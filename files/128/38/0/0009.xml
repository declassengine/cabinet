1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury (C. (63) 160), on public service pensions.The Minister of Defence said that the question at issue was whether the widows of officers of the Armed Services who had diedbefore 4th November, 1958 (the &quot; pre-Grigg&quot; widows), shouldreceive the same proportion of their husbands&apos; pensions as the widows of officers who had died after that date. Both the numbers concerned and the sums involved were small; and a concession on this narrowissue need not have embarrassing repercussions on pensionsgenerally.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it was impossible to concede that a distinction based on an arbitrary date was inequitablein relation to one class of pensioner without calling in question otherunpopular distinctions based on arbitrary dates. A demand was already being made for an increase in the pensions of officers, whichwere determined by the date of retirement. But there was no case on merits for selecting either the officers or the &quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows forfurther assistance; and it would be unwise to yield to pressure to givepreferential treatment to these particular groups.In discussion it was pointed out that, while the situation of the&quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows and of retired officers undoubtedly attractedsympathy, the gradual reduction of the purchasing power of pensioners&apos; incomes created a social problem which was not confined to these groups. It was arguable that eventually the principle of&quot;parity&quot; would have to be accepted. But this issue should beconsidered, if at all, in relation to the whole field of pensions; andto make piecemeal concessions to &quot; pre-Grigg &quot; widows, who hadalready been given substantial relief under the latest Pensions(Increase) Act and were known not to be among those in the greatest need, would expose the Government to severe criticism.In further discussion the balance of opinion endorsed this view.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no increase should be made in the pensions ofthe widows of officers who had died before 4th November,1958.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce the government&apos;s decision in the House of Commons early inthe following week.The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the earnings rule forwidowed mothers. They had before them memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (63) 13) and the Minister ofPensions (CP. (63) 15 and 26).The Minister of Pensions said that, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;searlier discussion, he had given further consideration to thedesirability of assisting widowed mothers by continuing the paymentof allowances under the national insurance scheme in respect ofchildren over the age of 18. At present a widowed mother who hadliving with her a child under 18 who was in full-time education or was an apprentice earning not more than 40s. a week received an allowance of 67s. 6d. for herself and 30s. for each child, which included the family allowance where it was payable. It would bepossible to extend above 18 the age up to which the children&apos;allowance would be payable; but this would involve extending up tothe same limit the children^ allowance paid to other national insurance beneficiaries, together with family allowances generally.The widowed mothefs own allowance would also have to be
;continued; and, since the child would be liable to be exposed toundesirable pressure if the payment of the allowance were madedependent on his remaining in full-time education, it would benecessary to fix the upper limit for both the children&apos;s allowance andthe mothets allowance in relation to an arbitrary age. This mightconveniently be 19, the age which normally marked the transition from school to university.The cost of a scheme on these lines would be about  2 million ayear, rising within 10 years to about  3-^ million. Legislation wouldbe required; and, since this would involve amendment of theNational Insurance Act, it would be impossible so to restrict its scopeas to avoid discussion of the earnings rule. A Private Membersuccessful in the ballot had announced his intention of introducing aBill to abolish the earnings rule; and, while an extension of the age limit for children&apos;s allowances might be presented as a commendableselective increase in benefits, it might not be sufficiently attractive toreduce pressure for this more radical measure.In discussion it was pointed out that, while an increase in theage limit for the payment of the children&apos;s allowances might be ofsome value, particularly in reducing the pressure on children to leaveschool at 18, public criticism was undoubtedly concentrated on the earnings rule and a demand for the abolition of the rule was likelyto be strongly pressed in the parliamentary debate on pensions andother social security benefits in the following week. Some means of helping widowed mothers generally, including those who wereprevented by family responsibilities from taking employment, wouldbe a more attractive alternative than raising the age for the paymentof children&apos;s allowances and would be more consistent both with theadvice of the National Insurance Advisory Committee and with theGovernments policy of selective benefits. The simplest means of helping the whole class of widowed mothers would undoubtedly beto make a substantial increase in the amount of the allowancespayable in respect of their children. This was open to the objection,however, that the allowances had only recently been increased andwere already larger than those paid in respect of the children of other national insurance beneficiaries.A possible solution might lie in a combination of measures,designed partly to reduce pressure for the abolition of the earnings rule for widowed mothers without opening the way to the abolitionof the rule in respect of other categories and partly to give additional assistance to mothers who were either not at work or earningrelatively little. Such a combination of measures might be achieved by raising the limit of free earnings from  6 to  8 or  9, raising from18 to 19 the age limit for the payment of children&apos;s allowances andraising by a reasonable amount (e.g., a further 5s.) the allowancepayable in respect of the children. If pressure for the complete abolition of the earnings rule were maintained in the face of theseproposals, it would be possible to demonstrate that this pressure wasbeing exerted on behalf of a minority of widows whose earnings were relatively high and whose need was therefore least; and theopposition to any modification of the earnings rule which might beexpected from the National Insurance Advisory Committee wouldbe helpful in resisting further concessions.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared that the most effective way of countering pressure for complete abolition of the earnings rule would be to make a series of concessions on the lines discussed. The details should be worked outby the Committee on Pensions and National Insurance in order thata final decision might be taken by the Cabinet before the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on pensions and social security benefits. It would be desirable on that occasion to give a reasonablydetailed indication of the Governments proposals.
Aden(previous reference:C.C. (62) 67thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that he would shortly have to initiate discussions with the Government of Adenabout the constitutional status of the Colony. It was already included within the dependent Protectorate of the Federation of South Arabia,which would continue Jo look to the United Kingdom for support and protection; and he had it in mind that its position should nowbe assimilated to that of the other States which were members of theFederation. In so far as this change would imply the termination of colonial rule in Aden, it could be presented as in some senseconferring on the Colony the status of independence within theFederation; and this should help the moderate party to retain power in the forthcoming elections. But it would also have the advantages that it would transfer to the Federation the embarrassingresponsibility for internal security in Aden, a responsibility whichthe authorities of the Federation would discharge with greaterseverity than we could afford to; and that, by further consolidatingthe union of Aden with the Federation, it might help to forestalldemands by the extremist party in Aden for genuine and complete independence outside the Federation. It would be for consideration whether, at some point, we should preserve our essential interests in aden by exercising our right to excise the military base areas fromthe territory to be transferred to the Federation and retaining theseunder our own sovereignty. For the moment, however, it wouldprobably suffice to make it clear that we retained this right and thatthe change in the status of Aden implied no weakening of our purpose to retain a military presence there indefinitely.In discussion it was suggested that there was no precedent forthe conversion of a Colony into a Protectorate and that furtherconsideration would need to be given both to the means by which such a change might be effected and to its possible implications. Itwould not necessarily be to our advantage to substitute a treatyrelationship for direct sovereignty, especially since the military baseareas were so intermingled with the rest of the habitable territorywithin the Colony that, if we were ever compelled to seek to giveeffect to our right to excise them, we might find it impracticable todo so. If, in these circumstances, the authorities of the Federationproved incapable of maintaining internal security in Aden and wewere compelled to intervene, we might find that we lacked both theconstitutional authority and the physical means to do so effectively;and we might be exposed to greater international criticism if our action had to take the form of external intervention rather than theassertion of direct sovereignty. Such a situation might be the more likely to arise in that our presence in Aden, in so far as it ensuredstability in the Persian Gulf, was probably regarded by the egyptian government as, on balance, to their own advantage. If, however, weappeared to surrender effective control over Aden and the egyptian government believed that, as a result, the Rulers in the Gulf mightbe attacked by Saudi Arabia, they might feel compelled to intervenethemselves; and in that event we should be ill-placed to deal withdisorders which might be provoked in Aden by the extremist partywith Egyptian encouragement.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theCommittee on Pensions and National Insurance toconsider, in greater detail, the proposed combination of measures indicated in their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion, in the light of the resultof the enquiry to be conducted under Conclusion (1), at a subsequent meeting.
Foreign AffairsMorocco(previous reference:CM. (63) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)East-west relations:Federal german republic(previous references:CC. (63) 58thConclusions,Minute 1, and cm. (63) 4thConclusions,Minute 3)France(previous reference:CC. (61) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary suggested that, since normal relationsappeared to have been restored between Morocco and Algeria, thetemporary embargo which we had imposed on the export of arms toMorocco could now be removed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the temporary embargo on the export of arms to Morocco should be withdrawn.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during his forthcoming visit to Bonn for discussions with the Federal GermanGovernment, he would be concerned to reaffirm the existing policyof the United Kingdom Government as regards both Berlin and theextension of commercial credit to the Soviet bloc. He would alsoascertain the reactions of the Federal German Government to thesuggestion that a non-aggression pact should be concluded, if possible,between the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and theStates members of the Warsaw Pact.In discussion it was suggested that any non-aggression pact of thiskind should, if possible, comprise Berlin and that, on this assumption,we should be particularly concerned to ensure that it would in no way diminish our unconditional right of access to the city.The Foreign Secretary said that there was some reason to suppose that President de Gaulle might intend to take advantage ofthe&apos; Press conference which he had arranged for January 1964 to announce some change either in the relationship between France andOn the other hand it was desirable to ensure, if possible, that the moderate party would be returned to power in the forthcomingelections and that any attempt by the extremist party to win support for the complete independence of Aden outside the Federation wouldbe resisted not merely by moderate sentiment in Aden itself but also by the loyalty of the whole Federation. Moreover, if the united nations sought to intervene in Aden, it would be possible to resistsuch intervention more effectively if Aden were only one member ofa Federation which, as a whole, was concerned that a British militarypresence should remain in the area.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that furtherconsideration should be given, initially by the Committee on defence and Oversea Policy, to the issues which the discussion had exposed.In particular, the constitutional implications of the proposed changein the status of Aden should be examined in greater detail; thepossibility of our retaining some degree of responsibility for internal security, even if the status of Aden were changed, should be explored;and it might be desirable, if only in order to avoid the legislation which might otherwise be necessary, to consider the alternative course of giving effect to the substance of the present proposal by anOrder in Council conferring full internal self-government on theColony.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate, for initialconsideration at an early meeting of the Committee on defence and Oversea Policy, a memorandum discussing, onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up,the implications of, and possible alternatives to, the proposal that the status of Aden should be assimilated to that ofother States which were members of the Federation ofSouth Arabia.
4. The Prime Minister said that he had discussed with the leader of the Opposition, Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P., the possibilityof instituting a review of the remuneration of Members of Parliament.They had provisionally agreed that it would be desirable in principlethat increases in the remuneration of Members of Parliament and ministers should be introduced as soon as possible after the next general Election and that the amount of the increases should bedecided, if possible, before the election took place, on the basis of advice to be obtained from some independent body, e.g., the national incomes Commission (N.I.C.). Mr. Wilson had suggested that the increases might also be announced before the election.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In principle a Parliament should itself determine the remuneration of its Members and of Ministers; and there would beobjection to referring this issue to an independent body if this implied that any analogy could properly be established between the remuneration of individuals carrying political responsibilities andthe pay of other professional classes. On the other hand it could be argued that, in the interests both of sustaining the Governmenfsincomes policy and of obtaining public support for any increasesfinally awarded, it would be desirable that the initial review shouldbe conducted by some independent authority.(b) It might be possible to reconcile these conflicting points ofview by inviting the Chairman of the National Incomes Commissionto conduct the enquiry, supported by selected Privy Councillors and only one or two members of the Commission.(c) If so, further consideration would need to be given to theterms of reference of the enquiry. The position of Members of theHouse of Lords and the higher judiciary would have to be takeninto account in this connection.(d) It would be preferable that the amounts of any increases tobe awarded should not be made known before the General Election.On the other hand time would be lost unnecessarily if the proposedenquiry did not begin until after the election. Ideally, therefore, theenquiry should start before the election but not report until its result was known.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to consider the terms inwhich the Chairman of the National Incomes commission might be invited to arrange for a review of the pay ofMembers of Parliament and Ministers.(2) Took note that special consideration would need to be given,in any such review, to the position of the higher judiciary.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Pay ofMembers ofParliamentand Ministers(previous reference:CM.

It would be necessary to keep a closewatch on developments in this connection.The Cabinet (2) Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.
Parliament 6.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th December, 1963.* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.SECRETIndustrialDisputesRailwaymen&apos;sWages*5. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that reports-whichhad not been denied had appeared in the national Press to the effectthat, in his current wage negotiations with the railway unions, theChairman of the British Transport Commission, Dr. Beeching, would offer a 5 per cent increase, in the hope of reaching a settlement at per cent. An increase of this order, coming so soon after the 6 percent increase which had been awarded to the railwaymen inNovember 1962, would be liable to have serious repercussions onthe Governments incomes policy. The present development was themore unwelcome in that it had appeared likely at an earlier stage that Dr. Beeching would obtain a settlement on the basis of anincrease of about 5 per cent, after a rather lower initial offer.Nevertheless, it would not be easy for the Government to oppose thesettlement which Dr. Beeching now appeared to have in mind. Underthe formula recommended by the Guillebaud Report of 1959 the railwaymen would be entitled to substantially more than 6 per cent.Moreover, Dr. Beeching had made it clear that the increase which he now proposed need not involve any increase in fares and could be financed from the yield of increased productivity on the railways.For both these reasons the Government might obtain little public support if, by refusing to countenance a settlement on the basis of a6 per cent increase, they took upon themselves the responsibility forprovoking a railway strike.In discussion there was general agreement that the Governmentwould not be justified in facing a railway strike on the grounds that dr. Beeching&apos;s offer was excessive, particularly in view of the improved operating results of the railways and the degree to whicha continued rise in efficiency could be held to depend upon goodlabour relations in the industry. But, if the award proved to be anincrease of 6 per cent, every effort should be made to reduce itsimpact on wage levels in other industries. The recent settlement inthe engineering industry, which had been widely represented as anincrease of 5-2 per cent, had in fact related to a period of more than12 months and had implied an annual increase of only 3-9 per cent.If the final award in the current negotiations on the pay of railwaymen related to a period of more than a year, a 6 per cent increase might be fairly represented, in terms of the governments incomes policy, as being the equivalent of a lower annual rate.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Labour,to consider the means by which it might be possible to relate the award of a 6 per cent increase in railwaymen&apos;s pay to a period longer than 12 months.
