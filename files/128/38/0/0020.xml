2. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in cyprus remained precarious and that there was a considerable riskof a renewal of communal fighting. It was therefore increasinglyurgent to find a political solution to the problem of the Island&apos;s future;but, although he was doing all he could, in his personal discussions with the representatives of the Greek and Turkish Cypriots, topromote a common understanding which might form the basis of formal negotiations, both parties were showing considerable reluctance to co-operate.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a critical situation might develop in East Africa in the light of the recent revolution in Zanzibarand the mutiny of certain military units in Tanganyika. Although theGovernment of Tanganyika appeared to have reasserted their authority, it was uncertain whether they could rely in future on the loyalty of the army. In addition there were indications that theGovernments of both Uganda and Kenya were apprehensive thatthey might shortly face similar disturbances, although the presenceof United Kingdom troops in Kenya should be a stabilising factor.There could be no question of our recognising, at least for thetime being, the new regime in Zanzibar, which was itself the victimof internal strife. But we had a moral obligation to the Sultan, whohad sought refuge in this country; and it would be necessary to give further consideration to the arrangements which would most appropriately be made for him and his retinue.In discussion there was general agreement that these developments afforded disquieting evidence of the extent to whichsubversive elements were seeking to establish a footing in commonwealth territories in East Africa. The implications,particularly as regards our future policy towards Southern Rhodesia,would need to be further examined; and it would also be necessaryto consider the situation which might arise if the Government of kenya invoked the assistance of our troops in the Territory in orderto deal with an insurrection.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Commonwealth Secretary.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the implications of the progressive subversion of Commonwealth territories in east Africa.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, to consider the instructions tobe given to United Kingdom forces in Kenya if theGovernment of Kenya invoked their assistance in dealingwith an insurrection.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Home Secretary and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, togive further consideration to the provision which wouldmost appropriately be made for the Sultan of Zanzibar.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.a 2
Indonesia(previous reference:CM. (64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) informed the Cabinet that, as a result of the discussions which the UnitedStates Attorney-General, Mr. Robert Kennedy, had recently held with various Governments in South-East Asia, it had been agreedthat a meeting of Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and the philippines should be held early in February in preparation for a subsequent meeting of the three Heads of Government, at whichthey would make a fresh attempt to resolve their differences. It wasnot clear whether, in endorsing this project, the Prime Minister of malaysia, Tunku Abdul Rahman, had waived any or all of thestipulations e.g., formal recognition of Malaysia by Indonesia which he had hitherto propounded as the conditions of his willingness to attend any tripartite conference. This aspect of the proposal,together with its other implications, would need to be further exploredwith Mr. Robert Kennedy during his forthcoming visit to London.In discussion there was general agreement that, although weshared with the United States Government the common purpose ofarresting the advance of Sino-Soviet influence in South-East Asia,there was some risk that the means by which the two Governmentssought to achieve this objective would diverge. The United StatesGovernment were chiefly concerned to dissuade Indonesia from making common cause with Communist China; we attached greater importance to maintaining the integrity of Malaysia. If, as a result,we judged it right to seek to restrain the Government of Malaysiafrom making any concessions of substance to Indonesia in theforthcoming discussions, we might appear to the United StatesGovernment to be deliberately thwarting their own policy; and, ifIndonesia succeeded by these means in promoting disunity betweenthe United States and ourselves, our position in South-East Asiawould be weakened. On the other hand it might be no less endangeredif we acquiesced in any settlement whereby the Government of malaysia undertook to arrange for the withdrawal of United kingdom forces from the Borneo Territories; for in that event those territories would eventually be overrun by Indonesia, the integrity of Malaysiawould be destroyed and our ability to maintain a military presence in South-East Asia for the protection of our interests and the dischargeof our commitments in the area would be gravely weakened. it followed that, while we must continue to seek a political solution ofthe differences between Malaysia and Indonesia if only because thealternative course of maintaining United Kingdom forces indefinitelyon the Borneo frontiers would ultimately be intolerable we mustbe on our guard against allowing the Government of Malaysia to paytoo high a price for it.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thelatest developments in South-East Asia to be discussed in greater detail with the United States Attorney-General.Mr. Robert Kennedy, during his forthcoming visit toLondon.Shop Hours 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Home(Previous        Secretary (CP. (64) 22) about shop closing hours.Reference:C.C. (60) 42nd The Home Secretary said that the Governments recent decisionConclusions, to terminate resale price maintenance had stimulated renewed interestMinute 4) in the question of shop closing hours. Although the Shops Bill, 1956,which had attempted to remedy the defects of the existing legislation,had had to be abandoned in the House of Commons, subsequentdiscussion had revealed growing support for complete repeal of therestrictions on week-day shop hours, any reform of Sunday closing hours being left to await the report of Lord Crathorne&apos;s Committeeon Sunday Observance. He therefore proposed to indicate, in reply
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 19) on government expenditure after 1968.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, even on the optimisticassumption that we should achieve a 4 per cent rate of growl h in the gross national product, public expenditure would be absorbing, by1968, over 41 per cent of the national income; and the momentumof the programmes to which the Government had already committed themselves would continue to entail a very high rate of expenditurein the following years. Those programmes represented the maximumdemand on resources which was compatible with prudence andfinancial probity; and any decisions to add new items should be matched by corresponding decisions to reduce existing programmesby an amount sufficient to offset the probable cost of the new items.In discussion the following main points were mads :(a) It was arguable that the Governments freedom of action should not be so strictly limited in relation to a period which still lay a good many years ahead. Apart from the inflexibility of such an approach it could be represented as unrealistic, inasmuch as it imputedto forecasts of the growth of public expenditure and of the national income a precision which they could not possess. Moreover, any announcement that it had been necessary to make adjustments in programmes already announced in order to accommodate, in several years time, projects which were economically sound in themselvesmight well be taken to imply that the Government had alreadyincreased public expenditure beyond the limits of good management.(b) On the other hand the recent White Paper on Expenditure(Cmnd. 2235) had clearly stated that existing programmes would absorball the resources likely to be available; and the Government would therefore be exposed to justifiable criticism if they now made majoradditions to those programmes without acknowledging the need toensure that the corresponding resources would be available at theappropriate point. This could not be achieved by merely withholdingor delaying approval for programmes of lower priority which hadnot yet been announced; the bulk of the expenditure to which, theGovernment were already committed in the years up to 1970 related to projects and programmes already published.(c) Projects which would bring into use under-employed sectors of the economy would increase the national income by raising thegeneral level of economic activity and would therefore impose a lighteradditional burden on the economy than projects which required theuse of resources already fully engaged. A decision to build the ChannelTunnel, for example, could provide employment for workers fromareas of high unemployment; and a decision to introduce theto forthcoming Parliamentary Questions, that he would now invitethe views of interested organisations, including representatives ofshopkeepers, trade unions, consumers and local authorities, aboutthe need, if any, for further legislation on the subject but that theGovernment had no intention of introducing fresh legislation duringthe lifetime of the present Parliament.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal,with the proviso that it would be preferable to avoid, if possible, any definite statement that there was no prospect of legislation in thepresent Parliament.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the point made in their discussion, theproposals in CP. (64) 22.a 3
decimalisation of the currency could absorb spare capacity in certainsectors of the machine tool industry. On the other hand the assumptions on which present forecasts of expenditure had been based included a 4 per cent rate of growth in the national income;and this, in turn, had assumed that under-employed productive resources would be brought fully into use.(d) In view of the high level which savings had already reached,the financing of additions to existing programmes might not be feasible without some increase in taxation. But, if confronted with adecision between increased taxation or the abandonment of projects of major social or economic importance, a substantial body of publicopinion might regard the former as the less objectionable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment could not easily acquiesce in a position in which their freedom to add new projects to their forward programmes would beconditioned by the need either to specify at the same time whichexisting projects would be eliminated or, alternatively, to foreshadowincreases in taxation. This would imply that the capacity of the economy could be measured more precisely than was in fact the case and that all other relevant circumstances would remain unchanged,assumptions which were at variance with experience. Nevertheless,it would be equally undesirable to create the impression that theGovernment were prepared to add new projects to their existing programmes without regard to their probable consequences. But, if new projects were justifiable on social and economic grounds, it should be permissible for the Government to endorse them in principle, on thebasis that, when the expenditure which they entailed reached,significant proportions, the necessary steps would be taken to keeppublic expenditure as a whole within acceptable limits.The Cabinet Agreed that their approval of new projects involvingsignificant additions to existing programmes of expenditure should be conditioned by the considerations indicated bythe Prime Minister in his summing up.School leaving age(previous reference:CM. (64) 5thConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal thatthe school leaving age should be raised to 16. They had before thema memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and theMinister of Education (CP. (64) 21) on the financial implications of a decision to raise the age in the years 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972respectively.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that a decision to raise theschool leaving age would increase current educational expenditure by an amount ranging from  31-5 million to  65 million, accordingto the extent to which it proved possible to recruit the necessaryadditional teachers. Non-educational costs would amount to  30- 35million a year. The capital expenditure necessary for the provisionof additional school buildings would amount to a total of about 150 million. The Minister of Education took the view that if, butonly if, the leaving age were raised, it would be defensible to accommodate part of the additional capital cost by making asubstantial reduction in the programme of improvement of existingschool buildings. But, if it was possible to forgo these improvementsat all, it ought not to be assumed that they would in any event havebeen included in the building programme at a time when the pressure on resources would be very heavy; and they should not, therefore,be offset against the cost of raising the leaving age. The capitalexpenditure would be phased over three years, beginning two years before the age was raised. If savings on improvements were offsetagainst the cost, the additional expenditure in the three years would
ChannelTunnel(previous reference:C.C. (63) 47thConclusions,Minute 11)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 20), summarising thearguments for and against United Kingdom participation in a Channeltunnel.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the long-term economic arguments in favour of the project were strong. From about1977 onwards the cumulative cost of the existing sea and air links between the United Kingdom and the Continent would show anCM. 6 (64)be  8 million,  19 million and  37 million respectively. If the full costwere reckoned, it would be  19 million,  44 million and  87 million.If the age were raised in 1970, this additional expenditure would accrue at a time when expenditure on programmes to which theGovernment were already committed would be rising rapidly; andit would be impossible to accommodate it unless reductions weremade in other proposals. But, in view of the difficulty of making anyreductions which would be effective before 1972, the financialobjections to raising the leaving age would be aggravated by the choice of any earlier date.The Minister of Education said that the Government would beexpected to announce their policy on the school leaving age in thecourse of the forthcoming debate on education; and, if they were unable to specify a definite date by which the age would be raised,they would be exposed to criticism on the ground that they were showing insufficient concern for the education of the majority of thecountry&apos;s children. It would be possible to defend on educationalgrounds a decision to raise the age in 1971, which would ensure thatthe greater part of the capital expenditure would fall after the years in which expenditure on the Channel Tunnel project, should theCabinet approve it, might be expected to be heaviest. Moreover, adecision to raise the age in 1971 would not necessarily represent anirrevocable commitment, since final decisions on the provision ofadditional buildings need not be taken until 1967 and, if it appearedby then that either the capital resources or the teachers necessary to implement the decision were unlikely to be available, the change couldbe deferred. The position would be further eased if, by the end of the decade, a decision had been taken to raise the age of entry to compulsory schooling, a course which many educationalists wouldadvocate if the leaving age were raised.In discussion there was general agreement that it was desirable in principle that the school leaving age should be raised to 16 and that,provided that countervailing economies were secured in theprogramme of improvements in school buildings, planning should proceed on the basis that the age would be raised in 1971. If thedecision were made explicitly contingent on the availability of anadequate supply of teachers, the Government might be exposed to pressure for a more rapid expansion of the teacher training colleges;but it should be possible to indicate that a raising of the age in 1971,while not constituting a firm commitment, represented the government&apos;s deliberate aim.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Education to announce, in theforthcoming debate on education, that the government intended that the school leaving age should be raised to 16in the academic year 1970-71 and would plan on this basis.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to concert with the chief secretary, Treasury, the precise terms in which thisdecision should be announced.
increasing excess over the comparable cost of a tunnel. Moreover, thetransport costs of exports to Europe would be reduced by some 10 percent if the tunnel were available. On the other hand the capitalexpenditure entailed, amounting to about  80 million if the totalcost were shared equally with French interests, would constitute a significant additional commitment, which would accrue in a period when the Governments existing programmes would be making avery heavy demand on our resources.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) On political grounds a decision was required urgently. Anannouncement by the French Government that they would beprepared to build their half of the tunnel but that we had refused toco-operate with them in completing the project would expose us tothe charge that, once again, we were demonstrating that we were nottruly European at heart. An announcement by the French Governmentthat, if we were not prepared to contribute to the undertaking, theywould be prepared to finance and build the whole tunnel themselves would be even more embarrassing.(b) If we sought to maintain that the addition of  80 million,over a period of years, to programmes of expenditure amounting tomany thousands of millions of pounds would endanger the economy,we should do more damage, by displaying a lack of confidence in our prospects for continued economic growth, than if we accepted theadditional commitment without more ado.(c) On the other hand, the same argument could be applied toany additional project considered in isolation; it was the accumulation of a number of such projects which would expose the economy to therisk of excessive strain. It would be irresponsible to undertake toparticipate in the construction of the tunnel unless we stated at thesame time that, if it proved impossible, at the appropriate time, to accommodate the project without excessive demand on our resources,commensurate economies would have to be made elsewhere in orderto allow work on the tunnel to proceed.(d) It would be unwise to assume that a project of this magnitudecould be financed by private capital. In particular, it would beobjectionable to allow a private company the freedom to vary charges for the use of the tunnel which would be necessary to attract equity capital. Nevertheless, the possibilities of private financing might meritfurther examination in consultation with the French Government.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofTransport to give further consideration, in the light oftheir discussion, to the terms in which the governments attitude towards the Channel tunnel project might most appropriately be announced in the near future.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Minister of Defence (CP. (64) 17) about theMemorandum of Understanding under negotiation with the UnitedStates Government on claims and indemnity for accidents resultingfrom the stationing of nuclear vessels in the Holy Loch.The Minister of Defence said that negotiations with the UnitedStates Administration on these issues had raised difficult questions about both the principle by reference to which liability should be assessed and the basis on which claims should be met. A formulaagreed in 1962 had provided for claims to be settled under the termsof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Status of ForcesAgreement in accordance with the principle of sole and absolute

The United States authorities,however, had now withdrawn their agreement to this formula, on theground that it would have become a precedent for dealing withincidents arising from the presence of nuclear-powered warshipsanywhere in the world. They proposed, as an alternative, thatclaims should be settled not under the Status of Forces Agreementbut through diplomatic channels, in accordance with customaryprocedures for the settlement of international claims under generally accepted principles of law and equity. Acceptance of this revisedformula would not be consonant with assurances already given toParliament that claims would be dealt with under the Status of ForcesAgreement and in accordance with the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator; nor would it be consistent with the legislation which the Government proposed to introduce to extend the applicationof this principle in our domestic law from land-based reactors tonuclear-powered ships. Moreover, it would not give claimants anunambiguous right to restitution. We were not in a strong positionto negotiate better terms; but it might be possible to reach a compromise on the basis of a formula which retained at least somefeatures of the earlier agreement, particularly the explicit recognition that the NATO Status of Forces Agreement should apply to thesettlement of claims.In discussion it was agreed that further consideration should begiven to the basis on which we should seek to reach agreement withthe United States Government on this matter.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the Lord Chancellor, the Secretary ofState for Scotland, the Attorney-General and other ministers concerned, to give further consideration to theterms on which an agreement should be sought with theUnited States Government about the claims and indemnityprovisions to be incorporated in the Memorandum of understanding governing the administrative and financial arrangements for United States Polaris submarines in the holy Loch.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
