DiplomaticServiceAllowance(previous reference:CM. (64) 10thConclusions,Minute 9)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (64) 49) about the payment of the Diplomatic ServiceAllowance to seconded officers serving with Missions overseas.The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said that further discussion between the Ministers concerned had not resolvedthe difference of opinion on this issue. The Foreign Secretary remainedfirmly of the view that the Diplomatic Service Allowance, which was intended to compensate members of the Diplomatic Service for havingaccepted the obligations of a nomadic career, should not be payable to seconded officers, who were sent to only a limited number of posts abroad and spent only a relatively small proportion of theircareers overseas. In view of the improvements to be made in theother allowances which seconded officers would receive, the difference in terms of total emoluments between a career officer and a secondedofficer would not normally be significant. For example, the differencebetween the amount received by a First Secretary in the diplomatic service and a seconded officer at this level would be only about 150 a year; and it would be inadvisable to jeopardise, for so smalla distinction, the welcome which public opinion would otherwiseaccord to the proposals in the Report of the Committee onRepresentational Services Overseas.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the diplomatic service would not be large enough to meet from its own ranks all thedemands that would be imposed on it during the years ahead; andit would be particularly important that it should be reinforced by officers seconded from the Board of Trade in order that our commercial interests overseas should be prosecuted as vigorously aspossible. Moreover, it was wrong in principle that the diplomatic service should become exclusive and that artificial barriers should beput in the way of the free movement of personnel between service at home and service overseas. The proposals at issue involved a more substantial difference than might be supposed between the amountsreceived by senior officers serving in the same post abroad accordingto whether they were career members of the Diplomatic Service orseconded officers. At the level of Under-Secretary this differencemight amount to over  700 a year. It was difficult to justify a distinction of this order when many of the considerations which werealleged to justify the payment of the Diplomatic Service allowance to members of the Diplomatic Service were in fact equally applicableto seconded officers serving overseas.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was indefensible in principle to differentiate, in terms of remuneration, between two officers carrying broadly the same measureof responsibility in a post abroad. This would lead to considerabledissatisfaction.(b) If the differential were maintained, officers would be reluctant to volunteer for secondment overseas; and industry would be criticalif, for this reason, our commercial representation abroad was inadequate.(c) If the Diplomatic Service Allowance were paid to officersseconded from the Board of Trade, it would also have to be paid toofficers seconded to oversea Missions from other Departments; andpressure might develop to extend it to all officers posted abroad.But, if it were not paid to officers seconded from the Board of Trade,it could fairly be confined to members of the Diplomatic Service.id) There was a clear distinction between officers who spent theircareers overseas and those who merely volunteered for secondmentfor shorter periods.
SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CM. (64) 10thConclusions,Minute 3)*2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia had recently informed us thatthe Speech from the Throne at the opening of the Legislature in salisbury that day would include a statement that they did not recognise the right of anyone to interfere in the affairs of SouthernRhodesia, that they would not tolerate any such interference andthat they would thereafter pursue their own course within the framework of the Constitution of Southern Rhodesia and would actin all respects as a Government in allegiance to the person of her majesty The Queen. This statement might well have been regarded by public opinion as tantamount to a unilateral declaration of independence; and we had therefore sought to persuade the PrimeMinister of the Colony, Mr. Winston Field, to arrange for it to be omitted from the Speech from the Throne. He had accepted this advice on the understanding that he would himself make a statement to this effect in his own speech during the Debate on the Address.In these circumstances the issue of independence for SouthernRhodesia might come to a head in the near future.This issue confronted us with a grave dilemma. We ourselvesdoubted whether it would be in the ultimate interests of SouthernRhodesia to accelerate a process of constitutional development which,if allowed to take its normal course, might be expected to result inAfricans securing a majority in the Legislature within about 15 years.On the other hand it would be contrary to all our previous practice to concede independence to a Colony otherwise than on the basisof majority rule; and, if we did so, we should alienate, perhaps beyondrecall, the sympathy of most of the other members of theCommonwealth. We must therefore seek to devise some compromise which might accelerate the pace of constitutional advance in SouthernRhodesia but, at the same time, keep the situation under political control. For example, we might offer the Government of the Colonyadditional financial assistance, on the understanding that this wouldbe devoted to improvements in African secondary education whichshould hasten the day when a larger number of Africans would be eligible to vote on the &quot; A &quot; roll. We must also endeavour to allaypublic anxiety that the Government of Southern Rhodesia, onattaining independence, would set aside the Constitution, to the disadvantage of the African members of the population; and forthis purpose we might be able to arrange that the Government of the* Previously recorded in a Confidential AnnexSECRETThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, eventhough the differentiation between career and seconded officers was probably valid, the disparity in total emoluments between the two groups should not be too large. The difficulty might be overcome ifthe allowances payable to seconded officers, excluding the diplomatic service Allowance, were so adjusted as to reduce the differentiationto a more tolerable level. This possibility should be examined.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the Diplomatic Service allowance should be paid only to members of the Diplomatic Service.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for industry, to examine, in the light of the discussion, thepossibility of so adjusting the allowances payable toseconded officers serving overseas, excluding the diplomatic Service Allowance, as to reduce the disparity between their emoluments and those of members of the diplomatic Service.
Colony would pledge themselves to accept the ruling of the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council on any change in the constitution which they might propose after independence, on the understandingthat the United Kingdom Parliament, although withdrawing even further than at present from intervention in the affairs of the Colony,would retain the power to legislate in the last resort if the Governmentof Southern Rhodesia endeavoured to proceed with some change inthe Constitution against the decision of the Judicial Committee.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had represented veryforcibly to Mr. Winston Field the constitutional objections to anyunilateral declaration of independence and the dangers to which theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia would expose themselves if,despite our warning, they made any declaration of this kind. At our suggestion the Governments of Canada, Australia and New zealand had also sent messages to Mr. Field, endorsing our attitude andemphasising that, if his Government embarked on a course of actionwhich the rest of the Commonwealth could not approve, they could have no hope of retaining, as they wished, the link between SouthernRhodesia and the Crown. In addition certain of the government&apos;s supporters in the House of Commons had agreed to visit SouthernRhodesia in order to make the Governments attitude known ininfluential circles in the Colony. These steps might yet suffice to restrain Mr. Field&apos;s Government from precipitate action. Nevertheless,local pressures might compel Mr. Field to make some gesture of independence; and in that event we must concentrate our efforts onpersuading him to do so in the manner which would be least offensive to constitutional propriety. If he agreed to make any declaration of independence outside the Legislature, we might be able to ignore it,at least for a time. Even if he introduced a Resolution in theLegislature, we need not regard him as having committed hisGovernment irretrievably. But, if he introduced legislation in anattempt to establish the Colony&apos;s independence, the Governor wouldbe required to signify the Royal Assent to the Bill; and any actionof this kind would constitute a direct challenge to the Crown in the parliament at Westminster. The Governor was appointed by theCrown on the advice of the United Kingdom Government and heldoffice at pleasure; and, in the circumstances in question, it would benecessary to consider whether the Crown should be advised to requirehim to demit his office. This situation would raise such graveconstitutional issues that we must seek, by all the means at our disposal, to reach some compromise settlement. Mr. Field&apos;s latest proposals for enlargement of the African franchise offered little prospect of a solution of this kind; but we must continue to work for agreement on some timetable of constitutional advance which would include both a fixed date for the attainment of an African majority in the Legislature and a fixed date for the independence of the Colony.The Lord Chancellor doubted whether it would be possible to defer action against the Government of Southern Rhodesia for aslong as the Commonwealth Secretary suggested. The Government ofthe Colony, no less than its Governor, held office at pleasure; and,if Ministers in Salisbury embarked on any unconstitutional courseof action, it would be for consideration whether they should be dismissed by the Crown, acting either on the advice of the UnitedKingdom Government, or, more doubtfully, in the person of theGovernor. If they purported to defy such dismissal and to remainin office, they could no longer claim that they were maintaining their loyalty to The Queen; and, from a constitutional point of view, theywould be in revolt against the Crown. The Governor would be boundto invite the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Edgar Whitehead, toattempt to form a Government; the latter would undoubtedly seek a dissolution; and during the interval of four months between the dissolution and a general election more moderate counsels might
prevail. Even if Mr. Field&apos;s Party won the election, we should bebetter placed than at present to acquiesce in the ColonySindependence, since we should be able to claim that we had taken allpossible action, short of force, to keep the Constitution in being andthat the election itself had given the population of the Colony ample opportunity to reflect on the issues involved before committing themselves to a policy of unilateral independence.In discussion it was suggested that it would be to our advantage to avoid bringing the issue to a head for as long as possible. SouthernRhodesia was advancing relatively rapidly in the direction of a non-racial community; and we should avoid any action which might be interpreted as implying that we regarded the policies of the Colony&apos;sGovernment as differing little from those of the Government of SouthAfrica. We should therefore hesitate to take such radical action asthe dismissal of the members of the Government a step for whichthere was only doubtful precedent; and we should be prepared toendure a considerable degree of provocative action on the part ofthe Government of Southern Rhodesia before ourselves taking actionwhich we should be unable to reverse. It was difficult for theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia to accept that they, alone of allthe Commonwealth countries in Africa, had no hope of achievingindependence for another 15 years; and we must therefore seek to devise some special form of relationship between the Colony andthe other members of the Commonwealth which, while denying itformal independence for the time being, would nevertheless do justice to its unique status and would demonstrate our determination to accelerate its constitutional advance to final independence as rapidly as possible. We must also seek to restrain the Government of northern rhodesia from any intemperate reaction to statements in SouthernRhodesia which might be thought to constitute a unilateral declarationof independence; and we must do all that we could to maintain theeconomic links between Northern and Southern Rhodesia whichhad been established when the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasalandwas dissolved.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the constitutional issues whichmight shortly arise in relation to Southern Rhodesia.Rail and 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theRoad Transport Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, as Chairman of the Rail and(previous reference:CM. (64) 5thConclusions,Minute 4)R.oad Transport Committee (CP. (64) 50), about the problems arisingfrom the British Railway Board&apos;s programme for rail closures.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the committeehad given further consideration to three issues the position ofholiday resorts; the procedure for the announcement of decisions on individual cases of closure; and the deferment of publication of certain proposals. As regards the first, the Minister of Transport had nowannounced that closure proposals affecting holiday resorts which hadnot yet been published would not take effect, even if approved, until after the 1st October. On the second issue, of the total of 330 closureproposals listed in Appendix 2 to &quot; Re-shaping British Railways &quot;,177 had been published and 73 had now reached the stage ofsubmission to the Minister of Transport for final decision. TheMinister&apos;s decision had already been announced in 16 cases; andfurther decisions had been taken but not yet announced. these included some refusals and some conditional approvals. Since theyconstituted a representative selection of decisions, it was proposedthat they should be announced at a Press conference, which wouldprovide an appropriate opportunity to give greater publicity to theprocedure for considering proposals and the conditions which might
The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of CP. (64) 50.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to submit to the PrimeMinister the draft of an announcement of theGovernments policy as regards the provision of rural bus services.Polaris *4.   The Prime Minister said that recent developments made itSubmarines desirable to reconsider the earlier decision that the United Kingdomfleet of Polaris submarines should be confined to four vessels. If the&quot; freeze&quot; of nuclear delivery vehicles which the United StatesGovernment had proposed were implemented, the Soviet Government,although permanently inferior to the Western Alliance as a whole interms of nuclear capability, would enjoy permanent superiority overthe European nations alone; and in these circumstances it would beeven more essential that we should be seen to retain an independentcapacity to inflict an unacceptable degree of nuclear damage upon an enemy. If we could deploy only four Polaris submarines in all, weshould run the risk that, during certain periods when only onesubmarine would be on patrol, an accident might put it out of action;and, if the credibility of the United Kingdom deterrent was to bemaintained, it might be wise to anticipate this risk by ordering a fifthsubmarine. It might also be significant that the French Governmenthad apparently decided that their seaborne deterrent should consistof not less than five submarines. On the other hand the financial implications of enlarging the Polaris programme were formidable;and a fifth submarine would impose an additional burden on thedefence budget which would have to be offset by economies in other categories of military expenditure.The Minister of Defence said that the United States authorities had recently established that the period for refitting a Polarissubmarine would be longer than they had originally expected; andtheir experience in this respect had caused the Chiefs of Staff to conclude that a fifth submarine was necessary if our deterrent was toremain credible. It should be possible to offset the cost by certaineconomies in the forward programmes for other weapons; and adecision should be reached as a matter of urgency, since UnitedStates production of the weapons system for the Polaris submarinewould shortly cease and, if we were to construct a fifth submarine,the additional weapons system must be ordered forthwith.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a fifth Polarissubmarine would constitute an addition to expenditure in the late1960s which would be particularly unwelcome, since it would coincide with other heavy demands on our resources at that juncture.* Previously recorded in a Confidential AnnexSECRETbe prescribed to avoid resultant hardship. As regards the third issue,the Chairman of the Railways Board had now agreed to the postponement of the publication of eight of the nine proposalsindicated in paragraph 9 of CP. (64) 16. Arrangements for publication in respect of the Manchester-Glossop line had proceeded too far tobe reversed.In discussion it was suggested that it would be desirable to announce, if possible simultaneously with the projected press conference, the Governments proposals as regards the provision of rural bus services. The Minister of Transport said that he hoped thatthese would be disclosed in answer to Questions in both Houses ofParliament in the near future.
Moreover, certain of the measures which were apparentlycontemplated as compensating economies would themselves involvebringing forward to the same date expenditure which otherwise mightnot have arisen until the 1970s. There were very considerable financialobjections, therefore, to incurring an additional commitment which,in terms of strategic requirement, had been proposed at a very latestage in the formulation of the programme of new weaponsconstruction which was to be announced in the Parliamentary debate on defence that week.In discussion there was general agreement that it would bedesirable on operational grounds to order a fifth Polaris submarine,provided that adequate offsetting economies could be securedelsewhere in the forward defence programme.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider, as a matter of urgency, the means by which economies might be secured in the forward defence programme on a scale sufficientto offset the cost of ordering a fifth Polaris submarine.(2) Agreed in principle that, subject to a satisfactory outcome ofthe enquiry to be undertaken under Conclusion (1) above,a fifth Polaris submarine should be ordered.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25 th February, 1964
