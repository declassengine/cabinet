ForeignAffairsFederalGermanRepublic(previous reference:CM. (63) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that during his recent visit to Bonn and Berlin he had ascertained that the federal german Government would probably be prepared to support a renewed initiative by the United Kingdom Government to reduceEast-West tension. But they would prefer such an initiative to bedirected towards achieving agreement on the establishment ofobservation posts as a safeguard against surprise attack; and they remained opposed to any attempt to conclude a non-aggression pactbetween the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) and theStates members of the Warsaw Pact, on the ground that it would tend formally to perpetuate the division of Germany.The Federal Government appreciated our reasons for supportingMalaysia against Indonesia; they had not exported, and would notexport, arms to the Indonesian Government.Economic relations between the Federal Government and theFrench Government continued to be strained, particularly in the context of agricultural policy.In discussion it was suggested that, if the French Governmentfailed to reach agreement with the Federal Government on agricultural policy, they might withdraw from the european economic Community (e.c.). We should be prepared, in that event,to try to devise some means of associating the other five members ofthe Community with ourselves and our partners in the European free trade Association. We should also be ready to consider the implications for ourselves if the French Government, instead of withdrawing from the E.E.C., sought to prevent further participationby the Community in the negotiations on the Kennedy Round in theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.NorthAtlanticCouncil:ministerial meeting inParis(previous reference:CC. (62) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to arrange for early examination ofthe action which might need to be taken if the FrenchGovernment failed to reach agreement with the othermembers of the European Economic Community on theCommunity&apos;s future economic policy.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during his forthcoming visit to Paris to attend the Ministerial Council of NATO,he proposed to discuss with the French Government recent developments in South-East Asia. It would be necessary to consider,in consultation with the United States Government, whether it wouldbe in our interest to support the projected international conferenceon the precarious situation which was developing in Cambodia.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.CM. 12 (63)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. Parliament would adjournfor the Christmas Recess on 20th December and would reassembleon 14th January.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor, the Home Secretary and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP. (63) 29) on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act,1921.The Lord Chancellor said that, in accordance with the decisionof the Cabinet at their meeting on 14th November, a debate hadbeen arranged in the House of Lords in order to ascertain whether there was any demand for an independent inquiry into the operationof the Act. Although every speaker had expressed dislike of someaspect of the procedures which its use entailed, there had been generalagreement on the need to retain this means of investigation and the debate had suggested that there was no current pressure for anyradical amendment or review of the Act. The most important of theproposals put forward for improving the procedures involved related to the payment of the costs of individuals appearing before a tribunal.He had therefore reminded the House of the arrangements madefor the ex gratia payment from public funds of the costs of individuals who had been allowed to be legally represented before the tribunal of Inquiry into matters arising out of the Vassall case. It should besufficient for Government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate inthe House of Commons on the Report of Lord Denning&apos;s Inquiry toindicate that, while there was no case for an inquiry into the Act,the Government would consider any proposals put forward forprocedural improvements.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.There might be advantage, however, in indicating that theGovernment were prepared to pursue, in consultation with the leader of the Opposition, the proposal advanced earlier in the year by thePrime Minister of the day, Mr. Harold Macmillan, M.P., for theappointment of a standing Security Commission to investigate casesinvolving national security which it might be convenient to examineby a less elaborate procedure than the Act required. If so, the termsof reference of this body would need to be further considered. Asregards the costs of persons who appeared before tribunals appointed under the Act, it was arguable that the Government should pay infull reasonable costs incurred by persons permitted by the tribunal to be legally represented on the ground that their conduct wasimpugned or that their reputations were endangered; and theGovernments spokesmen in the forthcoming debate should be in aposition to make a clear statement of policy in this respect.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Secretaryof State for Scotland, to prepare a statement on the costs of persons permitted to be legally represented beforetribunals appointed under the Tribunals of Inquiry(Evidence) Act, 1921, for the use of government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate on the Report ofLord Denning&apos;s Inquiry.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the composition and terms of reference of the proposed Security Commission.4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the desirability ofenlisting independent advice on the pay of Members of parliament and Ministers, on the assumption that the amount of any increase should preferably not be made publicly known until after the GeneralElection but that both the Government and the Opposition would commit themselves in principle to take the necessary action at the outset of the new Parliament.
n o&amp; a white paper on public expenditure(previous reference:C.C. (63) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (63) 32), to which was appendeda draft White Paper on Public Expenditure in 1963-64 and 1967-68.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during the debate on the Address he had announced estimates of public expenditure in1967-68 on the basis of the Governments present policies. As a result the Government had been challenged to publish a White Paper giving a more comprehensive picture of the growth of public expenditure.It would be advantageous to accept this challenge by publishing a white Paper of this kind before Christmas. The draft annexed tohis memorandum had been approved by the Economic PolicyCommittee; and, subject to further consideration of points of detail,it was proposed to publish it on 19th December.CM. 12 (63)In discussion it was suggested that advice might be sought either from the National Incomes Commission (N.I.C.) or from an ad hocbody, which might consist of the chairman and a few members ofN.I.C., reinforced by Privy Councillors or back-bench Members ofthe House of Commons. In favour of the former course it was represented that it would be preferable to remit the issue to a body which did not include any individual having a personal interest inthe outcome of the inquiry. Moreover, Parliament, having approved the establishment of N.I.C. as an impartial source of advice on wage claims advanced by other sections of the community, should be willingto submit to the Commission the question of the proper remuneration of its own Members. On the other hand a considerable body ofopinion held that Parliament should be prepared to decide on its own responsibility an issue which was of peculiar concern to its Members the more so since the nature of Parliamentary duties was unique and members of Parliament might have insufficient confidence in opinions expressed by a body none of whose members had practical experienceof political life. For these reasons it might be preferable that thequestion should be remitted to an ad hoc body, which might comprisea few members of N.I.C. but should also include individuals withpersonal experience of service both in Parliament and in industryand the professions. In any event it would be necessary to ensureadequate representation of the interests of the House of Lords.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebest method of obtaining independent but informed advice on the issues involved might be to remit those issues to a small body,consisting of the Chairman of N.I.C., supported by two membersof the Commission and, possibly, a third individual selected by virtueof special knowledge of Parliamentary and constitutional questions,on the understanding that this body would look for detailed information on the responsibilities of political life to an advisorypanel of Members of Parliament and Peers, which would need to be specially constituted for this purpose. He would discuss this proposalfurther with the Leader of the Opposition and, if agreement were reached, would endeavour to make an appropriate announcement inParliament before the Christmas Recess.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with the leader of the Opposition the desirability of arranging a review of the pay of Members of Parliament and ministers on the lines indicated in his summing up of their discussion.
In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.The following points were made:(a) In the table on page 5, comparing public expenditure in1963-64 and 1967-68, the decrease in expenditure on the itemdescribed as &quot; Assistance to agriculture, industry and transport&quot;might be misunderstood to imply that assistance to agriculture was expected to decline, whereas the reduction was in fact attributable to the decrease in the subsidy to be paid to the railways as a resultof the progressive reduction of the British Railways Board&apos;s deficit.This misunderstanding might be avoided if the order of the words inthe description of the item were reversed.(b) Expenditure on overseas aid would be liable to appear smallin comparison with other items; and the fact that the estimated increase was considerable in proportion to the total might usefully be emphasised if it were expressed in percentage terms either in anadditional column to the table or in the explanatory text.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion and inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to the draftof the White Paper on Public Expenditure in 1963-64and 1967-68.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal, to arrange for the White Paper,amended as necessary in the light of Conclusion (1) above,to be published before the Christmas Recess.Future 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterAgricultural Qf Agriculture (CP. (63) 31) on the development of the GovernmentsPo,icv agricultural policy.(previous reference- ^e Minister of Agriculture said that on 16th May the cabinet.C. (63) 32nd had authorised him to discuss with the farmers&apos; representatives and conclusions, with oversea suppliers certain proposed changes in the supportMinute 7) system for agriculture, of which the most important were theimposition of standard quantities, under flexible guarantee arrangements, for home production and the negotiation of voluntaryagreements with our main oversea suppliers for the limitation ofimports.The initial reaction of the farmers&apos; representatives had been to seek assurances about the maintenance of farming incomes and aboutopportunities for further growth. In contrast to the industrial sector,where incomes and productivity had moved broadly in line, farmershad increased their productivity without receiving any comparablebenefit in terms of incomes. Opportunities for increasing farmingincomes would be still further restricted if, under the new arrangements, there were to be a fixed ratio between home and overseas supplies of any given commodity, whereas the farmersconsidered that they were entitled gradually to increase their shareof a rising domestic demand. He had therefore prepared, inconsultation with representatives of the industry but without commitment so far as the Government were concerned, a draft statement of objectives (in the form appended to CP. (63) 31), whichmight form part of the Annual Review White Paper in March 1964,and could be used, in the interim, as the basis of the further discussions with oversea suppliers which would now be needed in relation to both cereals and meat.Negotiations on cereals had reached a stage at which agreementseemed possible, the situation being simplified by the fact that our main cereal imports maize and hard wheat were not of a kind
which could be produced at home. The only serious problem, so faras the home producers were concerned, was the level of the standard quantity. The farmers had asked for 10 million tons, which wouldprovide adequate scope for increased production in the coming year.Treasury Ministers, however, had suggested a lower figure of 8 million tons; and it had been established that oversea supplierswould be unlikely to agree voluntarily to restrict their imports if thestandard quantity of home production were set at a higher figurethan 9% million tons. In order to prevent imports at unrealistic pricesit was also proposed to establish a minimum import price. Therewere grounds for hoping that our main oversea suppliers would accept these proposals in principle. If so, it would be necessary to settle the detailed arrangements quickly if final agreement were to bereached before the Farm Price Review in February 1964.The position as regards meat gave rise to greater concern. for reasons connected with the nature of the trade control of the marketcould not be secured by the establishment of a minimum import pricebut would have to be effected by means of quantitative restriction.It would be difficult, if not impossible, to secure the agreement ofthe domestic producers to a standard quantity for meat, at least in1964; and the opposition would be particularly strong in Scotland.The farmers considered that an attempt at this stage to restrict home production was not justified by any prospective surplus in world production and would unreasonably deprive the industry of prospects of further growth. So long as home production remained uncontrolled,however, it would be impossible to obtain the agreement of overseasuppliers to limit their own imports; and this situation was furthercomplicated by the fact that, as a result of the withdrawal of medicalrestrictions, imports of meat from certain European countries were now to be expected. In these circumstances three possible courses of action were open to the Government. The first would be to impose a standard quantity on home production without the agreement ofthe farming industry. This would make it possible to secure a voluntary restriction of imports, would safeguard our other overseastrading interests and would effectively limit the cost of exchequer support. But it would have serious political repercussions.Alternatively, no limit could be placed on home production and thelevel of imports could be controlled by quotas. This course, however,would be liable to do serious damage to our international trade.Thirdly, it might be possible, although not easy, to go as far in thedirection of limiting home production as the farmers wouldvoluntarily accept and then to invite oversea suppliers to co-operate in the phasing of their supplies to the United Kingdom market. But,if these voluntary arrangements broke down, the Exchequer wouldbe at considerable risk. Much would depend on the extent to whichthere was a surplus of world meat production in the following year;it was already known that home production was not likely to increase by more than about 2 per cent and that this would do no more thankeep pace with the increasing demand.In discussion the following points were made:(a) A policy which could be represented as increasing protection for the home producer and reducing opportunities for the overseasupplier would be liable to place at risk the growth of the industrialexports on which the United Kingdom economy depended. On theother hand it would be socially and economically difficult to defend the deliberate restraint of domestic agriculture. A balance wouldhave to be struck between these conflicting considerations; and thiswould need to be reflected in any public statement of the government&apos;s policy.(b) The home producer could not be guaranteed a larger shareof the market, or encouraged to expect such an increase at each
7. The Minister of Labour said that he expected to receiveduring the day an interim report from the Committee of Inquiry underthe chairmanship of Professor Phelps-Brown which was consideringthe pay and conditions of employment of bus crews employed by theLondon Passenger Transport Board. The report, which would bepublished on 16th December, was likely to recommend increases in pay based on the proposals put before the committee by the Board.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th December, 1963.IndustrialDisputesLondon BusCrews(previous reference:CM. (63) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)successive review, without damaging our relations with overseasuppliers. On the other hand it would be unacceptable to restrict thehome producer to a fixed and unalterable percentage of the marketor to deny him the opportunity to compete for a larger share if his efficiency entitled him to expect it.(c) In view of the importance of concluding the negotiations oncereals it would be necessary to decide without delay whether to openformal negotiations with oversea suppliers on the basis of a standard quantity of 10 million tons, which might be reduced in negotiationto 9\ million tons, or whether to adopt lower figures. If possible, adecision should be taken on this point without prejudice to the broader issues of policy, which would remain for later discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (63) 31 and of the points made in their discussion.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consult the PrimeMinister on the most appropriate means of securing anearly decision about the basis on which formalnegotiations should be opened with oversea suppliers ofcereals.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
