The Queen&apos;visit toCanada1. The Prime Minister said that, in the light of recentexpressions of public anxiety about The Queen&apos;s safety during Herforthcoming visit to Canada, he had felt bound to consider how far the United Kingdom Government should properly interest themselvesin the issues involved. There was no doubt that, constitutionally, theduty of tendering advice to Her Majesty on this matter restedprimarily with Her Canadian Ministers. Nevertheless, the UnitedKingdom Government would have legitimate grounds for concern ifthere were any reason to suppose that The Queen&apos;s visit to canada would expose Her to any significant risk; and he had therefore thought it right to consult the Prime Minister of Canada. The latter had now informed us that he would be content that we should say,if necessary, that we had been in touch with the canadian government; that we were confident that they would take all necessary precautions; and that we were sure that, having carefullyassessed the risk, they did not consider that The Queen would be exposed to any undue danger. The Cabinet would probably feel that,having received this assurance, the Government had discharged their proper duty in this context.In discussion there was general agreement with this view,although, if a public statement proved necessary, its precise wordingmight require further consideration in order to make it clear that wewere not assuming the responsibility, which should continue to attach to the Canadian Government, of assessing whatever residual degreeof risk might still remain.GeneralElection:GovernmentInformationServices2. The Prime Minister said that, in order to avoid anymisunderstanding, Ministers might wish to instruct their Departmentsthat Departmental information services could properly continue todischarge their normal functions during the forthcoming GeneralElection campaign, provided that they took care to limit their activities to factual explanation of current Government statements and administrative decisions and did not become involved in theadvocacy of the Governments forward policies from a Party political point of view. This instruction would need to be interpreted with reasonable common sense.ForeignAffairsCyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 47thConclusions,Minute 3)South-EastAsiaIndonesia(previous reference:CM. (64) 47thConclusions.Minute 3)Malaysia3. The Foreign Secretary said that the position was relativelyquiescent for the time being and that there was little action that wecould usefully take, apart from keeping in touch with developmentsthrough the United States representative in the Geneva discussions and the Secretary-General of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Foreign Secretary said that there had recently been a repetition of the earlier attack on United States naval forces in theGulf of Tonkin; but the circumstances were confused and it was unlikely that the United States Government would feel that theyprovided sufficient grounds for any retaliatory action.The Foreign Secretary said that the President of Indonesia had now embarked on a tour of certain foreign countries and that developments during his absence were unpredictable. Nevertheless,we had arranged for United Kingdom subjects in Indonesia to bediscreetly advised to leave the country, if possible, at a convenient opportunity.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the representativesof Singapore in the current trade discussions had continued to presstheir demand for excessive quotas for the import of Singapore textiles4957-4
4C    &quot; SECRETinto the United Kingdom. Since their proposals were unacceptable,negotiations were now in abeyance and would probably not be resumed until the latter half of October. There seemed little risk thatin the interim the Government of Singapore would seek to reimposetheir earlier restrictions on the import of United Kingdom goods intoSingapore.Middle East The Foreign Secretary said that the recent meeting of Heads ofGovernment of Arab States had proved more uneventful than had atone time been feared. In particular, the proposal to divert the Jordanwaters for the benefit of Arab States had emerged in a form v/hichshould not do any significant damage to Israel. Discussions betweenthe President of the United Arab Republic, President Nasser, andPrince Feisal of Saudi Arabia appeared to indicate that the twoGovernments might be prepared to make some offer of mediation inthe dispute in the Yemen. But Prince Feisal seemed to have beencareful not to compromise his policy of supporting the Royalist causein that country.The Economic        4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that situation        the economy appeared to be developing broadly on the lines which(Previous       had been foreshadowed in the Budget Speech. There were no groundsReference:      for supposing that any serious degree of internal inflation wasCM. (64) 45th  currently impending; and there should be no need for generallyConclusions,    deflationary measures. On the other hand the recently publishedMinute 3)       statistics of trade had been disappointing, particularly as regards their implications in the longer term. The rate of expansion of our exportswas slackening; and imports remained high. Although both tendenciesmight be reversed during the forthcoming months, the gap betweenexports and imports was disquieting, particularly in so far as it wasreinforced by a rise in import prices. There was no sign, however, ofany basic lack of confidence in sterling; and there should be nodifficulty in maintaining this position by implementing the borrowingrights, both from other Central Banks and from the international monetary Fund, which we had arranged for this purpose.These developments confirmed the Governments declared viewthat, while an annual rate of growth of 4 per cent could be attained,its achievement would require great efforts not merely by theGovernment but by both sides of industry, particularly as regards the implementation of an effective incomes policy and the elimination of restrictive practices. It was also clear that Government expenditure would have to be kept under very critical review and that the policiesadvocated by the Labour Party in their Election Manifesto wouldoverburden the economy to an extent which would frustrate any prospect of achieving a balanced expansion.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The fact that our exports had not hitherto expanded as rapidly as we had hoped might be due to the fact that the mosthopeful prospects for exports in the longer term lay in the field of heavy capital goods; and it was these which, naturally, were theslowest to mature and, therefore, to be reflected in the export statistics.In so far as the higher level of imports was attributable to the processof industrial re-equipment which was now actively in train, it was tobe welcomed. On the other hand there were some indications that itwas due to a measure of forestalling, which the Government should seek, so far as possible, to discourage.(b) The statistics of employment which would be published inthe next few days would indicate that the economy was fully employed but that the pressure on labour resources was not as intenseas had been expected at an earlier stage.
SeveranceTerms for.O.A.C. Staff(previous reference:CM. (64) 47thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Prime Minister said that the British Overseas airways corporation (B.O.A.C.) proposed to introduce a severance schemefor some 4,000 employees whose services they wished to terminate.The terms of the scheme, however, were excessively generous andwould be liable to have very damaging repercussions on other nationalised industries, particularly British Railways and the national coal Board, who would be compelled to renegotiate redundancyschemes which they had agreed with the trade unions concerned andwere now operating without difficulty. It had therefore been agreed,in discussion among the Ministers primarily concerned, that in thefirst instance a meeting should be arranged between the Chairmanof B.O.A.C. and the Chairmen of British Railways and the national coal Board in order to establish whether the Corporation&apos;s proposals could be appropriately modified.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The justification of the Corporation^ scheme lay in the factthat it was designed to secure a reduction of staff by voluntaryresignation rather than by dismissal. The Corporation^ industrial relations were admittedly unsatisfactory; and they could maintain,in addition, that the effect of a normal redundancy arrangement would be to deprive them of the staff whom they wished to retainwhile compelling them to continue to employ the older and less efficient staff whom they would hope, by means of their own proposals, to persuade to retire. These arguments, however, did notoutweigh the manifest disadvantages of the proposals, particularlytheir probable reaction both on other nationalised industries and on private industry.(h) The cost of renegotiating the redundancy schemes of the other nationalised industries would be very heavy. For British Railwaysalone the cost might be increased from  20 million to  120 million.(c) B.O.A.C. might seek to justify their terms by analogy withthe compensation payments to redundant officers in the Armed forces and to oversea civil servants. There was a significant difference inprinciple, however, between payments to career officers, whoseprofession did not enable them readily to find alternative employment,CM. 48 (64)(c) The index of industrial production remained more or lesssteady, contrary to the general expectation that it would rise. This,however, might be misleading, particularly in view of the recogniseddifficulties of correcting the index for seasonal fluctuations and making adequate allowance for work in progress. It would bedesirable, therefore, not to attach undue weight to the index itself but rather to emphasise the undoubted rise in production achieved byspecific industries, e.g., construction and house-building.(d) The Government should also re-emphasise that, if production was to increase, restrictive practices must be eliminated; and theyshould make it clear that they would hope to realise this purpose not by compulsion but by collaboration with both sides of industry,particularly through the medium of the National economic development Council.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) and other ministers concerned, to circulate, in the light of their discussion, a draft statement on the economic situation, withparticular reference to industrial production, which mightform the basis of Government pronouncements on thissubject during the forthcoming weeks.
CharteredCompany andFinancialRelationswith theNorthernRhodesiaGovernment6. The Lord Chancellor said that the Government of northern rhodesia, basing themselves on legal advice, were disputing the claim of the British South Africa Company (Chartered) to the ownership of the mineral rights throughout the Protectorate. They proposed toexpropriate these rights without compensation; and they contended that any obligation to compensate the Company rested not withthemselves but with the United Kingdom Government on the groundthat it was solely our acts or omissions which could be held to have created any rights which the Company might claim to possess. Therights in question had in fact been obtained by a number of concessions at the end of the 19th century, the validity of which had never been settled in the Courts. In 1923 there had been a compromisesettlement, whereby the United Kingdom Government had taken over from the Chartered Company the administration of northern rhodesia and, in return, had recognised the Company as the owner of the mineral rights. Opinions given by the Law Officers in 1938and again in 1949 had confirmed the validity of the Company&apos;s rights;and the 1938 Opinion had also expressed the view that these rightshad been fully established before the 1923 Agreement was concluded.He had discussed this situation on the previous day withMr. Wina, the Northern Rhodesia Minister of Finance. It was clearthat the Northern Rhodesia Government were not prepared tolitigate in order to challenge the validity of the Company&apos;s rights inthe Courts and that they intended to press their proposal that theindependence constitution of the Protectorate should be so amended,before independence was achieved on 24th October, as to exemptmineral rights from the provisions debarring expropriation without compensation. He had therefore made it clear to Mr. Wina that theUnited Kingdom Government could not accept any liability for compensating the Company, on the grounds that the Government ofan independent Northern Rhodesia would inherit the normalliabilities of a successor Government in relation to the Company andthat the United Kingdom Government had acted throughout in good faith and in accordance with legal advice on the validity of theCompany&apos;s claims. He had also suggested that the Government ofNorthern Rhodesia should seek a basis for compensation in discussionwith the Company without prejudice on either side to the questionof legal liability. But it seemed unlikely that they would agree to doso. The Company had hitherto been disposed to claim that adequate and payments to industrial staff in the United Kingdom, who shouldbe able, in many cases, to find fresh employment without difficulty.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thematter could not be carried further until the projected meeting between the Chairman of B.O.A.C. and the Chairmen of british railways and the National Coal Board had taken place. If thismeeting did not result in a satisfactory revision of the Corporation^proposals, Ministers would have to consider the matter further. Theright solution might be to seek to devise a redundancy scheme for.O.A.C. on more normal lines, agreed with the trade unions concerned and comparable with the arrangements adopted by other nationalised industries.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, ifnecessary, for further consideration to be given, in the lightof their discussion, to the issues raised by the severancescheme proposed by the British Overseas airways corporation.
compensation might amount to  27 million net of all taxes. this figure, however, was quite unrealistic; and, in order to avoid a breakdown in the negotiations, it might be desirable that we shouldourselves seek to ascertain from the Company the lowest sum whichthey would be prepared to accept, provided that it was clear that wewere acting at the request, and as the agents, of the Northern rhodesia government. There were obvious objections to our acting as an intermediary in this way. On the other hand we must bear in mind the possible repercussions of the expropriation of the CharteredCompany on the position of the copper companies in northern rhodesia, whose mining rights depended on the validity of the chartered Company&apos;s own rights. If the Government of northern rhodesia succeeded in establishing the principle of expropriation inrelation to the Chartered Company, they might thereafter seek toextend it to the copper companies; and the implications of any development of this kind could be very serious. We might be compelled, therefore, to consider whether we should lend theGovernment of Northern Rhodesia the money with which to providecompensation for the Chartered Company, in return for some protection for the copper companies. In the first instance, however,it would be desirable, in further discussions with the Northern Rhodesian representatives, to renew the suggestion that they should submit the issues involved to some form of judicial arbitration, onthe grounds that their present refusal to do so would obviously beregarded merely as a device to seek to justify expropriation andwould be liable seriously to impair their public credit.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) In view of the rather ambiguous nature of the CharteredCompany&apos;s rights, their expropriation without compensation mightnot necessarily affect the international credit of Northern Rhodesiato any significant extent. On the other hand the International bank for Reconstruction and Development (I.B.R.D.) has already refusedto provide loans to Ceylon and the United Arab Republic on thegrounds that the Governments concerned had expropriatedinternational companies without compensation; and they might beexpected to adopt a similar attitude in relation to Northern Rhodesia.It might be possible to enlist the assistance of the Bank in dissuadingthe Northern Rhodesia Government from the action which theycontemplated.(b) There was no case for providing aid to the Government ofNorthern Rhodesia in order that they might pay reasonablecompensation to the Chartered Company. Their financial position was already relatively strong; and the acquisition of the CharteredCompany&apos;s rights would increase their annual revenues by some  7 million. Moreover, we should be liable to create a very damagingprecedent if we provided loans to any Government in order to enablethem to pay compensation for expropriation.(c) Due weight must nevertheless be given to the strength ofpolitical feeling in Northern Rhodesia on the question of the chartered Company&apos;s rights and to the implicit threat to the positionof the copper companies.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in thefirst instance we should maintain pressure on the Northern rhodesia government to litigate on the issues involved, having regard to the adverse consequences to their international credit if they proceededunilaterally to expropriate the Chartered Company&apos;s rights withouttesting their validity or, if this was established, paying propercompensation. The issues involved should thereafter be further considered by the Ministers mainly concerned in the light of there actions of the Government of Northern Rhodesia to this approach.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to be guided, in his further negotiations with the representatives of the Governmentof Northern Rhodesia about the Chartered Company&apos;smineral rights in the Protectorate, by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider whetherthe International Bank for Reconstruction andDevelopment should be moved to warn the Governmentof Northern Rhodesia of the probable reaction on theirinternational credit of a unilateral decision to expropriatethe Chartered Company&apos;s rights without compensation.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinisters primarily concerned, would arrange for the issues involved to be further considered in the light of the outcome of the negotiations contemplated under conclusion (1) above.7. The Lord President recalled that a survey of school buildings in England and Wales had been initiated by the then Minister ofEducation in 1962 in order to establish how far existing schools fell short of the best modern standards. Of the present total of some7 million school children about half were accommodated in schoolswhich had been built since the war to a high standard. The rest werein schools of varying degrees of inadequacy. Unfortunately, the questionnaire on which the survey was based had been directed toeliciting defects in existing schools in relation to a theoretically idealbuilding; and the picture presented by the replies was thereforeunrealistic and misleading. In earlier discussions the Cabinet had accordingly considered the manner in which the survey could be presented in proper perspective; and a White Paper for this purpose was in course of preparation. Meanwhile, however, the delay in publishing the survey had,attracted attention; and the Governmentwere being accused of deliberately suppressing information whichmight be employed for their political embarrassment.In discussion it was suggested that criticism of the Governmenfsrecord in education should be firmly rebutted by evidence of the substantial progress which had been made in the construction of newschools. Thus, the value of educational building which had been started in each year had increased from  100 million at the beginningof the present Parliament to  220 million next year. The delay in publishing the survey might properly be explained on the ground thatthe publication of the bare statistics which had been collected twoyears earlier would be seriously misleading and that it was necessaryto devote a considerable amount of time and effort to presenting themin a form which would be reasonably up to date and would enablethem to be seen in proper perspective. There might be advantage inadmitting that conditions in some schools were still unsatisfactory,since this would be seen to justify the Governmenfs current programme of new construction, which was commonly accepted asthe maximum which could realistically be undertaken.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) and in the light of their discussion, to submit to the Prime Minister, for circulation to the Cabinet, a draft statement defending the delay in publishing the projected White Paper on the School BuildingSurvey.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd September, 1964.SchoolBuildingSurvey(previous reference:CM. (64) 35thConclusions.Minute 9)
