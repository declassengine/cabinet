Parliament 1    The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.ConcessionaryFares for Old-Age Pensioners2. The Cabinet considered the growing pressure for some action by the Government in relation to the arrangement whereby old-age pensioners were granted concessionary fares on public transport inmany parts of the country. This privilege tended to be limited tocertain types of service and to certain routes; and the fact that its value was therefore liable to be curtailed when the services werechanged or the routes were extended was creating a series of arbitraryanomalies and provoking increasing dissatisfaction.In discussion it was suggested that it was open to local authoritiesto seek to remedy these anomalies by promoting private legislation.This, however, was a cumbrous and protracted method of dealingwith the problem; and it might be preferable for the Government to institute legislation themselves, particularly since a Private Memberof Parliament was known to be anxious to introduce a Bill for thispurpose. On the other band it could be argued to be bothadministratively retrograde and inconsistent with the Governmentsknown views on social benefits that they should seek to extend thearea of concessionary privileges in kind rather than to rely on increasing cash pensions at reasonable intervals. As against this argument, however, it could be maintained that the principle involvedhad already been conceded when the existing arrangements as regardsfares for pensioners had been originally approved; and theGovernment could not afford to remain inactive in face of the growingcriticism that the value of this concession was now being progressivelyeroded.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would need to give further consideration to the issues involved in due course.Outbreak ofTyphoid inAberdeen3. The Cabinet considered the latest developments inconnection with the recent outbreak of typhoid fever in Aberdeen. Ithad been agreed that an official enquiry into the immediate causes ofthis outbreak should be instituted; and the necessary arrangementsfor this purpose were being made as a matter of urgency. It had recently come to light, however, that, as the result of two isolatedcases of the disease which had appeared in the previous year,arrangements had been made to inspect certain meat-packingestablishments in the Argentine from which supplies of tinned meat,similar to those which were believed to be the cause of the outbreakin Aberdeen, were regularly shipped to this country. This inspectionhad resulted in a decision that we should refuse to accept furtherconsignments from these establishments until they adopted more satisfactory hygienic precautions, particularly as regards chlorinationof the water used for cooling the packed tins; but certainconsignments which had already reached this country were allowedto be distributed. These were now being recalled; and there was no immediate reason to suppose that the general public would be at any risk on this account, especially since it had not yet been established that, even at Aberdeen, the cause of the outbreak could be tracedwith certainty to tinned meat of the kind in question. On the otherhand it was disquieting that the bulk of Government stocks of thismeat dated from the early 1950s but that chlorination of the waterused in the packing establishments in the Argentine had not been
generally introduced until 1955. If, therefore, the absence of thisprecaution should be regarded as constituting a potential risk to health, it would be for consideration what action might need to betaken and how the position should best be presented to publicopinion. Meanwhile, urgent enquiries should be made about thecircumstances in which consignments of tinned meat from establish-ments in which water was still not chlorinated had been allowed, as recently as the previous year, to be distributed in this country.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for them to be kept in close touch with developments in connection with theoutbreak of typhoid fever in Aberdeen and to consider, inthe light of their discussion, how the possible implications ofthis outbreak would best be presented, if necessary, to publicopinion.Foreign 4.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, althoughAffairs we had had some success in promoting discussions in VientianeLaos between certain of the Powers concerned in restoring peace in Laos,(Previous        others had refused to participate. It might therefore be advisableReference:      that we should now endorse the alternative proposal by the PolishCM. (64) 29th  Government that a conference should be convened in Geneva, which conclusions,    would  include  the  co-chairmen  of  the  International  ControlMinute l)       Commission, together with representatives of the other member countries of the Commission and of the main political factions inLaos itself. It was reasonable to hope that the United StatesGovernment would not dissent from this procedure; but they appeared to be increasingly disposed to adopt a more belligerentpolicy, both in Laos and in Vietnam, and we might need shortly todecide how far we could support them in this respect. It had alreadybeen made clear to them that, although we might be able to despatch a squadron of aircraft to Thailand if this was necessary in order to stabilise the position, we should not be able to provide ground troopsin Indo-China.Congo The Foreign Secretary said that, as the date for the termination(Previous of the United Nations mandate in the Congo drew near, the situationReference: in the country was rapidly deteriorating. The Secretary-General of theC.C. (63) 4th United Nations did not appear to be prepared to take any immediateConclusions, action; and in these circumstances it was difficult to see how weMinute 3) ourselves could profitably intervene. He would keep the Cabinetclosely informed.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.SouthernRhodesia(previous reference:CM. (64) 25thConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had consulted the Prime Ministers of all other member countries of theCommonwealth about the desirability of inviting Mr. Smith, thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, to attend the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers and that it was now clearthat the majority of them held that only the Prime Ministers of fullyindependent member countries should be present at the meeting. Inthese circumstances there was no alternative to informing Mr. Smiththat he could not expect to receive an invitation. Mr. Smith might be disposed to regard this as a rebuff which would justify him in seeking a fresh mandate from the electorate on the issue of a unilateral declaration of independence by the colony. It was for consideration
legislative programme(previous reference:C.C. (63) 35thConclusions,Minute 6)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP. (64) 103) about the legislative programme for the1964-65 Session of Parliament.The Lord Privy Seal said that, while the programme annexed to cp. (64) 103 might need adjustment in the light of developments inthe Governments policy during the remaining months of the present parliament, it was important that work should proceed on the bulk ofthe Bills which would be required at the beginning of the new session in order that as many as possible might be considered by Ministersbefore the summer recess. The Bills in the first three categories of the list would constitute a full programme; and any subsequent additionscould be made only at the expense of Bills already included.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) On further consideration the urgency of legislation on local employment now appeared less than had at one time been supposed;and the Bill need not be given a high place among those held in reserve.(b) While it was desirable that legislation should be introducedearly in the new Parliament to implement the recommendations ofthe Committee on Company Law (the Jenkins Committee), on whicha White Paper was to be published during the summer, the Bill wouldbe long and complex and could not be ready for introduction untilFebruary 1965 at the earliest. It might be preferable, therefore, to defer its introduction until the beginning of the 1965-66 Session.(c) It was likely to be necessary to introduce legislation to indemnify the Crown against the claims of the Burmah Oil Companyarising from the demolition of property during the war in Burma.A Bill for this purpose should be added to the list of contingent Bills(List A.2).(.d) Legislation would probably be required in the light of thereport of the Committee on the Housing Situation in Greater London(the Milner-Holland Committee), which was expected to report at theend of the year.(e) There might be advantage in drafting the Bill on CommonsRegistration, at present among the reserve Bills, in case time became available for its introduction early in the Session. But the drafting of bills in the reserve list should be undertaken only if parliamentary counsel were not fully occupied with Bills in the main programme.CM. 30 (64)whether we should seek to anticipate this risk by inviting him toLondon for informal discussions which, although they would necessarily be inconclusive, might at least suffice to keep the situation under control for a further period.In discussion there was general agreement with this suggestion.There were tactical objections to inviting Mr. Smith to London either before or after the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers; andin these circumstances it might be wise to offer him a choice betweenboth dates.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to the mannerin which the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia mightmost appropriately be informed that he should not expect to be invited to attend the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers.
Nuclear-PoweredShips(previous reference:CM. (64) 29thConclusions,Minute 4)7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Lord Chancellor (CP.. (64) 107) about legislation on the liability of operators of nuclear-powered ships. They had before them, inaddition, a memorandum on the same subject by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (64) 111).The Lord Chancellor said that it would be desirable to introduce in the next Session of Parliament legislation enacting the principle ofsole and absolute liability of the operator in relation to nuclear-powered ships. In the absence of such legislation we should be unableto give effect to the provisions of the Brussels Convention on thissubject, in which we ourselves had played a significant part; weshould be convicted of inconsistency in failing to implement inrelation to nuclear accidents at sea the principle which we proposedto observe in relation to nuclear accidents on land by legislating togive effect to the Vienna Convention on third party liability in thefield of nuclear energy; we should be exposed to possibleembarrassment if we were asked, in connection with the forthcoming visit of the U.S.S. Savannah to this country, what provision had beenmade as regards liability in the event of a nuclear accident caused bythis vessel; and the value of the various agreements which we hadnegotiated with the United States Government about nuclear-poweredwarships in foreign ports might be questioned. For these reasons the drafting of the necessary legislation should be put in hand forthwith.The Minister of Transport said that it was premature to seek toreach a final decision on this question. The only other countriesoperating nuclear-powered ships, i.e., the United States and theSoviet Union, were not themselves prepared to adhere to the BrusselsConvention; and, if we introduced legislation of our own for thispurpose, we might be weakening our own negotiating position.Moreover, the legislation proposed would be liable to be in directconflict with other international conventions to which both we andthe United States Government were parties. These issues should befurther examined before the drafting of legislation was put in hand.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage probably inclined in favour of introducing legislation onthe lines proposed by the Lord Chancellor, provided that the implications were further explored on the lines indicated by theMinister of Transport.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that legislation establishing the principleof sole and absolute liability of the operator in relationto nuclear-powered ships should now be drafted.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for thenecessary instructions to be given, without delay, in orderto give effect to Conclusion (1) above.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the legislative programme for 1964-65as indicated in C.P. (64) 103, subject to the addition toList A.2 of a Bill to indemnify the Crown against claims arising from the war in Burma.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to keep the programme underregular review and to arrange for the drafting of the bills in question to be put in hand as rapidly as possible.
Damages for 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordLoss of Chancellor (CP. (64) 109) on the assessment of damages for loss of earnings earnings.The Lord Chancellor said that the Trades Union Congress(T.U.C) had raised with him the question whether, in assessingdamages for loss of earnings, the courts should take account of the sums which the plaintiff would have paid by way of national insurance contributions, had he been in work, and of the amount ofunemployment benefit which he received. The common law principleprovided that the plaintiff should be compensated for the pecuniaryloss which he had suffered; and in accordance with this principle ithad been held in recent cases that the national insurance contributions which would have been paid should be deducted, as should theunemployment benefit actually received. The T.U.C., however,maintained that it was wrong in principle to deduct the full amountof benefit to which the insured person had himself in part contributed.Moreover, the common law principle had been eroded by statute law;and the present position in England and Wales was that under theLaw Reform (Personal Injuries) Act, 1948, only half the industrial injury, disablement or sickness benefit received within five years ofthe time when the right of action arose was deducted, while underthe Fatal Accident Acts all insurance monies and other benefits paidto the dependants were wholly disregarded. It had long been the lawthat amounts paid under voluntary insurance policies should be disregarded. In claims for personal injury and for wrongful dismissalthe contributions which the plaintiff would have paid, had he beenin work, were deducted from the damages.It was arguable that the question whether the sums paid by wayof insurance should be taken into account in assessing damagesshould not turn on whether the insurance had been voluntarilycontracted; and a reasonable solution of the problem in England andWales would be to treat unemployment benefit in the same way as industrial injury and other benefit and to deduct half the amountreceived. The contributions, however, should continue to be deducted.Proposals on these lines seemed likely to be acceptable to the T.U.CThey were not acceptable, however, to the Minister of Pensions and national Insurance, who thought it inopportune for the Governmentto enter into commitments which might limit their freedom of actionin discussing severance payments and wage-related benefits, or to theMinister of Labour, who considered that contributions should be disregarded. In Scotland the position was different, in that it was thepractice to disregard both contributions and benefits.In discussion it was suggested that, while there could be noquestion of the amendment of the law of Scotland (which would be strongly opposed by the Scottish T.U.C.), there might be advantage in bringing the law in England and Wales into conformity with thatin Scotland. On the other hand the difference in law had beenCM. 30 (64)(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science toarrange for further consideration to be given, as a matterof urgency, to:(i) the possible implications of such legislation in thelight of the considerations outlined in CP. (64) 111;(ii) the form of the statement which it might be necessaryfor the Government to make if they werequestioned, in connection with the forthcoming visit of the U.S.S. Savannah to this country, aboutthe provision for liability in relation to any nuclearaccident caused by this vessel.
accepted for a number of years; and to provide that benefits shouldbe wholly disregarded in England and Wales would impose an unacceptable burden on the National Insurance Fund. The proposals put forward by the Lord Chancellor, however, might prejudice theoperation of the Contracts of Employment Act. There was apossibility, particularly if wage-related benefits were introduced, thatan employee who sued for wrongful dismissal might be over-compensated and might receive more in total if he brought an action under the Act than if the Act were complied with, a situation whichwould involve some risk of collusion between employer and employeeat the expense of the National Insurance Fund. Moreover, theGovernment had indicated in the White Paper on Compensation forVictims of Crimes of Violence that compensation under that scheme would be reduced by the amount of social security benefits; and itwould seem inconsistent to adopt a different principle in relation to claims for loss of employment.In relation to contributions it was arguable that, since thepayment of contributions affected subsequent benefits, the amountshould be disregarded notwithstanding the common law principle.In further discussion it was suggested that the T.U.C. were more concerned with the problems of severance pay and wage-relatedbenefit than with the issues raised in CP. (64) 109 and that theywould probably be content with a reply to the effect that the widerimplications of these issues were being examined. On the other hand the connection between assessment of damages for loss of earnings and the problems of severance pay and wage-related benefits did not seem to be close and, if the point were pressed, it would be difficultto justify maintaining a distinction between payments under voluntaryinsurance schemes, which were disregarded on the ground that theyhad been paid for by the insured, and those under compulsoryschemes to which the plaintiff had in part contributed. There wouldbe advantage in bringing unemployment benefit into line with thetreatment of industrial injury benefit under the Act of 1948, which appeared to have given general satisfaction.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion was in favour of the Lord Chancellors proposals but that the wisest course might be to communicate theseprovisionally to the T.U.C., as an indication of the manner in whichthe Government were disposed to view the problem, and to invitetheir comments before a final conclusion was reached.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to reply to the T.U.C. on thequestion of damages for loss of earnings on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.Apple and 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePear Quotas     Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 110) on import arrangementsfor apples and pears.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had recently discussed the possibility of relaxing thepresent restrictions on imports of apples and pears. Protection was provided mainly by import quotas, which had originally been introduced for balance of payments reasons and did not apply toAustralia, New Zealand and South Africa. Present quotas were:Apples (two six-monthly periods)July-December       ......      15,200 tonsJanuary-June ...      ...      68,750 tonsPears (annual quota)July-June     .........      28,000 tons
The Italian Government, supported by other suppliers, particularlyCanada, were pressing strongly for a liberalisation of these arrangements; and it would be to our political and commercialadvantage to go some way to meet this request. The quotas were nolonger justified on balance of payments grounds and were contraryto our obligations under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(GATT). Most Western European countries, however, except Italy,also maintained quota restrictions; and their tariffs were generallyhigher than our own. In the long-term arrangements for access wouldhave to be discussed in an international forum; but it would be unrealistic to expect any agreement in the near future.The Economic Policy Committee had therefore consideredalternative proposals by the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretaryof State for Industry. The former proposed that, in the case of apples,three periods should be substituted for the present two six-monthlyperiods, the quota being established at the present figure of 15,200tons from August to December, being raised to 55,000 tons between january and March and being completely removed from April to july. In the case of pears the Minister proposed that the presentannual quota period should be replaced by two periods, namelyMarch to July, during which the quota should be removed, and august to February, during which it should be of the same size(28,000 tons) as that now applicable to the whole year. These changes would not take effect until 1st January, 1965. The Secretary of Statefor Industry, on the other hand, recommended that, for apples, the quota for the period August to December should be increased to16,000 tons and that the period of complete liberalisation should begin on 16th March instead of on 1st April (with a quota forthe first two and a half months of the year of 50,000 tonsinstead of 55,000 tons for the first full three months). For pears he proposed complete liberalisation for the six months February to Julyinstead of for five months. Both changes would be introduced on1st July, 1964.The Economic Policy Committee had been unable to reach agreement on the choice between these alternative courses of action.It would be necessary to consult other Commonwealth governments before a final decision was taken. The present quotas gave Australiaand New Zealand an uncovenanted benefit, which they had no rightto expect to continue to receive indefinitely. The canadian government, on the other hand, would benefit from liberalisationand would be disappointed if no change were made in their favour.The Minister of Agriculture said that, when the new policy for horticulture was introduced, the domestic horticultural industry hadbeen assured that the tariff on sensitive items would not be regardedas negotiable within the next four years; and, although no similarundertaking had been given as regards quotas, any relaxation wouldbe regarded with great suspicion. Apples and pears were incontestablysensitive items; and the proposals which he had put forwardrepresented the maximum degree of concession which the industry could be expected to accept. Even so, they would adversely affecthome growers both at the beginning and at the end of the homeseason. To extend complete liberalisation for apples into the second half of March would damage their interests even more seriously;while to seek to introduce any new arrangements before the beginningof 1965 would be politically most unwise. Many European countriesprovided their horticultural industries with a higher degree ofprotection than did the United Kingdom. Moreover, there were likelyto be considerable surpluses of horticultural produce in Europe inthe next few years; and we must be careful to maintain an adequatemeasure   of  protection  for   our  domestic  industry.   In   these
circumstances it would be unwise to contemplate any liberalisation of our imports on any significant scale otherwise than as part of ageneral review of international arrangements in this context.Meanwhile, the arrangements which he had proposed were the most that could be realistically envisaged as an interim measure.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the production ofdessert apples in the United Kingdom had increased by over 50 percent in the last ten years and imports from all sources had risen byabout the same proportion. On the other hand there had been no significant increase in the quotas during this period. The monthsJuly to December were of principal concern to suppliers in thenorthern hemisphere; and a quota which remained at 15,200 tons,even for a period of five months instead of six, would provide themwith virtually no easement. The new policy for horticulture, which involved substantial Exchequer assistance to the industry, had notcomprised any limitation on the reduction of quotas, as opposed totariffs, on sensitive horticultural items. This policy would be frustrated if, on the occasion of its first practical test, we foundourselves unable to consider more than an inadequate degree of change or felt bound to promise the growers that, after this minimaladjustment, no further changes would be made for some years.Moreover, the Government had obligations to the domestic consumers as well as to the farmers. No increase in United kingdom production of apples and pears was expected over the next few years;and a significant relaxation of quota restrictions would be necessary if consumption was to rise in step with the increase in net incomes and the present upward tendency of average prices was to be arrested.Finally, our wider commercial interests required a substantialrelaxation of the quotas, if necessary unilaterally. If it was accepted as unlikely that any measure of long-term agreement on liberalisationin relation to horticultural produce would be achieved for some years,it would be wholly inconsistent with our trade policy to refrain from making a really substantial advance in the interim or to bindourselves not to make further advances thereafter during the lifetime of the next Parliament.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) A heavy domestic crop of apples was expected during thecurrent year; and there was little danger of any undue rise in prices.(b) An early liberalisation of the quotas would be of value interms of our relations with Italy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, it would appear to be inexpedient to make any significantalteration in the quotas for the current year. It might be desirable to contemplate some degree of liberalisation in 1965, whether on thelines proposed by the Minister of Agriculture or on a more generousscale; but the consultations which would be required for this purposeneed not be undertaken for some little time and any public statement which might have to be made in the meantime should be confined toindicating that we were considering how far liberalisation might bepossible in the following year.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there should be no change in the quotas forapples and pears during the current year.(2) Agreed in principle that a liberalisation of the quotas mightbe desirable in 1965.(3) Invited the Ministers concerned to be guided, in any public statements which they might have to make in this context,by the points made by the Prime Minister in his summing-up.
StationingCosts inGermany(previous reference:CM. (64) 26thConclusions.Minute 4)GermanInterestin the TSR.211. The Prime Minister said that at the meeting of the defence and Oversea Policy Committee on 27th May (D.O. (64) 24th Meeting.Minute 4) it had been agreed that the Federal German Minister ofDefence, Herr von Hassel, should be invited to inspect the prototypeof the TSR.2 aircraft during his visit to the United Kingdom andthat German technical experts should subsequently be allowed to10. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 105), and the Secretary of State for defence (CP. (64) 112) about new arrangements to offset the balanceof payments cost of our forces in Germany.The Chief Secretary said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s previous decision, he had discussed the issues involved with theFederal German Minister of Finance, Dr. Dahlgruen, in Bonn. Therewere three possible courses of action. We could seek to achieve anagreement, similar to that recently concluded by the federal government with the United States Government, whereby theFederal Government would recognise the continuing burden on our balance of payments caused by our military expenditure in Germanyand would undertake in general terms to do their best to offset thesecosts. Alternatively, we could negotiate an agreement corresponding to the Agreed Minute of 6th June, 1962, under which the federal government would undertake to relieve our balance of payments ofa specific amount representing part of the costs involved.Dr. Dahlgruen had not been prepared, however, to accept a commitment to spend more than DM250 million a year over thenext two years in respect of defence contracts; and this would be wholly inadequate to offset the cost of maintaining our forces inGermany. The third possible course was to abandon the attempt toreach a new agreement. It was clear, however, that the federal government would greatly dislike the political implications of a breakdown in the negotiations. Moreover, an agreement on theUnited States model, on the lines of the draft appended to cp. (64) 105, seemed likely to be no less effective in real terms than an agreement comprising specific minimum obligations at a relatively low level. It would also have certain presentational advantages inenabling us to claim that we had secured from the Federal Govern-ment terms comparable to those accorded to the United StatesGovernment.When this issue had been discussed by the Defence and overseas policy Committee (D.O. (64) 24th Meeting, Item 3) it had therefore been agreed that the Secretary of State for Defence should discuss thequestion further with the Federal German Minister of Defence,Herr von Hassel, during the latter&apos;s visit to the United Kingdom andshould seek to obtain from him the additional undertaking that theFederal Government would so direct their defence procurementplanning that in the longer-term their defence orders might offset thecost in foreign exchange of maintaining our forces in Germany. Asa result the Secretary of State had now written to Herr von Hassel inthe terms indicated in CP. (64) 112, proposing such an addition tothe draft agreement. If the Federal Government respondedfavourably, it would be to our advantage, on balance, to settle theissue on this basis.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in CP. (64) 105, subject to the modification suggested by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, inthe light of CP. (64) 112.
examine it in more detail. The Secretary of State for Defence had accordingly issued the necessary invitations. The Cabinet should be aware of these arrangements, however, in view of the possibility that public opinion, both at home and abroad, might misrepresent the government&apos;s motives in seeking to promote the purchase by theFederal German Government of an aircraft capable of deliveringnuclear weapons.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the federal government already possessed weapons systems (including UnitedStates aircraft) capable of delivering nuclear bombs, although theextent to which these weapons could penetrate the defences of theSoviet Union was less than in the case of the TSR.2. Moreover, theywere considering the purchase of the United States aircraft TFX,which had a range roughly equivalent to that of the TSR.2. A refusalon our part to sell the latter to the Federal Government, therefore,would not prevent them from acquiring aircraft with a comparablecapability.In discussion it was suggested that it was for consideration whether, in view of the possible damage to our relations with theSoviet Union and, therefore, to the relaxation of East-West tensionif the Federal Government acquired aircraft of this nature, we should seek to agree with the United States Government that neitherGovernment would sell such aircraft to the Federal Republic. Onthe other hand there was no prospect that the United states authorities would be willing to entertain such an agreement, whilethe Government would be exposed to considerable domestic criticism if they appeared to be trying to frustrate the efforts of the UnitedKingdom aircraft industry to sell aircraft in the Federal Republic inthe face of intense United States competition. Moreover, in so far as public opinion would be likely to be mainly concerned about thepossibility that nuclear weapons might be carried in the aircraft, itcould be made clear that any weapons of this kind would probablybe of United States manufacture and would therefore remain under united States custodial arrangements.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance it seemed to be in our interests that we should appear to be willing to sell the TSR.2 aircraft to the Federal German Governmentand that we should therefore allow German experts to examine it.If it subsequently appeared that the Federal Government were disposed to buy the aircraft, the Cabinet would have a further opportunity to consider the matter before reaching a final decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, that facilities would be provided to representatives of the Federal German Government to conduct a technical examination of the TSR.2 aircraft.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to bring the matter before them again if it appeared that the Federal GermanGovernment were disposed to purchase this aircraft.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th June, 1964.
