Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Foreign Affairs 3. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the debateCyprus in the Security Council of the United Nations on the establishment of(Previous an international force to maintain law and order in Cyprus nowReference: seemed likely to proceed on the basis of a resolution tabled by the cm. (64) 12th Brazilian Government. This would leave the composition and conclusions, direction of the force in the hands of the Secretary-General. Even ifMinute 2) we felt able to endorse this resolution, it would probably not be acceptable to either the Greek or the Turkish Governments.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in Cypruswas deteriorating and that the position of our troops in relation tothe local police forces was becoming increasingly invidious. We must continue to maintain that our initial intervention in the Island hasbeen undertaken in response to an invitation issued jointly by theleaders of the Greek and Turkish communities and that we could notconsent to any change in the functions which our forces weredischarging unless it was similarly endorsed by both communities.Bank Rate 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatit was now clear that some measure of restraint must be imposed onthe continued expansion of the economy and that he had thereforeagreed that Bank Rate should be raised by 1 per cent that day. Thisdecision would be announced during the morning; and he proposedto make an explanatory statement in Parliament during the afternoon.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposed action. It would be advisable, however, that any public statement about the change should avoid creating the erroneous impression thatit represented a major alteration or reversal of the Governmentseconomic policy or that the Government would always feelcompelled to justify publicly the adoption of monetary measureswhich should be accepted as routine adjustments of the economy. Itwould also be desirable to give further consideration to the impact ofthe change in areas such as the North-East of England and central scotland, where unemployment was still relatively high and aconsiderable margin of unused resources remained available. Theinitiative in bringing such resources into use often lay with localauthorities, who might be disposed to maintain that an increase in thecost of borrowing would inhibit them from pressing forward withplans for development.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, that Bank Rate would be raisedby 1 per cent that day.(2) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make astatement in Parliament, on the lines indicated in their discussion, in justification of this action.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to give furtherconsideration to the impact of the increase in Bank rate on the Governments policies for regional development.
In discussion it was suggested that there were some grounds forsupposing that the international force, as currently envisaged, mightbe placed under United Nations command. There might be considerable objection, however, to subordinating United kingdom troops in Cyprus to a United Nations commander; and we should need to consider carefully whether we could accept such anarrangement if it were proposed.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary.Malta(previous reference:CM. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that, after thelast Independence Conference on Malta had ended in deadlock, theGovernment of the Island had remitted to the United KingdomGovernment sole responsibility for the decision about the terms onwhich Malta might achieve independence. We could not evade this responsibility; but we should confine ourselves to proposing a newConstitution and should not seek to impose it. It would also be advisable to stipulate that any new Constitution should not beintroduced until it had first been approved either by a referendum inthe Island or by a resolution of the Maltese Legislature after a generalelection. If a solution on these lines proved to be unacceptable, therewould be no alternative to postponing the independence of the Island.Postponement was probably inevitable in any event, since it was unlikely, in the light of the differences of opinion between the political parties in Malta, that a referendum would yield the necessary majorityfor the endorsement of a new Constitution.In discussion it was suggested that the proposal that the newConstitution might be submitted for approval by a resolution of the maltese Legislature might appear to leave it free to the legislature to suggest an alternative Constitution which might be unacceptable tous. It might be wiser, therefore, to confine ourselves to stipulating thatour proposals must be approved by referendum.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should make a statement in Parliament in the near future about the constitutional development of Malta on the lines indicated in their discussion.Population and 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEmployment Secretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 57), to which was appendedThe South-East a revised draft of the White Paper on the South-East Study.^udy The Secretary of State for Industry said that, as a result of(Previous further discussion among the Ministers principally concerned,C Nire(64) Pth aoreement nad been reached on the revised draft of the White PaperConclusions,&quot; annexed to CP. (64) 57. It was proposed to publish the White PaperMinute 3) &apos;    m this form on 19th March.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In order to avoid suggesting that there was any likelihood of serious conflict between the plans of the British Railways Board for railway closures and the general pattern of future development in thesouth-east it would be desirable to omit the first sentence ofparagraph 22 of the draft.
Monopolies,Mergers andRestrictivePractices(previous reference:CM. (64) 4thConclusions)(b) A suitable opportunity might be taken to assure agricultural interests that they would be represented on any public agenciescreated to undertake major developments and that, when it was foundnecessary to take agricultural land for development purposes, the tenants would be left undisturbed for as long as possible.(c) Arrangements for securing appropriate publicity for the study and the White Paper should be considered in consultation withthe Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes).The Cabinet-Approved, subject to the points made in discussion, thepublication on 19th March of a White Paper on South-east england in the terms of the draft appended to CP. (64) 57.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 59), to which was appendeda draft White Paper on monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the white paper reflected certain changes in his original proposals, which hehad made in the light of the Cabinefs earlier discussion. In orderto meet the criticism that the Monopolies Commission would act inthe capacity of both judge and prosecutor an independent officerwould be appointed, in the person of a Registrar of Monopolies, whowould be empowered to investigate the facts in specific cases and toset out, for the consideration of the Commission, the issues involved.This appointment should also allay the fears of industry that full details of the charges which they would be required to answer wouldnot be available to them. It would rest with the Registrar to take theinitiative in proposing an investigation; but the Government would retain the right to decide whether an enquiry should be undertaken.Further consideration had confirmed that it was desirable thatthe Government should have more extensive powers to implementrecommendations of the Monopolies Commission. In extreme casesthese should include the power, under a scheme approved byParliament, to require the firm concerned to divest itself of undertakings or of holdings in other companies. Such action shouldrarely be necessary; but the Government should possess the means to deal with an occasion of this kind, if it ever arose.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be desirable to substitute for the introductoryparagraphs of the draft White Paper a section describing the results which the Governments policy towards monopolies had already achieved and establishing the case for a further advance in this field.(b) Shipping Conferences and farmers&apos; local co-operativepurchasing and trading groups should be excluded from the scope ofthe measures now envisaged.(c) The White Paper proposed that the Registrar should compileand publish a &quot; register &quot; of monopolies. This suggestion should bere considered, since it might be objectionable to publish lists of firms or industries in a context which might appear to call in question their commercial integrity.(d) It was arguable whether the initiative in promoting an enquiry into a monopoly should rest with the proposed Registrar. Onthe other hand it was essential that the Registrar should be seen tobe an effective instrument of the Governments policy, provided thatthe Government retained the ultimate power to disallow an enquiry in cases where questions of foreign policy or other issues of thenational interest were involved.
Rates(previous reference:CM. (64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP. (64) 56) about rates.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had considered thesuggestion that a short statement should be made in the near future to the effect that the Government had decided in principle to transferpart of the burden of rates to the taxpayer and that the amount wouldbe decided in the light of the reports of the Allen Committee on the impact of rates on householders and of the current review of central and local government finance. If relief were to be given quickly,however (and it could not, in any event, be effective until the Octoberrate demands were issued) it could be provided only by a generaltransfer of the burden from local to national taxation which, in orderm6 SECRET(e) The proposal to appoint two full-time deputy chairmen ofthe Monopolies Commission might need to be reconsidered, since itwas not certain that individuals of the necessary reputation and experience could be recruited for these posts.(/) There was considerable doubt whether it would be wise totake power to require a monopoly firm to divest itself of its interests.This could be represented as a significant departure from theGovernments known views about private property and free contract;in certain cases it might involve a forced sale without compensation;and it would be liable to be ineffective in cases where the interests tobe divested were represented not by physical or financial assets butby the technical and managerial ability of personnel in a firm&apos;service. On the other hand it was unrealistic to suppose that theGovernment could deal effectively with monopolies and mergersunless they possessed some sanction of this kind; and the fact thatit would be invoked only in the most extreme cases and would requirethe prior approval of Parliament should be a sufficient safeguard against abuse. The existence of the sanction should ensure that itwould rarely, if ever, need to be used.(g) The White Paper proposed that a wide range of informationagreements should be subject to registration. But there could be no assurance that, even if firms were compelled to cancel such agreements, they would not maintain the exchange of information byinformal means. It was doubtful, therefore, whether registration of agreements would be effective in terminating practices of this kind.On the other hand the prohibition should act as a deterrent to theexchange of information; and experience in the United States tended to endorse this view.(h) The White Paper proposed that provision should be madefor investigating monopoly and restrictive practices in the field ofcommercial services. The precise scope of this definition wouldrequire further consideration. It would appear desirable, for example,that the Stock Exchange and Lloyd&apos;s should be excluded; but services such as laundries and dry cleaners would presumably fall within the definition. There would be obvious political objection, however, to adiscrimination which would appear to be directed primarily againstthe smaller firms and to allow the larger institutions to evade control.Moreover, although it might be preferable to exclude bothprofessions and trade unions from the scope of the prohibition, this,too, might prove to be politically contentious.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, the Attorney-General and other ministers concerned, to give further consideration, in thelight of their discussion, to the draft White Paper onmonopolies, mergers and restrictive practices.
commercial policy: export credits(previous reference:C.C. (63) 57thConclusions,Minute 4)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Industry (CP. (64) 55) on the grant of credit cover by theExport Credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.) for trade with Cubaand by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (64) 58) on the grant of credit cover for trade with North Korea.The Secretary of State for Industry recalled that the Cabinet had decided in December 1963 that E.C.G.D. should be authorised toprovide, over a period of five years, credit cover for the export toCuba of 400 Leyland buses valued at  3-7 million. The Cubanauthorities were now anxious to purchase additional buses, togetherCM. 15 (64)to make any impact, would have to be substantial. To reduce thedemands on the average householder by  3 a year would cost theExchequer  100 million or the equivalent of 4d. on the standard rateof income tax. The evidence suggested, however, that the public wereprincipally concerned not about the general burden of the rates butabout the disparity in rate burden between one area and another andthe prospect of continuing increases in rates in future. Individualhardship in the areas where the increases in rates had been particularlyhigh would be relieved by the provisions of the Rates (Interim Relief)Bill; and long-term measures could be considered satisfactorily only when the reports of the Allen Committee and of the review on localgovernment finance were available. It would be difficult to justifyannouncing a decision of policy in anticipation of those reports. But,if such an announcement were made, it should indicate clearly thatan amount equal to that transferred from the rates would have to beraised immediately by additional taxation. The wiser course seemedto be to give greater publicity to the action already taken to provideinterim relief and to stand firm on a statement that the Governmentwould await the reports of the studies already in hand beforedetermining what changes should be made in the system.In discussion it was suggested that public disquiet derived partly from the fact that the burden of rates, unlike that of taxation, wasnot closely related to ability to pay and partly from the substantial increases in local expenditure attributable to the development of theeducation services. There might be scope for the transfer of someeducation expenditure from the local authorities to the Exchequer;but, since householders were called upon to meet only one quarter of rate-borne expenditure, the benefit from any transfer likely to becontemplated might be spread too thinly to help persons living onsmall fixed incomes who were the least able to meet increasing ratedemands. It might be preferable, therefore, to adopt a more selectiveapproach to the problem. For the present the best course might beto explain that the principal cause of the increase in rates was theexpansion of education; that it was recognised that this was becoming a national, rather than a local service; and that the Government werereviewing, in the light of this fact, the distribution of expenditure asbetween the local authorities and the Exchequer in order to ascertain whether any of the burden should be shifted to the latter. No furtherindication should be given of the probable result of this review; andit might be useful, in discussing the subject in public, to refer to thearguments against a substantial transfer to the Exchequer of the costof local services.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Home Secretary, to draft a short statement on the lines indicated in their discussion and to submit it to the PrimeMinister.
with locomotives and other goods which British firms were able tosupply. The indebtedness of Cuba to the Soviet Union was increasing;her reserves were negligible; and her trading prospects were uncertain.On the other hand she had at present a substantial income inconvertible currencies and there was no reason on economic grounds to refuse to extend cover. On balance, therefore, E.C.G.D. might beauthorised to provide cover under Section 2 of the export guarantees Act for short-term business on normal terms and toprovide cover for medium and extended term business subject to anannual limit of  4 million on the Departments liabilities. this represented a degree of risk which appeared to be acceptable.The Foreign Secretary said that he would wish to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Secretary of State for Industry,to the proposed action in the case of Cuba. In addition, a number ofBritish firms had approached E.C.G.D. for credit cover for exports to north Korea. Experience in relation to trade with countries in theSino-Soviet bloc suggested that the grant of export cover for north korean trade might be a reasonable commercial risk. On the otherhand North Korea had been condemned as an aggressor by theUnited Nations and any official endorsement of trade with her wouldnot only be liable to prejudice our relations with the United Statesbut might also provoke reprisals against United Kingdom trade and united Kingdom nationals in South Korea. The balance of advantage,therefore, appeared to incline against the grant of E.C.G.D. cover inthis case, particularly at the present moment when we were pledged to assist the United States Government, so far as possible, in obtaining the release of two helicopter pilots who had been seized by the north korean authorities.In discussion it was suggested that the objections to a guarantee of credit for trade with Cuba, particularly the political instability ofthe country and the possibility that United Kingdom goods might beboycotted in the United States, must be weighed against the risk that,if British firms did not maintain their place in the Cuban market,they might be supplanted by their commercial rivals in othercountries. It might be appropriate, however, that any guaranteesshould be given under Section 1 of the Export Guarantees Act, underwhich guarantees were justified on ordinary commercial grounds,rather than under Section 2.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that credit cover should not be made available by theExport Credits Guarantee Department for trade withNorth Korea.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Industry would give further consideration to thedesirability of authorising the Export Credits guarantee department to guarantee further credits for trade withCuba.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (64) 55 at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27th February, 1964
