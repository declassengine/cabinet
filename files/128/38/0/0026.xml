primeministers visit toOttawa andWashington1. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the results ofhis recent visit to Ottawa and Washington for discussions with theCanadian and United States Governments.The Prime Minister said that he had been gratified by the goodwillwhich the President of the United States, President Johnson, haddisplayed towards the United Kingdom and his evident desire tomaintain a particularly close relationship between the United Statesand ourselves. On practically all the individual issues which he had discussed with President Johnson unanimity of view had beenestablished. In particular, the United States Government nowappreciated the logic of our policy in relation to Indonesia; and wewere assured that, if the Government of Indonesia resumed theiraggressive attitude towards Malaysia, we should have the supportof the United States Government in seeking to maintain our positionin South-East Asia. We, for our part, had undertaken to provide theUnited States Government with comparable support in implementingtheir policy in South Vietnam and in resisting the attempt of theFrench Government to establish neutralism in the area.The United States Government were anxious to maintain the momentum of discussion with the Soviet Union in an attempt topromote a further relaxation of international tension. For this purpose they would welcome our support, in the forthcoming deliberationsat the Disarmament Conference in Geneva, of President Johnson&apos;proposal to &quot; freeze &quot; nuclear delivery vehicles. The discussions in washington had established that the United States Government wouldnot regard a measure of this kind as affecting either our fleet ofPolaris submarines or the TSR-2 aircraft and that they would hopethat the multilateral nuclear force, if it were created, would be similarly excepted from the scope of the &quot; freeze &quot;. In other respects,however, the concept was still in the early stages of development andmany of its details remained to be settled.President Johnson had undertaken to renew the understanding which had been established between the late President Kennedy andthe former Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Macmillan, M.P., about prior consulation between the Governments of the United States and theUnited Kingdom on the use of nuclear weapons; and the difference of view between the two Governments about the Memorandum of understanding on the use of the Holy Loch by United States nuclearsubmarines appeared to have been satisfactorily resolved.The United States Government had expressed warm admirationfor the speed and efficiency with which our troops had recentlyre-established law and order in East Africa. They now believed that,although the regime of Mr. Karume in Zanzibar was of doubtfulconstitutional validity, the balance of advantage inclined in favour of recognising it, in the hope that this might prevent it from falling whollyunder Sino-Soviet domination. They v/ere also concerned about the increasing deterioration of the situation in Ghana and were considering whether they might be compelled to terminate UnitedStates aid in respect of the Volta River project. We had impressed on them the dangers implicit in any precipitate action on this issue;and they had undertaken to consult us before reaching any decision.On the issue of United Kingdom trade with Cuba PresidentJohnson had taken note of our objections to a policy of economic sanctions and to any interference with normal trade between theUnited Kingdom and the Sino-Soviet bloc. The United StatesGovernment had appeared to appreciate the force of our argument;but they had made it clear that, if United Kingdom firms continuedto trade with Cuba, they must expect to find that their trade with theUnited States would suffer. It would be necessary to ensure that commercial interests in this country were aware of the United states attitude on this point.Discussions with other members of the United states administration on the forthcoming negotiations on the Kennedy
2. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that,as a result of recent diplomatic exchanges, a debate on Cyprus would begin that day in the Security Council. We must now await itsoutcome. In the meantime, however, the function of maintaining lawand order in the island was imposing an increasing strain on our troops, whose relations with the Greek and Turkish communitieswere inevitably deteriorating. We must therefore seek to ensure that,if a new peace-keeping force were established under United Nationsauspices, United Kingdom troops would not be called upon to playtoo prominent a part in it.The Cabinet -Took note of this statement by the commonwealth secretary.3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Industry (CP. (64) 44) and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government (CP. (64) 37 and 45) about the South-East Study.The Secretary of State for Industry said that officials had recentlycompleted a Study of the implications of the substantial increase in population in South-East England over the next 20 years. the regional Development Committee recommended that this Studyshould be published in the form annexed to CP. (64) 37, togetherwith a White Paper on the lines of the draft annexed to CP. (64) 44.The Study forecast that the population of South-East England (east of a line from the Wash to Dorset) would increase by 3-J- million inthe period 1961-81, about 2-4 million representing the excess of births over deaths and 1 -1 million representing net migration fromother parts of the country and from overseas. On the basis of thishypothesis the White Paper suggested a twofold approach to theproblem. First, local planning authorities should be empowered tomake substantial increased allocations of land for building in order to accommodate some 2 to 2\ million extra people. Second, in orderto relieve the pressure on the conurbation of London itself, a programme of major development schemes should be launched, inthe form of additional new towns and of large expansions of existingtowns, with the objective of accommodating, by 1981, the balanceof some 1 to 1J million people. The White Paper emphasised thatthe arrangements to be made for this purpose would not diminish the priority which the Government had already accorded to thedevelopment of Central Scotland and the North-East region ofEngland and that the extent and location of public investment andindustrial building in the South-East, together with the phasing of therelease of the necessary land, would be determined with this end inview. Nevertheless, planning in the South-East should be put in cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 3)PopulationandEmployment(previous reference:CM. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 6)The South-East StudyRound in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade had revealedalmost complete identity of view between the United Kingdom andthe United States on all the major issues involved. In particular, theUnited States representatives would be likely to endorse our own opinion that the proposals which would be put forward by thespokesmen of the European Economic Community would offervirtually no basis for negotiation.In the discussions in Ottawa the Canadian Government hadtaken note of our representations about the damage inflicted onour exports to Canada by the Canadian anti-dumping duties. Theyhad expressed their willingness in principle to consider this issuefurther; and it would be explored in greater detail when the canadian minister of Commerce, Mr. Sharp, visited London in the near future for discussions with the Secretary of State for Industry.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement and warmlycongratulated the Prime Minister on the successful outcome of his recent visit to Ottawa and Washington.
hand forthwith; and the White Paper therefore suggested that, inthose cases where the proposed development was to take the formof new towns, the existing administrative machinery would sufficebut that, in those cases where major town expansion schemes were involved, the Government would need to work out fresh arrangements in partnership with the local authorities. The necessary land shouldbe acquired well in advance of needs.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, inthe light of the continuing scarcity of housing in London, somemeasures to relieve the pressure on the metropolis were urgently required; and he would be content to endorse the expansion schemesproposed for this purpose provided that the land involved wasacquired by appropriate public agencies, who would be empoweredto ensure that the necessary development took place as it was required,whether it was carried out by private developers, by local authorities or by the agencies themselves. This would enable the Government tocontrol the timing of development in such a way that the prioritiesfor the North-East and Central Scotland were not jeopardised; itwould reduce the risk that private speculators would seek to extractexcessive profit from land transactions; and it would permit theExchequer to recover, at the point when the land was sold to private builders, the betterment resulting from such initial development asthe public agencies themselves might have undertaken. On this basis the Government could claim that the arrangements for effecting theexpansion of existing towns were analogous to the procedures whichhad been adopted in relation to the original creation of the new towns; and they could also emphasise, in the public presentation ofthe White Paper, that they intended to prevent the inevitableappreciation in land values from accruing to private speculators.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The references in the White Paper to the governments intention that controlled development of South-East England shouldnot detract from the priority to be accorded to expansion in North-East England and Central Scotland were scattered and not whollyconvincing. The point should be made more clearly and forciblyand at as early a stage as possible in the text.(b) It might be unwise to suggest that the land needed for expansion schemes should be acquired &quot; well in advance of needs &quot;.This would be liable to cause needless disturbance to existingoccupants, particularly tenant farmers; it would be regarded asdepriving them of the betterment to which they would feel themselvesentitled; it would involve a premature expenditure of public fundswhich might more profitably be used for other purposes; it might be resented by the local authorities concerned; and it would appear tobe an implicit endorsement of the view of the Opposition that it wasimpossible to obtain land for social purposes at reasonable pricesexcept by means of public acquisition.(c) On the other hand arrangements could no doubt be madeto reduce to a minimum the disturbance to existing occupants of theland in question. Moreover, current practice in relation to new towns,which would be adopted in relation to the proposed cases of expansion,secured to farmers and landowners the market value of their land,excluding the value to be created by development; and this practicehad evoked no criticism. The expenditure involved by the proposed measures some  40 million over a period of perhaps seven years would probably yield an eventual profit to the Exchequer. Theproposals should be acceptable to local authorities, who disliked theexisting Town Development Acts and would probably welcome thenew public agencies, which would be required to work in close collaboration with them. While it might be desirable, therefore, to reconsider the phrase &quot; well in advance of needs &quot;, the principle of advance acquisition should be clearly established in the White Paperif the Government were to be seen to be taking effective action to
deal in good time with the many problems which comprehensivedevelopment would involve.(d) The White Paper committed the Government to the viewthat high quality agricultural land should not be taken for urban development wherever there was a practical alternative. In many casesno such alternative might exist; nevertheless, a statement of theGovernments intention to avoid the sterilisation of high qualityagricultural land wherever possible would be of considerable value.There would also be advantage in arranging for agricultural interests to be appropriately represented on the new public agencies.(e) The Study specified certain areas, by name, as possible centres of development. The White Paper, however, did not commit theGovernment to endorsing any of these areas; and this might create an impression of irresolution. On the other hand no decisions couldbe reached until local planning authorities had been fully consulted;and the White Paper should be amended to make this point more clearly.(/) Even so, land values in the localities designated as possibleareas of expansion would be liable to vise sharply as soon as the study was published; and the Government must expect to be pressed to disclose the methods by which they proposed to prevent undesirablespeculation in such instances. If they appeared to be relying for thispurpose merely on public acquisition in the case of expansion schemes,they would be liable to be criticised for taking no corresponding action in relation to other land released for development and forfailing to provide safeguards against speculation in relation to all theland required for the 3-J- million population growth forecast by the study. On the other hand recent experience did not confirm that the designation of land for development necessarily resulted in aconsiderable rise in values; and the amount of land comprised by the study was so large and offered so wide a range of local choice ineach area of development that there would be relatively little scopein practice for speculation on any comprehensive scale. TheGovernment might be reasonably criticised if they took no actionto prevent speculation in cases where they proposed to induce major development by a deliberate initiative of their own; but in caseswhere no more was involved than the release of additional land for development their action could be represented as simply an extensionof current practice, to which there was no alternative except thecomplete nationalisation of all land. It was arguable that, since theGovernments policy on land use was already attracting criticism, theWhite Paper should devote more attention to this topic and should explain, in greater detail than in the present draft, the reasons which led the Government to believe that their proposals were preferable to the measures of nationalisation favoured by the Opposition. come degree of speculation in land was a natural manifestation of a free and prosperous society; and the White Paper should perhapsemphasise that the method of public acquisition which it recommended in the case of expansion schemes was devised not to prevent suchspeculation but to enable the Government to maintain firm controlover the timing of development.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, apartfrom specific points on which amendment of the text had been proposed, the White Paper raised major issues of policy in relationto land use, which required further examination.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the draft White Paper appended to CP.
