CONFIDENTIAL annex the LANGREFORT ONTHE FERRANTICONTRACT(previous reference;CM. (64) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3)CM. (64) 43rd Conclusions, Minute 3Wednesday, 29th July, 1964 at 11. 00 a.m.3.       The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandumby the Minister of Aviation (CP, (64) 157), to which was appendedan interim report by Sir John Lang on certain contracts betweenthe Ministry of Aviation and Ferranti Limited for the productionof equipment connected with the Mark I BLOODHOUND guidedweapon system.The Cabinet first considered the Motion which had been tabled by the Opposition as the basis of a Vote of Censure onthe Government in connection with the Ferranti contracts andwas to be debated on 30th July.   They approved the terms ofan amendment to be tabled by the Government.THE MINISTER OF AVIATION said that he would beexpected to indicate, during the course of this debate, theGovernments attitude towards the criticisms of the Ministryof Aviation&apos;s contracts procedures -which had been expressedin the Lang Report.   The Report found that the department had been at fault in three respects in their supervision of theFerranti contracts.   First, the direct labour costs involvedhad been overestimated.   Second, the overhead rate prescribed by the Departmental accountants had been established without consultation with the technical cost officers on the amount oflabour effort that would be required by the production programme.   Third, the Department had failed to take advantageof successive opportunities, before agreeing price3, toverifyhow far their estimates of direct labour costs were confirmed by actual costs.   A Departmental inquiry had been institutedto ascertain the reasons for the failure of co-ordination withinthe Department which had made these errors possible;  andit would be necessary to consider, in the light of the findings of this inquiry, whether disciplinary action should be taken.Other xnc 3- s tin? g s had also been taken to improve the contractsorganisation within the Department.   The accountants andthe technical cost staffs, whose functions had been deliberatelysegregated by a decision of the Labour Government in 1946,had now been placed under the supervision of a senior officer who would be responsible for ensuring proper co-co-ordination between them.   A review of contracts procedures had been instituted, with special reference to the standard clauses whichwere incorporated in many contracts.   New forms of incentivecontract were under consideration; and the possibility of employing independent expert consultants in connection withthe administration of the more complex contracts was beingThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................................TOP  SECRET //Copy No...l.*f.....CABINET
?0P SMETexamined.   These measures should enable the Governmentto sustain their position during the debate on the OppositionVote of Censure, provided that they made it clear that, if further action was shown to be necessary by the second Reportof the Lang Committee, which was expected later in the year,it would be put in hand without hesitation.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.   Nevertheless, it seemed doubtful whether theadministrative control of the technical staffs engaged in the supervision of increasingly complex technological contractswas adequate.   The first Lang Report conveyed an impression that decisions involving very substantial sums of public moneyhad been taken, for practical purposes, by relatively juniortechnical staffs and that these staffs had been insufficientlyaware of the need to keep the progress of the work under constant review in relation to the original estimates of cost.A project of the size and complexity of the BLOODHOUNDequipment should be placed under the firm control of an individual who would be responsible for its management at all stages and should be technically competent to supervise the fixing of the prices with full knowledge of all the factors involved.   It was   doubtful whether individuals of this calibrecould be recruited at the rates of pay at present in force forthe technical cost staffs of Departments.   The question would need to be considered further when the second Lang Report was available.On the other hand, the Government should not necessarilyassume, during the forthcoming debate, the whole responsibilityfor the outcome of the Ferranti contracts.   As the Lang report made clear, the blame must be shared by the Companythemselves, who had deliberately allowed work to proceed on the basis of prices which they knew would yield them an excessive profit.   Moreover, the contract in question was oneof very few contracts which had proved to cost less than had originally been estimated; and this fact, too, should not be ignored.In further discussion the Cabinet considered theattitude which Government spokesmen in the debate should adopt if the Opposition pressed for an inquiry into thepremature disclosure by the Press, of information about boththe Ferranti contracts and the recent negotiations with theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAG) on the modification of the Corporation^ order for VC. 10 aircraft.Inquiries had established that, in the latter case, the mostcircumstantial account of the incident which had appeared inthe Press contained no elements which could not have been derived from information which had already been published.In the case of the Ferranti contracts, however, certain ofthe facts which had been disclosed by the Press could only have been obtained from the Company themselves.   It wasdisquieting that enterprising journalism could penetratethe Governments confidential business to this extent.-2-JQP SECiS?
Nevertheless, no formal breach of the Official Secrets Actswas involved;  and, since it was reasonably certain that none of the information concerned had been derived from official sources, the Government should firmly resist any proposalfor an inquiry into the incident.The Cabinet -(1)     Invited the Government spokesmenin the fortlacoming debate on theOpposition Vote of Censure onthe Ferranti contracts to be guided by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2)    Agreed that the Government shouldresist any proposal that an inquiry Nshould be instituted into thepremature disclosure by the press of information relating both tothese contracts and to theGovernment&apos;s recent negotiationswith the British Overseas airways corporation about the VC. 10 aircraft.Cabinet Office, 3,1/7.129th July, 1964-3-
