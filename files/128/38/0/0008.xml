The Presidentof the UnitedStates1.

The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inParliament in the following week.TransportLong-term problems ofTraffic inTowns(previous reference:CM. (63) 7thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) suggested thatthe Government must be prepared to answer Parliamentary criticism of their attitude towards the reports by Sir Geoffrey Crowther and professor Buchanan on the problem of traffic in towns. In particular,it would be desirable, in the light of the forthcoming debate on regional development, to explain in greater detail the reasons whythe Government were not convinced of the need to adopt thesuggestion in those reports that some new form of regional development authority would be required to deal with the problemof adapting urban road systems to an increasing volume of traffic.The measures which the Government were adopting in relation tothe reorganisation of local government and the promotion of a more efficient system of land use should be equally effective for thispurpose. But steps should be taken to enable public opinion to seethese and other measures as inter-related elements in theGovernments transport policy as a whole.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to consider the means bywhich the Governments transport policy would most effectively be presented to public opinion, with particular reference to the part to be played by local and regional authorities in dealing with the problem of traffic in towns.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to prepare a memorandumon the issues involved, as a basis for the discussion to bearranged under Conclusion (1) above.Pay ofMembers ofParliament(previous reference:C.C.

(63) 18thConclusions,Minute 1)5. The Lord Privy Seal said that a deputation, comprisingmembers of all parties in the House of Commons, had recentlyrepresented to him the desirability of increasing the remuneration ofMembers of Parliament and had proposed that arrangements for examining this question should be made within the lifetime of thepresent Parliament, even if any increase which might be recommendedwere not implemented until after the General Election.In discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in referring the issues involved to an independent body, such as the
National Incomes Commission, which might establish a prescribedrelationship between the remuneration of Members of parliament and some objective standard and might thus extricate Parliamentfrom the embarrassing dilemma which confronted it wheneverMembers felt compelled to discuss their own salaries. On the otherhand, it was arguable that Parliament would be unwise to relinquishits control over a subject which was peculiarly the concern and theresponsibility of Members. The matter required further consideration before any decision could be reached, particularly as regards theposition of Ministers and members of the House of Lords.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister, would, consider further,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Home Secretary, the Lord Privy Seal,the Leader of the House of Lords and the Chief Whip, the issues involved in determining the Governments policy onthe remuneration of Members of Parliament.Foreign 6.   The Prime Minister said that during his visit to WashingtonAffairs he had briefly discussed the international situation with the newPresident of the United States, President Johnson, and with other foreign Heads of Government who were attending president kennedy&apos;s funeral. He had been assured by President Johnson thatthere would be no change in United States foreign policy and thatthe United States Government would wish to maintain close relationswith the United Kingdom. He proposed to accept President Johnson&apos;invitation to visit Washington again early in the following year for more detailed discussions.The Foreign Secretary said that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in washington had suggested that our forward plans must inevitably bebased on the assumption that United States leadership would now beless positive than hitherto, at least until after the Presidential election in 1964, and that it would therefore be particularly important thatwe should spare no effort to preserve the unity of the WesternAlliance. For this purpose we should seek to establish a closeunderstanding with the new Government of the Federal german republic and to avoid becoming isolated from the rest of Europe.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itmight be desirable to take this opportunity to renew earlier initiativesfor the promotion of closer cultural links between the UnitedKingdom and the Federal German Republic.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to examine the scope for promotingcloser cultural links between the United Kingdom and theFederal German Republic.disclosure of OfficialInformation7. The Prime Minister said that there had been several recentexamples of premature or unauthorised disclosure of official information in the Press. These were discreditable and, on occasion,dangerous. All members of the Government should not onlythemselves maintain a high standard of discretion in any public discussion of the Governments affairs but also ensure that their departmental staffs were no less circumspect.
-rJ (-JRoyalOrdnanceFactoryWoolwichBankEmployees:LegalExpenses ofthe CameronInquiry(previous reference:C.C. (63) 15thConclusions,Minute 6)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (63) 22) about the payment of the legalexpenses of the organisations of bank employees which had appeared before Lord Cameron in the course of his inquiry into staff relations in banks.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for this question tobe initially examined by the Home Affairs Committee.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for War (CP. (63) 24), proposing that the royal ordnance Factory, Woolwich, should be closed.The Secretary of State for War said that a review of the weapons and Fighting Vehicles Group of the Royal Ordnance Factories haddisclosed a considerable excess of productive capacity. Either of the factories at Nottingham and Woolwich could satisfy all foreseeablerequirements in this respect, with sufficient capacity in reserve tomeet the probable demand in any war now envisaged.Notwithstanding the long history and great prestige of the Woolwichfactory, the balance of economic advantage clearly lay in retaining the factory at Nottingham and inclosing the Woolwich establishmentby about the middle of 1966. Interested Members of Parliament andthe staff associations and trade unions, who were aware that a reviewhad taken place, were pressing for a decision; and it would bedesirable to make an announcement early in December, particularly since it would in any event become&apos; necessary by then to announce that some redundancy would occur early in 1964. The announcement should also comprise, if possible, a statement of the measures,currently under examination, for the resettlement of the 3,000 menwho would eventually be rendered redundant by the closure of thefactory.In discussion there was general agreement that the royal ordnance Factory, Woolwich, should be closed. The announcementof this decision should seek to explain clearly the justification for it,particularly the advantages to be derived from the more efficientdeployment of scarce skilled labour and from the use of the site for housing and, possibly, for the provision of a new power station. Ifdecisions on the resettlement of redundant labour and the alternativeuse of the site could not be reached in the very near future, there might be some advantage in deferring an announcement until after christmas; but it would be preferable that, if possible, it should bemade early in December. The future of the site was to be considered further by the Home Affairs Committee on the following day; andthe Committee should endeavour to expedite the decision.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposal to close the royal ordnance Factory, Woolwich, in 1966.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to consider, as a matter of urgency, the formof the announcement of this decision and to ascertain, inparticular, whether it could include an indication of theGovernments proposals on the redeployment ofredundant labour and the future use of the site.(3) Subject to the results of the enquiries to be instituted under conclusion (2) above, authorised the Secretary of Statefor War to announce at an early date the governments intentions as regards the factory.
NationalBuildingAgencyCensus ot 11.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePopulation      Secretary  of  State for  Scotland  and  the Minister  of Health(CP. (63) 23) about a proposal to take a limited census of thepopulation in 1966.The Minister of Health said that for a number of planning purposes the information obtained from a decennial census wasinsufficiently accurate in the second half of the decade. It was10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Public Building and Works (CP. (63) 21), to which was appended a draft White Paper proposing the establishment of aNational Building Agency.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that, if theGovernment were to achieve their objective of increasing the outputof the building industries by more than 50 per cent in the next decade without any great increase in the demand on the country&apos;slimited labour resources, it would be essential to encourage, by every possible means, a more intensive application of industrial methods to the processes of construction. The proposed Agency would contribute to this end by collating the building requirements of both public and private customers in phased programmes which would facilitate the employment of modern methods of building, by placingat the disposal of the public expert and co-ordinated information about industrialised methods of building and by assisting in trainingmembers of the construction industries and the related professions inthe use of those methods. In form, the Agency would be a company,limited by guarantee; and its expenditure would initially be of theorder of  250,000, eventually rising to perhaps  500,000. In due course the Agency would be expected to obtain part of its income from feescharged for the services which it would provide; but some measureof continuing subsidy from the Exchequer would probably benecessary. Extensive informal consultations with leadingrepresentatives of the building industries, the architectural professionand local government had revealed a wide measure of support for aventure of this kind.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.If the White Paper was to be published in the near future on thebasis of the informal discussions which had already taken place, itwould be important, in order to preserve the goodwill of the interests concerned, that its publication should be followed as closely aspossible by the more formal consultations which would be a necessaryprelude to the establishment of the Agency and the appointment ofits Board and Managing Director. Scottish interests should beinformed of the Governmenfs intentions before the White Paper was published and should be represented in the subsequent consultations.Further consideration might be given to the title of the Agency inorder to indicate more clearly the purposes which it was intended toserve.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (63) 21 and authorised theMinister of Public Building and Works to publish theWhite Paper on the National Building Agency in the nearfuture.(2) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister without Portfolio(Mr. Deedes), to give further consideration, in the light oftheir discussion and of any suggestions which he might receive from members of the Cabinet, to the title of the agency.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th November, 1963.accordingly proposed to take, in 1966, a 10 per cent sample census,supplemented by a full enumeration in six small and thinly populated areas in Scotland and, possibly, in a small number of selected areasin England and Wales. The cost would be  1 million, compared with 4 million for a full census. A 10 per cent sample census was sufficiently accurate for many purposes of central planning; and theHome Affairs Committee, which had considered the alternative of undertaking a full census in mid-decade, had concluded that theadditional cost could not be justified. It would be necessary to announce the Governments intentions before Christmas, in orderthat consultations with the local authorities could be put in hand;and it would.also be desirable to undertake a limited pre-test early in1964, in order to obtain from a few thousand householdersinformation required to ensure the reliability of the samplingprocedures. The list of questions which individuals completing the census forms would be required to answer would be further considered by the Home Affairs Committee in due course. It wouldnot be necessary to seek Parliamentary authority for the census untillate in 1964 or even the beginning of 1965.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a census based on a 10 per cent sample of population should be taken in 1966.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health to arrange for the Governments intentions tobe announced in Parliament before the Christmas recess and for the work of preparing the census to be put in hand.
