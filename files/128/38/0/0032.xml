Foreign Affairs 2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that in theCambodia course of recent riots in Phnom Penh Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy had(Previous been damaged. We had addressed an appropriate protest to the reference: Government of Cambodia. The incident provided fresh evidence of cm. (63) 13th Cambodian dissatisfaction with the attitude of the Western PowersConclusions, towards the proposal that the neutrality of the country should minute 3)       bg internationally guaranteed.Libya The Foreign Secretary said that the Libyan Government had invited us to review the Anglo-Libyan Treaty, which was not due to expire until 1973. In view of the importance of our military bases in libya, this was an unwelcome proposal; and we should have toconsider its implications carefully.Cyprus The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Government(Previous had now agreed to contribute $2 million towards the cost of the reference: ^ proposed international force in Cyprus; and we ourselves had. (64) 17th undertaken to provide a further $1 million. Additional contributionsConclusions, would probably be provided by other countries; and it should then beMmute l) possible to ensure that an international peace-keeping operationcould be sustained in the Island for a period of three months.In discussion there was general agreement that it was becomingvery urgent to establish the proposed force in Cyprus. In their efforts to maintain order our troops were encountering increasing resistanceand obstruction by the Greek Cypriot community; and their positionwould rapidly become intolerable unless they could transfer their responsibilities to an international force in the very near future.Meanwhile, the Commander, British Forces, Cyprus, althoughreluctant to increase tension in the Island still further by evacuatingthe families and dependants of British Service personnel, had beengiven full discretion to take this step at whatever moment he judgedit necessary to do so.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary andof the points made in discussion.East Africa 3.   The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet of the(Previous        results of his recent visit to Kenya, Uganda, Tanganyika and reference:      Zanzibar. He had found the Government of Kenya anxious toCM. (64) 10th strengthen their armed forces and to improve their arrangements for conclusions,    maintaining internal security. As a result he had reached broadMinute 2)       agreement with them that we would establish a training mission in kenya in order to advise and assist the Kenya Army, that we would co-operate in the training of the Kenya Air Force and that we would consider the possibility of transferring certain items of equipment and accommodation to the Kenya forces. In return the Government of kenya would be prepared to grant staging and overflying rights toour military aircraft and to provide facilities at Mombasa for ships of the Royal Navy. They had also agreed that British units might visitKenya at intervals for military training and exercises. This agreement would now need to be elaborated in detailed discussions with theGovernment of Kenya. In addition we should have to consider what further assistance we might have to provide for the European farmers in the territory, who were becoming increasingly discouraged in the face of the persistent encroachment by Africans on their farms.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The Government of Uganda had been anxious to take part in theair training project to be established in Kenya; and they were also prepared to accept a small British military training mission in Uganda.The situation in Tanganyika had been less satisfactory. It was doubtfulwhether President Nyerere now had either the will or the ability tocontrol developments; and it was significant that the Government of tanganyika were apparently unwilling to accept any assistance withthe training of their armed forces. The British troops who had beensent to Uganda and Tanganyika to assist the Governments in restoring order after the recent mutinies were no longer required andwould be withdrawn from both territories in the near future.The position in Zanzibar remained very confused. AlthoughPresident Karume commanded a greater degree of popular supportthan any other local leader, his position was precarious and a newattempt to overthrow his regime might develop at any moment. Inthese circumstances the Governments of the three mainland african territories had been informed that, if further disturbances broke outin Zanzibar and they were disposed to appeal to us for help in restoring order, we should be prepared to consider such a request.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the commonwealth secretary.4. The Prime Minister said that in the course of his recent visit to Northern Ireland he had been impressed by the importance ofmaintaining production at Messrs. Shorts&apos; factory; and the cabinet should therefore give further consideration to the possibility that the outstanding contract for light helicopters for the Army should beplaced with this firm.The Minister of Defence said that the two helicopters which were under consideration in this context, the Bell and the Hiller, were of equal operational capability, although the Hiller had the marginaladvantage of being already in service with the Royal Navy. On theother hand Messrs. Shorts, who would manufacture the Hiller, hadinitially submitted a tender which was some 20 per cent higher thanthe tender submitted by the Westland company in respect of the Bell;and a revised tender, which they had subsequently submitted at a figure slightly more favourable than the tender by Westlands, waspresumably prompted by knowledge of that tender and was receivedafter the original closure date. In these circumstances it was forconsideration whether the Government could properly accept the revised tender of Messrs. Shorts.In discussion it was suggested that there were several arguments in favour of accepting the Westland tender. The company had greaterexperience of helicopter manufacture than Messrs. Shorts; and theGovernment^ policy for reorganisation of the aircraft industry hadbeen based on an assumption that the manufacture of helicopterswould be concentrated at their works. A substantial, amount of sub-contract work had already been placed with Messrs. Shorts; and therecent decision to authorise them to complete development and initialproduction of the Skyvan civil freighter aircraft was an additionalearnest of the Governments desire to maintain employment at theirfactory as far as possible. Moreover, they had been able to reduce their original tender only by drawing on the grant of  10 million which they had recently received from the Government; and it couldbe argued that it would be improper to acquiesce in an arrangement which would in effect subsidise the company, at the expense of the taxpayer, in competition with a private firm. If, despite these considerations, it were still suggested that the tender of the Westland
agricultural policy(previous reference:CM. (64) 17thConclusions,Minute 4)Farm PriceReview5. The Minister of Agriculture said that, although the Farmers&apos;Unions were still seeking an increase of  34J million in the price guarantees and production grants covered by the Farm Price Review,he hoped to be able to reach agreement with them on the basis of changes involving a total increase of about  31^ million.  24 million of this sum would be attributable to a proposed increase of 2+d. a gallon in the price of milk. This increase, although substantial, wouldnot provide any greater return to the producer than he had receivedsix years before; and his costs had risen considerably in the interval.Moreover, there had been a considerable reduction in the size of the dairy herd during the last year; and the increase in production whichwould probably result from the increase in price was not likely to exceed the requirements of the market. The cost, which would be met by the consumer, would be reflected in an increase in the retail priceof milk from 8^d. to 9d. a pint from 1st April.The most important of the remaining increases were related to price adjustments for pigs and fat cattle. Agreement had been reached on standard quantities for cereals and on revised arrangements forthe marketing of fat stock, which would reinforce the incentive to farmers to vary their sales according to the strength of the market and would therefore reduce the cost to the Exchequer of the guaranteed price.The total cost to the Exchequer of the price guarantees and production grants had fallen from  343 million in 1961-62 to 301 million in the current financial year; and the present proposalsv/ere estimated to increase the Exchequer^ liability by no more than 7 million.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The total increase proposed was considerably greater than had been envisaged at the outset of the review. Moreover, it would represent an increase of some 1\ per cent in farmers&apos; incomes and cm. 18 (64)company should be rejected, the firm should first be given theopportunity to submit a revised tender in competition with the revisedtender submitted by Messrs. Shorts.On the other hand it was of considerable importance to maintainemployment in Northern Ireland. It could also be argued that someof the less satisfactory aspects of the Westland company&apos;s productionreflected a certain complacency on the part of the firm, which mightbe eliminated if they were exposed to the competition of a rivalundertaking in the field of helicopter production.In further discussion it was agreed that the additional employment which would be provided by the helicopter order inquestion would be marginal in relation to the total numbers already employed by both Messrs. Shorts and the Westland company andthat in these circumstances the arguments of principle againstentrusting the order to Messrs. Shorts should prevail.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the outstanding order for Army helicoptersshould be placed with the Westland company.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Aviation, inconsultation with other Ministers concerned, to advise thePrime Minister whether there were other means by whichthe Government could ensure the maintenance ofproduction and employment at Messrs. Shorts&apos; factory inNorthern Ireland.
would therefore be seen to be closely in line with the proposals whichhad been put forward by the Farmers&apos; Unions themselves for the first year of a three-year period in which they considered that incomes should rise. Those proposals had been widely criticised as excessive;and the present review might therefore be interpreted as indicating that the Government were in fact proposing to surrender to the farmers&apos; demands. It would be essential to make it clear that farm prices were reviewed annually and that the increase granted this yearcarried no implications as regards subsequent years.(b) The increase in the price of milk, which would then be higher in the United Kingdom than in any other European country, mightbe embarrassing in relation to the Governmenfs efforts to promoteprice stability in industry and would be liable to be strongly criticised by the consumer. It would be important to justify this increase by reference to the course of milk prices and dairy costs over the previous10 years and to demonstrate that prices of United Kingdom foodstuffsas a whole were still well below the general European level.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that, in order to secure a settlement whichwould be accepted by the Farmers&apos; Unions, the Minister ofAgriculture should offer a total increase in the price guarantees and production grants of about  31^ million in accordance with theproposals outlined in the discussion. But, if agreement could not bereached on this basis, the matter should be further considered by theCabinet.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to seek to reach agreement with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of the adjustments in the price guarantees and production grants which he had described.(2) Agreed that, if a settlement could not be reached on this basis,the issues involved should be considered further.Food Aid The Minister of Agriculture said that he had it in mind to include in the White Paper on the Farm Price Review a short passageindicating that the Government welcomed the initial programme offood aid projects which had been undertaken by the World FoodPrggramme authorities and would sympathetically considerparticipating in an extension of this programme. Such a statement would be in accordance with the Governments agreed policy; andthere would be a presentational advantage in including it in the white paper.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a statement of thiskind would be inappropriate in a White Paper dealing with domesticagriculture, since it might encourage United Kingdom farmers topress for a deliberate expansion of production in order to increasethe surpluses available for disposal to developing countries. although we were prepared to continue to take part in the World food programme, it would not be in our interests to acquiesce in an uneconomic expansion of production ostensibly for the relief ofhunger in the developing countries overseas but in reality for thebenefit of our own farmers.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that no reference should be made to the World food programme in the White Paper on the Annual Farm price review.
CM. 18 (64)Trade Unions 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerand the Law   of Labour (CP. (64) 68), to which were appended, at Annex A, the(Previous        draft of a public statement on trade unions and the law and, at^tffre^: , Annex B, the draft of a supplementary statement on trade unionCM (64) 17th practice.Conclusions,Minute 2)The Minister of Labour said that, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;searlier discussion, the statement at Annex A had been drafted on theassumption that the formal enquiry which the Government had itin mind to promote would be confined to issues arising from thestate of the law in relation to trade unions and that the problem of restrictive practices adopted by the unions would be examined by amore informal procedure, e.g., discussion in the National economic development Council. The draft statement was therefore confined toindicating that, in the Governments opinion, the law in relation totrade unions should be reviewed in an atmosphere free from political controversy and that the Government would therefore discuss withthe Trades Union Congress and the British Employers Confederation,at the appropriate time, the scope of an enquiry which might beestablished for this purpose and the methods by which it might best be conducted. But the statement also included a paragraphemphasising that, since the law on this subject was last reviewed, full employment and improved social services had transformed society,while new industrial methods and the approach of automation threwout fresh challenges for the future. Since this paragraph might bethought to imply that the proposed enquiry would embrace restrictive practices as well as issues of law, it might be better omitted.In discussion considerable support was expressed for theseproposals. Many of the Governments supporters were anxious thatthe law relating to trade unions should be comprehensively reviewed;and a considerable body of opinion in the trade union movement itself was known to be privately in sympathy with this attitude. TheGovernment could therefore afford to accept the risk that their proposal might be misrepresented as an attempt to undermine theindustrial power of the unions. At the same time, even if the public statement were confined to the question of trade unions and the law,the Government would at once be asked whether they intended topromote any corresponding enquiry into the restrictive practices ofthe unions; and it would be the more important to be prepared togive a clear answer to such enquiries in that the law relating to tradeunions had a direct bearing on certain types of restrictive practices and an enquiry into the state of the law could hardly avoid dealingwith such practices to some extent. For this reason, while it would be wise to omit from the statement the supplementary passage in annex B dealing specifically with restrictive practices, it would be appropriate to retain the reference to the challenges presented by new industrial methods and the approach of automation; and it wouldalso be desirable to be prepared to give a clear and authoritativedescription of the scope of an enquiry to be conducted on this basis.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to reconsider, in the light of their discussion, the draft public statement on trade unions and the law at Annex A to CP. (64) 68 and to circulate a fresh draft of this statement, together with a definition of the scope of an enquiry to be conducted on this basis.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meetingon the basis of the fresh draft of the public statement tobe circulated in accordance with Conclusion (1) above.
Government 7.   The   Cabinet   had   before   them   memoranda   by   the offices Postmaster-General (CP. (64) 66) and the Secretary of State for(Previous       Scotland (CP. (64) 69) about the removal of the Post Office SavingsReference:       Bank from London.CC (63) 44thConclusions, The Postmaster-General said that only about 1,000 of the Bank&apos;sMinute 6) &apos;    present staff would probably be moved from London and the balanceRemoval of the of some 6,000 would have to be locally recruited from the area to post Office     which the Bank was transferred. Glasgow, Liverpool and Tees-sideSavings Bank   appeared to offer the most suitable sites. All three had high levelsfrom London   of unemployment, were in need of clerical employment and couldmeet the Bank&apos;s requirements of staff. Glasgow was the leastacceptable to the staff who would have to move, primarily becausehousing was only available at some distance from the proposed sitefor the Bank. Moreover, only 5 per cent of the Bank&apos;s total businessrelated to Scotland. Housing was not available in Liverpool on suchfavourable terms as on Tees-side; but Liverpool had a higher levelof clerical unemployment. The junior staff concerned had expressed a preference for Tees-side.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that since the war central scotland had had a consistently higher rate of unemployment than any other comparable region in the country. The emigration of young people, which was much higher than from the North-East, was a particularly serious feature of the situation and was largelyattributable, especially in the Glasgow area, to a lack of opportunities for the large numbers of school leavers, who would be well suited towork in the Savings Bank. Glasgow also had rather easier and more rapid communications with London than Tees-side. Both the North-East and the North-West of England had benefited from theprogramme of dispersal of Government offices; but this programme had not so far been of any advantage to Scotland. It was important that the Government should give a lead in this respect, since otherwise industry would not be persuaded of the sincerity of theirregional policies; and, if the Savings Bank were not moved to Glasgow, Scottish opinion would regard this as proof that theGovernment were not in earnest as regards the development ofScotland.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The success of the programme of dispersal of government offices from London depended to a considerable extent on retaining the co-operation and goodwill of the staffs concerned. In the present instance there seemed little to choose between the three areasinvolved; and it might therefore be wise to give full weight to the factthat the staff had expressed a preference for Tees-side.(b) It could be argued in favour of choosing Liverpool that theexisting level of unemployment on Merseyside was broadlyequivalent to the level in central Scotland and was higher than onTees-side. Local opinion in the North-West was concerned at the apparent preference given to Scotland and the North-East in theGovernments regional development policies.(c) On the other hand juvenile unemployment on Tees-side wasproportionately higher than in either of the other two areas; and, interms of reinforcing the other measures which the Government hadalready taken to promote development in the respective regions, a transfer of the Bank to Tees-side might yield a greater dividend thanits removal to either Glasgow or the North-West.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to give further consideration to the issues involved before taking a final decision on this difficult question.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (64) 66 and 69 ata subsequent meeting.
Compensationfear Victims of crimes of violence(previous reference:C.C. (63) 60thConclusions,Minute 6)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (64) 64), to which was appended the draft of a white paper on compensation for victims of crimes of violence.The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had decided on15th October, 1963, that arrangements for the payment ofcompensation to victims of crimes of violence should be introduced in the form of a non-statutory ex gratia scheme and that theGovernment should announce in due course the principles of thescheme and the arrangements for its administration. The draft white paper, which had been approved by the Home Affairs Committee,proposed the establishment of a Victims of Crimes of ViolenceCompensation Board, composed of independent persons with legalexperience, who would award compensation on the basis of common law damages, subject to modifications designed to set reasonable limits to the amount of the awards. Decisions would be taken initiallyby one member of the Board after an examination of claims by theBoard&apos;s staff with the help of reports from the police; but, if theapplicant was dissatisfied with the decision, he would be allowed a judicial hearing by three other members of the Board, who would determine the application in the light of evidence brought at the hearing. If a scheme on these lines was approved by Parliament, itcould be introduced experimentally without legislation. It was proposed, therefore, that a debate should be arranged shortly afterthe publication of the White Paper; and any useful suggestions which emerged could be embodied in a revised White Paper, which would constitute guidance of the Board.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It might be desirable to state publicly that the Board wouldhave an office in Scotland, where applications would have to beconsidered against the background of a different system of law. If so,an office might need to be established in Wales as well. Paragraph 11of the White Paper should therefore refer to the possibility that officesmight be established outside London, where need arose.(b) The payment of compensation ought not to duplicate other payments from public funds, whether in the form of social benefitsor in the form of pensions payable to public servants. But, while itmight be right that payments directly related to the injury should notbe so duplicated, it was not equally clear that preferential retirement pensions to which police officers were entitled in recognition of thespecial risks of their employment should be taken into account in calculating compensation awarded for a particular injury. This pointrequired further examination.(c) The White Paper would preferably be published before easter. In view of Parliamentary interest in the subject, anannouncement should be made in both Houses of Parliament that itwould be published shortly.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to consider further, inconsultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the relationship of public service pensions to awards ofcompensation under the scheme described in CP. (64) 64and to report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.(2) Invited Ministers who wished to propose drafting amendments to the White Paper appended to CP. (64) 64to inform the Home Secretary as rapidly as possible.(3) Subject to any amendments proposed under Conclusion (2)above and to any further action required in the light of conclusion (1) above, invited the Home Secretary toarrange for the publication of the White Paper before the easter recess and to make an early announcement to this effect.
m10 SECRETRoyal 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeCommission on Secretary (CP. (64) 67) on the appointment of a Royal Commission*e Treatment  on the treatment of offenders,of OffendersThe Home Secretary said that penal principles and practice had last been examined comprehensively by the Gladstone Commissionon Prisons, which reported in 1895. The White Paper on PenalPractice in a Changing Society, published in 1959, had foreshadoweda fundamental re-examination of penal policy on the basis of theknowledge to be gained from research about the causes of crime andthe effectiveness of present methods of treatment; and, in view of ,the continuing increase in crime and the widespread doubt about theappropriateness of existing methods of dealing with offenders,particularly young offenders, it seemed desirable to institute this %re-examination without further delay. It was accordingly proposedthat a Royal Commission should be appointed to examine both theconcepts and purposes which should underlie the punishment and treatment of offenders and the existing methods of treatment availableto the courts and to review the work of the services providingtreatment and the responsibility for their administration. The HomeAffairs Committee, in agreeing in principle to the appointment of a royal Commission, had suggested that it would be helpful to publish,simultaneously with the announcement of the decision, a White paper explaining the background of the inquiry and the reasons why it was thought necessary to undertake it. The draft of a White Paper for thispurpose was appended to CP. (64) 67.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The Governmenfs supporters might not readily understand why the Government regarded it as urgent to announce theappointment of a Royal Commission on the treatment of offendersbut were apparently not prepared to take similar action in relationto the trade unions or to go further, in this respect, than indicating that they would consider instituting, at the appropriate time, some form of enquiry into the state of the law concerning the unions. It &apos;was for consideration whether, for this reason, the appointment ofthe proposed Royal Commission on the treatment of offendersshould be deferred for a time. On the other hand the appointment of sthe Commission would be welcomed by those most closely concernedwith the problems of crime and of the treatment of offenders; and,in view of the pending publication of the report of a Committee onPenal Policy established by the Labour Party under the chairmanship of Lord Longford, it was desirable that the Government should beseen to take an early initiative.(b) It was doubtful whether it would be appropriate that theterms of reference should require the Commission to re-examine theconcepts and purposes which should underlie the punishment and treatment of offenders, since these were now well understood and generally accepted. Such a re-examination might be valuable,however, in relation to the treatment of young offenders, in view ofthe decreasing rate of success in the approved schools and of thesuggestion in the report of the Central Advisory Council for education on children of average or less than average ability (theNewsom Report) that consideration should be given to theappropriateness of the goals which were sought for young people inthis category.(c) It was desirable that the Commission should consider notonly the treatment of offenders but also the factors which fosteredand inhibited crime. To direct them explicitly to examine these,however, might lead them into unnecessarily extensive and prolongedinvestigations; and it would be sufficient for them to take account, inaccordance with the proposed terms of reference, of modernknowledge on the subject.(d) The content of the White Paper might with advantage bemore closely related to the concept of &quot; the war on crime &quot;, although
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th March, 1964.the use of that phrase in the title might be reconsidered. A good dealof the material on the administration of justice, for example, mightnot appear to the public to be of immediate relevance to theprevention of crime; and there might be some embarrassment in providing details of measures relating to England and Wales whichcould not, within the compass of the White Paper, be reasonablyaccompanied by a similar recital in relation to Scotland. On the otherhand the White Paper might well take more credit for the programmeof prison building; and greater prominence should be given to thereasons which had led the Government to the conclusion that thetime had come to institute a comprehensive review of the problemsof crime and of the treatment of offenders. In the revision of the draftcare should be taken to ensure that the concept of treatment was notemphasised to the exclusion of that of punishment.(e) The White Paper should, if possible, be published before easter; and further consideration should be given to the timing of its publication in relation to the publication of the White Paper on compensation for victims of crimes of violence.The Lord President, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that it would be desirable to appoint a RoyalCommission with terms of reference on the lines of those proposed in annex A to CP. (64) 67. The draft White Paper should be considered further by the Ministers principally concerned in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion and of any amendments which Ministers wishedto propose. The timing of its publication should be discussed with theLord Privy Seal and the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes).The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be desirable that a Royal Commissionon the treatment of offenders should be appointed, withterms of reference on the lines indicated in Annex A to cp. (64) 67.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to give further consideration, inthe light of their discussion and in consultation with theMinisters principally concerned, to the draft White Paperappended to CP. (64) 67 and to circulate a revised draft frr consideration at a subsequent meeting.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to consider the timing of thepublication of the White Paper in consultation with theLord Privy Seal, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) and to report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.
