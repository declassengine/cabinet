(64) 19th Conclusions, Minute 11Tuesday. 17th March. 1964.-   at  11.00 a.m.THE MINISTER OF POWER said that the unions in theelectricity supply industry had decided to introduce working to rule and a ban on overtime with effect from Monday, 23rd March.   Althoughthe industry had a reasonable reserve of capacity, a serious shortageof power might develop.    1  it became necessary to proclaim a stateof emergency, Parliament would have to be recalled within five days from the issue of the Proclamation and the Easter Recess might haveto be adjusted for this purpose.In discussion the following main points were made(a) So long as the action contemplated by the unions did notdevelop into a strike, it would not be necessary or, indeed, properto employ troops to operate the power stations.(b) The dispute might lead to a demand that the Minister of labour should appoint a conciliator.    This Would not be appropriate in a case where the resistance of the management to demands for increased wages was in line with the Governments policy.The Cabinet -(l)    Took note of the statement by the Ministerof Power.(2)    Invited the Home Secretary, as Chairman ofthe Ministerial Committee on Emergencies, toarrange for the Committee to keep the situation under close review.Cabinet Office, S, W. 1.17th March, 1964
