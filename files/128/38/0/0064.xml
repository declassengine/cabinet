21Copy No.CAEINETCONFIDENTIAL. annex cm. (64) 13th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday, 20th February, 1964 at 10. 30 a. m.POSTMSN&apos;S PAY(previous reference:CM. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 6)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster General (C. F. (64) 54) on the pay claim for postmen,.THE POSTMASTER GENERAL said that, in accordancewith the Cabinefs earlier decision (CM. (64) 11th Conclusions,Minute 6), he had offered the Union of Post Office Workers athree year pay agreement, involving an increase of 4 per centin the first year with an increase of 3f per cent in each of thenext two years.     The Union had rejected this offer and had indicated mat they would only accept a settlement based on anincrease of 5 per cent in the first year.     This would involve,for all those grades represented by the Union who were not covered by the central settlement for the non-industrial civilservice, an average increase of 4-g- per cent in the first yearand Z% per cent over the whole three year period.     This mightbe regarded as not wholly incompatible with the Government^incomes policy, particularly since, if the Union&apos;s claim werenot met, they might resort to industrial action and would be liable to have public sympathy on their side.In discussion there was general agreement that anincrease of 5 per cent in the first year should not be conceded.It was for consideration whether an increase of 4jr per centshould be offered, on the grounds that, even if it were refused.,it would demonstrate the Governments willingness to meet theUnion half way.    On the other hand, postmen&apos;s existing wagehad been fixed by arbitration as late as 1963, after taking intoaccount a survey by the Pay Research Unit of comparable out-side employment;   and an increase of 4 per cent on the figurethen established would compare reasonably with the subsequentincrease in wages both within the Civil Service and in outsideemployment.    Moreover, an offer of 4jr per cent, no less than an offer of 5 per cent, would constitute a breach of theGovernments incomes policy;  and, in so far as it approachednearer to the Union&apos;s demand than the Governments originaloffer of 4 per cent, it might be more difficult to sustain againsifurther pressure than the fully defensible offer of 4 per cent.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................TOfP  SEGRET
If the Union were unable to accept this offer, they should beprepared to take the issue to arbitration;  and the fact thatthey had hitherto refused to do so constituted no reason whythe Government should seek to compromise with them at theexpense of the incomes policy.The Cabinet -Agreed that the offer of a three year pay-agreement to the Union of Post office workers should continue to be based, asregards postmen and postmen highergrade, on an increase not exceeding4 per cent in the first year.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1.20th February,  1964
