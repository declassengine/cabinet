SubjectMonopolies, Restrictive Practices and Resale Price Maintenance
Monopolies,restrictive practices andResale price maintenance(previous reference:CM. (64) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)MonopoliesThe transfer of the initiative from the Government to theCommission would be liable to alarm industry; and the proposal should not, therefore, be mentioned in the statement. It wouldalso be desirable to avoid any specific definition of the additional powers which it was proposed to take in order to implement theCommission^ recommendations. The problems involved in breaking up large and established monopolies were formidable and requiredSECRET4148-4 a 2The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 13) on resale price maintenance and by the Secretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 11)on monopolies, restrictive practices and resale price maintenance.They also had before them a draft Parliamentary statement on these subjects, which had been prepared in the light of the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion.The Secretary of State for Industry said that, although the detailsof the Government&apos;s proposals could be elaborated later in a white paper, the initial statement of policy should indicate the broad lines on which the Government proposed to deal with the whole complex of interrelated issues. He suggested that:(i) The Monopolies Commission should be enlarged and shouldbe empowered to work in groups in order that it might dispose ofcases more rapidly; its procedure should be improved in order tosatisfy the criticism that industries were not sufficiently informed ofthe case which they were required to meet; and the initiative ininvestigating cases of alleged monopoly should be transferred fromthe Government to the Commission itself.(ii) More effective powers should be taken to act on the findings of the Monopolies Commission, including power in extreme cases to compel firms to divest interests and even to require them to breakup a monopoly.(iii) The Monopolies Commission should be empowered to investigate the minority of mergers which were likely to result ina significant reduction of competition in a substantial market. Thecompletion of a merger should not be deferred pending investigation;but the Government should be empowered to annul a merger which,in the light of the Commission&apos;s report, appeared to be contrary tothe public interest.(iv) The Restrictive Trade Practices Act should be amended inorder to enable information agreements to be investigated and certain other deficiencies to be remedied.(v) Power should be taken to refer to the monopolies commission monopolies, mergers or restrictive practices in the field of services.As regards resale price maintenance he had concluded, in thelight of the Cabinefs earlier discussion, that, in the context of ageneral prohibition of the practice, it would be possible to providefor the exemption of particular industries if they could satisfy a judicial tribunal that in their case the practice would not operate against the public interest. In order to avoid delay, however, theprohibition should be applied to all industries which did not seekexemption within a limited period; and applications for exemptionshould be referred to the tribunal in groups and in the order specified by the Board of Trade. The tribunals procedure could be modelledon that of the Restrictive Practices Court, in which the interest ofthe public was represented by counsel nominated by the Attorney-General and instructed by the Registrar of the Court.In discussion the following main points were made:
further study in the light of the experience of other countries whichhad apparently adopted similar measures to restrict the growth of monopoly.MergersIn view of the public disquiet at the inability of the Governmentto prevent mergers which appeared likely to be contrary to thepublic interest, it was no longer sufficient to rely on the power to investigate any monopoly which might result from a merger. Onthe other hand there were considerable objections both to requiringfirms contemplating merger to obtain prior consent (since this wouldbe liable to delay useful developments and to lead to undesirablespeculation) and to attempting to undo a merger after it had beencompleted. If effective means of breaking up harmful monopoliescould be devised, however, their existence might suffice to causefirms proposing a merger to consult the Government voluntarilybeforehand and to deter them from proceeding against the government&apos;s wishes. At that stage, however, it would be difficult for the Government to apply any criterion save that of size, since there would be no means of knowing whether the proposedaggregation of economic power would be abused; and it would therefore be necessary to give further consideration to the questionof the means by which the Government could best form a view on the desirability of a merger. For the purposes of the forthcomingstatement, however, it would be sufficient to refer to the effect whichthe new powers that the Government proposed to take in order to implement the recommendations of the Monopolies commission might be expected to have in deterring undesirable mergers.service as regards services there was general agreement that power should be taken to refer monopolies and restrictive practices to the monopolies Commission only in the field of commercial andindustrial services, excluding the professions. It was not intendedto exercise this power in respect of shipping; and it might also be wise to draft the proposed statement in terms which created no suggestion that trade union practices would be within the scopeof the new legislation.Resale Price MaintenanceThere was general agreement that resale price maintenanceshould be made illegal, subject to a provision that claims for exemption should be considered by a judicial tribunal. The detailsof the proposal would require further examination, particularly thequestion whether criminal or civil sanctions should be applied. Thepreparation of the necessary legislation should be put in handimmediately, with a view to the introduction of a Bill in the present session.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the current session to make resale price maintenance illegal, subjectto the provision of a right to apply to a judicial tribunal for exemption.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to consider urgently, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor andthe Attorney-General, the legislative provisions necessaryto give effect to the decision at Conclusion (1) above.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Industry, the Minister of Defence,the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of Health toprepare, in the light of their discussion, a revised
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th January, 1964.draft statement of Government policy on monopolies,mergers, restrictive practices and resale price maintenance, to be made in Parliament that day.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion and inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, to themeasures to be taken to strengthen the monopolies commission and to augment the Governments powersto implement the Commission^ recommendations; andto circulate in the near future a draft White Paper onthese subjects.
