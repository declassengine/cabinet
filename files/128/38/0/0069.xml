Copy No...(Jr.CABINETPCSTMEN&apos;S PAY(previous reference:CM.(64) 23rdConclusions,Mimute 2)CONFIDENTIAL annex cm. (64) 39th Conclusions, Minute 5Friday, 17th July, 1964 at 10. 30 a.m.5.       The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster General (C P. (64) 139) on postmen&apos;s pay.THE POSTMASTER GENERAL said that at a recent meeting with the Union of Post Office Y/orkers (U. P. W.) hehad reiterated the Governments offer of an increase of pay of 4 per cent, back-dated to 1st January, 1964, together witha similar back-dating for whatever further increase rnigh^result from a review by the Pay Research Unit (P.R.U,) jon the basis of the Report of the Committee on the Pay ofPostmen.   In reply the Union had made it clear that nothingless than an increase of lO-j? per cent, together with any amount recommended by a P.R. U. enquiry, would be acceptable.Despite their previous agreement to accept arbitration if thedispute could not be settled by negotiation, they had indicated that they were no longer prepared to do so.   The Union had arranged a one-day strike on the previous day and were continuing to impose a ban on overtime.   It would now benecessary, therefore, to impose restrictions on parcels andcertain types of mail and to appeal for restraint on the partof the public in sending mail over the next few days, in orderthat the current accumulation might be cleared.   On this basis the Post Office might hope to maintain a reasonable service for fully paid letters.   There appeared to be no immediatemeans of resolving the deadlock with the Union;  but thepassage of time might bring them to adopt a more conciliatory attitude, when arbitration might be less repugnant to them.It might then be advisable for the Government to offer a small increase on their present offer of 4 per cent.   But no margin of improvement would be likely to be acceptable to the Unionat present.In discussion the following main points were made:(a)  It had been alleged by the Union that the Governmentsoffer of a P.R. U. review would result in considerable delay,amounting to perhaps six months.   In fact such a review couldbe completed in about six weeks; and this fact might be publicly emphasised with advantage.   On the other hand thelength of time required for the review was partly dependenton the co-operation of the Union.-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................................
TOP SEGUE?431(b) At a later stage in the dispute it might be reasonable tooffer a three-year agreement, which would provide a somewhatlarger increase than 4 per cent in the first year, counterbalancedby an appropriate reduction of the increase in the subsequenttwo years.(c) Further consideration should be given to the best meansof securing a more adequate presentation of the Governmentscase, which was a strong one, in the national press.The Cabinet -(1)    Agreed that in the current dispute aboutpostmen&apos;s pay no improvement on theoffer already made to the Union of PostOffice Workers should be conceded forthe time being.(2)    Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the PostmasterGeneral and the Minister without portfolio, to review the arrangementsfor the public presentation of theGovernments case in the dispute.Cabinet Office, S. W. 117th July, 1964
