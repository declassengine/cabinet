Incomes Policy        2.   The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the report of a reviewSalaries of of university salaries by the National Incomes Commission (N.I.C.)University Staff would be published on the following day. This report would propose(Previous increases in the salaries of university staffs, ranging from 8 per centReference: to 23 per cent, at a cost of some  6 million a year. It would be advisableC.C. (62) 73rd that the Government should endorse this considered recommendationConclusions, and that an announcement to this effect should be made before the minute 5) Easter Recess.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom ofthis course. So prompt an acceptance of the Commission^recommendations would be liable to reinforce the mounting pressure for an increase in the salaries of school teachers and to have unfortunate repercussions on the current dispute about the pay of doctors. In addition it might provide grounds for an erroneousassumption that, because the Government had felt able to accept theCommission^ recommendations without delay, they had had someforeknowledge of them. On the other hand the Commission had beenestablished in order to provide independent and authoritative advice on proper levels of remuneration; and, since their findings were akinto the award of an arbitration court, the Government had no grounds for rejecting them and would therefore be unwise to defer acceptingthem.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in thecircumstances, the wisest course might be to indicate, before the easter Recess, that the Government endorsed the Commission^recommendations in principle but that they would need to oonsiderthem in greater detail and would make a further announcement afterthe reassembly of Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord. President, to announce on 26th Marchthat the Government accepted in principle therecommendations of the National Incomes Commissionon university salaries, to be published on 25th March,and that they would make a further statement after the easter Recess.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Lord President and other Ministers concerned, to giveconsideration to the terms of the further statement to bemade after the Easter Recess.Foreign Affairs 3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Libyan Government hadLibya now invited us to open negotiations on 20th April about the future of(Previous       the Anglo-Libyan Treaty, on the basis that the Treaty itself would be reference:      terminated and that we would evacuate our military bases in Libya.CM. (64) 18th It would be to our advantage to protract these discussions as far as conclusions,    possible; to keep in close touch with the United States Government,Minute 2)       who were faced with a similar request in relation to their military facilities in Libya; and to seek to preserve at least the staging andoverflying rights which our aircraft at present enjoyed in relation toLibyan territory.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.There was increasing evidence that the Egyptian Government wereintensifying their pressure to compel us to evacuate our bases in theMediterranean and the Middle Bast; and, if they succeeded in securing4415-2Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Easter Recess.
our eviction from the Libyan base of El Adem, our position would be seriously weakened. In these circumstances we should not acquiesce in any unilateral denunciation of the Treaty by the LibyanGovernment; nor should we agree to take part in negotiations directed to the termination of the Treaty. We should confine ourselves toimplementing our earlier undertaking to review the Treaty, since onthis basis we could, if necessary, withdraw from Libya without prejudicing our legal entitlement to continue to overfly Libyanterritory and, possibly, even to use the facilities at El Adem.Meanwhile, we should avoid any action which might endanger our strategic facilities in Malta.Cyprus The   Foreign   Secretary   informed   the   Cabinet   that   the(Previous Secretary-General of the United Nations had now proposed M. SakariReference: Tuomioja as the United Nations mediator in the Cyprus dispute; and,CM. (64) 19th since this suggestion appeared to be acceptable to both the Greek and conclusions, Turkish interests concerned, it seemed likely that M. Tuomioja&apos;sMinute 5)       appointment would shortly be announced.Cambodia The Foreign Secretary said that the suggestion that a new(Previous        conference should be arranged to discuss an international guaranteeReference:       of the integrity and neutrality of Cambodia had proved unacceptableCM. (64) 18th  to the Governments of the United States, South Vietnam and conclusions,    Thailand. The United States had suggested, as an alternative, that minute 2)       quadripartite discussions should be arranged between themselves andthe Governments of Cambodia, South Vietnam and Thailand; and theGovernment of Cambodia appeared to be willing to endorse thisproposal, although they were anxious that the French Governmentshould be associated with the negotiations. In these circumstances hebad suggested to the Soviet Government, who shared with us thechairmanship of the 1954 Geneva Conference on Indo-China, thatarrangements should be made on this basis.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.CommercialPolicyExport Credits(previous reference:CM. (64) 16thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Industry (CP. (64) 76) about the export credit for Cuba.The Secretary of State for Industry said that at their meeting on 3rd March the Cabinet had invited him to settle, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, the provision of credit cover for certain goods for which letters of intent had then been issued by the Cuban TradeMission. In agreement with the Foreign Secretary he had authorised the Export Credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.) to providecover in respect of the business in question, amounting to some 1-6 million. The general question of credit cover for trade withCuba had subsequently been referred to the Departments AdvisoryCouncil, who had stated that they were willing to entertain Cubanbusiness on a commercial basis under Section 1 of the Export CreditsGuarantees Act for the normal period of five years, subject to a limit of  4 million on annual repayments, which might be extended, ifnecessary, by up to  -h million in all in order to relieve pressure inpeak years. The Council recognised that the Government might wishto impose a lower limit on political grounds; but in that case theywould expect the Government to make it known that this was adecision for which they, not the Council, were responsible. It wouldbe inexpedient to adopt this course since, once it became known thatthe Government were prepared to determine the extent of credit coverin the case of Cuba by reference to other than purely commercialcriteria, they would be exposed to pressure to take similar action inrelation to the provision of credit for trade with members of the soviet bloc.
Finance for 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordUniversity President (CP. (64) 78) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 81)Expansion       on finance for university expansion.The Lord President recalled that in October 1963 the Governmenthad accepted the recommendation of the Committee on higher education (the Robbins Committee) that the number of students inuniversities and institutions with university status should be raised to197,000 by 1967-68. This involved raising the numbers in the existinguniversities to 170,000, compared with the previous objective of150,000 in 1966-67. Whether the increase could be achieved wouldSECRET4415-2 a 3CM. 20 (64)The Foreign Secretary said that he was concerned at the probablerepercussions on our relations with the United States if we providedcredit for trade with Cuba on the scale proposed. It would be preferable that the figure of  4 million should be reduced to not morethan  2 or  2^ million.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The figure of  4 million would not be made publicly known.Moreover, it represented only the upper limit within which coverwould be provided and did not imply that contracts to the full amount would necessarily be concluded. One or two large firms had alreadywithdrawn from the competition for orders because they fearedrepercussions on their business in the United States. On the otherhand shipbuilding firms were bidding keenly for business with Cuba.(b) The amount of trade with Cuba which would be involvedmust be viewed in comparison with the volume of United States trade,backed by the Export-Import Bank, with such countries as indonesia and Egypt. This trade was contrary to our own strategic interests;and it would not be unreasonable to propose to the United StatesGovernment that they should abate it in return for an abatement ofour trade with Cuba. On the other hand there was no reason to believethat the United States Government would respond to representations of this kind.(c) E.C.G.D. was subject to Ministerial direction; and theSecretary of State for Industry was therefore entitled to direct theDepartment to provide credit cover for a lower sum than thatrecommended by the Advisory Council on purely commercial grounds.On the other hand any intervention by the Government in this respectwould be bound to become known, with potentially embarrassingconsequences.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion appeared to favour acceptance of the AdvisoryCounciPs recommendations, the Foreign Secretary reserving hisposition. It would be essential, however, to keep the question under close review in the light both of political repercussions in the UnitedStates and of any changes in the credit-worthiness of Cuba. Ifnecessary, the matter should be referred again to the Cabinet forfurther consideration; and it might in any event be desirable that theCabinet should review the issues involved when the amountoutstanding on annual maturities reached a level of  3 million. Inaddition firms engaging in trade with Cuba should be made aware ofthe risk of repercussions on their trade with the United States.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (64) 76.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, to keep the question of creditcover for trade with Cuba under close review on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing-up.
depend on the capital resources devoted to university expansion in1964 and 1965, since building starts in subsequent years, althoughimportant as an indication of the Governmenfs continuing intentionto support the expansion of the universities, could not provide accommodation for additional students in 1967-68. When the decisionto accept the Rob bins Committee recommendation had been taken ithad been thought that it would be possible, by some temporaryreduction of standards, to achieve the additional numbers within thecapital investment allocation of  33^ million in each of the calendaryears 1964 and 1965, which had already been sanctioned, with theaddition of a further  10 million for 1964. The universities, however,had offered to provide twice the number of additional places proposedby the Robbins Committee at a total additional cost of over  100million. The University Grants Committee (U.G.C.) had not accepted this offer of a more rapid expansion and had thereby succeeded in reducing the additional cost for 1965 to  25 million, to which shouldbe added an additional  15 million already sanctioned for 1964 inorder that immediate progress might be made. The U.G.C. had made it clear that, in their considered judgment, the addition of  25 million to the  331 million originally authorised for 1965 was the least thatwould enable the objective of 170,000 places by 1967-68 to beachieved. This figure allowed for an increase in the proportion of students provided with residential accommodation from 30 per cent to 37 per cent, compared with the Robbins Committee&apos;srecommendations that eventually two-thirds of the student population should be so accommodated; and it implied a unit cost of  2,700 perplace compared with  2,300 per place actually spent in recent yearsand the Robbins Committee&apos;s expectation of a cost of about  3,000 perplace. It was important that the amount of work that would be sanctioned in 1965 should be announced soon, in order that planningmight proceed; and the only alternatives to accepting U.G.C.&apos;sconsidered judgment of the cost of achieving 170,000 places were either to withdraw the Governments acceptance of this objective orto announce a smaller programme which the U.G.C. were known toconsider inadequate for the purpose. Neither of these courses was acceptable.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the proposal of anadditional  25 million for building starts in 1965 would involve atotal additional investment, after taking into account the cost of fees,land and equipment, of  37 million over and above the  33i millionalready approved for 1965. This was a considerably higher figurethan was contemplated when it was agreed that the expansionrecommended by the Robbins Committee could be financed fromthe resources allocated to education generally and announced in theWhite Paper on public expenditure. The commitment to provide170,000 additional places in 1967 must be honoured; but, in view ofthe pressure which was being put on Departments generally to reduce their claims on national resources in order to create a reserve margin of  30 million in 1965-66, it was necessary to consider carefullywhether expenditure of this order was in fact essential to provide this number of places. The information required for this purpose did notappear to have been made fully available: but the estimated cost perplace was unnecessarily high, the scale on which it was proposed toprovide residential accommodation appeared unduly generous andsome of the projects included in the estimates, although necessary inthe long run, were not essential during the period of emergencyexpansion. There was no sign of the temporary sacrifice of standards which had been regarded as a concomitant of the short-term programme or of the emergency action which had been contemplatedas a means of making the most of the available resources during theperiod when the pressure on accommodation would be greatest.Before any decision could be taken, therefore, it was important thatthe proposals should be examined in greater detail.In discussion it was emphasised that the claims of the universitiesmust be considered in relation to other items in the Governmenfs
Treatment of offenders(previous reference:CM. (64) 18thConclusions,Minute 9)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (64) 80), to which was appended a revised draft ofthe White Paper on &quot; The War Against Crime in England and Wales,1959-64 &quot;.The Home Secretary said that the draft of the White Paper hadbeen amended in the light of the Cabinets previous discussion. If itwere now approved, it would be possible to publish it before Easter.But, if it were thought to require further consideration, its publication should preferably be deferred until the middle of April. In the latterevent, however, it would be desirable that the publication of the reportof the Departmental Committee on Treatment of Children and YoungPersons under the chairmanship of Lord Kilbrandon should, ifpossible, be deferred until the same week, in order to avoid any suggestion that the decision to appoint a Royal Commission inEngland and Wales had been inspired by the report of the KilbrandonCommittee. The risk that the report of the Labour Party&apos;s committeeon Penal Policy would appear before the White Paper could beaccepted.In discussion it was suggested that there would be advantage inpostponing the publication of the White Paper until the middle ofApril, in order to enable further consideration to be given to certain points of drafting. There would be no difficulty in arranging for thereport of the Kilbrandon Committee to be published at about thesame time.CM. 20 (64)programme, including housing, and in the light of the overriding need to maintain the soundness of the economy. The first step, however,should be to consider how far it would be possible to provide suchaccommodation as was essential during the emergency period at a lesser cost than that of the proposals put forward by the U.G.C.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Government should honour their undertaking to provide 170,000places, the proposals for achieving this objective should be scrutinisedin order to ascertain whether savings could be made either byeliminating the less essential projects or by reducing the cost by usingmodern methods of construction. It would be helpful if the lord president, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister ofPublic Building and Works would meet for this purpose under thechairmanship of the Home Secretary and in consultation with theChairman of the University Grants Committee. Thereafter, he would arrange for the Ministers concerned to consider, in the light of theconclusions of the Home Secretary&apos;s enquiry and of the current reviewof the investment programme, the priority which should be accorded to the programme of university expansion in relation to the claims of other projects in the public sector.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the lord president, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Ministerof Public Building and Works, to examine the proposalsfor capital investment submitted by the universities witha view to reducing the cost of the minimum necessary to implement the Governments undertaking that 170,000places would be provided in the universities in 1967-68.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to consider,in consultation with the Ministers principally concerned,the priority to be accorded to the expansion of the universities in the light of the results of the enquiry to be conducted under Conclusion (1) above and of the currentreview of the Governments investment programme.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, to give further consideration to the draft white Paper appended to CP. (64) 80.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, invited the Home Secretaryto arrange for the publication of the White Paper on a convenient date in the week beginning 12th April.GovernmentOfficesRemoval of thePost OfficeSavings Bankfrom London(previous reference:CM. (64) 19thConclusions,Minute 9)7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by thePostmaster-General (CP. (64) 79) and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP. (64) 75) about the removal of the Post Office savings bank from London.The Postmaster-General said that, in accordance with theconclusions of the Cabinet at their previous meeting, he had consulted the associations representing the staff concerned. The Society of CivilServants, which represented the interests of the senior staff numbering350, had still refused to express any preference as regards the area towhich the Bank should be moved. The Civil Service ClericalAssociation, which represented 5,000 of the staff, had adhered to theirpreference for Tees-side and had said that they would regard adecision to move the Bank to Glasgow as an affront to the processes of consultation. In these circumstances, and in the light of the shortageof housing in Glasgow and the extent of the daily journey which thestaff would have to face, it might be wiser to move the Bank elsewhere.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he could not accept that the staff would suffer any disadvantages, even as regardsaccommodation and daily travel, if the Bank were moved to Glasgow.A decision to prefer some other area would be interpreted as indicating that the dispersal of Government Departments was determined bystaff pressures; and, if this impression gained currency, no staffs wouldever be moved to Scotland and industry would be given no incentive to develop or expand undertakings north of the Border.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said he was concerned at the effectof the decision in this case on the programme for the dispersal ofGovernment Departments from London. This programme involvedsome 10,000 staff, in addition to the staff of the Post Office savings bank. So far good relations had been maintained with the staffsconcerned; but future transfers would be liable to be jeopardisedif a decision were taken to move the Bank to Glasgow against thewishes of its staff.In discussion it was suggested that the balance of advantageinclined in favour of moving the Bank to Tees-side and that theinterests of Scotland would be better served by inducing industry tomove there in the first instance. This would bring clerical employmentin its train, whereas the unfavourable publicity which would attend a transfer of the Post Office Savings Bank against the wishes of thestaff would inhibit industry from moving to Scotland. On the otherhand a decision of such importance should not be based on thepreference of the relatively small number of staff concerned but shouldbe determined by considerations of Government policy and thenational interest. From this point of view the transfer of a Governmentoffice involving such a substantial amount of clerical employment would be an important demonstration of the governments determination to deal effectively with the problem of regional development.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, on balance, the Bank should be transferred to Glasgow. But it would be helpful if, when this decision was announced, the Government couldindicate at the same time that they intended to move several other
