(63) 3rdConclusions.Minute 3.)SouthernArabia(previous reference:CM. (64) 28thConclusions.Minute 1)1. The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of the recentadvance by the Pathet Lao forces, a serious situation was developingin Laos and the position of the Laotian Government was beingprogressively undermined. The United States Government believedthat it would now be desirable to make a renewed effort to re-establishpolitical stability in the area by reconvening the conference whichhad negotiated the Geneva settlement of 1962. But they wished theconference to be preceded by preliminary local discussions inVientiane; and they were also seeking to make their acceptance ofthe subsequent conference conditional on certain stipulations,particularly the withdrawal of the Pathet Lao forces from the area in the Plaine des Jarres which they had recently occupied. It was doubtful whether the proposed preliminary discussions would in fact be of value, since only the threat of active intervention by the UnitedStates would probably deter the Communist Government of Chinafrom continuing to foment disorder in Laos; and, although we should support the United States proposal, we should be unwise to expect any useful outcome.In discussion there was general agreement that it would havebeen preferable, if possible, to proceed direct to a fresh conferenceon the 1962 model than to devote time to preliminary discussions which would merely provide the Pathet Lao with further opportunityto consolidate their position. Moreover, the United States Governmentshowed no apparent disposition to take the military action which aloneoffered some prospect of stabilising the situation in Laos; and it was difficult to envisage what they could expect to achieve by a policy ofmilitary inactivity coupled with an insistence on preconditions for a diplomatic conference which the other participants were unlikely toaccept. We had already offered, however, to reinforce the UnitedStates position in Indo-China by despatching a squadron of fighter aircraft to Thailand; and, although our other commitments wouldnot allow us to do more than this, we should continue to support theUnited States as far as possible in resisting the gradual subversion ofthe Laotian Government.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that it now seemed probable that the projected meeting between the Heads ofGovernment of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines would takeplace in Tokyo on 5th June. We should await the outcome.In discussion it was agreed that this meeting might still be frustrated by the failure of the Indonesian Government to effect thewithdrawal of their guerilla forces from the Borneo Territories onwhich the Malaysian Government were rightly insisting as a conditionof attending the meeting. Nevertheless, it was to our advantage topromote a settlement by discussion and agreement, if possible; andwe should do nothing to reduce the chances that the meeting would eventually take place.The Colonial Secretary said that, as a result of a recent dispute between the labour unions in British Guiana, civil disorder had broken out afresh in the Colony. The Governor had therefore declareda state of emergency; and he had been reinforced by the despatch ofadditional United Kingdom troops. It might be necessary, however,to confer additional emergency powers on him by Order-in-Council;and we should not exclude the possibility that, if the disorderscontinued, we should have to revert to direct rule of the Colony.The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that the measureswhich we had taken to repress the revolt in the Federation of south arabia were gradually succeeding. Moreover, there were some indications that the Rulers of the member States of the Federationmight be more willing than had originally seemed likely to contemplate the measures of constitutional reform without which there could belittle hope of long-term political stability in the area. The way was
Malta(previous reference:CM. (64) 26thConclusions,Minute 3)The Colonial Secretary said that he was not unhopeful of a successful outcome to the current discussions with the Government of malta about a new defence agreement regulating our possession and use of our base in the Island. It had been made clear to the PrimeMinister, Dr. Borg Olivier, that, unless we obtained satisfaction onthe issues to which we attached importance in this context, we might feel unable to continue to maintain forces in the Island; and there was some hope that the Prime Minister would appreciate the economic implications of this warning. If a reasonable defence agreement couldbe concluded, only the question of the constitutional status and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church in Malta would remainoutstanding; and it should be possible to enact legislation conferringindependence on the Island during the remainder of the present session of Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that time had been reserved for legislation on this subject on the assumption that the Bill would benon-controversial. But the status of the Roman Catholic Church underthe independence constitution would be liable to be the subject of acute controversy in this country; and it might be preferable,therefore, that, even if independence were conceded to Malta inprinciple before the end of the Session, the consequential legislation should be deferred until the following Session. On the other hand theGovernment of Malta were now relying on our enacting the Island&apos;independence before the end of the present Session; and there was a risk that, if these hopes were disappointed, public opinion in Malta,regardless of political affiliation, would turn against the UnitedKingdom and our position in the Island would be seriously threatened.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theCommittee on Defence and Oversea Policy to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to the current negotiations with the Government of Malta about theindependence of the Island.India(previous reference:C.C. (63) 35thConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet considered the United Kingdom contribution, inrespect of 1964-65, to the Consortium on Aid to India. There was general agreement that this contribution should be fixed, as in theprevious year, at a level of  30 million.Soviet Union: The Minister of Agriculture said that the United KingdomAgriculture Agricultural Exhibition in Moscow had attracted great interest in theSoviet LTnion and we might reasonably expect that, as a result,considerable Soviet orders might be placed in this country. The soviet authorities had clearly been impressed by the efficiency of our agricultural methods and had expressed the hope that the UnitedKingdom and the Soviet Union might co-operate in agricultural research.In discussion there was general agreement that we should respondpromptly and appropriately to this initiative.therefore being gradually prepared for a fresh constitutional conference in London and for the preliminary discussions in Aden,in which it now seemed likely that most of the local political parties would be willing to participate.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary and theColonial Secretary.
Rates(previous reference:CM. (64) 17thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 104), recommending that theGovernment should adhere to the policy as regards rates which hadbeen outlined by the Prime Minister in a speech on 5th March. 1964.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Prime ministers statement had recognised that some alterations in the present systemof rating would be required but that a decision on the scale and natureof the changes must be deferred until the Government had receivedboth the report of the Committee under the chairmanship of professor Allen which was examining the impact of rates on individualhouseholders and the report of the interdepartmental review of thebalance between local and national taxation with particular referenceto expenditure on education. This statement remained valid; and itwould be inopportune to seek to elaborate it at this juncture.In discussion there was considerable support for this view. Thereport of the Allen Committee should be available in draft by August;and, even though the interdepartmental enquiry could not becompleted until rather later, the Government should be able by theearly autumn to identify more clearly than at present those classes ofratepayers who were most in need of relief. It was doubtful, however,whether it would remain politically feasible for the Government tomaintain a neutral attitude on the subject until the General Election;and it was for consideration whether they should give some indication that they would be prepared to consider the possibility of transferringexpenditure from the rates to the taxes, particularly as regardseducation. The programme of educational expansion which was nowin train had been undertaken for national, rather than local, reasons;and it was becoming increasingly clear that this programme couldnot be allowed to depend indefinitely on so inelastic a source ofrevenue as the rates. For both reasons it might be appropriate toindicate that the Government did not dismiss the possibility that the financing of education might be transferred from the rates to the taxes.On the other hand a transfer of this kind would be very expensive interms of the additional taxation which it would entail; and it wouldnot necessarily provide any significant relief to those ratepayers whowere most in need. Moreover, there could be no assurance that localauthorities, if relieved of the liability for expenditure in respect ofeducation, would not take the opportunity to enlarge their expenditureon other purposes. For these reasons it would be as well to avoid, atthis juncture, too explicit an indication that the Government wereprepared to consider changes of this kind.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, for the time being, Government spokesmen onthe subject of rates should adhere to the policy outlined in cp. (64) 104.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given, in due course, to possiblemodifications in this policy which it might be expedient for the Government to adopt later in the year.CM. 29 (64)The Cabinet (3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theSecretary of State for Industry and the Minister of Statefor Education and Science, to arrange for a public announcement to be issued in the near future, about thepossibility of co-operation between the United Kingdomand the Soviet Union in the field of agricultural research.
AgriculturalPolicyBeef Prices(previous reference:CM. (64) 11 ihConclusions,Minute 8)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (CP. (64) 108) about beef prices.The Minister of Agriculture said that beef prices had risen sincethe end of 1963 to record levels in the past week, although even now the wholesale price was only 2^d. per pound above the average for april and about Is. per pound above the very low prices of a yearago. The rise was due to the shortage of Argentine exports, caused bythe drought of 1962-63, combined with a fall in production of some7 per cent in the first quarter of 1964 in Western European countries,where demand for beef had also been rising. Those countries hadconsequently removed restrictions on meat imports and were now seeking supplies in all parts of the world. Previously the UnitedKingdom had offered the only free market for meat; but western europe was now a competitor in this respect so much so that exportsof Australian meat to the United Kingdom had recently been diverted to Europe in order to take advantage of the higher prices nowobtainable there.Until recently United Kingdom exports of beef had been too small to have any effect on domestic prices. In the first quarter of1964 they had averaged 650 tons a week, compared with a total consumption of beef in the United Kingdom of about 25,000 tons aweek. Recently, however, they had reached a level of about 1,600tons a week. As a result supplies of beef and other carcase meat in the april-June quarter, compared with a year ago, showed a slightreduction from 692-9 thousand tons to 685 thousand tons. Theshortage of Argentine beef seemed likely to continue for most of theyear; and, although future Continental demand was unpredictable, it seemed unlikely to decline before the autumn and might increase stillfurther in the meantime. Domestic production between July and december should be no less than in the corresponding period in 1963;and grass-fed cattle should be available in greater numbers towardsthe end of June, when prices should steady and then start to fall,unless Continental buying increased further. Imports were being sought wherever they were available.In this situation we had to consider whether or not it would bedesirable to prohibit exports or at least to seek to discourage them.It could be argued in favour of such action that exports were no longerinsignificant in relation to our total supplies and that they enabledforeign consumers to benefit from our agricultural support system.On the other hand a ban on exports would be contrary to our trade policy and our commercial interests; and it would merely divertContinental buyers to countries now supplying us with imports, withthe result that in the longer term we should gain no net advantage.Moreover, there would be practical difficulties in preventing theexport of cattle from Northern Ireland to the Irish Republic; andthis loophole would permit British cattle also to evade any restrictions. An alternative course would be to attempt to obtain adraw-back of the subsidy in respect of exported cattle; but this wouldbe ineffective for practical reasons. Until recently some 80 per cent of exports consisted of cattle not attracting subsidy, since they were theresult of heavy spring culling of the dairy herds. The proportion now coming under the guaranteed price subsidy was higher; but the subsidyhad already fallen to a low figure and, if prices remained at theirpresent levels for a further six weeks, would be almost completelyeliminated. A third possible remedy might lie in a rather arbitrarytax on exports. But this would require legislation; and, if action hadto be taken, it would be preferable to impose a quota or a prohibition on exports, which could be operated under existing legislation. on balance, it would probably be unjustifiable in present circumstances to seek to restrict the export of beef; but the position should be kept under close review and, if exports rose much further and pricesincreased substantially above their present levels, action might becomepolitically inevitable.
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The imposition of an export tax would entail an amendment to the Finance Bill and would therefore require a very early decision.But, if in the event restrictions had to be imposed, it might in any case be preferable that they should take the form of quotas; and furtherconsideration should be given to the manner in which these might beapplied with least detriment to Northern Ireland.(b) Public opinion might criticise the Government on the groundthat the present rise in prices could have been avoided by long-termbulk purchase agreements with the major exporting countries. this criticism would be mistaken in so far as such agreements were not always acceptable to the exporting countries and were in any eventuseless in a situation caused by a short fall of production. Moreover,the complexity of the trade made meat unsuitable for bulk purchase by Government, in contrast to such uniform commodities as rawsugar.(c) The United Kingdom had benefited very substantially in thepast from the operation of a free market in meat; and occasional rises in prices were the inevitable concomitant of a system which, taken asa whole, was greatly to our advantage. The extent to which the UnitedKingdom relied upon imports of meat made it impossible to insulateour prices from movements in the world market.(d) Public criticism might be directed particularly to the apparent anomaly that, if we maintained our exports, the foreignconsumer would benefit from our domestic subsidies. But this criticismignored the fact that the present rise in prices would reduce the costof the guaranteed price for beef in the current financial year from theoriginal estimate of some  43 million to about  15- 20 million. Tothis extent it could be argued that it was the foreign consumer whowas subsidising the United Kingdom taxpayer rather than vice versa.Moreover, a considerable part of total world agricultural exports weresubsidised by Governments in one form or another.(e) Imports of meat from other countries were not subject to any restrictions, except on grounds of health and hygiene. It would therefore be useful to explose the possibility that the United states might export supplies at the present level of prices. Furtherconsideration should also be given to freeing imports of Canadiantinned ham and of other forms of meat as alternatives to beef. It was important that the Government should be seen to be making everyeffort to increase available supplies on the United Kingdom market.(/) It would be desirable that the Government should take anearly opportunity to explain publicly their reasons for refraining, atleast for the time being, from imposing restrictions on exports of beef. But, in so far as any statement issued for this purpose would need to elaborate the arguments of principle in favour of allowing the free market to continue, it should not press those arguments to thepoint at which the Government might be embarrassed if action to restrict exports of beef subsequently became politically inevitable.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no restrictions should be placed on the export of beef for the time being.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to keep the situation under close review andto inform them forthwith of any unfavourabledevelopments.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Minister without portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to issue, in the light of their
NuclearPoweredShips(previous references:CM. (64) 8thConclusions,Minute 4 and cm. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Defence and the Lord Chancellor (CP. (64) 106 and 107respectively) on visits by nuclear powered vessels to foreign ports.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, in view of the impending visit of H.M.S. Dreadnought to Norfolk, Virginia, at theend of June, it was necessary to reconsider the issues involved in visits by United Kingdom and United States nuclear pov/ered ships to eachother&apos;s ports. United States warships had paid a number of visitsduring the past few years to United Kingdom ports other than the holy Loch, both at home and overseas; and in the absence of any formal safeguards, particularly as regards safety and indemnity, wehad had no option but to take these visits on trust. In January 1964,however, the United States authorities had communicated to us astatement on the operation of their nuclear powered warships inforeign ports (reproduced at Annex A of CP. (64) 106) which, as theyhad informed us, had also been sent to the Governments of othercountries likely to receive visits from these vessels. They had expressedthe hope that we would be willing to issue a similar statement in orderthat mutual visits of nuclear warships might be arranged on the basisof the assurances contained in these statements. Certain unsatisfactoryfeatures in the statement, relating to safety and the notification of visits, had subsequently been satisfactorily amended; and there nowremained only the question of indemnity in the event of an accident.The United States authorities had shown themselves unwilling toinclude in a statement which was intended for world wide applicationany formal acceptance of the principle of the sole and absolute liability of the operator of a nuclear reactor. Nevertheless, as a result offurther discussion, they had indicated that, provided that agreement could be reached on the indemnity clause, they would be prepared towithdraw their original statement and to replace it with an exactcounterpart of the United Kingdom statement at Annex B of cp. (64) 106. The latter met our requirements as regards safety andthe notification of visits by United States warships to our ports.Moreover, in so far as it provided that claims following from a nuclearincident involving a vessel of the type in question would be dealt withthrough diplomatic channels in accordance with customary procedures for the settlement of international claims under generally acceptedprinciples of law and equity, it represented the maximum that weshould wish to concede in relation to visits by our own nuclearpowered warships to foreign ports. Finally, it left unaffected the separate bilateral agreement, which we had negotiated with the UnitedStates Government earlier in the year, on claims and indemnity foraccidents resulting from the stationing of nuclear vessels in the HolyLoch. No question of legislation would be involved; and it would therefore be to our advantage to conclude an agreement with theUnited States authorities on this basis.The Lord Chancellor said that, after consultation with theMinisters principally concerned (the Minister of Transport dissenting)he had reached the conclusion that it was necessary to enact legislationdiscussion, a public statement of the reasons for whichthe Government proposed to refrain from restrictingexports of beef in present circumstances.(4) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for industry and the Secretary of State for Scotland, toconsider how restrictions on exports of beef might be imposed with least detriment and inconvenience, if theyshould subsequently prove to be unavoidable.
applying the principle of sole and absolute liability to the operators of nuclear ships. The Government had already accepted this principle in relation to nuclear reactors on land and would shortly give effectto it by legislation in accordance with the Vienna Convention on third party liability in relation to nuclear energy. Moreover, we had playedan active part in negotiating the Brussels Convention on the liability of operators of nuclear ships; and it would be embarrassing to makeany departure from the principles which it embodied, particularly since, in view of the dissentient attitude of the Governments of theUnited States and the Soviet Union, the Convention could not comeinto force unless ratified by ourselves. In addition, the wording of thestatement which it was now proposed to adopt in respect of claims and indemnity in relation to nuclear powered warships had beenconsidered in the context of the Holy Loch agreement and had beenheld to be unsatisfactory since there were no generally acceptedprinciples of law and equity in this field. In that case we had succeeded in persuading the United States authorities to supplement the formulanow envisaged by an expression in general terms of their support forthe principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator; and,although this had no legal validity, it was of value in so far as itestablished United States acceptance of that basic principle. If,therefore, the statement now envisaged dispensed with any referenceto the principle, it would be inconsistent with, and would derogatefrom, the Holy Loch agreement; and it would fail to satisfy the assurances given to Parliament by the then Minister of Defence inFebruary 1961 that we would give effect to the principle of sole andabsolute liability of the operator in relation to nuclear ships. any departure from this policy in respect of visits of nuclear warships to united Kingdom ports would be unlikely to be acceptable to publicopinion in the United Kingdom.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) So far as visits by United Kingdom warships to the UnitedStates were concerned it might be preferable to omit any reference toindemnity in the proposed statement. But, although the United states authorities might accept such an arrangement in relation to theforthcoming visit of H.M.S. Dreadnought, they would undoubtedlyremain concerned to formulate a statement which would cover the visits of nuclear powered warships to any country and would thereforeavoid any specific reference to the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator, which they felt unable to accept, primarily for reasons of security, in relation to their own nuclear poweredwarships.(b) In respect of any damage caused by United States nuclearships in foreign ports United States law made the United StatesGovernment responsible only to the extent that the law of the foreign country concerned imposed such liability. Unless, therefore, weenacted legislation applying the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator, we should be unable to obtain full indemnity in theevent of an accident involving a United States nuclear vessel.(c) Any decision to cancel the visit of H.M.S. Dreadnought toVirginia on the ground that we were unable to reach agreement withthe United States Government on the question of indemnity wouldhave serious political implications.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,without prejudice to the desirability of legislating in due course to giveeffect to the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator, weshould concentrate our immediate efforts on securing an understanding with the United States authorities which would permit the visit of H.M.S. Dreadnought to take place. The ministers immediately concerned should consider how this would best be done.
The Cabinet Tnvited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor, the Secretary of State for Defence and theMinister of State for Education and Science, to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to the formof a statement on the question of indemnity in relation tovisits by United Kingdom and United States warships to each other&apos;s ports.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,26th May, 1964.
