SouthernArabia(previous reference:CM. (64) 27thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Colonial Secretary said that on his recent visit to theFederation of South Arabia he had reviewed both the military andthe political situation.The military operations were developing satisfactorily. the morale of our forces was high; and they had the full co-operationof the Arab troops of the Federal Regular Army. As a result the first stage of the operation to suppress the revolt in the Radfan area had now been satisfactorily completed. The Aden-Dhala Road had been cleared; and important mountain positions, together with two of themost fertile valleys, had been occupied by our troops. The localtribesmen and their families had evacuated the area and had removedto the mountains. To pursue them further would be costly in menand would make heavy demands on man-power and equipment; andthe Commander-in-Chief therefore proposed that we should now seek to secure the submission of the tribesmen without undertaking furthermajor operations by ground forces. For this purpose harassing air attacks should now be launched, particularly against rebel strongholdsin the mountains; but there would be no bombing of villages. It wouldbe particularly important to intercept the reinforcements, both ofmen and of military supplies, which the local tribes were continuing to receive from the Yemen. Initially, warning leaflets, issued in thename of the Federal Minister of the Interior, would be dropped inthe areas concerned, calling on the tribesmen to submit. They wouldnot indicate that, in the absence of compliance, air attacks might follow; but the implication would be well understood. While it wouldnot be practicable, in the light of local custom, to call upon the tribesmen to surrender their rifles, other guarantees of good behaviourwould be required. Meanwhile, the arduous nature of the operationsmade it essential to provide the troops with periodical relief; and anadditional battalion should be despatched to Aden for this purpose.The decapitated bodies of two soldiers in British uniforms had recently been found by a patrol of the Federal Army. Circumstantialevidence made it virtually certain that these were the bodies of thetwo soldiers whose heads had been reported to have been displayedin the Yemen.As regards the political situation, he had had discussions withthe Federal and Adeni Ministers and with delegations from all themain political parties. Some dissatisfaction had been expressed aboutthe merger of Aden with some of the Protectorate States in a federation, particularly on the score of the powers exercised by theFederal authorities as regards internal security. The powers of these -feudal Rulers in the States had also been criticised. It wasreassuring, however, that nobody had advocated the separation of aden from the Federation or the removal of the United Kingdombase. In addition the enthusiasm for union with the Yemen whichhe had encountered during his previous visit had now noticeablydiminished. In these circumstances he had felt able to agree that theconstitutional conference which had been projected during theprevious year but had been deferred as the result of an outbreak of violence should now be held in London in June. Ministers representingall 14 States of the Federation would take part; but it would be impracticable to include, in addition, representatives of political parties outside the Government. They would be given an opportunityto express their views, however, at a preparatory conference, to beheld in Aden. At the London conference we should probably be pressed to commit ourselves to a date for the independence of theFederation. A possible date might be some five years hence; but thiswould depend to some extent on the willingness of the Federal Rulersto introduce more democratic procedures in their States, a pointon which he had spoken frankly to them during his visit.
In addition we must be prepared to promote the economic development of Aden and the Federation. The scope for action in thisrespect was now being examined locally by a team of United Kingdomofficials; and decisions on their recommendations should, if possible,be taken before the constitutional conference in June. Generosity inthis context would ultimately be more economical than an attemptto hold the country down by military force.The Secretary of State for Defence said that it was essential toretain our base at Aden. It was the focal point of our arrangementsfor protecting our interests and discharging our commitments in theMiddle East; and it was an essential link in our present chain of communications with Singapore, which played a corresponding role in the Far East. If we withdrew from Aden, we should be unable tohold Singapore; and we should leave, in each area, a vacuum which our enemies would seek to fill. It was for this reason that the UnitedStates Government had repeatedly impressed on us the importance which they attached to our retaining both bases.The Foreign Secretary said that he endorsed this view and supported the Colonial Secretary in the measures which he advocated.The prospect of a fresh political initiative was particularly welcomeand should be helpful to us not only in the United Nations but also inrelation to world opinion. As regards the further military measureswhich were now proposed, the directive given to the local militaryauthorities should be drawn as precisely as possible in order to restrict the scale and intensity of air attack to the minimum which was essential.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The move of an additional battalion to Aden would require careful consideration as regards both the public presentation of theneed for reinforcement and the choice of the route to be adopted forpurposes of overflying.(b) In defining the targets of the proposed air attacks it wouldbe necessary to take particular care to avoid, if possible, killing orinjuring women and children. On the other hand our troops shouldnot be handicapped in their operations by the imposition oflimitations on air action which might expose them to the risk ofincurring unnecessary casualties.(c) It was for consideration whether we should seek to promotemore positive action by the United Nations in relation to Yemeniaggression and subversion in southern Arabia. On the other hand the United Kingdom Permanent Representative at the United nations had advised that any attempt to raise the issue in the Security Councilin the near future would probably be unprofitable. It would be preferable, therefore, to concentrate our efforts on reinforcing the attempt by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to securethe demarcation of the frontier between the Yemen and theFederation of South Arabia, the establishment of United Nationsobservers in the area and the demilitarisation of the boundary.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the colonial secretary.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, togive further consideration to the route to be adopted forthe despatch by air of additional troops in reinforcement of the Aden base.
2. The Postmaster-General said that the operation of anunlicensed broadcasting station from an unregistered ship, theCaroline, off the coast of East Anglia had caused considerable public and Parliamentary interest. A number of the Governments supporters in the House of Commons would be strongly opposed to any attemptto prevent this and other similar stations from operating and were pressing the Government to reopen the question of licensingcommercial sound broadcasting in this country. Apart from this issue,the operation of a number of illicit broadcasting stations on the high seas would be liable to interfere with radio communications essentialto the safety of ships and aircraft and with broadcasting stationsoperating on the Continent. A committee of experts under the aegis of the Council of Europe were at present discussing a draft agreement on the prohibition of such broadcasting; and a number of european countries might pass the necessary legislation during the next fewmonths. No legislation could be undertaken in this country during thepresent Session; and it was therefore proposed to adopt a non-committal attitude in replying to Parliamentary Questions on thefollowing day. But the Government would be under strong pressureimmediately after the Whitsun recess to indicate what action, if any,they proposed to take.In discussion it was suggested that there was considerable support in the country for commercial sound broadcasting and that &quot; RadioCaroline&quot; was particularly popular in East Anglia, where the reception of the services of the British Broadcasting Corporation(B.B.C.) was indifferent. On the other hand the provincial newspaperswould be liable to see in local commercial broadcasting a substantialthreat to their own survival; and they would therefore seek to mobilise opposition to it. If, however, the question of permittingcommercial broadcasting, which the Cabinet had rejected two yearsago, were to be reopened, it could be considered only on the basis ofan objective review of all the factors involved; and the Governmentcould not permit a change of policy on that issue to be forced upon them by the operation of illicit stations. Meanwhile, whether or notcommercial sound broadcasting were to be permitted in principle,there could be no case for tolerating broadcasting stations on the high seas, which would constitute, particularly if their numbers increased,a danger to shipping and aircraft and a serious source of interferencewith the services of stations on land. The prevention of broadcastingfrom ships outside our jurisdiction, however, raised legal problems ofconsiderable difficulty, although effective action might be possible ifmembers of the Council of Europe introduced legislation to preventthe stations receiving advertising material and supplies. While itwould be necessary for the Postmaster-General to give non-committalreplies to questions at this stage, it would be important to servewarning, before a lucrative business in broadcasting from ships on theCommercialSoundBroadcastingCM. 28 (64)(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to give furtherconsideration to the publicity to be accorded to this measure of reinforcement.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary, togive further consideration, in the light of their discussion,to the terms in which authority should be given to the local commanders for the adoption of a limited degree of airproscription in southern Arabia.
2 tlhigh seas became established, that consideration was being given tothe means of prohibiting such enterprises and that those who invested in them did so at their own risk. One means of doing so might be toindicate that, in view of the possible threat to safety of sea and air navigation from illicit broadcasting stations and of the risk of the disruption of European broadcasting services, we were examiningwith other countries what action could be taken and how the difficultlegal problems could be resolved. It might be to our advantage to summon an international conference of wider scope than the currentEuropean discussions, since this would in itself serve as a warning that the stations might not be tolerated in future.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be helpful if the Home Secretary would arrange for acommittee of the Ministers principally concerned to consider, in thelight of the Cabinets discussion, in what terms the governments attitude might most appropriately be announced in a public statement which could not be delayed long after the Whitsun Recess. In themeantime the Postmaster-General should indicate that legislation was not contemplated during the remainder of the current Session;but he should avoid implying that a decision had been taken not to legislate at all.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the terms of astatement on commercial sound broadcasting, to be made after the Whitsun Recess, to be considered by a committeeof the Ministers principally concerned under his chairmanship.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to be guided by their discussion in replying to Parliamentary Questions beforethe Recess.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th May, 1964.
