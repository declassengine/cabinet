The best course seemed to be to make a statement which would commit the Government to take some action in this respect but wouldnot tie them to detailed proposals.   It might be indicated, first,that the Government would take steps to encourage localauthorities, particularly in areas of scarcity, to release moreland and that for this purpose it might be useful to appoint aCommission to discuss the problem with relevant localauthorities!  second, that the Government intended to introduce a tax on betterment, the revenue from which would be used toprovide assistance to local authorities in the task of urban renewal,including the restoration of derelict land and the provisionof public open spaces; and, third, that any such tax would becharged at a differential rate in order to discriminate betweenareas, such as the south-east, where a high level of tax couldbe levied without preventing additional land from being released and others where the demand was less compelling.   It should berecognised, however, that the economic implications of therelease of substantial quantities of land in areas of high demand would not necessarily be wholly beneficial, since it would tend toincrease the flow of population into those areas.In discussion it was suggested that all previous experience indicated the great difficulty of finding any practicablemethod of taxing land values.

If therehad been any other solution to the problem, they might havebeen expected to find it.   The Government should therefore avoid committing themselves at this stage to proposals for dealing withthis highly complex problem which it might in the event prove impossible to implement either at all or in a form which didnot inevitably open the way to a capital gains tax.On the other hand it could be argued mat previous attempts to tax land values had failed because the rate of taxation had been too high.   It should not be impossible to devise a levy on develop -ment values on the lines proposed in the memorandum(CP.(64) 125)by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, which wouldappiy to all sales of land and all development.   The charge should be regarded less as a tax than as a fee for the exerciseof the monopoly created fey the gffant of planning permission inrespect of one area and its refusal in respect of another.  Alevy in this form could be associated with the policy of releasingland, as foreshadowed in the South-East Study, and with the growing shortage of land suitable for development.   Alternatively,it might be presented in the context of the necessity to broadenthe basis of taxation with a view both to securing new sources of revenue to support increased public expenditure and torendering the incidence of taxation more equitable.   The latterapproach, however, would increase the logical difficulty ofdistinguishing between a charge on development values and a capital gains tax; and any statement on these lines would haveto be drafted wife particular care in order to avoid creating theimpression that the Government contemplated a general tax on capital.la further discussion it was suggested that, while itmight ultimately be necessary to introduce some form of levy on development values and, possibly, a general capital gainstax, the difficulty of indicating any such intention at the present stage implied that it might be preferable for the Government totake their stand on the fact that any tax would be liable toincrease the price of land and that the only effective solution tothe problem was to take steps, on the lines proposed by theMinister of Housing and Local Government, to increase thesupply of land for development.   Attention might also be drawn to the fact that even in Sweden, where the economy was organised in accordance with Socialist principles, proposals total land values had been repeatedly rejected as impracticable andit was accepted that land owners should receive the economicprice for their land.   On the other hand this might be regarded by many of the Governmenfs supporters as too negative an approach to a problem which was causing considerable public concern, coupled with an expectation that the government intended to put forward positive proposals for its solution.   on balance, therefore, the best course appeared to be to seek to answer the criticisms of the high price of land by drawing attention to the Governments proposals for increasing itsavailability and to deal with the separate issue of excessiveprofits in a public statement, possibly by the Chancellor of theExchequer, discussing in general terms the action which the
TOP SEGUE?Government had already taken to provide a more equitablesystem of taxation and the problems of finding a broader base for the increased revenue which v/ould be necessary to financeincreases in public expenditure.   In this context developmentvalues could be presented as one untapped source of revenuewhich the Government would be prepared to examine.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,said that it might prove necessary in the future to impose some form of taxation on land values and, possibly, to contemplate a capital gains tax.   But, pending further examination of feeproblem, it would be necessary to avoid committing theGovernment to a particular solution, while indicating that theywere aware of public anxiety and retained an open mind on thepossibility of finding some method of securing a share inenhanced land values for the community.  Emphasis should belaid on the steps that were being taken to secure the release ofmore land for development as the only effective means of reducing land prices.   It would be helpful if the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, in consultation wife the Chancellor of fee duchy of Lancaster, the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentand the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), v/ould considerthe terms in which the Governments policy could be described in a public speech during the autumn.The Cabinet -invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in consultation with the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, theMinister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes),to consider further, in the lightof their discussion, the terms inv/hich the Governments policy on land values could be discussed ina public speech in due course; andto report their conclusions to thePrime Minister.
