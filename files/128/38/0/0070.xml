.3 in::;CONFIDENTIAL. ANNEPOSTMENfSPAY(previous reference:CM. (64) 39thConclusions,Minute 5)Tuesday, 21 st july 1964 at 10. 00 a.muTHE POSTMASTER GENERAL said that the operationalsituation resulting from the recent one-day strike and the ban onovertime by the Union of Post Office Workers (U.P.W.) was substantially the same as when he had last reported to the Cabinet(CM. (64) 39th Conclusions, Minute 5).     There had, however,been some deterioration in the London area where the delay indelivering mail was now some four to five days.    The Union had approached the Trades Union Congress (T.U. C) wife a request for financial and moral backing in the dispute, but had not as yetelicited any clear response.    It seemed probable that theSecretary of the T.U.C, Mr. George Woodcock, would seekfurther discussion with the Chancellor, but it was not yet knownwhat line he might take.     There seemed only two possibleapproaches to the problem.    The first was to offer the Union asubstantial increase in pay for the first year of a three-year agreement, on the understanding that any increase offered in thesecond and third years would be correspondingly reduced if thework of the Pay Research &quot;unit (P. R. U. ) showed that the initialoffer was too high.    While he had himself advocated an offer of a5 per ce-.it increase of pay in the last year when the matter hadbeen initially discussed by the Cabinet, he considered that thiswould be inappropriate after the industrial action which had beentaken by the Union.    The second course, which he much preferred,was to maintain the Government&apos;s offer of investigation by theP.R.U. followed by arbitration if necessary.    While he believedthat the operational situation might deteriorate somewhat furtherover the next few days he also believed that at the end of that timethe Union might be more willing to accept arbitration.Discussion showed some support for tie view that therewould be advantage in timing if the Government were to take theinitiative la accordance with the first alternative mentioned bythe Postmaster General.    It was, however, argued that thiswould merely represent a return in much less advantageouscircumstances to the proposal which had been turned down byfee Cabinet in earlier discussions and the balance of opinion wasin favour of maintaining fee Governments offer of a review byfee P. R.U. to be followed by arbitration if necessary on the outcome.-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................................TOP  SECRET ...Copy No...tSk-
TOP* SICK?433In further discussion it was suggested Coat the Government&apos;public position would be enhanced by more effective publicity forthe fact that such a review could be undertake:.! in a relatively short time if the Union were prepared to co-operate.     Tha shortestpracticable time limit should be set for its completion but it wouldbe disadvantageous in the longer run to the standing of the P.R.U.and its place in the negotiation of Civil Service salaries as a wholeif its investigations in the present dispute were to be undulycurtailed.     It appeared that subject to the co-operation of the Unionit should be possible for the review to be completed in some four tooix weeks, but further discussion with officials would be required before a precise time could be publicly stated.    The review wouldnot itself normally determine a precise rate of pay, but would produce a range based on fair comparisons wife outside similaremployment.    Negotiations with the Union would then be requiredin order to determine precise rates and if this led to arbitrationthe process might take a further two months.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion said thatthe balance of advantage lay in maintaining the Governments offer for the speediest practicable review by the P.R. U. which was consistent with its long-term standing coupled with aa undertaking to accept arbitration if necessary on the outcome.    In giving furtherpublicity to the Governments position it would be advantageous tostate the minimum practicable time limits for the completion of allthese processes if the Union co-operated.   Further consideration should also be given to the desirability of the Government undertaking in the event of the outcome of the review going to arbitration to payat that stage any further increase which they might have offered inthe negotiations back-dated to 1st January; 1964, coupled with anundertaking to pay subsequently, and similarly back-dated, any increase which might result from arbitration.   It would be necessaryto examine further      at time limits could properly be set to these processes, but a statement in this sense should be made the following morning.The Cabinet -Invited the Postmaster General,in consultation with the chief secretary Treasury, theMinister of I-fihour and the minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) toissue a statement on the lines ofthe Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.Cabinet Office, 3. &quot;,-7.121st July, 1964TOP SIC1EY
