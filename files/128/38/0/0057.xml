NuclearPropulsionfor merchant ships(previous reference :CM. (64) 40thConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Minister of Transport said that at their earlier discussion(CM. (64) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4) the Cabinet had. invited himto give further consideration to the offer by a group of industrialiststo co-operate with the Government in the construction and operationof a nuclear-powered merchant ship. As a result he had submitted a detailed proposal to the Economic Policy Committee; and theCommittee had agreed in principle that the Government should participate in the venture, provided that the further negotiations onits financial and other implications which would now be requiredcould be brought to a satisfactory conclusion. He proposed to make an announcement to this effect in the House of Commons on thefollowing day.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof Transport.Award of costs atStatutoryInquiries2. The Lord Chancellor said that Lord Silkin had given noticeof a Question in the House of Lords enquiring when the report ofthe Council on Tribunals on the Award of Costs at Statutory Inquirieshad been received, when it would be published and what action theGovernment proposed to take upon it. It appeared that the council had invited their Chairman, Lord Tenby, to move Lord Silkin to raisethe matter. The report recommended that costs should normally be awarded to successful objectors in compulsory purchase and analogouscases; that an unsuccessful objector should not normally be awardedcosts, except where there was little or no merit in one objection overanother and policy or chance was the determining factor in thedecision; and that in such cases the unsuccessful objector shouldreceive costs, provided that he had not behaved unreasonably. TheHome Affairs Committee had considered the report on 24th July;but, while they inclined to the view that the successful objector shouldbe paid costs, they had felt unable to come to a final conclusionwithout further examination of the cost of this proposal and of theproblems involved in determining whether an objector should beregarded as successful where, for example, a compulsory purchaseorder was confirmed with modifications. They had agreed that the printing of the report should be put in hand, on the assumption thatit would not prove possible to publish it before the forthcomingGeneral Election and that the Government^ decisions on therecommendations could be announced in the new Parliament. It was unfortunate, therefore, that Lord Tenby should have inspired aQuestion which was likely to embarrass the Government.In discussion it was agreed that the answer to the Question shouldbe to the effect that the printing of the report was in hand, that it wasnot yet possible to say when it would be published and that theCouncil&apos;s recommendations were under consideration. In view of thepossibility that pressure on the matter might develop during theautumn it would be desirable that a decision should be taken inSeptember.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thematter should be considered further by the Home Affairs Committeein September and, if necessary, brought before the Cabinet. In themeantime it would be appropriate for the Lord Chancellor to answer the Question on the lines indicated in their discussion and to askLord Tenby why he had felt justified in inspiring a member of theOpposition to put down a Question about the CounciFs report.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to be guided by their discussion in answering Lord Silkin&apos;s Question in the House of Lordsabout the report by the Council on Tribunals on theAward of Costs at Statutory Inquiries.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to give further consideration to the reportduring September.The LangReport onthe FerrantiContract(previous reference :CM. (64) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3)*3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Minister of Aviation (CP. (64) 157), to which was appended an interim report by Sir John Lang on certain contracts between theMinistry of Aviation and Ferranti Limited for the production of equipment connected with the Mark I BLOODHOUND guidedweapon system.The Cabinet first considered the Motion which had been tabled by the Opposition as the basis of a Vote of Censure on the Governmentin connection with the Ferranti contracts and was to be debated on30th July. They approved the terms of an amendment to be tabled bythe Government.The Minister of Aviation said that he would be expected toindicate, during the course of this debate, the Governmenfs attitudetowards the criticisms of the Ministry of Aviatioifs contractsprocedures which had been expressed in the Lang Report. The Reportfound that the Department had been at fault in three respects in theirsupervision of the Ferranti contracts. First, the direct labour costsinvolved had been overestimated. Second, the overhead rate prescribed by the Departmental accountants had been established without consultation with the technical cost officers on the amount of laboureffort that would be required by the production programme. Third,the Department had failed to take advantage of successiveopportunities, before agreeing prices, to verify how far their estimates of direct labour costs were confirmed by actual costs. A Departmentalinquiry had been instituted to ascertain the reasons for the failureof co-ordination within the Department which had made these errorspossible; and it would be necessary to consider, in the light of the findings of this inquiry, whether disciplinary action should be taken.Other measures had also been taken to improve the contractsorganisation within the Department. The accountants and thetechnical cost staffs, whose functions had been deliberately segregatedby a decision of the Labour Government in 1946, had now beenplaced under the supervision of a senior officer who would beresponsible for ensuring proper co-ordination between them. A reviewof contracts procedures had been instituted, with special referenceto the standard clauses which were incorporated in many contracts.New forms of incentive contract were under consideration; and thepossibility of employing independent expert consultants in connectionwith the administration of the more complex contracts was being examined. These measures should enable the Government to sustaintheir position during the debate on the Opposition Vote of Censure,provided that they made it clear that, if further action was shown to benecessary by the second Report of the Lang Committee, which was expected later in the year, it would be put in hand without hesitation.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.Nevertheless, it seems doubtful whether the administrative controlof the technical staffs engaged in the supervision of increasinglycomplex technological contracts was adequate. The first Lang Reportconveyed an impression that decisions involving very substantial sums* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (64) 142)by the Foreign Secretary on the South American services of the british overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.).The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said that theChairman of B.O.A.C. had indicated that the Corporation^ presentservices down the East and West coasts of South America would not.O.A.C.Services toSouthAmerica(previous reference:CM. (64) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)CM. 43 (64)of public money had been taken, for practical purposes, by relativelyjunior technical staffs and that these staffs had been insufficientlyaware of the need to keep the progress of the work under constant review in relation to the original estimates of cost. A project of the size and complexity of the BLOODHOUND equipment should beplaced under the firm control of an individual who would beresponsible for its management at all stages and should be technicallycompetent to supervise the fixing of the prices with full knowledge ofall the factors involved. It was doubtful whether individuals of thiscalibre could be recruited at the rates of pay at present in force for thetechnical cost staffs of Departments. The question would need to beconsidered further when the second Lang Report was available.On the other hand the Government should not necessarily assume,during the forthcoming debate, the whole responsibility for the outcome of the Ferranti contracts. As the Lang Report made clear,the blame must be shared by the Company themselves, who had deliberately allowed work to proceed on the basis of prices which they knew would yield them an excessive profit. Moreover, the contract inquestion was one of very few contracts which had proved to cost lessthan had originally been estimated; and this fact, too, should not be ignored.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the attitude which government spokesmen in the debate should adopt if the Oppositionpressed for an inquiry into the premature disclosure by the Press ofinformation about both the Ferranti contracts and the recent negotiations with the British Overseas Airways Coporation (B.O.A.C.)on the modification of the Corporation^ order for VC.10 aircraft.Inquiries had established that, in the latter case, the mostcircumstantial account of the incident which had appeared in the Presscontained no elements which could not have been derived from information which had already been published. In the case of theFerranti contracts, however, certain of the facts which had been disclosed by the Press could only have been obtained from theCompany themselves. It was disquieting that enterprising journalismcould penetrate the Governmenfs confidential business to this extent.Nevertheless, no formal breach of the Official Secrets Acts was involved; and, since it was reasonably certain that none of theinformation concerned had been derived from official sources, theGovernment should firmly resist any proposal for an inquiry into the incident.The Cabinet-CD Invited the Government spokesmen in the forthcoming debate on the Opposition Vote of Censure on the Ferranticontracts to be guided by the considerations which had emerged during their discussion.(2) Agreed that the Government should resist any proposal thatan inquiry should be instituted into the premature disclosure by the Press of information relating both to these contracts and to the Governmenfs recent negotiations with the British Overseas airways corporation about the VC.10 aircraft.
pay their way in the foreseeable future and that the Corporation would therefore be compelled to withdraw them unless they were subsidisedby the Government to the extent of  1-6 million a year. Thewithdrawal of the services would be interpreted by public opinion inthe South American countries as denoting a lack of interest in their future as a market for United Kingdom goods; and this impressionwould be particularly unfortunate at a time when we were seeking to promote United Kingdom trade with South America and had recently announced a contribution of more than  7 million to theInter-American Development Bank. When the Cabinet had consideredthe question on a previous occasion (CM. (64) 39th Conclusions,Minute 3) it had been suggested that a subsidy to B.O.A.C. would be embarrassing in the light of the Governments decision in the previous year to refuse a subsidy to a United Kingdom passenger liner service to South America. A subsidy to a national airline, however, might properly be judged by reference to rather different criteria from thoseappropriate to a privately-owned shipping line. It had also beensuggested that B.O.A.C. might follow the example of other airlinesoperating on these routes by reducing their rates below the levelsprescribed by the International Air Transport Association (I.A.T.A.).This, however, would be objectionable in principle, particularly inview of the Governments recent insistence on the observance ofI.A.T.A. rules by United States airlines in relation to passenger fareson the North Atlantic services. Finally, it had been suggested that anysubsidy to B.O.A.C. should be charged to the Foreign Office Vote.This would be acceptable for a trial period, provided that the services were operated by the VC.10 aircraft and that, since the payment would constitute a subsidy to a United Kingdom industry, the ForeignOffice would not be expected to accept any corresponding reduction inthe total sum available for aid to foreign Governments.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Eagle Airways Limitedhad recently offered to operate the South American routes with VC.10aircraft at a lower cost than B.O.A.C. and had indicated that, if theGovernment were interested in this suggestion, they would submitspecific proposals after a more detailed study of the routes involved.Since it would clearly be unwise not to entertain this approach, weshould refrain from incurring any new commitment to B.O.A.C. inthe interim.The Minister of Transport said that a decision to subsidise an air service to South America would provoke a sharp reaction fromthe shipping industry. As a result of the Governments refusal in theprevious year to provide an annual subsidy of  300,000 to Royal MailLines Limited in respect of the Reina Del Mar the ship had been taken out of service on the South American route and three other ships ofthe Company on the same route might also have to be withdrawn.Shipping interests were now greatly concerned about the prospect that yet another subsidy might be provided to air transport,particularly in respect of services which were in competition withshipping lines.Discussion showed some support for the maintenance of a british air service to South America even at the cost of a subsidy. While EagleAirways should be encouraged to put forward a definite proposalfor consideration, the flying rights on the South American routeswere currently held by B.O.A.C.; and their transfer to another airlinecould not be assumed but would have to be negotiated. Moreover,these rights related to the use of Comets and Boeing 707s; and theoperation of vc10s would, similarly, have to be the subject of freshagreement. In these circumstances the wisest course might be to offerB.O.A.C. a subsidy for one year, which would allow sufficient timefor the examination of any alternative proposal which Eagle Airwaysmight submit in due course.
The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to seek to persuade the british overseas Airways Corporation to maintain their south american services for a limited period on the understandingthat the resultant expenditure would be taken into account in the forthcoming financial discussions between theGovernment and the Corporation.Company 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofLaw State for Industry (CP. (64) 156) on Company Law.(previous reference: The Secretary of State for Industry said that he had undertakenC.C. (59) 60th to inform the House of Commons before the Recess of theConclusions, Governments proposals on the principal issues raised by the reportMinute 2) Gf the Committee on Company Law under the chairmanship of LordJenkins. This could be done either by the publication of a White paper or by means of an Answer to a Parliamentary Question. The economic policy Committee had agreed that the Jenkins Report afforded a sound basis for a revision of company law; but, since the necessarilycomplex legislation required to implement the report could not beintroduced until the second Session of the new Parliament, they haddoubted whether it would be wise at this juncture to publish a detailed statement of the Governments intentions and, in particular, to expose the fact that on two of the problems raised by the report no decisionhad yet been taken. The first of these was the exemption of the privatelimited liability company from the obligation to publish its accounts.The Jenkins Committee&apos;s proposal that the exemption should be abolished might well be right in principle; but some aspects of theproblem required further consideration and in the meantime it mightbe embarrassing to commit the Government publicly to acceptance ofthe recommendation. The second problem concerned the exemptionsfrom disclosure of accounts enjoyed by banks, discount houses,insurance companies and shipping companies, some of which it was proposed to retain and others not. In the circumstances the best course seemed to be to make an announcement in the form of a written Reply to a Parliamentary Question on the lines of the draftappended to CP. (64) 156. This would sufficiently indicate that theGovernment accepted the Jenkins Committee&apos;s approach to the revision of company law, while proposing in some respects to go further than the Committee, whose report had been regarded in some quarters as unduly cautious.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.CM. 43 (64)On the other hand the maintenance of a United Kingdom airlineservice to South America had only a limited prestige value; and theobjections to a specific subsidy for this purpose were considerable.Since the Government would in any case have to negotiate a freshfinancial understanding with B.O.A.C. covering the whole of theCorporation^ activities, it would be preferable to seek to persuade them to maintain the services in question for a further few months onthe understanding that the expenditure entailed would be taken intoaccount in the general settlement. On this basis there should besufficient time for Eagle Airways to submit definite proposals and forthe Government to examine them before reaching a final decision.In further discussion it was generally agreed that the balanceof advantage lay in adopting this course.
In further discussion the following amendments to the draft statement appended to CP. (64) 156 were suggested:(a) Since not all private companies were industrial companies,it would be preferable to refer, in the second sentence of paragraph 2,to the Governments objective of greater economic, rather than greaterindustrial, efficiency.(b) In the third sentence of paragraph 2 the reference to beneficialshare ownerships should be redrafted in order to make it clear that what was in question was the shareholding of companies in other companies and not the disclosure of individual holdings of sharesthrough nominees.(c) In the same sentence the reference to securing greaterresponsibility in the formation of companies should be expanded tomake the Governments intentions explicit.(d) In the last paragraph the reference to the governments intention to enter into early discussion with banks and others might provoke the question why discussions had not already been initiated;and it would be preferable to substitute some such form of words as&quot; Before legislation is finally drafted the Government intend to enterinto discussions . . .&quot;.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal to announce the governments intentions as regards the report of the Committee onCompany Law by means of a Written Answer to a parliamentary Question.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to give furtherconsideration to the terms of the Answer in the light ofthe points made in their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th July, 1964.
