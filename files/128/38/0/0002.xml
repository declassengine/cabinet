Report ofthe RobbinsCommittee onHigherEducation(previous reference:CM. (63) 1stConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that the substantive proceedingswhich were now to take place in the House of Commons that day would have provided the Government with an opportunity to make their statement of policy on the recommendations of the Committeeon Higher Education if it had not already been arranged, inaccordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision at their earlier meeting, thatthis statement should be released to the Press. In the circumstancesthis release should be deferred until after the Prorogation ceremony;and the statement should thereafter be published, as a White paper for the information of Parliament, as soon as possible.The Cabinet-Agreed that the statement of the Government^ policy onthe   recommendations   of   the   Committee   on   higher education should be published as a White Paper as soonas possible after the Prorogation of Parliament.ForeignAffairsMorocco(previous reference:C.C. (62) 44thConclusions,Minute 3)WesternEuropeanUnion:ministerial meeting(previous reference:CM. (63) 1stConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the frontier conflict whichhad recently developed between Morocco and Algeria appeared tobe increasing, although its causes remained obscure. The King ofMorocco had now asked us for supplies of arms. It would be unwise to accede prematurely to this request, since the Algerian Governmentwere seeking to overthrow the monarchy in Morocco and it wouldbe of advantage to them to be able to represent the King of Moroccoas dependent on Western European support. If the position continuedto deteriorate, however, it might become necessary to consider thesupply to Morocco of purely defensive arms.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Agreed that, for the time being, no arms should be supplied to the Government of Morocco.The Foreign Secretary said that his initial discussions with theFrench Ambassador in London had confirmed his impression thatthe French Government would continue to adopt an unhelpfulattitude to the forthcoming discussions between the Foreign ministers of the member countries of the Western European Union. Inparticular, they were likely to oppose any proposals for further negotiations with the Soviet Government designed to lead to animprovement in East-West relations. The Foreign Minister ofBelgium, on the other hand, would probably be more favourably disposed towards further negotiations for this purpose and to urge that they should be continued. He would himself seek to use the^ CM. 2 (63)Parliamentary 1.   The Lord Privy Sea! informed the Cabinet that, whenBusiness Parliament   reassembled   that   day   for   the   Prorogation,   theGovernment^ decision to defer the Opening of the next Session until12th November would be contested in the House of Lords. Since the ceremony of Prorogation could not take place until after theconclusion of the ensuing debate, it had been agreed with the leader of the Opposition that a parallel debate should be arranged in theHouse of Commons. The Opposition were unlikely, however, to seek to divide the House.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.

.L 14. The Cabinet had before them a revised draft text of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament (CP. (63) 3).The Lord Privy Seal said that it would probably be unnecessary to omit from the Speech any of the references to future legislation which it now contained, since it should be possible to recover, byone means or another, the greater part of the Parliamentary time which would be lost by the postponement of the Opening of the new session.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In view of the fact that the Governmenfs attitude to therecommendations of the Committee on Higher Education was nowto be made public well in advance of the Debate on the Address andmight be expected to attract considerable public attention, it mightbe advisable to give greater prominence to this subject in the Speech.Any amendment for this purpose, however, would need to preserve the existing balance in the Speech between the references to economicand social measures respectively.(b) The references to the Governmenfs intention to providerelief to certain householders suffering hardship from increased ratesas the result of revaluation of their houses should be re-examined in the light of the position in Scotland.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, and other Ministers concerned, toarrange, in the light of the discussion, for the preparationof an amended text of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament.(2) Invited Ministers to forward to the Lord Privy Seal by28th October any other amendments which they might wish to suggest.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:CM. (63) 1stConclusions,Minute 3)public investment(previous reference:C.C. (62) 61stConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP. (63) 2), to which was appended a draft white Paper on civil public investment.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, following the precedent of recent years, the Government should shortly publish a white paper on civil public investment in 1964-65. The draft appended to CP. (63) 2 described developments since the previous White paper and indicated the Governments willingness to permit a furthersignificant increase in public investment in 1964-65, although therate of increase would be smaller than in the current year. The draftincluded for the first time a summary of the Governmenfs progressin ensuring, as far as possible, that nationalised industries secured a proper rate of return on capital, together with a description ofpublic investment expenditure on facilities for sport and physicalrecreation. The draft had been prepared on the assumption that, whenthe White Paper was published, the White Papers on the North-east of England and Central Scotland would already have been issued;and, since these would now be liable to be somewhat deferred, itforthcoming discussions to improve and extend the contacts betweenthe United Kingdom and the member countries of the european economic Community.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary.
would be necessary either to revise the draft of the White Paper on civil public investment or to reconsider the proposal to publish the text before the end of October.In discussion it was suggested that, since the Report of theCommittee on Higher Education had been published on the previous day and other White Papers on the problems of urban traffic andthe reorganisation of the British Overseas Airways corporation would probably be published in the near future, it might be appropriate that the White Paper on public investment should presentthe forthcoming increase in investment in a more positive light, asthe result of a forward policy to which many of the proposals in theother White Papers would eventually contribute. While the investment which they would involve would not arise, for the most part, until after 1964-65, it would be unfortunate if the White Paper implied,by an absence of appropriate references, that, in formulating the investment programme for that year, the Government had not takeninto account these and other plans for future development, includingthe prospective expansion of the housing programme to 400,000houses a year. If this approach were adopted, it might be wiser thatthe publication of the White Paper should follow, rather thanprecede, publication of the more specialised White Papers. In any event there might be advantage in delaying its publication until afterEducation Week, beginning on 11th November, in view of the criticism likely to be attracted by the apparent reduction in investmenton school buildings.On the other hand it was one of the principal purposes of theWhite Paper to make clear to public opinion the very substantial increases in investment to which the Government were already committed; and it would be desirable to establish this point without undue delay in order to forestall the demands for even greaterexpansion which would probably be provoked by the morespecialised White Papers. Even so, it might be desirable to take steps,either by expanding Part I of the White Paper or by offering an appropriate explanation during the Debate in the House of Commons,to present the White Paper&apos;s proposals in a rather wider context,to which discussion of the subsequent White Papers on particular areas of investment could be related.In further discussion it was suggested that the White Papermight include references to the Government^ intention to affordlocal authorities greater access to the Public Works Loan Board andto the proposal, shortly to be announced by the Minister ofAgriculture, that local authorities should be eligible to receive grants to assist them in rebuilding markets. Some explanation should alsobe provided of striking reductions in investment, e.g., in the case ofthe Atomic Energy Authority.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thedraft White Paper should be reconsidered in the light of the points which had been raised, with the object of placing investment for1964-65 in the context of a positive policy of expansion, in which thetopics dealt with in the other prospective White Papers would beseen to have their place.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Chief Secretary, Treasury,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, tore-examine the draft White Paper appended to CP. (63) in the light of the discussion and to give furtherconsideration to the timing of its publication in relationto the forthcoming publication of other White papers on related issues.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Indonesia(previous reference:C.C. (63) 60thConclusions,Minute 1)Export credit facilities(previous reference:C.C. (63) 53rdConclusions,Minute 1)6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (63) 184) on export credit facilitiesfor trade with Indonesia.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the current liabilities of the Export Credits Guarantee Department in respect of trade withIndonesia amounted to some  250,000 for short-term business and 14 million for long-term business. The amount of new short-termbusiness was small; and there was no reason to depart from thenormal practice whereby facilities for such business were providedwithout restriction. Applications for long-term cover, however, shouldbe scrutinised with particular care, in the light of the continuingtension in South-East Asia; and the position should be reviewed ina few weeks time.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (63) 184.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary and the Secretaryof State for Industry, Trade and Regional Development,would arrange for the provision of credit facilities for trade with Indonesia to be kept under close and continuous review.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th October, 1963.
