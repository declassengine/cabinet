Malta(previous reference:CM. (64) 35thConclusions,Minute 5)The Cabinet resumed their discussion about the independence of Malta.The Colonial Secretary said that, if no agreement was reached in the current negotiations, the Prime Minister of Malta,Dr. Borg Olivier, would attribute their failure to our insistence onretaining, in the projected defence agreement, a right to deploynuclear weapons in the island if circumstances so required. In that event the effect on our right to deploy nuclear weapons in otherparts of the world might be almost as damaging as the effect ofacceding to Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s request for an assurance that we wouldnot maintain a nuclear stockpile in Malta. Moreover, althoughagreement had not yet been reached on the question of theconstitutional status and privileges of the Roman Catholic Churchand we for our part might seek to emphasise that this was the reasonfor the breakdown of the negotiations, public opinion would be more likely to concentrate on the failure to conclude a defence agreement and we should be accused of refusing to grant Malta the independencewhich we had promised nearly a year ago because the maltese government were unwilling to allow us to establish a nuclear baseoff the coast of Africa. Seen in this light,, a refusal to grant Maltaindependence at this stage in the negotiations would be liable to damage our relations with African countries and to discredit any statement which we might make, during the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers which was about to begin, about our intentions to grant independence to our remaining colonial territories as soon as possible.On the other hand, if Dr. Borg Olivier sought to resolve the deadlock by offering to accept independence for Malta without either a financial agreement or a defence agreement, we should inevitablyfind ourselves still obliged to assume some measure of financial responsibility for the island without obtaining the benefit of thedefence facilities which had now been agreed, apart from the issue ofour right to maintain a stockpile of nuclear weapons in the island, ifnecessary.In these circumstances it might be best to seek to compromise on the basis of a private assurance to Dr. Borg Olivier that, apartfrom the temporary storage of nuclear weapons in transit, we hadno foreseeable requirement to maintain a nuclear stockpile in Maltabut that, if at any time, owing to changed circumstances, we should wish to do so, we would consult with, or seek the agreement of, theGovernment of Malta.The Secretary of State for Defence said that it was very unlikelythat such an assurance would remain secret. But, if it became public knowledge, it would constitute a very damaging departure from theprinciple, which both the United Kingdom and the United states government had hitherto maintained, that we refused either to confirm or to deny the presence of nuclear weapons in any particularbase. While it might prove impossible to maintain this principleindefinitely, it would be a very grave step to depart from itunilaterally; and we should not contemplate action of this kindexcept after full consultation with the United States authorities.Moreover, any concession in the case of Malta could not fail to havefar-reaching repercussions on our right to deploy nuclear weapons inbases in other parts of the world and would be liable to expose us topressures which would be unacceptable but difficult to resist.In any case it was unlikely that Parliament would be preparedto approve Malta&apos;s independence unless satisfactory agreement hadbeen reached on the religious issue. In further discussion withdraw. Borg Olivier, therefore, we could justifiably maintain that in the short time available in the remainder of the current Parliamentary
session it would be impossible to enact a measure of such importance and that there was now no alternative to postponing further negotiations on the outstanding issues until the autumn.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If Dr. Borg Olivier&apos;s Government fell, Mr. Mintoff was likelyto come to power. Despite his close relations with the United arab republic (U.A.R.) and the Soviet Union, it would be difficult torefuse independence to Malta indefinitely; and there was therefore a serious risk that in a few years time the island would be closely linked with the U.A.R. Such a development would have seriousstrategic implications for the United Kingdom. It followed that itwas to our advantage to support Dr. Borg Olivier as far as possible.On the other hand, while he might be brought to accept, in the last resort, an amendment to the Constitution in relation to the status and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church, he appeared to be compelled by internal political reasons to insist on obtaining asatisfactory assurance that nuclear weapons would not be stockpiledin the island. Nevertheless, there was at present no significant popularagitation in Malta about nuclear weapons.(b) Time was available in the current Parliamentary session topass the necessary legislation granting independence to Malta, butonly if the Bill was wholly uncontroversial. In view of the religiousissue and the absence of a defence agreement, however, this was unlikely to be the case; and there was now insufficient time beforethe end of the session to consult the United States Governmentand, if necessary, the authorities of the North Atlantic treaty organisation about any alteration in the established policy of refusing to confirm or to deny the presence of nuclear weapons in specific oversea bases.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in this difficult situation it seemed preferable, on balance, to postponefurther discussions on Malta&apos;s independence until the autumn. Itmight be desirable, however, not to bring the current negotiations to an abrupt conclusion during the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters; and it would therefore be best that Dr. Borg Olivier shouldbe informed at an appropriate point that, while significant progress had been achieved in negotiating the terms of Malt.a&apos;s independence,there were still several outstanding issues which made it impossibleto pass the necessary legislation during the remainder of the currentParliamentary session. It was our hope, however, that full agreement would be reached on these issues when discussions were resumed in the autumn.The Cabinet Endorsed the views expressed by the Prime Minister inhis summing up and invited the Colonial Secretary to be guided by them and by the general sense of their discussion in his further negotiations with Dr. Borg Olivier about theindependence of Malta.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th July, 1964.
