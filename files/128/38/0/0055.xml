Postmen&apos;s Pay(previous reference:CM. (64) 40thConclusions,Minute 3)*1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the questionof postmen&apos;s pay. They had before them the draft of a statement bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed to makea fresh approach to the Secretary of the Union of Post Office Workers,Mr. Smith, on the basis of the draft statement. This indicated thatthe Government could not negotiate with the Union while the threat of a strike existed; that, if this threat was withdrawn, the Governmentwould be prepared to negotiate on the basis of advancing some part of the 34j per cent wage increase which was due on 1st January,1965, under their existing offer; that the proposed pay investigationwould be completed by 1st January, 1965; and that on that date the postmen would receive the balance of the 3-J- per cent, togetherwith any additional amount recommended by the pay investigation.This proposal would fully implement the Report of the Committeeon the Pay of Postmen (the Armitage Report) and would be inaccordance with the accepted procedures for negotiation and settlement of Civil Service wages. Moreover, it left open the period to which the pay investigation would be related. It could be basedon outside rates of pay in the earlier period and its outcomeconsequently be backdated to 1st January, 1964; or, alternatively,it could be based on current rates of outside pay and its outcomecould take effect from 1st January, 1965. Since it appeared that the later pay investigations might be based on comparisons more advantageous to the postmen, the net outcome might be more acceptable to them.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the position whichmight arise if the maximum offer which the Government could contemplate in the course of negotiations proved unacceptable to theUnion. If the Union then carried out the strike which they had called, only an improvised postal service, based on voluntary labour,could be maintained. This would be likely to be wholly inadequate to the needs of business and industry. If the Forces were used tomaintain a service, the National Union of Railwaymen might calla sympathetic strike; and this would necessitate the declaration of aState of Emergency, which would require Parliament to remainsitting.Some difference of view was expressed about the rate of increase for 1964 which the Government could contemplate under the termsof the new proposal. On the one hand it was suggested that, in viewof the demand by the Union for an increase of 10^- per cent in the face of the Governmenfs existing offer of 4 per cent, it was improbable that anything less than the median of these two extremes would be acceptable to the Union. Since this would absorb the whole of the1\ per cent available for the first two years under the Governmenfsproposal, there would be strong pressure for a further increase from 1st January, 1965. It also seemed improbable that any lesserrate would then be acceptable to the Union as the outcome of negotiations on the basis of the pay investigation. On the otherhand it could be maintained that an increase of this order was quiteunjustified on the merits of the case, would be unacceptable to aconsiderable body of opinion both in Parliament and outside andwould have widespread repercussions. The precise figure could bedetermined only in the course of negotiations with the Union.Moreover, there were further variations which might lead to a more generally acceptable offer on the basis of an initial increase of morethan 4 per cent, back-dated to 1st January, 1964, coupled with afurther increase within the range of 1\ per cent, dated from theconclusion of the negotiations. This possibility, too, could be exploredin the further exchanges with the Union.
In further discussion the following additional points were made:(a) The statement to be made to the Union should not be opento misunderstanding as accepting the Union&apos;s case on the time likelyto be taken for the completion of the pay investigation. This could in fact be completed within a short period, if the Union gave their co-operation; and it would be preferable merely to say that on anyview the investigation would be completed by 1st January, 1965.(b) The reference in the draft statement to a withdrawal of the threat to strike by the Union as a condition of the Governmentswillingness to renew negotiations might be omitted from any publishedstatement, although the Chancellor of the Exchequer would no doubtmake the point to the Union in discussion.(c) It would also be preferable to omit the reference to the factthat the new proposal was in accordance with the accepted procedures for negotiation and settlement of Civil Service wages and to confine the statement given to Mr. Smith to a factual indication of the basis on which the Government were prepared to negotiate.(d) There might be advantage in publishing the statementimmediately the Chancellor of the Exchequer had seen Mr. Smith,in order to forestall any misrepresentation by the Press of the courseof the discussion. On the other hand this might be disadvantageousin so far as it might be preferable to allow the Union an opportunityto consider the offer before it became public. This was an issue whichcould best be decided in the light of the course of the initial discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Smith.(e) It would be preferable that the discussion which had beenarranged between the Prime Minister and the Leader of theOpposition should approximately coincide with any discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Smith.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided, inhis forthcoming interview with the Secretary of the Unionof Post Office Workers, by the points made in their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of the subject ofpostmen&apos;s pay at a subsequent meeting.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Parliament would be adjourned on Friday, 31st July.The Rolls 3.   The Secretary of State for Industry informed the CabinetRazor that he had hitherto deferred a decision on the desirability of company instituting an enquiry under the Companies Act into the affairs of rolls Razor Limited in order to avoid prejudicing such opportunitiesas the company might still have to retrieve some part of its fortunes.It was now clear, however, that there would be no advantage in further delay and that an enquiry should be put in hand forthwith.He proposed, therefore, to make an announcement to this effect inthe House of Commons that afternoon.In discussion there was general agreement in principle with thissuggestion. Some doubt was expressed, however, whether it wouldbe proper to institute a statutory enquiry while liquidation of thecompany was in process.
ForeignAffairsSoviet UnionCyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 38thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Foreign Secretary said that during his visit to moscow in the following week he would take the opportunity to ascertainhow far the Soviet Government were prepared to pursue thepossibility, in which they had recently shown some interest, that anagreement on the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons might be negotiated.In discussion it was suggested that in any exchanges with theSoviet Government on this subject we should need to be continuouslymindful of the inter-connection between an agreement on non-dissemination and the proposed multilateral nuclear force. It was becoming increasingly clear that the interest which the federal german Government were displaying in the latter concept derivedfrom their conviction that, if such a force could be successfullyestablished, it would provide them with the opportunity to acquiresome degree of substantive control over nuclear weapons. The SovietGovernment remained wholly opposed to any development of thiskind; and their attitude towards an agreement on non-disseminationwould be liable to be considerably influenced by the extent to whichthey believed that we were simultaneously pursuing a course whichmight give the Federal German authorities the effective disposition of nuclear weapons. It was the more important, therefore, to adhere to the principle that the nuclear warheads in any multilateral force which might be created would remain exclusively under United States,and possibly United Kingdom, control.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it had emerged from the discussions which he and the Foreign Secretary had justconcluded with the Prime Minister of Greece, M. Papandreou, thatthe Greek Government favoured a solution of the problem of Cyprusby means of Enosis, coupled with an arrangement whereby thesettlement would be in some sense guaranteed by the North atlantic treaty Organisation. In return they would be prepared to cede to turkey a small island off the Turkish coast. The Turkish Government,on the other hand, were showing increasing interest in a solution basedon a partition of Cyprus, whereby they would exercise sovereignty over an area in the north-east of the Island.Liability ofOperatorsof Nuclear-poweredShips(previous reference:CM. (64) 30thConclusions,Minute 7)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Education and Science (CP. (64) 150) on the implications of legislation establishing the principle of the sole andabsolute liability of operators of nuclear-powered ships.The Secretary of State for Education and Science recalled thaton 6th June the Cabinet had agreed that legislation establishing this principle should be prepared and had invited him to arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the possible implications ofsuch legislation in the light of the considerations which the Ministerof Transport had advanced in CP. (64) 111. This task had beenCM. 41 (64)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, to give further considerationto the propriety of instituting a statutory enquiry intothe affairs of a company while it was in process ofliquidation.(2) Agreed that, subject to the results of the action to be taken under Conclusion (1) above, an enquiry should now be instituted under the Companies Act into the affairs of rolls Razor Limited.
undertaken by a working party of officials, whose report was annexed to CP. (64) 150. Most of the Departments concerned were in favourof early legislation to implement the Brussels Convention of 1962on the Liability of Operators of Nuclear Ships; but the Ministry ofTransport remained of the opinion that it would be better not to commit ourselves at this stage on the grounds that our interests would be liable to change if we developed a fleet of nuclear-poweredmerchant ships and that it was not entirely clear that legislation would substantially improve our present position in relation to warships.In discussion it was pointed out that, at least for the present,our interests lay in protecting our conventional ships from the liabilitywhich they might incur in existing circumstances in respect of damageresulting from a collision with a nuclear-powered warship and in providing support in our domestic legislation for claims under theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Status of ForcesAgreement and the Holy Loch Agreement for compensation on thebasis of the sole and absolute liability of the operator. On the otherhand, since the problems of compensation for nuclear incidentsinvolving warships were closely bound up with our relations withthe United States, it would be important to ensure, by consultationwith the United States Administration at the appropriate time, that by introducing legislation we should in fact improve our ability toobtain adequate compensation for any incident in which one of theirwarships was involved. It would be necessary, in drafting the proposed legislation, to have regard not only to the implementation of the brussels Convention but to the position under the NATO Status of forces Agreement; and for this purpose a copy of the instructions which had been sent to Parliamentary Counsel should be supplied to the Lord Chancellor.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasagreed that the preparation of the proposed Bill should proceedwith a view to its introduction in the next Session of Parliament. Itwould be necessary to consult the United States Administration before a final decision on its introduction was taken; but consultation shouldbe deferred until Ministers had had an opportunity of consideringthe draft Bill.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for the circulation to the Legislation Committee as soon as possible of a draft Bill on the liability of operators of nuclear-poweredships.Compensationfor formerPublicServants inthe Federationof rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:CM. (64) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (64) 153) about compensation for members of thePublic Service of the former Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland,to which was annexed a note on the possibilities of improving thesettlement which had been made in this regard.The Lord Chancellor said that, after full examination of the issues involved, he was satisfied that the Government were under no legal or moral obligation to members of the former federal public Service. As regards those individuals who had originally beenmembers of Her Majesty&apos;s Overseas Civil Service (H.M.O.C.S.) inthe service of the Territorial Governments, it had been made clear to them when they joined the Federal Service that they would therebycease to be members of H.M.O.C.S. and that their future would nolonger be the responsibility of the United Kingdom Government.They had also had a period of two years on compulsory secondmentfrom the Territorial Services, followed by a further three yearscontinued secondment, in which to decide whether they wished to
join the Federal Service on this condition. Moreover, on the dissolution of the Federation all five Governments concerned had agreed on the compensation settlement for the individuals affected.This provided that, where comparable employment was availablebut an officer did not wish to take advantage of it, he should beallowed to retire on pension earned to date but without any additionalpayment in respect of abolition of office. The Government of nyasaland, however, wished to pursue a policy of Africanisationof their Public Service; and all the Governments had agreed that here,and elsewhere where for any other reason comparable employmentwas not available, redundant officers should be allowed to retireon pensions earned to date, together with the &quot; abolition of office &quot;addition, which under Federal pensions legislation amounted to one-third of pension earned. No improper pressure had been exertedby the United Kingdom Government representatives in reaching this settlement; and it was difficult to establish the grounds on which itwas now being criticised in the House of Lords. But the criticismseemed to derive mainly from a belief that the United KingdomGovernment were responsible for the dissolution of the federation and should therefore accept full responsibility for the treatment ofmembers of the former Federal Public Service. We could not afford to accept either of these contentions. If it was nevertheless judgednecessary to make some concession, the least damaging of thepossibilities examined in the note annexed to CP. (64) 153 was thesuggestion that some form of additional cash compensation forredundant officers should be provided at United Kingdom expense.Even this, however, would be liable to have wide repercussions; and,on balance, it would be wiser to adhere firmly to the terms of theoriginal settlement.The Foreign Secretary suggested that, if necessary, government spokesmen in the House of Lords might undertake that theGovernment would consult the Territorial Governments about theworking of the scheme which had been established to relieve hardshipamong redundant members of the former Federal Public Service.But this offer should be made only in the last resort.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Comparisons were liable to be drawn between the treatmentaccorded to members of the former Federal Public Service and thataccorded either to members of the H.M.O.C.S. when the territories in which they served reached the stage of self-government or to members of the Public Service of the former Federation of the west indies when this, too, had been dissolved. Such comparisons, however,were not well founded. In the former case we bore a special responsibility; in the latter case lump sum compensation had beenprovided on the initiative of the local Governments concerned,whereas on the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland the Territorial Governments had adopted a contraryattitude.(b) The original settlement might be criticised on the score thatthe concept of comparable employment lacked reality in thecircumstances of the dissolution of the Federation, since european members of the former Federal Public Service who transferred to afinancially comparable post in a Territory might nevertheless suffersome diminution of their status and prospects in other respects. Onthe other hand, when the Government of Northern Rhodesia had subsequently decided to adopt a policy of Africanisation of theTerritorial Public Service, they had made special provision forformer members of the Federal Service who had opted to transfer to the Territorial Service; and this provision had constituted animprovement for those officers on the terms of the Federal PublicService Compensation Scheme.
i(c) The objections which had been raised to the terms of thesettlement owed as much to a general concern to ensure fair treatment for officers of United Kingdom origin serving overseas as to thedetails of the Federal settlement itself. Certain proposals which were under discussion as regards a United Kingdom guarantee of thesecurity of pension for former members of H.M.O.C.S. might thereforebe relevant to a defence of the Federal settlement. On the otherhand any reference to the possibility of action which might furthersafeguard the position of former members of H.M.O.C.S. would be liable merely to emphasise the contrast between their treatment andthat of members of the former Federal Public Service.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 153.(2) Agreed that it would be undesirable in principle to offer any concession in respect of the terms of the compensation which had been provided for members of the PublicService of the former Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland.The Queen&apos;s 7.   The Cabinet had before them Notes by the Lord Privy SealSpeeches (CP. (64) 151 and 152), to which were appended drafts of the queen&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and on the Opening ofParliament respectively.The Cabinet approved a number of amendments to the draft speech circulated under cover of CP. (64) 151. They agreed that the paragraph referring to the recent Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters should be redrafted in more positive terms; that the reference to the health of the economy in paragraph 13 should bere considered nearer to the date of delivery of the Speech; and thatit would be desirable to incorporate a reference to developments inthe health and welfare services.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to provide the Prime minister in due course with a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s speech on the Prorogation of Parliament, taking account of thepoints made in their discussion, for submission to the queen.In discussion of the draft Speech circulated under cover of cp. (64) 152 it was agreed that a further draft, prepared in the lightof any suggestions which Ministers might make to the Lord privy seal before the beginning of September, should be submitted to theCabinet about the middle of that month. It would be for consideration whether the new draft should include a reference to the Governmentscontinued support of the principles of a wider European unity.In further discussion there was general agreement on theimportance of making rapid progress with the preparation oflegislation required for introduction early in the new Session. Itmight be necessary for the Legislation Committee to meet during september in order to consider draft Bills.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate, for consideration inSeptember, a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament, taking account of any proposals and amendments submitted to him by Ministers duringthe next few weeks.(3) Invited the Ministers responsible for the preparation oflegislation for the following Session of Parliament toensure, as a matter of urgency, that work upon draftBills proceeded as rapidly as possible.
public order(previous reference:CM. (64) 38thConclusions,Minute 5)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (64) 154) on the protection of distinguished visitorsfrom abroad.The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet at their meetingon 16th July had invited him to consider whether any action was required to intensify the protection for important visitors to thiscountry against molestation or embarrassment. The degree ofprotection afforded to a foreign visitor varied with the risks to whichit was thought that he would be exposed. The Prime Minister of kenya, Mr. Kenyatta, who had been attacked in London in theprevious week, had visited this country on earlier occasions without incident; and it had not been thought that during his latest visithe would require more than a single personal bodyguard, togetherwith a uniformed police officer stationed at the entrance to his hotel.To arrange for uniformed officers to form a cordon between avisitors hotel and his motor car would not be in accordance with themanner in which foreign visitors were normally treated in thiscountry, except when the presence of Royalty was thought likely to attract large crowds. The Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis,however, proposed to arrange that in future at least one officer ofthe Special Branch of the Metropolitan Police should be stationednear the entrance of the place at which an eminent foreign visitorwas staying; and this, in addition to the protection already afforded,seemed adequate to prevent incidents such as the assault on mr. Kenyatta. As regards demonstrations the police had power to restrain demonstrators only if they believed that they would be able,if necessary, to satisfy a court that they had grounds for apprehendinga breach of the peace or obstruction of the highway. The policethemselves regarded their powers as adequate; and to increase them would necessitate highly controversial legislation to curtail the rightof peaceful demonstration, which would be contrary to this country&apos;stradition of civil liberty.In discussion it was suggested that the law recognised no rightof peaceful demonstration but only a right to pass and re-pass along the highway. So long as demonstrators did this without causingobstruction, however, the fact that they carried offensive bannersdid not constitute a ground for intervention unless the reaction ofthe public was such that a breach of the peace was to be apprehended.Public criticism was normally directed to what was regarded asexcessive interference by the police rather than the reverse.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theadditional precautions which the Commissioner of Police proposedto take for the protection of eminent foreign visitors appeared to be adequate; and, since it was clear that no legislation could beintroduced in the remainder of the lifetime of the present Parliament,it was unnecessary to come to any immediate decision on the questionwhether any further steps should be taken to protect foreign visitorsfrom being embarrassed by demonstrations.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of CP. (64) 154.StationingCosts(previous reference:CM. (64) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 155), on stationing costs in Germany,to which was appended a draft agreement on this subject betweenthe United Kingdom Government and the Federal Government ofGermany.The Chief Secretary said that these drafts, which had beenaccepted without amendment by the Federal German Government,
would constitute a settlement in accordance with the objective whichthe Cabinet had approved, namely that we should seek to reach agreement for a two-year period on the basis of a formula whereby the Federal Government would undertake in general terms to do their best to offset, by their military and civil purchases, the continuingburden on our balance of payments arising from our military expenditure in Germany and would also undertake so to direct their defence procurement planning in the longer term that their defenceorders might offset this expenditure. Moreover, the federal government had now agreed to forego their earlier proposal thatthe agreement should be accompanied by a confidential exchange of letters whereby we would recognise that they would be unlikely tobe able to make purchases at a higher level than DM350 million ayear. This was a not unsatisfactory settlement; and, although it contained no specific figure for the amount of the military and civilpurchases by the Federal Government, an agreement which was inother respects acceptable was certainly preferable to an agreementincorporating an unduly low figure as the limit of such purchases.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (64) 155 about the termson which the Government should conclude a freshagreement with the Federal Government of Germanyabout the balance of payments costs of our forces inGermany.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to arrange to announce the details of this agreement, preferably in answer to a written Parliamentary Question on 27th July.The kennedy round(previous reference:CM. (64) 25thConclusions,Minute 5)10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 149) about the kennedy round.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the discussions onthe Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations were developing in an increasingly unsatisfactory manner and, as regards agriculture, had reached virtual deadlock. The French Government were determined to effect considerable technological improvements in their agricultural industry before making any concessions on the degree of agriculturalprotection which they maintained; and they were resolved to retainby all possible means their position as, in effect, the granary of theEuropean Economic Community (E.E.C.). The United StatesGovernment were equally determined that the Kennedy Roundshould include genuine negotiations on agricultural trade and thatfor this purpose the lists of proposed exceptions from tariff reductions which the participating countries were due to table by Novembershould include agricultural, as well as industrial, exceptions. despite this situation we must seek to ensure that the negotiations remained in being until the General Election had taken place in this countryand the Presidential election in the United States was over. Thereafterit would probably be necessary to arrange for the position to be reviewed by Ministers of the participating countries early in 1965in an attempt to restore the momentum of the negotiations. At thesame time we could not ignore the possibility that the wholeenterprise might founder in the autumn: and it was therefore desirable that we should now begin to study in detail the implications of its collapse and the alternative courses of action which would thenbe open to us.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Itwas fortunate that our own agricultural policies, particularly in sofar as they incorporated assurances of access to the United Kingdom
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd July, 1964.market to foreign suppliers, absolved us from any blame for the deadlock which had now developed in the agricultural sector of thenegotiations.In further discussion it was suggested that, even if the negotiationsas a whole finally broke down, we might have a fresh opportunity e.g., by reaching a low-tariff agreement with the United States andthe member-countries of the European Free Trade Association(EFTA) to compel the French Government to adopt more liberalpolicies. On the other hand it would not necessarily be to our advantage to side openly with the United States against the E.E.C.,since the latter offered us a more favourable market for our exportsthan the United States; and, if we adopted policies which might provoke the Community to discriminate against us by way of retaliation, our exports would be liable to suffer and we should bemore likely to promote increased unity among the member countries of the E.E.C. than to detach the rest of them from France. Moreover,we should risk disrupting the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 149.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to arrange for officials to prepare, for submission to Ministers after theforthcoming General Election, a study of the implications of a collapse of the negotiations in the Kennedy Roundand of the alternative courses of action which would beopen to us in that event.
