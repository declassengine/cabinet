Cyprus 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that, after the recent attacks by(Previous       Greek Cypriot forces on certain Turkish Cypriot strongholds in the reference:      Island, an uneasy truce had been re-established; elements of the cm. (64) 42nd United Nations peace-keeping force had been interposed between theConclusions,    Greek and Turkish troops; and there appeared to be some prospectMinute 2)       that th.e Government of Cyprus would allow supplies of food and drink to be sent to the isolated Turkish communities. Meanwhile, thenegotiations at Geneva continued; and the Greek and turkish governments were discussing alternative means whereby, if a politicalsolution were found in the form of Enosis, Turkey might be compensated by the creation of a Turkish base on the Island. Theprospects of ultimate agreement on this basis, however, were notbright. Moreover, the position had been complicated by the fact thatthe  United  Nations  mediator,  M.  Tuomioja,  had  now  beenincapacitated by illness and was unlikely to resume his functions.The Secretary-General of the United Nations proposed that these should be assumed by Signor Spinelli; and we should acquiesce inthis appointment.In addition the Soviet Government had given certain publicindications that they proposed to concern themselves with the problemof Cyprus. Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow did not considerthat these were a prelude to physical intervention in Cyprus by theSoviet Union; but there were some signs that the Government of cyprus were in active contact with the Soviet Government and this aspect of the situation would need to be kept under close review. TheUnited States Government had suggested that the three GuarantorPowers should formally repudiate the Soviet statement. But it wouldappear to be wiser to seek to move the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations to remind the Soviet Government of the security council resolution of 9th August, deprecating the intervention of third parties in the Cypriot dispute; and, in agreement with the UnitedStates Government, we were proceeding accordingly.It would also be desirable that we should now take some initiative in the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) in order to avertthe growing risk of war between Greece and Turkey and the dangers to the North Atlantic Alliance which such a development would entail.By these means we might hope to hold the position in the Islandfor a further period. But it was becoming increasingly urgent thatsome political solution should be found; and it was therefore very desirable to ascertain whether the Greek Government still adhered tothe assurance, which they had recently given us, that their objective was to ensure Enosis and that they would be prepared, if necessary,to supplant Archbishop Makarios for this purpose or whether theyhad now capitulated in effect to the Archbishop&apos;s own view thatCyprus should become a unitary and independent State.In discussion there was general agreement that an independentCyprus would represent an unwelcome threat to our strategic interestsin the eastern Mediterranean and that we should therefore seek tosecure a solution based on Enosis, coupled with some form ofcompensation to Turkey for the loss of her position in the Island andthe provision of safeguards for those Turkish Cypriots who mightchoose to remain in Cyprus even after Enosis. These members ofthe Turkish community could not hope to enjoy, under any future settlement, the constitutional privileges which they had been accordedunder the Zurich and London Agreements. But they must at least be assured of protection for their lives and property; and for thispurpose it might be necessary to arrange for some form of inter-national control over the police forces of Cyprus for some years afterthe settlement and also to ensure that whatever military bases in the
Island might be reserved for Turkey would constitute an asylum forTurkish Cypriots in the event of renewed communal tension.It was now urgent to reach a final settlement, whether on this basis or on the lines of some other acceptable solution. OtherwiseArchbishop Makarios would be left free to pursue his objective, whichwas becoming increasingly clear, of deferring a solution until he could secure, at the forthcoming meeting of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations, a resolution in favour of a unitary and independentCyprus. His determination to proceed in this manner would have been strengthened by the intervention of the Soviet Government; and, inso far as the Soviet action might have served to restrain the TurkishGovernment, it would also have reduced the sense of urgency withwhich the Greek Government had approached the problem at an earlier stage and would have disposed them to feel that it was less important to seek to hold Archbishop Makarios in check or even tosupplant him. In these circumstances we should give all possiblesupport to the negotiations in Genev a; and, in order to avoid creatingany impression that, apart from our support for those negotiations,we were being inactive, we might well take an initiative in NATO onthe lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary.Discussion then turned to the position of United kingdom nationals, including Service families, in Cyprus. The Cabinet were informed that, although the Commander, British Forces, Cyprus, had full authority to arrange for their evacuation by air from Nicosiaairport whenever he judged it necessary to do so, it could no longer be assumed that, if renewed fighting broke out in the Island and the airport came under attack, we should be able to implement the plans for this purpose. In these circumstances it was for consideration whether we should now order the evacuation of the individuals concerned forthwith; or whether we should plan to evacuate them without further delay, if it became clear that the Geneva negotiations were about to break down; or whether we should take no immediate action but should keep the situation under daily review in the lightof developments both in the Island itself and in the various centres ofinternational negotiation about the problem. If we removed the families at once, we might increase tension in the Island and jeopardise the prospects of a political solution. Similarly, if we declared publicly that we should evacuate them if the Geneva discussions broke down,we might appear to cast doubt on the prospects of success for thediscussions themselves. On balance it seemed unlikely that the GreekGovernment would risk attempting a landing to seize Nicosia airport,since the troops involved would be within striking distance of Turkishaircraft based on the mainland. It was perhaps equally unlikely thatTurkish aircraft would attack the airport unless Greek forces, bytrying to occupy it, presented themselves as a target. There was stillsome chance, therefore, that, even if renewed fighting broke out inthe Island, we could hold the airport for a sufficient length of timeto enable us to evacuate the United Kingdom families; and in thesecircumstances it would be wiser to refrain from any overt action atthe present time but to keep the situation under close review and tobe prepared to evacuate the families forthwith if the Genevanegotiations broke down. In addition arrangements should be madeto ensure that an alternative plan for evacuation by road was available,even though it was unlikely that such a plan would prove practicable in the event.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by their discussion in seeking to provide full United Kingdom support forthe current negotiations in Geneva about the future of cyprus.
Prison 2.   The Home Secretary said that the Birmingham Police wereAdministration conducting a thorough investigation into the escape from WinsonEscape of a Green Prison of Charles Wilson, who was serving a sentence ofPrisoner from 30 years imprisonment for his part in the recent mail train robbery.Winson Green xhe men convicted of complicity in the robbery had been dispersed,Prison after tne dismissal of their appeals, among several security prisonsand were subject to the special precautions normally taken in the caseof prisoners who were believed to be likely to attempt to escape. a preliminary investigation by a senior officer of the Prison Departmentof the Home Office had indicated that Wilson&apos;s escape had probably been procured by accomplices who had scaled the wall of the prisonand unlocked both the external doors and the prison cell. this involved the use of a series of keys, one of which was kept underparticularly stringent security safeguards. This suggested that therehad been collusion between Wilson&apos;s accomplices and some individualwithin the prison. Apart from this possibility, there was no evidenceof failure to take proper security precautions, although a certainweakness, possibly unconnected with the escape, had been found inthe security arrangements. The other prisons at which persons convicted of offences connected with the robbery were detained hadbeen instructed to review their security arrangements and to increase their precautions in consultation with the local Chief Constables.In discussion it was suggested that escape might be rendered moredifficult in future by the use of dogs to patrol prisons externally andof electronic devices such as closed-circuit television. Dogs could notbe used, however, without handlers and a consequent call on scarcemanpower; and, while various electronic devices were currently thesubject of experiments, they were of limited value since, unless theycould be brought to a high level of reliability, there was a risk thatthey would merely create a false sense of security. The imposition ofmore stringent restrictions on prisoners themselves, particularly asregards visits by relatives and friends, was liable to be criticised asunnecessarily harsh. It might be necessary, however, to considerbuilding special prisons of a higher degree of security for prisonersserving very long sentences and those sentenced under the HomicideAct, 1957, to life imprisonment for murder.The Cabinet Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek to arrange, at his discretion, a meeting of the North Atlantic treaty organisation Ministerial Council in order to discussdevelopments in relation to Cyprus.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain whether the GreekGovernment adhered to their earlier policy of seeking topromote a solution of the problem of Cyprus by means ofEnosis.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the Commonwealth Secretary and theMinister of Defence for the Royal Air Force, would keep under close review, in the light of their discussion, thearrangements for evacuating United Kingdom civiliansfrom Cyprus.
3. The Cabinet were informed that the Trade statistics for July,which would be published on the following day, showed a reductionof  17 million in exports and  43 million in imports as compared withJune. The adverse trade balance, although less than that for June, was higher than in the early months of the year. The three-monthly figures,which provided a more reliable indication of long-term trends, showed that the adverse trade balance was continuing to grow, although at a diminishing rate. There was reason to think that the figures for Augustwould present a somewhat similar picture.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th August, 1964.The EconomicSituationTrade Figures
