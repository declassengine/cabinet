Foreign Affairs 2. The Minister with Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said that weLaos were maintaining our efforts to convene a conference on Laos on the(Previous        nnes proposed by the Polish Government and that, although the reference:      chances of success were uncertain, this course still appeared to offerCM. (64) 30th the most hopeful prospect of ending the present hostilities.Conclusions.Minute 4)Spanish&apos;decision The Minister without Portfolio said that the prospectiveto build United arrangements for the manufacture in Spain of United Kingdom typeKingdom type frigates and for the sale of United Kingdom equipment to Spain towarships a possible]e value of  10 million over six years might well be jeopardisedby recent untimely disclosures in the Press. This would be a damagingdevelopment; and, if it proved unavoidable, it would be forconsideration whether the Government should give some publicindication of the value of the orders which our industry was losing asa result of partisan criticism of our policy as regards the supply ofarms to other countries.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the United states under-Secretary of State, Mr. Ball, had made no reference in his recent discussions in London to the possibility that the United StatesSixth Fleet should intervene in order to prevent a Turkish invasion of Cyprus.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements by the Minister without portfolio (Lord Carrington) and by the commonwealth secretary.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was becoming increasingly concerned by the new threat to the Borneo territories which might be latent in the projected Summit meeting between the heads of Government of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines. Itwas doubtful whether we could rely on the good faith of the indonesian Government in this matter; and it was more probablethat they would use the interval provided by the Summit meeting, asthey had used the period of the earlier &quot; cease-fire &quot; agreement, toincrease their subversive forces in the Borneo Territories by covertmeans while we should feel inhibited from taking appropriatecounter-measures of our own.In discussion there was general agreement that, although weshould do nothing to hinder the prospective Summit meeting (whichmight have the important incidental advantage of re-establishingdiplomatic relations between Malaysia and the Philippines), weshould remain alert to the risks to which the Secretary of State for defence had drawn attention.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to keep the military position in the Borneo Territories under close review andto bring the matter before them again if it appeared thatthe prospective Summit meeting between the Heads ofGovernment of Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippineswas being used by the Indonesian Government to increasethe covert infiltration of the territories.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider the advisability of transmitting an appropriate warning to this effect to the Prime Minister of Malaysia.Cyprus(previous reference:CM.

265OUnited nations conference on trade andDevelopment(previous reference:CM. (64) 21stConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Secretary of State for Industry said that the united nations Conference on Trade and Development at Geneva had now reached its final stages. It had proved to be of greater political significance than we had orginally envisaged since, while the developing countries had shown an unexpected capacity to develop a uniform and agreed policy of their own, the United StatesGovernment had failed to respond adequately to this development and it had been left largely to the United Kingdom delegation to takethe initiative in keeping the conference under control. Even so, the developing countries had contrived to ensure a favourable hearingfor their own proposals in the various sub-committees in which theconference had been organised; and the documents constituting theFinal Act of the conference, which would now be referred to theUnited Nations for consideration by the General Assembly in due course, would inevitably reflect those views to a greater extent than we should find wholly palatable.As regards the individual issues with which the Conference hadbeen concerned:(a) On the question of commodity arrangements and access tomarkets for primary products the resolutions which the conference would be invited to adopt would only be acceptable to us if they weremade subject to an introductory formula (the &quot; chapeau &quot;) whichwould make it clear that the subscribing countries would undertaketo do no more than to give consideration to the proposals involved.Provided that this formula was retained, we could probably acquiesce in the resolutions. If it was rejected, however, we might find it possibleto endorse the proposals as regards access to markets but we should see much greater difficulty in accepting those on commodity policy.(b) On the question of preferences the final proposals of the relevant sub-committee, though less positive than we should have wished, could be accepted.(c) As regards the issue of supplementary financing our own proposals had been endorsed.(d) The major difficulty had arisen in relation to the question ofthe institutions to be created to promote the future work of theconference. The developing countries had shown considerableenthusiasm for a new body resembling the abortive international trade Organisation. Since it was essential to secure the rejection ofthis concept, we had been forced to contemplate a compromisewhereby the conference itself would continue in being, meeting at intervals of not more than three years, and its work would besupervised by a Board of 52 members, 17 of whom would berepresentatives of the developed countries. A settlement of this kind would have been not entirely unsatisfactory. In addition, however,there had been considerable support for a suggestion that the board should adopt special voting procedures, whereby decisions would besubject to a two-thirds majority of the Board itself, coupled with a two-thirds majority of the spokesmen of the developed and developing countries separately. We had resisted this proposal on theground that the conference and its organs, being creatures of theUnited Nations, were only advisory in nature and that it would be inadvisable, by empowering them to adopt unusual voting procedures,to imply that their recommendations would be in any sensemandatory in character. As a result it was now proposed that theSecretary-General of the conference should establish a specialcommittee to examine all the various possible forms of votingprocedure which had been canvassed; and the final decision on theissue would therefore be deferred until the report of this committeecame forward for debate in the General Assembly of the united nations.(e) The conference had also considered the question of theprinciples which should govern international trade; and, since the outcome was only partially acceptable to us, it would be necessaryfor us either to endorse some of the proposed principles while
rejecting others or, preferably, to suggest that the whole question should be remitted for further consideration.(/) The proceedings of the conference would be comprised in aFinal Act, the preamble to which was doubtfully acceptable.Nevertheless, it would be to our advantage to subscribe to it, ifpossible; and we should only reserve our position if this provedabsolutely necessary.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether it would be toour advantage to endorse the findings of the conference. They wouldbe liable to commit us, in effect, to maintaining commodity values ata permanently high level; and, even though the &quot; chapeau &quot; wouldprotect us against this risk to some extent, we must assume that the moral and political pressures which would be brought to bear against us in the United Nations would be very heavy. By subscribing to theresolutions on commodity arrangements and access to markets weshould take the first step in a process which would ultimately compel us to pay for our imports, particularly of foodstuffs, artificially high prices which would reflect not the market value of those imports butthe needs of the developing countries for finance. This would be a significant departure from our previous insistence that we were notprepared to contemplate concealed subsidies in food prices butpreferred to contribute to the development needs of other countries by means of direct aid; and, in so far as the issues involved would be liable to be sharply focused within the institutionalised framework ofthe proposed Board, they would tend to recreate, in an economiccontext, the tension between developing and developed countrieswhich we had hoped to resolve, in political terms, by the progressiveliquidation of our colonial empire.On the other hand circumstances now gave us no option but to endorse the findings of the conference; and we should be liable to do more damage to our own interests by refusing to participate in theFinal Act than by acquiescing, however reluctantly, in its provisions.. Whether we subscribed to the resolutions or not, they would in any event be submitted to the United Nations and endorsed by theGeneral Assembly; and, if we had refused to accept them, we should merely attract the odium of appearing to thwart the initiative of theconference when we might hope, by endorsing them, to gain a measureof political advantage, particularly in so far as we constituted one ofthe main markets for the products of the developing countries.Moreover, whatever pressure might subsequently be brought to bear upon us, we could continue to rest in the formal position that we were committed to no more than an undertaking to give consideration tothe proposed provisions as regards commodity arrangements and access to markets; and the &quot; chapeau &quot; provided us with a safeguardin this respect which, if we dissociated ourselves from the conferenceat this late stage, we might well lose altogether. It would be essential,however, to ensure that, on the related question of institutions, we accepted no commitment at this stage about the voting proceduresto be adopted by the conference, if it remained in being, or by theproposed Board, if it was created, since we could not afford in any circumstances to contemplate a position in which recommendationsof the Board could be held to be more than merely advisory in character.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to the points made in their discussion,the Secretary of State for Industry should indicate, at thefinal stage of the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment, that the United Kingdom Government wouldnot dissent from the submission by that conference to theUnited Nations of proposals as regards trade anddevelopment on the lines which he had described.
267GOutbreak of 4.   The Minister of Health informed the Cabinet that anTyphoid in Inspector of the Ministry of Agriculture had reported in March 1964Aberdeen that two meat-packing plants exporting to this country, known(Previous respectively as Argentine 1A and Uruguay 5, had for a period usedReference: unchlorinated water in the canning process. Consignments from oneCM. (64) 30th Qf these piants had been turned back on the high seas; but suppliesConclusions, already distributed in this country had not been recalled. It had sinceMmute 3) begn established that a tin of corned beef from the Argentine 1A planthad been included in the stock of the shop in Aberdeen to which thecurrent outbreak of typhoid fever had been traced; and it had beendecided as a result to withdraw from circulation 6-lb. tins of cornedbeef which had originated in either this plant or Uruguay 5. Furtherproblems had now arisen as a result of the decision of the firm ofJ. Sainsbury Ltd. to withdraw from their shops all tins imported fromthese plants, including 1-Ib. tins of corned beef and tins of tongue andcorned mutton. The question now arose whether steps should be takento withdraw these tins generally and, if so, whether an announcement to that effect should be made in the course of a debate in the Houseof Commons later in the day on the Ministry of Health Vote. Expertmedical advice confirmed that 1-lb. tins of meat had never been associated with typhoid (although a bacillus other than typhoid had recently been found in one such tin in this country) and that 1-lb.tins were less likely than large tins to be infected by defects in thecooling process. It did not therefore seem necessary to undertake ageneral withdrawal of tins of this size. Since, however, the ground forwithdrawing 6-lb. tins of corned beef was the unsatisfactory natureof the manufacturing process at the plants in question and not an association between corned beef and the typhoid epidemic (which hadnot so far been established), it appeared appropriate to withdraw6-lb. tins of tongue and mutton from the Argentine 1A plant whichhad been exposed to the same risk as the corned beef. It was arguable that tongue and mutton from the Uruguay 5 plant should also be withdrawn; and the Argentine interests had represented that it wouldbe unfair to discriminate against their products by failing to requirethe withdrawal of those of the Uruguayan plant also. The Uruguayaninterests were naturally reluctant to accept this argument, since their trade had already been severely damaged despite the fact that no connection had been established between their products and thetyphoid epidemic. The imports of those products were greater in quantity and more widely distributed than those from the Argentineplant; and on balance it seemed sufficient to withdraw only those from the plant known to be associated with the outbreak. Theimporters believed that it might be possible to effect the withdrawalprivately; but, since the withdrawal of corned beef had been thesubject of a public announcement, the wiser course might be to announce this further withdrawal publicly and to notify medical officers of Health accordingly.In discussion it was agreed that no necessity had been shown towithdraw 1-lb. tins of meat. Since, however, the 6-lb. tins of beefhad been withdrawn on the ground that they had been producedotherwise than in accordance with the best hygienic practice, it wouldbe difficult to justify a failure to withdraw 6-lb. tins of other meatwhich had been similarly produced; and, while it was not known thatthe unchlorinated water used at the Uruguay 5 plant, as distinct fromthat used at Argentine 1A, was impure, it would be unwise, in viewof the withdrawal of the corned beef produced there, not to withdraw the tinned tongue and corned mutton as well. It should be made clear,however, that the withdrawal of the tongue and mutton produced atthe two plants was a precautionary measure, consequent upon thewithdrawal of the corned beef, and that the stocks were not being destroyed but would be held until the committee of inquiry under thechairmanship of Sir David Milne had established the source of theinfection at Aberdeen. It was desirable to avoid stimulating public anxiety about the large stocks of corned beef imported before the
Offer of an *5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChiefArt Collection   Secretary, Treasury, (CP. (64) 115) about the possibility of an offer to the United Kingdom of an important collection of modern art.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that a Mr. Hirshhorn, a united States citizen, might decide to offer his important collectionof modern sculpture and paintings to the United KingdomGovernment on certain conditions. This was probably the mostimportant collection of modern sculpture in private hands in the world and was valued at some $20-30 million. If Mr. Hirshhorn decided tobring the collection to London, it would be on the understanding thatthe United Kingdom Government would supply an appropriate sie and building and would meet the running costs of the museum. the site, which he wished to be in central London, would probably befound in Regents Park. The capital cost of the building would be ofthe order of  f million to  1 million at current prices; and therecurrent costs involved would be in the region of  150,000 a year.Mr. Hirshhorn would wish his present curator to remain in chargeof the collection; and he would expect to play a major part in the nomination of the governing body and in the formulation of themuseum&apos;s policy. The acquisition would give London an outstandingpublic collection, which we could not hope to accumulate without such a gift; and it would be to our advantage to seek to reach agreement with Mr. Hirshhorn, although we should not necessarilysucceed in doing so in view of competition from other quarters.Meanwhile, it was essential that we should maintain particulardiscretion about the situation.CM. 31 (64)introduction of the practice of using chlorinated water in the canningprocess and now held by the Ministry of Agriculture; and, rather thanmake a special announcement, the Minister of Health should take theopportunity afforded by the debate that afternoon to mention that this further precaution had been taken.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be desirableat a later stage to consider the feasibility of sterilising stocksconsidered to be at risk by a new radio-active process, which washarmless both to the food and to the consumer. There might also bea case for considering whether compensation should be sought fromthe Governments of the Argentine Republic and of Uruguay on theground that the tins from the plants in question had continued tocarry, during a period when unchlorinated water was being used, aGovernment stamp certifying that the meat had been canned underhygienic conditions.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Health (i) to arrange that 6-lb. tins of tongue and corned muttoncanned at the Argentine 1A and Uruguay plantsshould be withdrawn from circulation, pending theconclusion of the inquiry into the source of thetyphoid epidemic at Aberdeen;(ii) to state, in the course of the debate in the House ofCommons later in the day, that, as an additionalprecaution consequent upon the withdrawal of 6-lb.tins of corned beef produced at the plants in question,6-lb. tins of tongue and corned mutton were also being withdrawn.
In discussion the following main points were made:ia) Richmond Park might provide a more suitable site for thecollection than Regents Park; and this and other possibilities shouldbe further considered before a decision was taken.(b) Legislation would probably be required, especially if mr. Hirshhorn sought to impose particular conditions about the composition of the body of trustees.(c) It would be necessary to consider how best to anticipate the unfavourable comparisons which might be drawn if the government undertook expenditure on the scale envisaged and at the same timethe current negotiations for the acquisition of the Pollock Housecollection of paintings in Glasgow, at a capital cost of  300,000, and are current cost of  20,000 a year, were allowed to fall through.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (64) 115.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th June, 1964.
