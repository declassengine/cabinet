The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said thatthe discussions between the Foreign Ministers of Malaysia, indonesia and the Philippines, which were due to open in Bangkok on thefollowing day, seemed likely to be concerned principally with theinterpretation of the cease-fire agreement in the Borneo territories which had been negotiated by the United States Attorney-General,Mr. Robert Kennedy.The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said that thePress conference which President de Gaulle had held on 31st Januaryhad not proved to be the occasion of a major pronouncement ofpolicy and had aroused relatively little interest.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Minister without Portfolio(Lord Carrington).(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) toconsider the means by which our own interests would best be protected in the pending discussion, between theForeign Ministers of Malaysia, Indonesia and the philippines, of the cease-fire agreement in the borneo territories.Cyprus 2.   The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet that the(Previous        proposals for the creation of an international peace-keeping force in reference:      Cyprus had been accepted by the Greek and Turkish GovernmentsCM. (64) 8th and by representatives of the Turkish community in Cyprus. it conclusions,    appeared possible that Archbishop Makarios, who had not yet replied.Minute 3)       might seek to avoid an outright rejection of the proposals by makingunacceptable conditions which would necessitate a further round of negotiations. In the meantime the situation in the Island remainedtense and there was some reason to think that illicit supplies of armswere reaching both communities from abroad.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.AgriculturalPolicyCereals and meat(previous reference :CM. (64) 8thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Minister of Agriculture said that agreement with the oversea suppliers on the management of the United Kingdom markedin cereals was now in sight. They had accepted a standard quantity for home production based on a figure of 9f million tons, which wouldbe acceptable to our farmers; in return, we had undertaken to take effective remedial action if cereal imports in any given period fellsignificantly below the average for the three years ending in July 1964.The prospects of a satisfactory agreement on meat were lessencouraging. The arrangements which we had in mind would requirethe oversea suppliers to restrict themselves voluntarily but rigidlyto prescribed import quotas; and any increase in home productionabove a standard quantity, if it resulted in a fall in the market price,would therefore have a serious effect on their earnings. They had accordingly pressed us for two assurances: first, that they would havethe right to increase their exports to us by an amount equal to any amount by which home production exceeded the standard quantity;and, second, that, if domestic production in excess of the standard quantity could be shown to have caused a significant fall in import prices, we would consult them with a view to taking corrective actionto bring domestic production into line with the standard quantityonce again.
In discussion the following points were made:(a) It might be inadvisable to concede the first of thesestipulations. Even though the oversea suppliers might not wish tomake use of their rights under a provision of this kind, it would beseen as a means of bringing pressure to bear on the domestic producerby depressing prices; and it would also imply indirectly a risk to theExchequer. It would be less objectionable to accept an obligation to consult the oversea suppliers about remedial action if domestic production in excess of the standard quantity led to a fall in prices.But even in this case any undertaking should be expressed in general terms.(b) Standard quantities for the domestic production of beef and lamb would probably be strenuously opposed in Scotland. Eventhough it could be demonstrated that the standard quantity for beefwould correspond closely with the actual levels of production forecast for the next three years, the same argument did not apply to lamb,where the imposition of any standard quantity could be held to imply a restriction on the expansion of production.(c) On the other hand the abandonment of the attempt to limitdomestic production of meat in return for import quotas would expose the Exchequer to continued risk if the market collapsed as a resultof excessive imports. Even if a heavy increase in the cost of subsidies for 1964 made the farming community more ready to accept anagreement on meat in 1965, it would in the meantime have exposedboth the Government and the farmers to severe criticism.(d) The imposition of a limit on meat production in the form of standard quantities would compare unfavourably with the policy of growth and expansion which the Government were seeking to promotein the rest of the economy. This analogy, however, was misleading,since the degree of support given to domestic agriculture was greaterthan that accorded to industry and the controls which the farmers were now being asked to accept were designed to protect subsidyarrangements from which they derived considerable benefit. Moreover,the present subsidy arrangements for agriculture protected a largenumber of small high-cost producers.(e) In default of agreement with the oversea suppliers it wouldbe necessary to seek to negotiate more flexible arrangements for the phasing of meat imports without imposing standard quantities on home production. Such arrangements, however, would not provideany certain protection for the Exchequer if the market came underpressure.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, if anagreement could be reached with the oversea suppliers on acceptableterms, it would be to the ultimate advantage of the domestic producer and would have the political advantage of carrying forward thedevelopment of the Governmenfs new policy for agriculture. But, inview of the anxiety of the farming community, particularly in Scotland,about measures which could be held to restrict unduly theiropportunities for expanding their production and their incomes, itmight be preferable to maintain the present arrangements for a further year rather than to seek to impose on the farmers an agreement whichthey would not voluntarily accept. Within these limitations we shouldcontinue to work for an agreement. In particular, while we should notpromise oversea suppliers the right to increase their exports to us byan amount corresponding to any amount by which home productionexceeded the standard quantity, it might be possible to accept a commitment, in general terms, to take remedial action if, as a resultof excessive domestic production, import prices fell significantly.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in the course of hisfurther negotiations on meat supplies, to be guided by thepoints made during their discussion.
British sugar corporation(previous reference:C.C. (61) 41stConclusions,Minute 7)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (CP. (64) 24) about the British Sugar Corporation(B.S.C.).The Minister of Agriculture said that the B.S.C. was in form apublic company, which had been created in 1936 by an amalgamation of all the existing enterprises engaged in the processing of sugar beet.Since 1939, however, it had not operated on an ordinary commercial basis. At present the shareholders received a dividend of 7 per centon their original capital of  5 million. This dividend was in practiceguaranteed to them, whatever the trading results of the companymight be; but it could not be increased without the consent ofMinisters. The shareholders were therefore at no commercial risk.At the same time, however, they were the legal owners of assets witha nominal value of  171 million and a current insured value of over 60 million. Since 1960 they had been pressing for a higher return ontheir investment; and, although the Government had refused eachyear to agree to any increase in the dividend, the position was nolonger tenable. In these circumstances the Economic Policy Committeehad agreed in principle, in August 1963, that the Corporation shouldbe reorganised; and the chairman of the Board had been informedthat new financial arrangements would be made, which would comeinto force on 1st April, 1964, and would enable the Governmentto cease controlling the dividend.The proposals which had now been elaborated for this purposeenvisaged that a price would be fixed which the Corporation could afford to pay for beet sugar on a commercial basis. This price wouldvary with changes in world sugar prices; but other risks wouldhenceforward be borne by the Corporation, whose profits would therefore vary according to the commercial efficiency with whichthey conducted the enterprise. In these circumstances the Governmentwould no longer be justified in retaining control of the Corporation^capital structure and dividend distributions. But they would need todefend themselves against the charge that they were transferring tothe shareholders unfettered control over assets of very considerablevalue, which had been created since 1939 by the Exchequer withoutany real contribution or risk-taking by the shareholders. TheCorporation had accordingly offered to make a capital reconstructionan integral part of the new arrangements. The issued capital wouldbe increased by 5 million  1 shares, of which 2\ million would be distributed to existing shareholders as a bonus issue and a further2\ million would be issued free to the Statutory Sugar Board which,since 1956, had been the source from which the Corporation^ capital programme of modernisation had been financed. The Sugar board would thus acquire 25 per cent of the equity of the Corporation; inaddition, the Treasury had had, since 1936, a holding which would represent 11 per cent of the enlarged equity capital. At the same timethe Board of the Corporation would indicate that the dividend wouldbe raised to 8 per cent in 1964 and possibly to 9 per cent in 1965.Arrangements on these lines would dispose of the constant pressure from the shareholders and the Board for an increase in thedividend; would encourage the Corporation to become commerciallyefficient; and would place it in a better position to raise fresh capital,at the appropriate moment, on its own credit. But they would alsoafford the Government reasonable protection against any charge thatthey were distributing to the shareholders assets which had been created by the Exchequer.In discussion these proposals attracted some support. they represented a logical elaboration of the decision of principle whichthe Economic Policy Committee had taken in the previous year; andthey could be presented as a genuine, if somewhat belated, attempt by the Government to rationalise the Corporation^ activities.Moreover,  the  shareholders  were  legally entitled  to  put  the
Corporation into liquidation and to distribute the assets; and, evenif it were unlikely that they would be able to mobilise sufficient support for drastic action of this kind, it was possible that, if the government did not put forward acceptable proposals for a reconstruction of theCorporation, the Board of Directors would resign and their successorswould refuse to co-operate with the Government in the future conductof the Corporation^ activities.On the other hand there was no conclusive argument in favourof the proposed changes. A guaranteed return of 7 per cent couldnot reasonably be regarded as ungenerous; nor did it follow that,if the Corporation was to be transformed into a risk-takingenterprise, this process must necessarily be accompanied by a capital reconstruction which would transfer to the shareholders asubstantial quantity of assets financed by the Exchequer. This aspect of the proposals would be liable to become the subject of acutepolitical controversy and to provoke the Opposition to declare that,if they were returned to power at the forthcoming General Election,they would nationalise the Corporation. It was arguable whether a threat of this kind would be to the Governments electoral advantageor not; but it would clearly gain in plausibility if, by raising thedividend to 8 per cent in the year in which a settlement was reached,the Corporation exposed themselves to the charge that they were notonly flouting the Governments incomes policy but were also givingthe shareholders the benefit of profits earned in a period while theCorporation had still been drawing its finance from the Exchequer.The proposed arrangements would be more defensible, therefore, ifthe initial increase of dividend were deferred for at least a year, whenit would be possible to represent it as deriving from profits earnedduring a period of genuinely commercial operation.The shareholders might refuse to endorse a proposal to this effect,even if it was recommended to them by the Board. If so, theirunreasonable attitude would put the Government in a stronger position than at present to maintain that the existing arrangements must continue without change or, alternatively, that a further periodmust be provided for reconsideration of the whole basis of theproposed settlement. The situation would be more difficult, however,if the Board refused even to submit the revised proposal to the shareholders on the ground that, relying on the Governmentsassurance that dividends would be released from official control asfrom 1st April, 1964, they were already committed to maintain thedetails of the settlement proposed in CP. (64) 24 without modification.In that event it would be necessary to consider the matter afresh.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to explore the possibility of reaching agreement with the Board of Directors of theBritish Sugar Corporation on the lines proposed in cp. (64) 24, subject to deferment of the initial increase individend for at least a year.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Decimalisation        5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous        Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 18) on the decimalisation ofReference:       the coinage.C.C. (61) 66thConclusions, The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, from the point of minute 6) view of the national economy, decimalisation of the coinage would represent a sound investment in the long term. The saving of time inbanks, offices and shops might yield a direct return of 15 and 30 percent on the capital cost of the operation; and a considerable indirectreturn might be expected from the improved efficiency likely to result
from the modernisation of accountancy and related techniques. Thecapital cost was estimated to amount to  109 million and, if the new system were introduced in February 1967, would be spread over thefive years 1964-65 to 1968-69, with a peak expenditure of  55 million in 1966-67. The Exchequer would bear about  60 million of thecost, with the possible addition of further sums for compensation.There would be a strong case for resisting pressure to pay compensation to undertakings which stood to benefit fromdecimalisation; but it might be desirable to make an exception infavour of certain undertakings, such as small retailers, for whomthe cost of the change might outweigh any advantage which theywould derive from it. If a decision were taken in principle to introducedecimalisation, it would be necessary to consider whether to adoptthe system based on the pound, which the Halsbury Committee onDecimalisation had recommended, or the alternative system basedon 10s. The timetable proposed by the Halsbury Committee envisagedlegislation in the current Session, with a view to the introductionof the new coinage in 1967; but this would impose a heavy burden on the economy at a time when the resources likely to be availablehad already been hypothecated to other projects.In discussion it was agreed that, in view of the commitmentsalready undertaken or in prospect for the second half of the decade,it would be unwise to embark on the introduction of decimal coinagein the immediate future and that a decision on the merits of theproposal should therefore be deferred.The Cabinet-Agreed to defer a decision on the proposals in CP. (64) 18relating to the introduction of a decimal coinage.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4 th February, 1964.
