parliament the UsiJ 2.   The Secretary of State for Industry said that it would beof Trading desirable to give an early indication of the Governments attitude toStamps trie pr0p0sai that legislation should be introduced to prohibit the useof trading stamps. The wisest course in present circumstances wouldbe to suspend judgment on the matter and to allow time for thearguments on either side to be developed in Parliamentary debate andin public discussion. He understood that the Consumer Council wouldalso refrain from committing themselves to a firm view at the present stage. He proposed to make an appropriate announcement to this effect in Parliament.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Industry.Security inthe PublicService(previous reference:C.C. (63) 27thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had it inmind to renew discussions with the Leader of the Opposition on theproposal, outlined by his predecessor in the Parliamentary debate on 7th May, 1963, for the establishment of a small standing body to actas a Security Commission. This body would consist of a judicialChairman, together with two recently retired senior officers of theCivil Service and the Armed Forces with practical experience of security problems; and it would be available, on instruction by thePrime Minister after consultation with the Leader of the Opposition,to investigate the implications, in terms of the efficiency of departmental security procedures, of any breach of security by a publicservant.In discussion it was generally agreed that it would now be appropriate to explore further, albeit without commitment on thepart of the Government, the attitude of the Opposition towards aproposal to which, when it was originally made, they had reacted notunfavourably. It would be desirable, however, to anticipate, if possible,any allegation by the Opposition that this proposal represented afurther attempt by the Government to employ the Judiciary, contraryto normal principles, in the service of the Executive.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers intentionto discuss further with the Leader of the Opposition, without commitment, the establishment of a Security Commissionto examine the implications of any breach of security by apublic servant.Foreign 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Iraq remainedAffairs obscure. Although the Iraqi Army appeared to be in control of theIraq country, there was as yet no formally constituted government to(Previous which we would consider according recognition. The new regimeReference: would not necessarily support the policies of President Nasser; the cm.

The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Berlin(previous reference:CM. (63) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that, although the situation on theaccess routes to Berlin gave no current cause for particular concern,it might deteriorate again at any time. It would be desirable, therefore,that the Departments concerned should examine the non-militarycounter-measures which it might be possible to adopt if the SovietGovernment renewed their attempts to impede Western access to berlin.East-west relations(previous reference:CM. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, that the Foreign Secretary would arrange for a review by the Departments concerned of thenon-military counter-measures which might be taken if theSoviet Government again sought to restrict Allied access to Berlin.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Secretary for defence, Mr. McNamara, had made an important statement on18th November about the relative strengths of the Western Powers andthe Soviet bloc in terms of both military and economic capacity. Hewould arrange for copies of this statement to be circulated to theCabinet.The Secretary of State for Industry said that it now appeared thatthe attempt by certain countries, notably the United States, to promote a concerted policy of restricting credit to countries of the Soviet blocmight be abandoned. Recent discussions in the North Atlantic Counciland in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Developmenthad shown a clear division of opinion on the subject; and it had been difficult to avoid the conclusion that those countries which hadadvocated this policy had done so because they were unable to offerfurther credit and were therefore unwilling to see the Soviet marketopened to their competitors.The Cabinet (3) Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Industry.(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange for copiesof the statement by the United States Secretary for defence, Mr. McNamara, on 18th November to be circulated for their information.Kenya:LandSettlement(previous reference:C.C. (62) 44thConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (CP. (63) 18) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP. (63) 19)on the future of European farming land in Kenya.The Colonial Secretary said that recent developments in Kenya,especially in the central Kikuyu region, were giving rise to growinganxiety about the future of the European mixed farmers. increasing numbers of landless Kikuyu were invading this region; and thefts of stock, destruction of fencing, and attacks on property were becoming increasingly frequent. Resistance by the European farmers might precipitate racial disturbances; and the Government would be facedwith a critical situation if military intervention became necessary inorder to protect European lives. Apart from the practical difficultiesof such an operation, the political effect of using United kingdom troops for this purpose after Kenya had become independent wouldbe very damaging. These developments were disappointing,particularly in the light of the earlier expectation that there would be
CM. 7 (63)a secure future in Kenya for the European farming community. Butit was now clear that, at least in the central region, the position of the europeans would gradually become untenable; and the government therefore had no alternative but to take prompt action if law and orderwere not to break down.For this purpose we should immediately announce that we would assist the Government of Kenya to purchase some 350,000 acres ofland in the central region over the next 3J years, at a cost of about 3 -1 million. We should also indicate forthwith that the projectedreview of the existing land resettlement schemes would be advanced to a date early in the following year, thus implying that wecontemplated further substantial transfers of land in the near future.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, whereas theGovernment^ policy of land purchase in Kenya had hitherto been intended to settle Africans on land previously occupied by Europeanfarmers, the present proposal would be seen to be designed primarily to compensate European farmers for the effects of constitutional change. Such a modification of policy would be liable to have widerrepercussions. In particular, the inducement to the local governmentto maintain law and order would be removed; and there would beno justification for confining the proposed action to the central region of Kenya or for refusing similar treatment to European farmers and business men in other parts of Kenya and, in comparablecircumstances, in other territories. Moreover, progress with the mainsettlement scheme did not justify its sudden expansion. Of the 650,000acres bought under the scheme only 100,000 had so far been settled by Africans. There was no reason, therefore, why the 350,000 acresnow in question should not be included in the main scheme if it were necessary to give priority to settlement in the central region. Someextension of the scheme might become necessary in due course; but,if so, it should be discussed with the Kenya Government in the context of the financial arrangements which would have to be negotiatedbetween the United Kingdom and an independent Kenya.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If the Kenya Government were unable or unwilling to restrain the Kikuyu tribesmen who were gradually invading the central region,the knowledge that European farmland was to be bought and resettledby Africans over a period of 3t years might not lead to any easing of tension. Indeed, it might merely encourage the Kikuyu to take over the farms immediately by force. On the other hand local opinion inclined to the view that the announcement of an extended settlement scheme would tend to reduce the danger of violence.(b) If we were to avoid creating the impression that the main purpose of the new arrangements was not to resettle Africans but to compensate Europeans, with all the dangers of repercussion whichthis would entail, we should present our action in relation to thecentral region of Kenya as being part of an accelerated review of thesettlement scheme in general. We should therefore refrain, if possible,from specifying either the acreage or the expenditure involved.(c) The risk of repercussions should not, however, be exaggerated.If the proposed new scheme secured a relaxation of the present tension in the area, it might become possible to stabilise the situation of theEuropean farming community elsewhere in Kenya and so to limit the size of the United Kingdom&apos;s commitment. On the other hand, a breakdown of law and order in the central region at this stage wouldbe more likely to lead to disorders elsewhere, possibly extending evenbeyond the borders of Kenya. If the situation deteriorated to a point at which it became necessary to contemplate the total withdrawal ofthe European farming community, the assets at risk might amount tosome  140 million.
(d) It was arguable whether it would be to our advantage to seek to link the proposed extension of the present settlement scheme withthe financial negotiations which we should have to undertake with the kenya Government on or after the Colony&apos;s independence. If the twoissues had to be considered together, the urgency attaching to theextension of the land resettlement scheme would compel us to advance the date of the wider negotiations. If so, we might be compelled tomake concessions in those negotiations in order to secure a rapidsolution of the problem of the resettlement scheme. If, on the otherhand, the issues were dealt with individually, the total cost of two separate negotiations might well be greater than the cost of a single,combined settlement.(e) Any payment to European farmers under the proposed arrangements should, if possible, be confined to United kingdom citizens. There might be objection to providing from the UnitedKingdom Exchequer compensation for, e.g., South African farmers in Kenya.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement in the Cabinet that action must be taken to alleviate tension and anxiety in the central region of Kenya and thatit should be based on some extension of the present land settlementscheme to include more European farming land in the affected areas.An early announcement to this effect would be desirable; and theMinisters concerned should therefore give further consideration toits precise terms, particularly the extent to which it should specify the degree of commitment which the Government were prepared toassume and should be linked with the wider financial negotiations with we should shortly have to undertake with the Government ofan independent Kenya.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, and in the light of the considerations which had emerged from their discussion, to submit to thePrime Minister the draft of statement, to be made inParliament at an early date, about land settlement in Kenya.TransportLong-term problems ofTraffic inTowns6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (63) 12), to which was appended a draft parliamentary statement on Professor Buchanan&apos;s report on the long-term problems of traffic in towns.The Minister of Transport said that Professor Buchanan&apos;s report,together with the report of the Steering Committee under thechairmanship of Sir Geoffrey Crowther which had supervisedProfessor Buchanan&apos;s study, would be published on 27th November.These were original and radical studies of the probable developmentof urban life in the light of the increase in traffic; and their far-reachingrecommendations would provoke considerable debate. He therefore proposed to make a statement in the House of Commons on the dayof publication and to hold a Press conference. He had revised the draft statement appended to CP. (63) 12 in the light of discussion with theMinisters principally concerned, in order to give more prominence tothe passages referring to the Governments intentions as regards the implementation of the proposals in these reports.In discussion it was suggested that there might be somedisadvantage in making an initial statement on so complex a subject,since the questions which would inevitably arise could be satisfactorilyanswered only in the course of a full debate. On the other hand it was important that the Government should indicate at the outset their
CfaalgroveAirfield(previous reference:C.C. (63) 47thConclusions,Minute 9)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (63) 16) on the disposal of Chalgrove Airfield.The Home Secretary said that in 1959 a Sub-Committee of theHome Affairs Committee had agreed that Chalgrove Airfield shouldbe sold to the Martin-Baker Aircraft Company, who were using it to test aircraft ejection equipment which was essential for defence purposes. In order to ensure, in accordance with established policy,that the former owners were ultimately given the option ofrepurchasing their land, the offer of sale was made conditional on thecompany&apos;s giving certain undertakings. These were given byMr. James Martin, who controlled the company, in the terms requestedbut were not as explicit as assurances given by Ministers to the former owners, some of whom, together with certain local residents, were strongly opposed to the sale of the airfield to the company. The Cabinet,at their meeting on 18th July, had therefore invited the Minister ofDefence to offer Mr. Martin a 99-year lease, subject to restrictionsdesigned to ensure that the former owners would be given the option to repurchase their land when the airfield ceased to be used for testingejection equipment. Mr. Martin, however, had rejected a lease, mainly because he regarded the Government as having given an undertaking to sell him the airfield, on the strength of which he had investedconsiderable sums in its improvement.The Ministers concerned had considered the matter further inconsultation with the Law Officers and now proposed that, in orderto give Mr. Martin the equivalent of a freehold entitlement while retaining for the Government the means of fulfilling their pledge tothe former owners, it would be appropriate to offer Mr. Martin (ina letter on the lines of the draft appended to CP. (63) 16) a 999-yearlease, terminable only by the company or on the airfield&apos;s ceasing tobe used for its present purpose. On termination the Air ministry would pay the company the then market value of the property.In discussion it was suggested that the Government would be exposed to considerable criticism if they put themselves in a positionin which they would be unable to ensure that, when the present useCM. 7 (63)general attitude to reports which would attract intense public interestand, in particular, should seek to anticipate the criticism that, in sofar as Professor Buchanan&apos;s proposals assumed an adequate systemof public transport, they were incompatible with the curtailment of rail services under the reorganisation of the railways which was inprogress. It would also be desirable to reassure local authorities, whowould be liable to be alarmed by Sir Geoffrey Crowther&apos;s proposal that regional agencies should be created to implement urbanredevelopment. A statement of this importance ought not to be madeelsewhere than in the House of Commons; but it should preferably be rather shorter than the revised draft.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to make a statement inthe House of Commons on 27th November on the reportsof Professor Buchanan and Sir Geoffrey Crowther on long-term problems of traffic in towns.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to give further considerationto the terms of the statement in the light of their discussion and in consultation with the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister without Portfolio(Mr. Deedes).
of the airfield ceased, the land could be offered to the former owners.It should therefore be explained to Mr. Martin, even more explicitlythan in the draft letter attached to CP. (63) 16, that the Governmentsnew offer was the equivalent of a sale and that the device of a 999-yearlease had been adopted only in order to ensure both that he receivedthe security of tenure to which he attached importance and that effect could still be given to his undertakings at some future date when thecompany might no longer be subject to his control.On the other hand the Governments original offer to sell the airfield to the company had been made on the assumption that itwould suffice to rely on Mr. Martin&apos;s assurances that, when the airfieldceased to be used for the testing of ejection equipment, the former owners would be given an opportunity to repurchase their land.Mr. Martin could reasonably maintain, therefore, that the Governmentwere morally committed to a sale; and, if a fresh attempt to persuade him to accept a lease were unsuccessful, the Government mightencounter even more damaging criticism from him than from theformer owners and their supporters. Nor would a lease be likely tosatisfy the former owners, since it would not bind a future Governmentto offer the land back to them when the lease to the company wasterminated.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to incline in favour of reaching asettlement with Mr. Martin, if possible, on the basis of a 999-yearlease. But, in view of the explicit nature of the Governments originaloffer to sell the airfield, a refusal by Mr. Martin to accept a lease onthese terms might leave the Government with no alternative to a sale.He would discuss personally with Mr. Martin the Governments new proposal and the reasons for it. If Mr. Martin were unwilling to acceptthe proposal, the matter would have to be considered again.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange to discuss with Mr. Martin, the chairman of the Martin-BakerAircraft Company, a settlement of the dispute about thebasis of the company&apos;s occupation of Chalgrove Airfieldon the lines indicated in CP. (63) 16.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit to the PrimeMinister the draft of a letter inviting Mr. Martin to this discussion.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor to give further consideration tothe terms of the draft letter to iMr. Martin at Annex 2 of cp. (63) 16.PensionsAllowancesfor WidowedMothersand their children(previous reference:CM. (63) 5thConclusions,Minute 4)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Pensions and National Insurance (CP. (63) 15) about increasedallowances for the children of widows.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that hehad considered whether it would be feasible to assist widowed mothersby increasing the amount of the children&apos;s allowance rather than byabolishing the earnings rule for widows. Such a measure appeared,however, to be open to considerable objection. In the first place itwould involve legislation; and it would be difficult so to limit thescope of the Bill that amendments affecting the rates of allowancepayable for children generally would be out of order. Even wideramendments, including a proposal to abolish the earnings rule itself,might be acceptable. Second, it would be difficult to justify theproposal on merits. The allowances in question had been increased as recently as six months ago, as part of a general increase in rates of
benefit; and a further increase, confined to widowed mothers only,would be liable to throw doubt on the adequacy of this recentadjustment. Moreover, widowed mothers already received more inrespect of their children than other beneficiaries under the national insurance scheme; and the further this preferential treatment was extended the stronger would be the pressure to improve the rates forthe children of other beneficiaries. Finally, unless the national assistance scale rates for children were simultaneously increased, thosewidowed mothers who received national assistance to supplement their national insurance benefit would find that the increase which they received under the latter head would be offset by a reduction in their national assistance; and the poorest of the widowed mothers would therefore receive no net benefit at all from the change.The Minister of Education said that he had examined thesuggestion, put forward during the Cabinefs earlier discussion, that,as an alternative to the abolition of the earnings rule for widowed mothers, education maintenance allowances might be increased. Whenthe General Grant was introduced, hov/ever, these allowances had become a matter entirely within the discretion of the local authorities;and it would be inexpedient to ask local authorities to increase them at the present time.In discussion it was suggested that, despite the current pressure for the abolition of the earnings rule for widowed mothers, theGovernment might gain greater credit by refusing any concession ina field where no case for a further increase in benefits could reasonably be established. On the other hand it was doubtful whether they wouldbe able to sustain this position; and it might therefore be desirableto seek some alternative solution to the problem which would bemore clearly consistent with the Governments declared intention togive selective benefits to those most in need. It might be possible, forexample, to extend the relevant allowances beyond age 18, at whichthey ceased at present, and to allow them to remain payable, either at existing or at increased rates, during a part or the whole of any period of full-time education or apprenticeship after that age. Thiswould have the additional advantage that it would be of benefit tothe widowed mothers as well, since it would imply that in manycases they would continue to receive the allowances until they reachedthe age of 50, at which they themselves became entitled to widows&apos;pension.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance to circulate at an early date a memorandum on the desirabilityof continuing payment of certain allowances under thenational insurance scheme which would otherwise ceasewhen the children concerned attained the age of 18 and toindicate, in particular, how far the legislation which wouldbe required for this purpose would provide unavoidablescope for proposals to amend other benefits under that scheme.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st November, 1963.
