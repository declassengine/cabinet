Postmen&apos;s 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Union of PostPay Office Workers had abandoned their threat to take industrial action(Previous        as a result of his agreement that one aspect of the issues in disputeReference:      should be referred to an independent enquiry. This would cover solelyCM. (64) 2lst   the limited, but important, question of the interpretation in relationConclusions,    to postmen of the phrase &quot; fair comparison &quot; with outside employmentMinute 4)      which, in accordance with the recommendations of the RoyalCommission on the Civil Service, 1953-55 (Cmd. 9613), was used asthe basis for the determination of Civil Service pay but was ambiguousin the case of postmen in view of the absence of clear analogues. Theunion for their part had agreed that the dispute should subsequently be referred to the Civil Service Arbitration Tribunal on the basis ofthe findings of this enquiry. A settlement on these terms would not involve any derogation from the position which the Government had maintained   throughout   the   controversy   and   would   not   beobjectionable to other Civil Service Unions, since it did not breachthe principle that disputes on Civil Service pay should be subject to arbitration by the Tribunal.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.IncomesPolicyChemists&apos;Remuneration3. The Minister of Health said that the chemists were claimingadditional remuneration of  9 million a year in respect of dispensingservices which they provided under the National Health Service. Some 3 million of this claim was attributable to increased costs; the balancerepresented the chemists&apos; estimate of the increase in their net earningsto which they were entitled. An independent enquiry had established that the costs in question had in fact risen by rather more than  3 million a year; and it would be necessary to meet this part of theclaim with some degree of retrospection. An increase in net earnings would also be justifiable in principle; but the amount would be amatter for negotiation and the award should not be retrospective.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Ministerof Health.EducationSchoolBuildingsSurvey(previous reference:C.C. (62) 8thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Lord President said that a survey of school buildings inEngland arid Wales had been initiated by the then Minister ofEducation in 1962 in order to establish how far existing schools fell short of the best modern standards. For this purpose a number of&quot; defects &quot; had been identified and the survey had sought to establishhow many of these could be attributed to any given school. Since a school wholly free of &quot; defects&quot; would be a theoretically idealbuilding, it was not surprising that nearly every school surveyed wasdeficient in several respects or that the cost of remedying all theshortcomings was estimated to be in the region of  1,000 million. Itwas unfortunate that so unrealistic a survey should thereby offer scope for considerable public criticism. But its initiation had been announced at the outset; and subsequent Ministerial statements had committedthe Government to its publication.CM. 23 (64)Parliament j.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Foreign 5.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs informed the affairs Cabinet that the Security Councilof the United Nations had now the Yemen     discussed the recent incident at Harib when we had delivered a(Previous       retaliatory attack by air on a fort on the Yemeni side of the borderReference:      between the Yemen and the Federation of South Arabia. the cm. (64) 2lst   resolution  on  which  the  debate  had  been  based  had  been conclusions,    unsatisfactory from our point of view; and the United KingdomMinute 2)      Permanent Representative at the United Nations had therefore been instructed to abstain from voting. He had made it clear that we had adopted this neutral attitude because the resolution embodied certainpositive elements an appeal to the parties involved to exerciserestraint and a proposal that the good offices of the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations should be employed to settle the issues in dispute which we accepted and should wish to implement. TheUnited States Government had also abstained from voting during the debate in response to representations from the Prime Minister to thePresident. All the other members of the Security Council, however,had voted in favour of the resolution. Meanwhile, Yemeni aircraft were continuing to overfly the territory of the Federation.The Prime Minister said that the incident had shown that weshould be liable to encounter increasing difficulty in maintaining ourposition in southern Arabia and sustaining the confidence of our friends in that area if we had recourse for this purpose to measuresinvolving overt attack on the Yemen, even in retaliation againstYemeni aggression. Nevertheless, we must make a renewed attemptto enlist the co-operation of the United States Government in themeasures which would be required to maintain our base at Aden in face of the threat posed by the presence of United Arab Republic(U.A.R.) troops in the Yemen, whose numbers, so far from being reduced in accordance with the resolution of the United Nations,had now risen to nearly 40,000. While we must be careful not toimperil our relations with other Arab States, particularly Kuwait andLibya, by appearing to indulge in unnecessary aggression against theIn discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be preferable to avoid, so far as possible, the use ofthe word &quot; defect&quot;, in so far as it was employed by the survey todenote any variation from a standard which might in some circumstances be literally impossible of attainment, e.g., in relationto the siting of the playing fields of schools in urban areas.(b) A comparable survey of hospitals or housing would revealsimilar deficiencies, which would be more serious, in many respects,than those identified by the school building survey. This situation was widely recognised; and public opinion would not necessarily be unduly disturbed by the publication of the survey, if its findings were placed in the appropriate context.(c) The survey should therefore be published under cover of a white Paper, which would put its findings in proper perspective andwould emphasise the very considerable measures of expansion whichthe Government had undertaken in the field of education, particularlyin terms of the school building programme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Survey of School Buildings should bepublished in the near future.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the ministers concerned, to present it under a cover of a White Paperbased on the points made in their discussion.
Cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)Yemen, we must be resolute in maintaining our position in southernArabia; and we should seek to ensure the maximum of publicity forthe repeated acts of U.A.R. provocation.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of these statements.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the Secretary-General of the United Nations had suggested that the United Nationsmilitary presence in Cyprus should be supplemented by a united nations police force and had invited the United Kingdom tocontribute ten police officers and thirty constables to this force. the risks to which we should be exposed if we accepted a new and additional commitment as regards the maintenance of law and orderin Cyprus were sufficiently obvious; and it would be prudent to refuseto contribute any United Kingdom police personnel to the proposedforce.In discussion it was suggested that the United NationsCommander, General Gyani, appeared to be determined to constitute the international police force and that it might therefore be inexpedient to dismiss completely the possibility that we might eventuallycontribute to it. Even if we refrained from committing ourselves atthis stage, there might be some advantage in contributing UnitedKingdom personnel subsequently at the point when the force was sufficiently substantial to assume responsibility for policing at least the Turkish Cypriot areas of the Island. On the other hand it was virtually certain that, once we had accepted this commitment, weshould find it very difficult to withdraw our contingent; and we mightincur an indefinite and ambiguous liability for the maintenance oflaw and order in the Turkish Cypriot area.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage inclined against contributing to the proposed international police force, mainly on the grounds that the UnitedKingdom troops already committed to the United Nations military force represented a sufficient contribution on our part to the enforcement of order in the Island. We should therefore inform theSecretary-General that we were unable to accede to his presentrequest; and we should refrain, at this stage, from giving any indication that we might be willing to reconsider our attitudesubsequently.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of State for commonwealth affairs, to submit to the Prime Minister the draft of a message to the Secretary-General of the United Nations,rejecting the proposal that the United Kingdom should contribute personnel to the international police force which it was proposed to establish in Cyprus.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th April, 1964.
