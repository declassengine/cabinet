Royal Air 2.   The Secretary of State for Defence said that the HomeForce Affairs Committee had had under consideration a proposal toMaintenance    announce that the R.A.F. Maintenance Unit, Heywood, which wouldUnit-Heywood shortly become redundant, would be closed. He had come to theconclusion, however, that it was unnecessary to announce any such proposal at present; and further consideration of the future of thisUnit would therefore be deferred.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Secretary of State for defence.Extension of 3.   The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thatStevenage he proposed to give notice shortly of his intention to make an OrderNew Town extending the area of Stevenage New Town. Objectors would havean opportunity to be heard at a public inquiry; and, as a result of an amendment to the New Towns (No. 2) Bill which had recently beencarried against the Government, the Order would be subject to the negative Resolution procedure. The New Town Corporation had reached the end of their housing programme; and, if they were notto lose staff and contractors, it was essential that they should beable to plan for further building in the area of the proposed extension.Delay in setting the procedure in motion would be liable to entailcorresponding delay in providing for the essential housing needs ofLondon.In discussion it was suggested that, since the procedure would inevitably take a considerable time, little would be gained by initiatingit immediately. Before any decision was taken, however, it would bedesirable to consider further whether steps could be taken, short ofthe immediate announcement of the proposed extension of the NewTown, to avoid delaying the progress of the Corporation^ housingplans.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government togive further consideration, in the light of their discussion,to the desirability of announcing the proposed extension ofStevenage New Town.Lamp- 4.   The Secretary of State for Defence drew attention to the standards in work currently in progress for the replacement of the Victorianthe Westminster lamp-standards in Birdcage Walk by tall standards intended to carryArea modern lighting. He understood that it was proposed to take similar measures in Constitution Hill. These changes would seriously detractfrom the character of two streets which contributed to the beautyof the St. James&apos;s Park area; and it was questionable whether thework should be allowed to proceed. The problem of preserving thecharacter of distinctive streets had been solved in Paris by the installation of powerful electric lighting in the existing lamp-standards; and a similar solution might be sought in London.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Foreign AffairsCyprus(previous reference :CM. (64) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations, U Thant, had now informed us that he was satisfied that there was general agreement between all theGovernments concerned that the United Kingdom Governmentshould be invited to continue to contribute to the United nations force in Cyprus, our contingent being reduced to a level of about1,100 troops. U Thant had also assured us that the directive tothe Commander of the force would henceforth be interpreted morepositively and with greater vigour than hitherto. Meanwhile, as aresult of the recent discussions between the President of the UnitedStates and the Prime Minister of Turkey, the Turkish Governmenthad agreed to take part in further confidential negotiations, under united States auspices, in an effort to find a solution for the problemof Cyprus. The United States Government hoped to persuade theGreek Government also to participate in these negotiations. Theiroutcome would be referred in due course to the United Nations.In discussion it was suggested that public opinion in the UnitedKingdom might be disturbed by a decision to continue to provide a united Kingdom contingent for the United Nations force in theabsence of any assurance from Archbishop Makarios that our troops and their families would no longer be molested and abused. Suchcriticism would be reinforced by the growing concern about theabsence of any information on the fate of the United Kingdomofficer, Major Macey, who had been attached to the United nations force as a liaison officer and, together with his driver, had beenmissing for some days. It would be undesirable, however, to seek fromArchbishop Makarios the type of specific assurance about the futuretreatment of our troops which would give him the opportunity tosuggest that they should be withdrawn completely; and it would be preferable to rely on the statement of U Thant that he had verifiedthat a continued United Kingdom contribution to the United nations force would be generally welcomed. But this should not inhibit us from addressing appropriate representations to the Archbishopabout the vilification of our troops in the local Press, which hepurported to control; and we might reinforce this demonstration ofour concern by offering a reward for any information about the fate of Major Macey.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that the existinglighting was insufficient for the needs of modern traffic and itsinadequacy had probably contributed to a recent fatal accident inBirdcage Walk. The Governmenfs intention to instal modernlighting had evoked no protest when it had originally been announced in 1962; and the contract for the work in Birdcage Walk had alreadybeen let. He would be prepared, however, to examine the possibilityof cancelling the work in hand and of abandoning the proposals inrelation to Constitution Hill and certain other areas.Discussion showed considerable support for the view that the lighting in the streets in the neighbourhood of St. James&apos;s Parkshould, if possible, be improved without the introduction of modernlamp standards.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works to give further consideration, in the light of their discussion, toalternative methods of improving street lighting in the st. James&apos;s Park area and to bring the matter before themagain at a later meeting.
Malta(previous reference :CM. (64) 29thConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Colonial Secretary said that his discussions with thePrime Minister of Malta, Dr. Borg Olivier, about the independence and future Constitution of the Island appeared to be approachingtheir final stages, although no agreement had yet been reached.The provisions in the draft Constitution about the status and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church were still a cause of difficulty; but he had reached agreement with the authorities of the vatican on proposals which he hoped would ultimately prove acceptable to Dr. Borg Olivier and to the Archbishop of Malta. Inthe discussions on defence and finance he had hitherto avoidedspecifying the amount of financial assistance which we should beprepared to provide in return for a satisfactory defence agreementsince, if the negotiations should break down, it would be preferable that their failure should appear to be attributable to a fundamentaldivergence of view on the constitutional issue of the position of theChurch than to disagreement on finance. If, on the other hand, it proved possible to resolve all the outstanding issues, it would bedesirable that a Bill to provide for the independence of Malta shouldbe introduced in the very near future.In discussion there was general agreement that, before any legislation was introduced for this purpose, the Cabinet would need to give careful consideration to the terms of the final settlement.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to announce inthe House of Commons that afternoon that, in the lightof an assurance from the Secretary-General of the united nations that a continued United Kingdom contributionto the United Nations force in Cyprus would be acceptable to all those concerned, including the greek and Turkish Governments and the Government of cyprus, we had decided to maintain a contingent in theforce at the reduced level of about 1,100 troops.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to give furtherconsideration to the desirability of addressingrepresentations to Archbishop Makarios about theabuse of our troops in the Greek-Cyriot Press.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to arrange for a reward to be offered forinformation about the fate of Major Macey and his driver.Laos The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Laos remained(Previous critical. New proposals had been put forward by the PolishReference: Government for an international conference to negotiate a settlement;CM. (64) 32nd and he hoped that it might be possible to obtain the concurrenceConclusions, Df tne other Governments concerned.Minute 4)Vietnam The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Secretary of(Previous State, Mr. Rusk, had now assured us that, if the United states reference: Government proposed at any time to extend the scope of theirCM. (64) 16th military action in relation to Laos and Vietnam, they would informConclusions, Us before doing so.Minute 3)The Cabinet (4) Took note of these statements by the Foreign Secretary.
2879The Concord(previous reference :C.C. (62) 70thConclusions,Minute 4)7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of aviation (CP. (64) 123) and by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP.(64)124) on the development of the Concord supersonic airliner.The Minister of Aviation said that, since the Cabinet decided in November 1962 to undertake, jointly with the French Government,the development and production of the Concord supersonic airliner,detailed designs of the aircraft had been prepared, preliminarystructural work had been put in hand and close consultation hadbeen maintained between the British Overseas Airways Corporation(BOAC) and Air France on the operational requirements. The time had now come to decide on the design of the two prototype aircraft which it had been agreed to develop. Most of the original calculationshad been confirmed by the experimental work; but it had become clear that modifications were required to strengthen the engine andto enlarge the wing partly because the original design had under-estimated the weight of the aircraft and partly because the air-linesnow required larger reserves of fuel than had been provided by theoriginal estimate. The provisional forecast, made in 1962, that thedevelopment cost of the Concord would be of the order of  150- 170million had to be increased by some  65 million as a result both oforiginal underestimation and of a general increase in wages and prices; and the cost of strengthening the engine and enlarging thewing would increase expenditure by a further  40 million. As aresult the initial cost of development was now estimated at  275million, to which the United Kingdom would have to contribute 137-5 million, or some  50 million more than the original estimate.In addition, the unit price of the Concord would have to be increased from about  3- 4 million to about  5 million (as compared with 3 million for a VC-10 or  2\ million for a Boeing 707); and thiswould inevitably add substantially to the operating costs. these should be initially offset, however, by the higher load factors whichmight be expected to result from the passenger appeal of the aircraft,which a surcharge of 15 per cent on current fares would enable it to operate economically on the same load factor as the Boeing 707.The risks of radiation in relation to passengers and aircrew at highaltitudes no longer gave cause for concern; but the problem of noiseand of the sonic bang still required further investigation.The United States programme for the development of asupersonic transport aircraft had suffered delay and now seemedto be directed towards a Mach 3 aircraft, built of titanium andprobably costing twice as much as the Concord per unit. Such an aircraft could hardly be in service before 1975; and this intervaloffered us an opportunity to increase our share of the marketcorrespondingly. By contrast the Soviet Union had made considerable progress in design work on a supersonic transport; and, if the concord were abandoned, they would probably be the first in this field.The British firms concerned had agreed to be responsible for the extra cost of building early production aircraft, which might amountto about 10 per cent of the total United Kingdom share of launchingcosts or about  14 million. It had been agreed with the french authorities that a levy should be charged on the proceeds of sales of the aircraft, engines and spares; and it would be desirable to seek the Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate, for their consideration before legislation was introduced to providefor the independence of Malta, the terms on which it was proposed to reach a settlement of the outstanding issueswith the Government of the Island.
7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of aviation (CP. (64) 123) and by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP.(64)124) on the development of the Concord supersonic airliner.The Minister of Aviation said that, since the Cabinet decided in November 1962 to undertake, jointly with the French Government,the development and production of the Concord supersonic airliner,detailed designs of the aircraft had been prepared, preliminarystructural work had been put in hand and close consultation hadbeen maintained between the British Overseas Airways Corporation(BOAC) and Air France on the operational requirements.

It had been agreed with the french authorities that a levy should be charged on the proceeds of sales of the aircraft, engines and spares; and it would be desirable to seek the Concord(previous reference :C.C. (62) 70thConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate, for their consideration before legislation was introduced to providefor the independence of Malta, the terms on which it was proposed to reach a settlement of the outstanding issueswith the Government of the Island.
to negotiate with the main United Kingdom contractors anarrangement for sharing any remaining margin between sales price and the cost of production. On this basis and on the hypothesis that150 aircraft would be sold, we could expect to recover about one-third of our initial investment. If, however, it were possible to sellan adequate number of aircraft at a higher unit price than  5 million,the recovery of the Governments investment would be increased upto a full recovery at a price of  6\ million.The French Government had decided to proceed with the concord project on the above basis. We should clearly take the samedecision; and a joint announcement to this effect should be made assoon as possible.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it appeared likely fromexperience of other advanced aircraft projects that the cost of the concord would ultimately be higher than the figure forecast by theMinister of Aviation. Even on the basis of the present estimate,however, the project would cost nearly as much as two Channeltunnels. Moreover, it was demonstrably uneconomic. If the Concordwere sold at a unit price of  5 million, its operating costs per sea-mile, even on the most favourable assumptions, would be some25-35 per cent higher than that of the Boeing 707 now being operated by BOAC. In fact, however, the economic selling price for the concord (i.e., on the basis of recovering development expenditureof  275 million in the sale of 150 aircraft) was not  5 million but 7 million; and it was very unlikely that, at this price, a market for150 aircraft existed. Regard must also be paid to the impact of the concord on BOAC, who might feel that they would have no option but to buy it; and in that event their resultant losses would inevitablyfall on the Exchequer. These financial consequences could not bedissociated from the problem of the VC-lOs of which the corporation were currently seeking to disembarrass themselves; and this complex of issues should be made the subject of an independent financialenquiry before the Cabinet decided whether to proceed with the concord and, if so, on what scale. The case for a review of the project was strengthened by the unresolved problem of the sonicbang, since there would be little advantage in incurring such heavy expenditure on an aircraft which could realise its full supersoniccapability only over unpopulated parts of the earth.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Further consideration should certainly be given to the extentto which the sonic bang might limit the economic operation of theaircraft. The public might eventually tolerate the noise; but therecauld be no certainty on this point and experience of the sonic bangscaused by Service aircraft was not necessarily relevant.(b) The delay in the United States programme for thedevelopment of a supersonic aircraft admittedly provided anincreased opportunity for the Concord. On the other hand thewariness with which the United States aircraft industry, which hadgreater experience of the problems of supersonic flight than theBritish aircraft industry, were approaching their project suggestedthat we should be wise not to act precipitately as regards our ownundertaking.(c) It was doubtful whether future generations of supersonic transport aircraft would follow the line of development pioneeredby the Concord. They might more probably derive from the Mach 3aircraft now under consideration in the United States. If this proved to be so, it would greatly diminish any technological benefit to Britishindustry that might be gained from the development of the Concord.On the other hand the United States venture faced very difficulttechnical problems, particularly in connection with the use of
titanium in the construction of the aircraft. If these provedeconomically insoluble, the further development of the principlesembodied in the Concord might well offer the most fruitful prospects.(d) If the United Kingdom industry in general and the aircraft industry in particular were to remain competitive in world markets,we must not shrink from accepting considerable financial risks inorder to promote advanced technological projects, even if some ofthem proved abortive. To cancel the Concord project at this stage would not only be politically embarrassing but would imply that wehad withdrawn from the technological race. On the other hand the technological development of the aircraft industry was not an end in itself; our aim must be to produce an aircraft which waseconomically effective and saleable. The information so far available about the operating costs of the Concord and the possible limitations on its economic use made it undesirable that we should finally commit ourselves at present to carrying through the project.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there appeared to be general agreement that, despite the many uncertaintiesattending the project, it would not be politically practicable towithdraw from it at the present juncture. But the issues involved should be further considered later in the year; and in the meantimewe should confine ourselves to announcing, with the minimum of publicity, that we were proceeding with the project, in collaboration with the French Government, on the basis described by the Ministerof Aviation.The Cabinet-CD Authorised the Minister of Aviation to agree, in his forthcoming discussions with the French Government,to accept the proposed modifications in the Concordproject, as indicated in CP. (64) 123, and to announce,with the minimum of publicity, that work would proceed on this basis.(2) Agreed to review the project again later in the year.ProposedIncreasesin RailwayFares(previous reference :C.C. (63) 36thConclusions,Minute 5)8. The Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) said that ithad come to his notice on the previous day that the london transport Board and the British Railways Board proposed toissue simultaneous statements within the next few days on increases in fares. The London Transport Board would announce increasesnecessitated by the recently agreed wage increases arising out of thereport of the Committee of Inquiry under the chairmanship of professor Phelps Brown; and they would announce at the same timevarious measures, including the introduction of new types of vehicle,designed to increase the efficiency of the service. The railways board proposed to increase fares in the London area in parallel with the increase in the fares on the London Transport Board&apos;services and, in addition, to increase by 7 per cent the fares on services within a radius of some 80 miles of London. All these increases were intended to become effective on 19th July. Theincrease in railway fares in inner London might be argued to bejustified by reference to the Railway Board&apos;s practice of keepingrailway fares in line with those of the London Transport Board in thearea served by both undertakings; but the increase outside Londoncould not be justified either by reference to that practice or by theprospect of compensating increases in efficiency. In so far as it wasrelated to wage increases, it could only reflect an increase given inthe previous year and not the wage claim currently before the Board;and the Board&apos;s real purpose, therefore, must be deemed to be toincrease the revenue which they obtained from passengers who were compelled to travel to London to work and had no alternative means
HiCM. 33 (64)of.transport. The public would be likely to find it difficult to accept that this justified the proposed increases.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that the Governmenthad accepted the last increase in railway wages on the understandingthat this would not in itself necessitate an increase in fares. It now appeared, however, that the Railways Board were taking theopportunity offered by the increase in London Transport fares to recoup themselves, at the expense of part of the travelling public,for the additional expenditure on wages. Moreover, it could be argued that the practice of keeping inner London fares in step with thoseof the London Transport Board was in itself contrary to the publicinterest; and to use that practice as a ground for charging higherfares outside London as well seemed wholly unjustifiable. On theother hand, since the commuter services were uneconomic, thosewho used them were at present being subsidised by the rest of thepublic; and there was no reason why they should not be requiredto pay fares which would more nearly approach the economic rate.The Government had encouraged the Railways Board to raise faresas a means of making the service pay its way and had facilitated theintroduction of increased fares in response to economic requirementsby empowering the Board to bring higher fares into operation beforethe proposed increases were considered by the Transport Tribunal.It was necessary to distinguish between the policy of treating therailways on an economic basis and the policy of regarding them asa social service which it was proper to expect the public to subsidise.The Government had endorsed the former policy, the Oppositionthe latter; and consistency required that the consequences of requiring the railways to cover their costs should be accepted.In further discussion it was suggested that the Railways board might be asked to adopt the alternative method, which remainedopen to them, of applying to the Transport Tribunal for approvalof the proposed increases in fares before bringing them intooperation. Since the Tribunal would be unlikely to hear theapplication until the autumn, this would ensure that the public wouldhave some months&apos; notice of the impending increase not only ininner London but also in the wider area as well (since fares outside london could hardly be increased before those which were linked with the increase in the London Transport Board&apos;s fares).Alternatively, the Board might be persuaded in their own interests to separate the increase in the outer area from that in London andto explain to the public the economic case for their proposals. Infavour of the first course it could be argued that the economic case for the increases outside London had apparently existed for sometime; and there was no reason why the Railways Board should nothave applied to the Tribunal some months previously. On the otherhand they had elected not to do so; and it would be unwise for theMinister of Transport, who had no power to give them directions onthe matter, to attempt to interfere in their exercise of their commercial judgment. Moreover, since preparations for the introduction of thehigher fares had already been made, the fact that the Governmenthad intervened would be bound to become known and might beopen to misrepresentation. It could be alleged, for example, that the government&apos;s intention was to seek to compel the Railways board to prolong their consideration of the claim for increased wages whichwas currently before them. It would be unwise, therefore, to attemptto bring pressure to bear on the Railways Board, although it wouldbe desirable to seek an opportunity of pointing out to the Chairmanof the Board privately the disadvantages, both from the Governmenfspoint of view and in terms of the Board&apos;s own relations with thepublic, of announcing an increase in fares at short notice and on thebasis, which the public might well consider irrelevant, of the proposed increase in the London Transport Board&apos;s fares.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the attention of the Chairman of theRailways Board should be drawn informally to the embarrassmentwhich a sudden announcement of an increase in fares, both in theLondon area and beyond, might occasion not only to the government but also to the Board. He should be asked to consider applying tothe Transport Tribunal for approval of the Board&apos;s proposals beforebringing them into effect; but it should be made clear that theGovernment recognised that the ultimate decision rested with theBoard. He should also be asked to consider whether in the Board&apos;sown interest it might be better to give the public a frank explanation of the economic case for an increase in fares rather than to attemptto relate them to the recent agreement between the London transport board and the trade unions for an increase in wages for the Board&apos;staff coupled with measures to increase the efficiency of the service.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport and the Minister without portfolio (Mr. Deedes) to arrange to discuss the railways board&apos;s proposals for increase fares with the Chairman ofthe Board on the lines indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.Cabinet Office,25th June,S.W.1,1964.
