The Cabinet 1.   The Prime Minister said that, at the first meeting of the new administration, the Cabinet would wish to send a message of warmpersonal greeting and good wishes to the former Prime Minister,Mr. Harold Macmillan, M.P.As regards the future it would be his wish and purpose thata united and resolute Government should go forward to the tasks which lay ahead. He would seek, to the utmost of his ability, to lead the Government in this spirit; and he would ask for the co-operationof all his colleagues in ensuring the prompt and effective despatchof public business. Problems should be resolved by Committees ofthe Cabinet whenever possible; and Cabinet discussions should be reserved for items of major importance. Collective discussion shouldbe directed to reaching decisions; and decisions, once taken, should be firmly maintained.In addition, Ministers should be alert to detect the emergence ofnew situations which might create embarrassment for theGovernment in the future. These should be brought promptly toattention, while there was time and opportunity to deal with them.It would assist the forward planning of the governments programme of action if all Ministers in charge of Departments would submit to him, in the next few days, a brief summary of the major problems which at present confronted them, with some indication of the action required to resolve them and the period within whichit would have to be taken if it was to have early results.The Foreign Secretary, on behalf of the Cabinet, expressed tothe Prime Minister the appreciation of his colleagues for his remarksand for the example of leadership which he already provided to thecountry as a whole. The Cabinet pledged him their full support inthe days which lay ahead.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange, on their behalf, for a message of personalgreeting to be conveyed to the former Prime Minister,Mr. Harold Macmillan, M.P.(2) Took note, with approval, of the wishes expressed by thePrime Minister about the conduct of government business.(3) Agreed that all Ministers in charge of Departments should submit to the Prime Minister, not later than 25th October,a brief list of the major problems with which they were likely to have to deal in the near future.New Session 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of his intentionof Parliament to seek membership of the House of Commons at the pendingby-election at Kinross and West Perthshire on 7th November. Itmight be advisable, therefore, that the opening of the new Session ofParliament, at present fixed for 29th October, should be deferred until 12th November.In discussion there was general agreement with this suggestion.It would be very desirable that, at the opening of a new Session, thePrime Minister should speak personally in the House of commons in the Debate on the Address; and several members of the Cabinet,who were now taking charge of important Departments for the first time, should be allowed a short interval in which to informthemselves of their new duties and responsibilities before being required to defend the Governments policies in the Debate. Thetime available for the heavy programme of legislation foreshadowed
The QueerTsSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:C.C. (63) 60thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would need toconsider the text of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament in the light both of the proposed deferment of the beginning of thenew Session and of recent developments in the Governments policies.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Report of the Committee on Higher Education wouldbe published on 23rd October. It had been assumed at an earlier stage that a Press conference on that day would suffice to indicate the Governmenfs attitude to its recommendations, since the debate on the Address in the following week would have provided an early opportunity to elaborate the Governments policy in more detail. Inview of the interval of three weeks which would now be liable toelapse between the publication of the Report and the Debate on the address it would be advisable to issue a written statement of policy on 24th October and to arrange an additional Press conference withrepresentatives of the educational Press. In that event the referenceto the Committee&apos;s Report in The Queen&apos;s Speech might need to bere considered.(b) It had already been decided to publish on 30th October theReport of the Committee on the Organisation of Civil Science, whoserecommendations were to some extent related to those of theCommittee on Higher Education. This decision, however, should now be re-examined, particularly since the Government might be unable to give an early indication of their attitude to some of themain recommendations in the report.(c) It might be advisable to defer the publication of the white papers on the development of Central Scotland and North-east england until after the opening of the new Session. This would makeit possible to refer to their forthcoming publication in The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament and would lead naturally toa discussion of their contents during the Debate on the Address.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council and the Ministerof Education, to arrange for the publication on24th October of a statement, on the lines already agreed,of the Government^ attitude to the recommendations ofthe Committee on Higher Education.(2) Invited the Minister of Education, in consultation with theLord President of the Council and the Chief Secretary,Treasury,to arrange for representatives of the educationalPress to be appropriately informed of the government&apos;s policy in this respect.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the publication ofthe Report of the Committee on the Organisation ofCivil Science.in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament would inevitably be somewhat curtailed; but the situation in this respectmight be relieved to some extent if Parliament adjourned at christmas for a rather shorter interval than would normally be thecase. This possibility could be explored further in due course.The Cabinet Agreed, in principle, that the Opening of the new Sessionof Parliament should be deferred until the Prime minister was able to take his seat in the House of Commons.
(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional Development to consider the advisability of deferring publication of the White Papers on thedevelopment of Central Scotland and North-east england.(5) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange, in thelight of their discussion, for the draft text of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament to be reconsidered.ForeignAffairsBerlin(previous reference:C.C. (63) 60thConclusions.Minute 1)WesternEuropeanUnion:ministerial meeting(previous reference:C.C. (63) 25thConclusions.Minute I)4. The Foreign Secretary said that it could now be reasonablyassumed that the recent action of the Soviet military authorities intemporarily denying free passage to United Kingdom and UnitedStates convoys into Berlin had been caused by a genuinemisunderstanding of the procedures involved and not by a politicaldecision of the Soviet Government. The United Kingdom and united States authorities had hitherto used different procedures inthis respect. Common procedures had now been agreed; and, if theSoviet Government were appropriately informed, they wouldprobably accept them.The Foreign Secretary said that he would shortly be attendinga meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Western European Union,preceded by a private discussion with the French Foreign Secretary,M. Couve de Murville. The attitude of the French government towards these proposed consultations had been unhelpful; but hewould seek to prevent this from prejudicing their success, since theywere intended to ensure continued discussion between the UnitedKingdom and the member countries of the European economic community on matters of common interest.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statements by the foreign secretary.Kenya(previous reference:C.C. (63) 60thConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Colonial Secretary said that at the conclusion of the kenya Independence Conference the representatives of the KenyaAfrican National Union (KANU) had accepted a limited number of changes in the Constitution approved at the Lancaster HouseConference in 1962. These changes were less drastic than those whichthey had originally demanded; and, if we had refused them, the kenya Government might well have declared the independence ofthe Colony by a unilateral act. In that event it would not have beenrealistic to seek to hold the country by force; but our relations withthe local Government would have been endangered, the european population might have had to be withdrawn and the minority tribeswould have been deprived of the protection offered by theConstitution as it now stood.On the other hand there remained a danger that therepresentatives of the Kenya African Democratic Union (KADU),who had not accepted the limited changes in the Constitution, might seek to provoke tribal disorder. There appeared to be a division ofopinion within KADU itself, however, between those who favouredrecourse to violence and those who advocated moderation. the longer a decision was delayed the less was the risk that large-scaledisorder would break out; and such isolated incidents as might occur should be capable of being dealt with by the Kenya police and the Kenya African Rifles.
In discussion the Cabinet expressed their appreciation of th ,skill and persistence with which the Colonial Secretary had broughtexceptionally difficult negotiations to a more successful outcome than had at one time appeared possible.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the colonial secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd October, 1963.
