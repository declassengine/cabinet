Foreign AffairsWesternEuropeanUnion:ministerial meeting(previous reference:CM. (63) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)East-west relations(previous reference:C.C. (63) 58thConclusions,Minute 1)South Africa(previous reference:C.C. (63) 56thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the recent meeting of theForeign Ministers of the Western European Union (W.E.U.) countries had resulted in a useful exchange of views. Periodic meetings of thesame kind should help to restore closer relations between the UnitedKingdom and Europe, particularly since the French ForeignMinister had now declared his Governments support for theforthcoming negotiations on tariff reductions in the kennedy round.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that, in the course of the W.E.U.meeting, he had obtained the support of all member countries, withthe exception of France, for continuing negotiations with the SovietGovernment in an attempt to promote a further improvement in east-West relations. For this purpose he would try to arrange an early meeting with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, either inLondon or at Geneva. This would provide an opportunity to explore the possibility of making further progress towards agreements onthe non-dissemination of nuclear weapons and the establishment ofobservation posts in order to reduce the dangers of surprise attack.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal, notonly as an earnest of the Governments intention to improve East-West relations but also in the hope that it might lead to more extensivenegotiations. The prospect of an agreement on the non-dissemination of nuclear weapons would be enhanced if the Soviet Governmentcould be persuaded that such an agreement would not be inconsistent with the establishment of a multilateral nuclear force under the auspices of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Disagreement onthe status of Berlin was likely to continue to be the main obstacle to a non-aggression pact; and it would be important that, if any pact of this kind were concluded, it should be accompanied by somedeclaration of intention on the German issue, in order that the exclusion of Berlin from the pact might not be interpreted as implying that the Soviet Government claimed, and we recognised,that the Soviet authorities had a right, in the last resort, to impose a solution of the problem of Berlin by unilateral action.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;intention to seek to arrange an early meeting with theSoviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, in order to explore the possibility of further measures to reduceEast-West tension.The Foreign Secretary said that a resolution calling for theimposition of sanctions against South Africa might shortly be tabledin the Security Council of the United Nations. Such a resolution, ifpressed to a vote, would expose the United Kingdom to serious embarrassment. To abstain from voting on it would be valueless, since it would be mandatory in character; to vote in its favour would create a dangerous precedent, particularly as regards our future policy inthe case of Southern Rhodesia; while to veto it would be liable to damage both our moral standing in the eyes of the world and ourrelations   with   the   African   Commonwealth   countries.   TheThe Cabinet 1.   The Prime Minister read to  the  Cabinet  a letter of appreciation from the former Prime Minister, Mr. Harold Macmillan,M.P., in reply to the message of greetings and good wishes which theCabinet had sent to him.
4 SECRET 0Scandinavian Governments were believed to favour an alternativeresolution, which would invite the United Nations to consider other methods of securing constitutional development in South Africa andthe abandonment of apartheid; and, if such a resolution was tabledand was supported by the United States Government, we could probably endorse it. It would be necessary to keep developmentsunder very close review.In discussion it was suggested that, if the more moderateresolution failed to gain support, it might be necessary for the UnitedKingdom, however reluctantly, to veto a resolution calling for theimposition of sanctions against South Africa. If so, it would benecessary to make it clear that our action did not imply any approvalof apartheid but was based on the principle that the United nations should not create a precedent for the use of economic sanctions asa means of coercing member countries.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to keep them closely informed of developments in the Security Council of the united nations in relation to South Africa.British 3.   The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that theGuiana political  parties  at  the   British  Guiana  Conference  under  his(Previous        chairmanship, having failed to reach agreement between themselves,Reference:       had remitted the questions involved to his arbitration and had agreedC.C. (63) 60th t0 accept his decision. He might find it necessary to announce theConclusions,    Governments intentions that day.Minute 4)The most critical of the problems at issue related to a reform ofthe electoral system in the Colony. Under the existing system theGovernment Party, led by the Prime Minister, Dr. Jagan, had achieved a majority of seats which was disproportionate to the votes cast intheir favour. Since the lines of party division in British Guianacoincided with the lines of racial division, this situation had createdacute discontent; and any solution to the problem must seek to compel candidates in future to win support from all the main racialelements of the population. For this purpose it would be advisable tointroduce a system of proportional representation. This would entailsome risk of a proliferation of small parties; and it might be necessary,after the first elections under the new system, to try to limitdevelopments of this kind by establishing certain minimum qualifyingconditions which any candidate must satisfy.Dr. Jagan&apos;s reaction to a decision to introduce proportional representation was unpredictable. But, if his Government resigned inprotest, a critical situation might develop and it might become necessary to reimpose direct rule of the Colony. For this purpose theexecutive powers of the Government would need to be transferred tothe Governor by Order in Council; legislation would have to been acted rapidly in the Parliament at Westminster in order to investhim with legislative authority; and he would need to be reinforced by the despatch of additional administrative personnel from theUnited Kingdom.If local disturbances developed, they could probably be controlled by the police, with the assistance, if necessary, of the two battalions of United Kingdom troops already in the Colony. It was unlikely to be necessary to reinforce these troops at the outset; butthe situation would need to be kept under review.Since it was clearly desirable that the first elections on the basisof proportional representation should be conducted while we retainedcontrol of the Colony, the issue of independence would have to be deferred until those elections had taken place. In the meantime any
The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:CM. (63) 2ndConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that the draft text of The Queen&apos;sSpeech on the Opening of Parliament appended to CP. (63) 3appeared to give insufficient prominence to commonwealth interests. A new paragraph, devoted solely to the Commonwealth,might be appropriately added. In addition the reference to the government&apos;s intention to provide relief to certain householderssuffering hardship from increased rates as a result of revaluation oftheir houses was not entirely apt to the position in Scotland; but no alternative form of words which would be free from criticism on other grounds could be devised and it was therefore advisable, on balance, that the reference to rates should stand in the terms of thedraft appended to CP. (63) 3.Certain other amendments to the draft Speech were considered and approved.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to provide the Prime minister with a revised draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament, taking account of the amendments approved in their discussion, for submission to The Queen.The Foreign 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the formerOffice Building Foreign Secretary (C. (63) 185) and the Minister of Public Building(Previous        and Works (CP. (63) 4) on Foreign Office accommodation.Reference \CC. (63) 45ih The Foreign Secretary said that it was becoming increasinglyConclusions. desirable to make an early announcement of the Cabinefs decisionMinute 2) eventually to reconstruct the present Foreign Office building on the site. The present accommodation was inadequate to the needs of theDepartment; and, in the absence of any indication of the government&apos;s intentions, the morale and efficiency of the staff of theForeign Office would be liable to be prejudiced. It would also benecessary to undertake an urgent short-term programme ofredecoration and refurnishing of the existing building in order toensure reasonable conditions of work for the next few years.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that he had now given further consideration to the method by which an architect forthe new building might be selected. An open competition wassusceptible to the objection that architects of established reputationwould probably decline to compete. Moreover, the Governmentwould find it difficult to refuse to commission the winner, eventhough they might not approve his design. A limited competitionwould be liable to be criticised on similar grounds and was knownto be regarded with disfavour by the architectural profession. He hadadditional financial assistance which the Colony might require wouldbe made dependent on the local Governments accepting the normaldegree of financial control by the United Kingdom.The United States Government would endorse a policy on theselines; and we could rely on their support if it became necessary todefend our actions in the United Nations.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.The Cabinet Approved the policy proposed by the Colonial Secretary inrelation to British Guiana.
therefore decided, after consultation with the President of the RoyalInstitute of British Architects, that the best course would be todraw up a list of five or six architects, including some of the youngermembers of the profession, and to make a final selection from thesenames.In discussion the following points were made:(a) An early announcement of the Governments decision todemolish the Foreign Office building might be thought to affect the plans for the rehousing of the Service Departments. It would bedesirable to avoid creating any impression of this kind; but thepossible implications of the decision in this context should be further considered in due course.(b) The selection of an architect on the lines proposed by theMinister of Public Building and Works might evoke criticism on theground that some form of competition should have been adopted.The arguments against a competition would therefore need to be presented to public opinion with care. In the first place a considerableamount of detailed work would be required to produce evenpreliminary designs for a building of this kind; and no establishedarchitect could be expected to put his time, reputation and money at stake if his chances of success were bound to be uncertain.Moreover, no design could satisfy the purposes which the building was intended to serve unless it had been planned from the outset inclose consultation with the future occupants of the building; but itwas impossible to combine such consultation with the requirementsof either an open or a limited competition.(c) Nevertheless, public opinion would be liable to attach importance to the style of building to be adopted for this importantsite; and the architects selected for interview should therefore be judged by reference not only to examples of work which they hadalready executed but also to their intentions as regards the new building in the form of sketch designs.(d) The Governments of India and Pakistan should be informed,at the appropriate point, of the Governments intention toreconstruct the Foreign Office building, in view of their interest in the library of the former India Office.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, the Minister ofDefence and the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes).,to arrange for an announcement of the government&apos;s decision to reconstruct on the site, in due course, thebuilding accommodating the Foreign Office, theCommonwealth Relations Office and the Home Office.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Commonwealth Relations toarrange for this decision to be communicated, at theappropriate time, to the Governments of India and pakistan.(3) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, to arrange for theexecution of short-term measures to refurnish andredecorate the existing building.(4) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works toarrange for the selection of an architect for the newForeign Office building on the lines suggested in cp. (63) 4 and to consider, in the light of their discussion and in consultation with the Minister without Portfolio(Mr. Deedes), the way in which this procedure might best be presented to public opinion.
6. The Secretary of State for Industry said that the draft white papers on the development of the North-East and Central Scotlandhad been examined by the Committee on Regional Development,who had reached agreement on the measures to be announced, with one exception. This related to a proposal to build a new road bridgeat Erskine on the Clyde, which would need to be further considered in order to ascertain whether it could be accommodated within the agreed figure for investment of this nature in Central Scotland.Earlier difficulty in determining the amount by which the existing programme for road construction in the North-East could be augmented had been resolved by an undertaking by the Minister ofTransport to accept responsibility for the additional expenditure aspart of the national programme for the roads.In addition it would be desirable to include in the White paper on the North-East an account of the Governmenfs general approach to problems of regional development and to emphasise that thesolution of these problems involved social, as well as economic,considerations.It had originally been intended to publish the White Paperssimultaneously on 7th November; but this would no longer bepossible. Their impact might be greater if their publication were nowdeferred until after the publication of the Governmenfs major bills in the early part of the new Session of Parliament; but this mightinvite criticism on the ground that the change of Administration hadinvolved delays which were detrimental to the interests of the regions.The best course, therefore, would be to publish them on14th November, two days after the Session opened. This wouldenable time to be devoted to their discussion, if necessary, during the debate on the Address.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If the White Paper on Central Scotland included a referenceto the proposed Erskine bridge, it should be made clear that it was intended that the cost should be met by the local authorities andrecovered by means of tolls. The White Paper should avoid creatingthe impression that the project would be put in hand regardless ofthe willingness of the local authorities to accept the financial liability.(b) If the White Papers were likely to be debated in parliament in the near future, Ministers should decline to discuss them on television in the meantime.(c) The arrangements for the publication of the White Papersshould be co-ordinated with the arrangements for the publication ofthe major Bills which would be introduced during the first week ofthe new Session.The Cabinet (1) Approved the publication of the White Papers on thedevelopment of the North-East and Central Scotland,subject to further consideration of the drafts on the lines indicated by the Secretary of State for Industry, Trade and regional Development.White papers on the North-East andCentralScotland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 12thConclusions,Minute 7)CM. 3 (63)(5) Invited the Minister of Public Building and Works, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, to circulate, in due course, a memorandum on the timing ofthe various measures now contemplated for the rehousingof the Departments in the present Foreign Office building and the implications of these measures for the accommodation likely to be required by the service departments as a result of the changes in the central organisation for Defence.
(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to co-ordinate the arrangements forthe publication, during the first week of the new Sessionof Parliament, of the White Papers and of theGovernments major Bills.commercial policy(previous reference:C.C. (63) 57thConclusions,Minute 4)Bacon MarketSharingAgreement7. The Minister of Agriculture informed the Cabinet that recent discussions with foreign suppliers of bacon had revealed good prospects of agreement on arrangements whereby the total requirements of the United Kingdom market would be divided amonghome producers and oversea suppliers on the basis of specifiedpercentages. Such an agreement, which would be subject to reviewafter five years and could be terminated by any of the contractingparties on three months&apos; notice, should be acceptable in principle to united Kingdom farmers. But it might encounter criticism from those interests which would be disposed to argue that the United kingdom market should absorb all the bacon which the domestic industry could produce and should only thereafter look to foreign suppliers tomake good the balance. It should be possible to meet such criticismby emphasising not only that the value of the domestic producersshare of the market would increase as the market itself expanded butalso that, if a clear consumer preference for domestic bacon emerged,the domestic producers share of the market would rise still further.On balance, it would be to our advantage to conclude an agreement on this basis.In discussion there was genera! agreement with this view. Publicopinion, however, might be disposed to regard the agreement as a concession to oversea suppliers, particularly Denmark. It would be important, therefore, to emphasise the positive advantages of the new arrangement, in so far as it represented agreement on the part of denmark to limit the access of Danish producers to the UnitedKingdom market. From this point of view the agreement represented a concession by Denmark to the United Kingdom rather than in the opposite sense.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof Agriculture.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st October, 1963.
