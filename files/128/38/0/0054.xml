Malta(previous reference:CM. (64) 38thConclusions,Minute 6)1. The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that thenegotiations with the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr. Borg Olivier, had now been brought to a successful conclusion on the lines previouslyapproved by the Cabinet. The defence agreement would notincorporate any unacceptable limitations on our entitlement to storenuclear weapons in Malta, if necessary; and we for our part hadforegone our stipulation that the electoral law in the island should beso amended as to prevent the Roman Catholic Church fromexercising undue spiritual influence during elections. It would nowbe desirable to enact promptly the legislation required to giveeffect to the independence of Malta on this basis.In discussion the Cabinet expressed their satisfaction at this result. Very little time now remained in the present session for thepassage of the necessary Bill through both Houses of Parliament.Nevertheless, this should not be impossible; and every effort shouldbe devoted to securing its enactment before the Recess.The Cabinet Approved the introduction, for enactment before theforthcoming Recess, of legislation to grant independence to malta on the basis described by the Colonial Secretaryduring their discussion.The EconomicSituation(previous reference:CM. (64) 21stConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP. (64) 143), about the prospects for expenditure, taxation and the economy in general, together with a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 144), about Supply expenditure in1965-66.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the development ofthe domestic economy was proceeding broadly on the lines which hadbeen foreseen when the Budget had been introduced in the spring.The rate of growth, which had reached a figure of 6 per cent whileresources of manpower and industrial capacity were under-employed,was now levelling off, as the economy approached full employment,at a rate of about 4 per cent. Production appeared to be increasingrather more slowly than had been expected; and it was clear that prices were under increasing pressure, although this was not yetsevere. Exports remained at a reasonably satisfactory level; but therecent rise in imports, after a period in which they had appeared toreach stability, was disquieting. Although it would not be practicable to take any further steps to restrict demand for the time being, theposition would need to be closely watched, especially since the currentdeficit on the balance of payments was being aggravated by asubstantial outflow of long-term capital. The resources to meet ashort-term drain on the reserves, in the form of recourse to theInternational Monetary Fund and the implementation of other international arrangements in this context, were available and wouldhave to be used. But we could justify their use only if we coulddemonstrate that the imbalance was temporary and would be corrected after an interval and that the domestic economy wassound. It was doubtful whether, in the absence of further measures,these stipulations could be satisfied in the longer term. All theGovernments policies had been based on the assumption that a4 per cent rate of growth would be achieved and maintained. It was now beginning to be doubtful whether this objective would, in fact,prove to be fully attainable. Moreover, the latest forecast ofGovernment expenditure indicated that its annual rate of increase over the next few years would be not 4 -1 per cent, as had hitherto been assumed, but 5 per cent; and, unless steps were taken to adjust4932-3a 2
this rise, it could not be accommodated without a significant increasein rates of taxation. The alternative lay in making substantial changesin the use of our resources; and it would be essential that these should begin to be reflected in the Departmental Estimates for1965-66.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The only lasting remedy for the present strain on the economy was an increase in productivity. In so far as this depended on the re-equipment and enlargement of our productive capacity,there were encouraging signs that industry was taking active steps tothis end. This might account, at least in part, for the persistenttendency of imports to rise.(b) Unemployment was now low; but the number of vacanciesnotified was tending to level off and there were some indications thata position of relative stability as regards labour supply might beemerging. It was becoming increasingly urgent, however, to deviseand introduce an effective incomes policy; and this task should begiven the highest priority as soon as the political uncertainty arisingfrom the forthcoming General Election had been dispelled.(c) The forecast of Supply expenditure for 1965-66 indicated that it would show an increase of about 8-4 per cent over thecorresponding figure for 1964-65. This would represent a higher rateof annual increase than in any previous year since the Korean War(apart from 1963-64, when expenditure had been deliberately allowedto rise in order to offset the industrial depression).(d) It was particularly important to seek to secure all possible economies in defence expenditure. On the other hand it was verydifficult to see how any significant savings could be achieved unlessour oversea commitments were first reduced.(e) In present circumstances the Government should be preparedto make the most effective use of monetary policy, within the limitsimplied by the present level of Bank Rate, in order to moderate the pressure of demand.(/) It would be important to ensure, if possible, that the seriesof statistical announcements to be made in the next few months,relating to imports, exports, the balance of payments, the level of the reserves and other economic indicators, should be presented insuch a way as to anticipate misinterpretation and to enable publicopinion to see them in proper perspective.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 143 and CP. (64) 144.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes) andother Ministers concerned, to pay particular regard in theforthcoming months to the public presentation of thevarious economic indicators which would become due for publication.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Postmen&apos;sPay(previous reference:CM. (64) 39thConclusions,Minute 5)*3. The Postmaster-General said that the operational situationresulting from the recent one-day strike and the ban on overtimeby the Union of Post Office Workers (U.P.W.) was substantially thesame as when he had last reported to the Cabinet (CM. (64)39th Conclusions, Minute 5). There had, however, been somedeterioration in the London area where the delay in delivering mailwas now some four to five days. The Union had approached the
Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) with a request for financial and moral backing in the dispute but had not as yet elicited any clearresponse. It seemed probable that the Secretary of the T.U.C.,Mr. George Woodcock, would seek further discussion with theChancellor; but it was not yet known what line he might take. there seemed only two possible approaches to the problem. The first was to offer the Union a substantial increase in pay for the first year of a three-year agreement, on the understanding that any increaseoffered in the second and third years would be correspondingly reduced if the survey conducted by the Pay Research Unit (P.R.U.)showed that the initial offer was too high. While he had himselfadvocated an offer of a 5 per cent increase of pay in the last yearwhen the matter had been initially discussed by the Cabinet, he considered that this would be inappropriate after the industrial actionwhich had been taken by the Union. The second course, which hepreferred, was to maintain the Governments offer of investigation by the P.R.U., followed by arbitration if necessary. While he believedthat the operational situation might deteriorate somewhat furtherover the next few days, he also believed that at the end of that timethe Union might be more willing to accept arbitration.Discussion showed some support for the view that there wouldbe advantage in timing if the Government were to take the initiative in accordance with the first alternative mentioned by the Postmaster-General. This, however, might merely represent a return in much lessadvantageous circumstances to the proposal which had been rejected by the Cabinet in earlier discussions; and the balance of opiniontherefore lay in maintaining the Governments offer of a review bythe P.R.U., to be followed by arbitration, if necessary, on the outcome.In further discussion it was suggested that the Governmentspublic position would be enhanced by more effective publicity for thefact that such a review could be undertaken in a relatively short time, if the Union were prepared to co-operate. The shortestpracticable time limit should be set for its completion; but it wouldbe disadvantageous in the longer run to the standing of the P.R.U.and its place in the negotiation of Civil Service salaries as a wholeif its investigations in the present dispute were to be unduly curtailed.It appeared that, subject to the co-operation of the Union, it shouldbe possible for the review to be completed in some four to six weeks;but further discussion would be required before a precise time couldbe publicly stated. The review would not itself normally determinea precise rate of pay but would produce a range based on faircomparisons with outside similar employment. Negotiations with theUnion would then be required in order to determine precise rates;and, if this led to arbitration, the process might take a further twomonths.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage lay in maintaining the Governments offer forthe speediest practicable review by the P.R.U. which was consistent with its long-term standing, coupled with an undertaking to acceptarbitration, if necessary, on the outcome. In giving further publicity to the Governments position it would be advantageous to state theminimum practicable time limits for the completion of all these processes, if the Union co-operated. Further consideration shouldalso be given to the desirability that the Government mightundertake, if the outcome of the review was submitted to arbitration,to pay at that stage any further increase which they might have offered in the negotiations, back-dated to 1st January, 1964, andmight also undertake to pay subsequently, with similar retrospection,any increase which might result from arbitration. It would benecessary to examine further the effective dates to be adopted; but astatement in this sense should be made the following morning.
Nuclear 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (64) 136) byPropulsion the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman of the EconomicShij*5lerc,,ant    PQncy Committee, about nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee had considered whether we should carry forward thework which we had undertaken in collaboration with Belgonucleaireon the development of the Vulcain reactor by constructing and testinga reactor in a prototype ship. A working group under thechairmanship of the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry ofTransport, Sir Thomas Padmore, in which outside interests were represented, had recommended this course, which would involveexpenditure of  15-17 million over the next five years with a further expenditure in the following five years of  5-7 million on research and development and about  500,000 for operating costs. Thealternative would be to reduce our research effort to the levelnecessary to complete the existing Vulcain programme up to 1967and to keep in touch with developments on nuclear marine reactorselsewhere, in order that we could resume research and developmentif ideas more promising than those at present current were to emerge.This would cost  9-10 million less than the first course in the initialfive years.The Economic Policy Committee had been unable to reach agreement. It was argued in favour of the construction of a prototypeship that the resultant prestige would be valuable to our shipbuilding industry, which was losing ground to foreign competitors; that itmight prove possible to develop the prototype ship into an economicproposition with relatively little further expenditure; and that,whereas it was unlikely that the economic performance ofconventional means of propulsion could be substantially improved,the Vulcain design might be capable of considerable development.On the other hand it was argued that it was dangerous to subordinatecommercial considerations to those of prestige; that, since nuclear power was most likely to be competitive in large units, the likelihood that industry might be able to produce a marine reactor capable of competing with conventional propulsion was not high; and that, ata time when Government expenditure was rising rapidly, the marineproject, though attractive, did not deserve such high priority inrelation to other nuclear projects as to justify the proposed expenditure.The Minister of Transport said that since the matter had beenconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee shipping interestshad for the first time shown willingness to participate in thedevelopment of an experimental prototype. He had been informed by the chairman of the Furness Shipbuilding Company (Mr. CharlesCore) that the company would be prepared to build, and the Anglo-Norness Shipping Company to charter, a 65,000-ton oil tanker, if theGovernment would lease a nuclear reactor at approximately the costof conventional fuel. The ship would be chartered to the Governmenton completion for the purpose of undergoing trials and any necessaryexperimental work. He believed, in the light of recent discussions with the Atomic Energy Authority, that there was a possibility thatthe Vulcain reactor could be developed with little further expenditureafter the initial period to provide a means of propulsion at a relatively high speed at a competitive cost. If so, the production of a fastmerchant ship might enable us to transform the economics of shipping to our own considerable advantage.The Cabinet Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister of Labour and theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to issue astatement on the lines of the Prime Minister^ summing up.
Small 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the MinisterSatellite of Aviation (CP. (64) 146) and by the Chief Secretary, TreasuryLaunchers       (CP. (64) 147), on the development of a small satellite launcher.The Minister of Aviation said that the United Kingdom had made its contribution to various activities in space in collaboration with Europe. The BLUE STREAK rocket had been fired successfully;but its existing design would need modification before it couldlaunch communications satellites into suitable orbits. The membersof the European Launcher Development Organisation (ELDO) were due to consider in the autumn whether these modifications should beundertaken and what the next stage in the programme should be.At the same time the European Conference on satellite communications would be considering whether to embark on thedevelopment of communications satellites for supply to the worldsystem. In negotiations with the United States about setting up aninternational satellite communications system we had secured rights to provide a share of the equipment. In the next few years theEuropean Scientific Research Organisation (ESRO) would be lettingcontracts for satellites of increasing complexity for scientific research.Defence studies suggested that there might also be defence requirements for satellites, probably in conjunction with the UnitedStates. If we were to influence these international developments andto secure for the United Kingdom some share of the orders for the equipment involved, we must put ourselves in the necessarytechnological and industrial position by further research anddevelopment. The Ministry of Aviation and industry had already done preparatory work on rockets and satellites; but before wecould hope to influence programmes or win contracts we shouldCM. 40 (64)In discussion it was agreed that this new development, involving the testing of a nuclear reactor in a much larger ship than had previously been contemplated, would require further examination.It might be necessary to undertake a detailed project study before adecision could be reached. In the meantime it would be desirable forthe Minister of Transport to make a statement before the Recess,indicating that new proposals had been put forward and were being studied.The Lord President, summing up the discussion, said that thematter could not be carried further until the Chancellor of theExchequer had had an opportunity to consider the new proposals. Ifit were thereafter proposed to pursue them, a memorandum settingthem out in detail should be brought before Ministers, perhaps inthe Economic Policy Committee in the first instance. In the meantime the Minister of Transport should consider, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the terms of a statement to be madein the House of Commons.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport:(i) to consider further, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Minister of State for education and Science, the proposal to construct, inconjunction with the business firms in question, alarge tanker for the purpose of testing the Vulcainnuclear reactor;(ii) to consider, in the light of their discussion and inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the terms of a statement to be made in the House ofCommons before the Recess.
need to test components and instruments under actual spaceconditions and to demonstrate our experience of launching satellites,injecting them into orbit and controlling them in orbit. the eldo launcher was too expensive to be used as a development toolfor this purpose; but we had in BLACK KNIGHT a small butpowerful and successful rocket which could readily be converted intoa small satellite launcher. The development cost would be some 2 million a year over a period of four to five years; and a subsequentprogramme of operational firings would cost  2 million a year. in discussion in the Economic Policy Committee it had been suggestedthat this additional expenditure could not be approved unlesscompensating savings could be found elsewhere in the governments programme. It would be possible to offer partial savings from theMinistry of Aviation Vote but not the whole amount involved, unlessthe Ministry of Defence were to offer savings in respect of workwhich his Ministry carried out on their behalf.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that a decision could not properly be taken on the proposal by the Minister of Aviation untilthe review in the autumn of the international programmes of scientific space research to which we contributed had been completed and until proper estimates of the cost of continuing them wereavailable. The proposal to build a United Kingdom launcher to testsatellites and components seemed inconsistent with the view of theMinister of Aviation, which he shared, that United Kingdomparticipation in the building of communications satellites should onlybe in collaboration with Europe. When the time came to consider further developments it would be necessary to pay close attentionto the economic returns to be expected from further investment inspace activities. He had asked his Department to study this aspectfurther, in consultation with the Ministry of Aviation. Having regardto the estimated increase in public expenditure which the cabinet had just discussed he suggested that a decision should await thecompletion of these studies and then be further considered in the context of the international developments to be reviewed in theautumn.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, while thedevelopment proposed by the Minister of Aviation was not of suchdirect defence interest as to justify on that score alone the provisionof compensating savings on the Defence Vote, its general importanceto the development of United Kingdom technology would nevertheless justify an effort in this direction.Discussion showed general agreement that the direct and indirect importance of technological developments in the field of space activity called for a degree of United Kingdom participation,if we were to share in the benefits of the international programme.There was also agreement, however, that the additional expenditure involved in the immediate proposal before the Cabinet could notbe contemplated unless compensating savings were made available.If this were done, the proposal might be approved in principle.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Aviation and the Secretary of State for defence, to consider whether savings could be found from the Votes of the Ministry of Defence and theMinistry of Aviation which would fully offset the costof developing a United Kingdom launcher.(2) Approved CP. (64) 146, subject to savings being forthcomingin accordance with Conclusion (1) above.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st July, 1964.
