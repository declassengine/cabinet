TheOrganisationand finances of B.O.A.C.(previous reference:CM. (63) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Aviation (CP. (63) 17), to which were appendedalternative drafts of a White Paper dealing with the financial problems and the future organisation and management of the british overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.), together with a draft parliamentary statement by the Minister on the same subject.The Minister of Aviation said that the shorter version of theWhite Paper, which had been prepared in the light of the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, would be less likely than the original version togive rise to controversy about the allocation of responsibility for theCorporation^ present difficulties. But for this reason it might bemore liable to stimulate pressure for the publication of the reportby Mr. John Corbett, a leading accountant, which the Governmentwere known to have received. If, therefore, the shorter version of theWhite Paper was adopted, it would be necessary firmly to resist this pressure.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was generally agreed that the shorter version of the white paper was preferable to the original, longer, version. On this basis,however, the Corbett report should not be published. This shouldbe made clear, if necessary, at the outset of any discussion of theWhite Paper or of the Ministers statement.(b) Annex II of the longer draft White Paper, showing operatingresults for certain airlines for the years 1958-62, would be attachedto the shorter version as well.(c) Certain points not mentioned in the shorter version of theWhite Paper or in the statement would be better dealt with in debate.These included the effect on B.O.A.C.&apos;s operation of the government&apos;s decision to award trooping contracts to independentoperators; the extent of the Governments responsibility for.O.A.C.&apos;s investments in subsidiary airlines, particularly in theMiddle East; and the detailed justification for the changes inB.O.A.C&apos;s management which the Government intended to make.(d) The terms of compensation for Sir Matthew Slattery andSir Basil Smallpeice had now been agreed. It would be preferable,however, that the Government should refrain, if possible, frompublicly disclosing them.(e) Publication of the White Paper might result in the resignation of the present Board of the Corporation. Certain changes in theBoard would in any event be necessary. It would also be desirableto strengthen the executive staff of the Corporation by newappointments, including some transfers from the senior staff ofBritish European Airways. The Ministers statement, however, should confine itself to indicating that steps would be taken to fortify themanagement of the Corporation, without giving details in relationto particular posts.In further discussion certain amendments to the draft statement were agreed.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Aviation to arrange for thepublication of the draft White Paper at Annex B of cp. (63) 17.(2) Authorised the Minister of Aviation to make a statement,on the day the White Paper was published, on the linesof Annex C to CP. (63) 17, subject to the amendmentsnoted in their discussion.
(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to consider themeans of ensuring the most favourable public presentation of the Governments future policy for theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation.2. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that theLondon Passenger Transport Board had been inclined to try to resolve the situation resulting from the refusal of London bus crewsto work overtime by offering a substantial increase in pay. Thiswould have been embarrassing in relation to the Governmentswages policy; and it would therefore be preferable to establish anindependent enquiry into the pay and conditions of work of the buscrews. Such an enquiry would appropriately be conducted by theNational Incomes Commission; but a reference to the Commissionrequired the agreement of the parties concerned and, in the present case, the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union had refused their consent. He therefore proposed to announce in the House ofCommons that day that the Government intended to remit the issues involved to an ad hoc enquiry, under the chairmanship of professor Phelps Brown.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom ofconstituting an independent enquiry into a situation which theGovernment might be expected to deal with themselves. On the otherhand the questions at issue did not relate only to wages policy; theyinvolved also technical considerations of transport policy and methods of transport operation, which required expert and independent examination if, as was clearly necessary, the wagestructure of London bus crews should now be made the subject ofa thorough revaluation. If so, however, it would be important thatthe Parliamentary statement about the enquiry should emphasise the wider context within which it would take place; that the enquiry&apos;terms of reference should be sufficiently comprehensive for thepurpose envisaged; and that the composition of the panel appointedto conduct the enquiry should reflect the technical factors involved.It might be desirable, therefore, that the panel should include oneor two additional members, whose qualifications would enable themto pronounce authoritatively on the technical problems at issue andto insist, if necessary, on an adequate examination of radical changesin present methods of operation. Although it might be wiser not tomake the establishment of the proposed enquiry conditional uponthe withdrawal of the present ban on overtime working, it shouldbe made clear in the statement that the Government would nowexpect this ban to cease.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposal to constitute an ad hoc enquiry into the circumstances of the currentdispute about the conditions of service of London buscrews.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, andthe Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to give further consideration, in the light of their discussion, tothe public presentation of this proposal and to thedesirability of including in the panel appointed to conduct the enquiry an adequate number of individualsqualified to examine the technical aspects of the problems involved.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th November, 1963.IndustrialDisputesLondon BusCrews
