TOP secret copy No.CABINETPQSTMEN&apos;S PAY(previous preference:C. C.(62) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)CJ^NFmBMTIAJL ANNEX.CM. (64) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday,, .13th February, 1964 at 10. 00 a.m.The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (CP. (64) 40) about the current payclaim for Postmen and Postmen Higher Grade.THE POS TMA3 TSR-general said that the Union of post Office Y/orkers had been offered a three-year agreementinvolving th?.;ee annual increases of 3j per cent.   They had accepted this for all grades except Postmen.   In their casethe Union would be unlikely to accept an increase of lessthan 4^- per cent to 5 per cent in the first year.Feeling among the Postmen was running&apos;high and hadbeen aggravated by what they regarded as an unjust awardby the Arbitration Court last year of less than 2 per cent atthe Postman&apos;s maximum,   If they failed on the present occasion to obtain what they regarded as an acceptableincrease there could be little doubt that they would resort to industrial action.In discussion the following points were made:-(a) The recent central pay settlement for the non-industrial Civil Service was equivalent to three annual increases of 4 per cent, jr. per cent and Z\ per cent.   TheNational Staff Side had reluctantly accepted these figures onthe understanding that they were the maximum to which theGovernment could agree.   To accept a higher figure for thePostmen now would have serious repercussions.(b) To accept an argument based on-the alleged unfairnessof an arbitration award would appear to encourage thePostmen to set aside the agreed arbitral machinery.   the argument was the less justifiable in that the award in questionreflected the findings of the Pay Research Unit that postmenwere paid more at the maximum than their outside analogues.The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of.......................... g g
(c) It could be argued that an award to the Postmen ofan increase of      per cent, and the simultaneous award tothe higher grades of an increase of 3^ per cent would amountto an average award of no more than 4. 2 per cent.   Asagainst this the fact that Hie Postmen were so large a group would tend to deprive such an argument of its practicalforce in relation to e. g. the Civil Service.   Moreover, anyoffer exceeding 4 per cent at the present stage would be inconsistent with the Governments incomes policy.(d) It should not necessarily be assumed that industrial action by the Postmen would lead to a resumption of negotiations on the normal industrial pattern.   Questions of discipline would also be involved.   Nevertheless, it wouldbe only prudent to assume that in the event of industrial action it might be necessary to make some final concession in order to secure a return to full normal working.   Thiswas an added argument for setting any offer at the present stage at a level which would leave room for maneouvre later.The Cabinet -(1)  Authorised the Postmaster-general to offer the Union of Post office workers a three-year pay agreement for the Postmen grades based on three annual increases of 4 per cent,3^ per cent and 3\ per cent respectively.(2) Took note that the Union had already indicated their willingness to accepta three-year pay agreement forPostmen Higher Grade based on threeannual increases of 3^ per cent,jr. per cent and jr. per cent respectively.(3) Agreed that if the Postmen were to resort to industrial action in supportof a larger increase in the first year of the agreement it might be necessaryto reconsider, in the light of circurn-stances at the time, the conclusionrecorded at (1) above.Cabinet Office, S. W. 113th February, 1964-2-
