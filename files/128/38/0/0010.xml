Federationof rhodesia and Nyasaland(previous reference:CC. (63) 57thConclusions,Minute 3)4093-21. The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (CP. (63) 28), to which were appended the texts ofmessages exchanged between the Prime Minister and the PrimeMinister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,Sir Roy Welensky, discussing certain objections by the federal government to the procedure which had been adopted for the drafting of the Order in Council to be laid before the United kingdom parliament in order to give effect to the dissolution of the Federation.The Lord Chancellor said that, on behalf of the commonwealth secretary, who was absent in Kenya, he had considered these objections in the light of the timetable for the dissolution of theFederation which had been outlined in paragraphs 52-57 of the Reportof the Conference on Central Africa (Cmnd. 2093) which had beenheld at Victoria Falls in June. Those paragraphs made it clear that the target date of 31st December, 1963, for the dissolution of theFederation was conditional on the substantial settlement by that timeof such important general issues as the apportionment of the public debt and other liabilities and assets of the Federal Government andthe future of the Federal Public Service but that, on the assumptionthat decisions on these points were reached in good time, &quot; the UnitedKingdom Government should be in a position to complete and enact,before the end of December 1963, the legal instruments necessary togive effect to the decisions agreed upon by the Governments, whowould be given an adequate opportunity of commenting on their proposed provisions&quot;. The Federal Government now sought to interpret these words as implying that the Order in Council providingfor the dissolution of the Federation could include only such decisions as were agreed by all the Governments concerned; and, in his messages to the Prime Minister, Sir Roy Welensky had maintained that the apportionment of assets and liabilities between the three territorial governments of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland had not been so agreed, on the grounds that certain of its provisions in this connection were unacceptable to the federal government. He had also protested that the Federal Governmenthad not been afforded &quot; adequate opportunity of commenting &quot; onthe Order in Council as regards both this item and others.In fact, however, the proposals as regards the apportionment of assets and liabilities had been accepted by the three territorial governments without modification, while the Federal Governmenthad dissented not on the grounds that the proportions in which the assets and liabilities were to be distributed were unacceptable but onthe grounds that apportionment would reduce the security ofstockholders and that their position should therefore be reinforced by some form of guarantee to be provided by the United KingdomGovernment. We could not afford to entertain this suggestion; andwe were therefore bound to maintain that the reference to &quot; thedecisions agreed upon by the Governments &quot; did not entitle theFederal Government to impose a veto on proposals which were acceptable to all the other Governments concerned. The PrimeMinister^ reply to Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s latest message should adhere to this attitude. As regards the other matters on which the federal government claimed that they had been insufficiently consulted, we might offer to make these the subject of an additional Order in Council,provided that the necessary provisions were agreed before31st December.In discussion there was general agreement that any action whichmight postpone the date of dissolution of the Federation beyond31st December, 1963, could not be contemplated, since postponement would be liable to provide an opportunity for the reopening of agreements which had already been reached on such issues as thefuture of the Rhodesian railways, the Kariba hydro-electric station,
etc., and would therefore jeopardise the process of orderly dissolution of the Federation. On this assumption, however, the Order in Councilmust be tabled on the following day; and it would be necessary tomake this clear to Sir Roy Welensky. It was more doubtful whetherthe Government could demonstrate, in the face of possible criticismin Parliament, that the provisions of the Order in Council relating tothe apportionment of Federal assets and liabilities were based onsubstantial agreement between the parties concerned or reflected&quot; decisions agreed upon by the Governments&quot;. The federal governments suggestion that some form of additional guarantee should now be attached to the liabilities involved was a significantreservation; and, although there could be no question of ourentertaining this proposal, it might be thought to debar us frompurporting to act on the basis of general agreement. In thesecircumstances it was for consideration whether we should confine theOrder in Council to those provisions which were genuinely agreed by all the parties concerned and should thereafter legislate unilaterallyon any matters of contention or whether we should first offer to discuss further with the Federal Government the issues on which they weredissatisfied. Since it was virtually certain, however, that we should fail to reach agreement with them on the most significant of these issues,i.e., the apportionment of assets and liabilities, any further discussion would serve only to delay the introduction of the Order in Counciland so to jeopardise the 31st December as the date of dissolution ofthe Federation. The wisest course, therefore, might be to adhere toour planned timetable; to table the Order in Council on the following day; to make it clear, in the Prime Minister^ reply toSir Roy Welensky, that we were unable to accept the claim that theFederal Government enjoyed an implicit right of veto on such of its provisions as they did not accept; and to suggest to the commonwealth secretary, who was attending the Independence Celebrations in Kenya,that, before returning to the United Kingdom, he should visit Salisburyin order to defend our attitude to the Federal Government and to explore with them the least contentious method of dealing with other issues which had been raised in Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s messages but didnot need to be dealt with by the Order in Council.The Cabinet then considered the draft of the Order in Councilto be tabled on the following day. The order of certain paragraphswas amended.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theLord President and the Lord Chancellor, would give further consideration, in the light of their discussion, tothe terms in which he should reply to the latest message from the Prime Minister of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland about, the provisions of the Order inCouncil on the dissolution of the Federation.(2) Agreed that no concession should be made to the suggestion of the Federal Government that the apportionment of federal assets and liabilities between the territorial governments should be accompanied by the provision ofsome form of additional guarantee by the UnitedKingdom Government to the stockholders concerned.(3) Agreed that, subject to the amendment approved in their discussion, the Order in Council should be tabled inParliament on the following day.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the suggestion that the commonwealth secretary, before returning from Kenya to the UnitedKingdom, might visit Salisbury in order to explain our attitude to the Federal Government and to seek to resolveany other outstanding issues in connection with the dissolution of the Federation.
Pensions(previous reference:CM. (63) 9thConclusions.Minute I)allowances for WidowedMothersand theirChildrenThe Cabinet-(1) Agreed that widowed mothers&apos; personal allowances,children&apos;s allowances and family allowances should remainin payment until the last child reached age 19.(2) Agreed that allowances to the children of widowed mothersshould be equated with the allowances payable toguardians in respect of orphan children in their care andthat the amount of any such increases should be disregarded in the calculation of National Assistancebenefits.l^.J.Vl. tu2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP. (63) 27) on possible improvements in the provisionfor widowed mothers and their children.The Lord Privy Seal said that at their previous discussion theCabinet had suggested that some acceptable improvement in theposition of widowed mothers might be secured by a combination of measures to raise the age limit for the payment of children&apos;allowances, to increase the amount of those allowances and to raisethe limits of free earnings. The Committee on Pensions and national insurance had now considered these possibilities in detail and had recommended that the age limit should be raised from 18 to 19 andthat the allowances to the children of widowed mothers should beincreased to the level now payable in respect of orphan children inthe care of guardians. In addition it might be expedient to establish an enquiry either into the economic and social circumstances of widows and their children or into the position of married women at work or,alternatively, to commission a wider enquiry into the structure of thepublic and private provision for widows, especially those with children.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If the allowances for the children of widowed mothers were raised only to the levels applicable to orphan children in the care of guardians, some 14,000 widows now in receipt of National Assistancepayments would receive no benefit, because the increased allowances would be offset by reductions in the amount of their national assistance payments. Since it would be unjustifiable to introducemeasures of relief which would apply to all widowed mothers except the comparatively small number who stood in greatest need, it wouldbe necessary to provide that, in the case of widowed mothers, any increase in children&apos;s allowances would be disregarded in the calculation of National Assistance benefits.(b) The measures now proposed were complicated and might therefore be less effective politically in reducing pressure for theabolition of the earnings rule. It might therefore be appropriate that,concurrently with an extension of the age limits and an increase inchildren&apos;s allowances, the limit for free earnings in the case not only of widowed mothers but also of widows and retirement pensionersshould be increased to  7 for widowed mothers and to  5 for the other categories.(c) Any form of enquiry at this stage might expose theGovernment to the criticism either that they were seeking furtherpretexts for delay or that they were insufficiently informed aboutmatters which should have been under close and constant review. Itwould be preferable, therefore, to maintain that the measures nowproposed would provide as great an improvement in the condition ofwidowed mothers as the facts of the situation warranted. It could beadded, if necessary, that, if further changes proved to be justified bya change in the situation, the Government would not hesitate tointroduce them.
(3) Agreed that the earnings limits for widowed mothers, widows and retirement pensioners should be increased to  7 forwidowed mothers and  5 for the other categories.(4) Agreed that no enquiry into the position of widowed mothersor widows should be instituted at the present stage.(5) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance tosubmit to the Prime Minister the draft of a statementannouncing these decisions, to be made in Parliament onthe following day.Indonesia 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary of the(Previous Cabinet, to which was appended a minute from the Chief Secretary,Reference: Treasury, to the Prime Minister on the Decca radar installations in. (63) 2nd Indonesia.Conclusions, .Minute 6) The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Strategic ExportsDecca Radar Committee at their meeting on 6th December had come to the installations conclusion that it was no longer politically possible to justify the continuation of a contract whereby a United Kingdom firm was engaged in work in Indonesia which would strengthen both the offensive and the defensive capability of the Indonesian Government.It might be difficult, however, to secure the withdrawal of thetechnicians involved without jeopardising their personal safety; andour chances of doing so would depend largely on our making public,at the same time, the embargo on the export of arms and military equipment to Indonesia which had been brought privately into forcesome weeks earlier.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Djakarta had reported that itwould be impossible to withdraw the technicians unobtrusively, since they were living in housing provided by the Indonesian Air Force andwould also need to obtain exit permits from the Indonesian authorities.They were unlikely to be in great personal danger; and it was more likely that any reprisals by the Indonesian Government would bedirected against British commercial interests in Indonesia. The valueof these was of the order of  150 million.(b) The military arguments in favour of preventing thecompletion of this contract were less cogent than the political considerations, since it would be at least two years before the completed chain of radar installations came into service. On the otherhand, if the contract was not cancelled, the morale of our forces inSouth-East Asia might suffer; public opinion in the United kingdom would criticise the Governments apparent lack of determination to contain the Indonesian threat; and we should find it difficult to persuade the United States Government and our allies in the north atlantic Treaty Organisation to restrict the export of arms to indonesia.(c) It would be particularly desirable to secure the co-operationof the United States authorities, since some of the work involved wasunder sub-contract to Radio Electronics Limited, a United Statesfirm who would be able to complete the installation unless otherwiseinstructed.(d) Although the Decca Radar Company would probably be willing to comply with the Governmenfs request to withdraw theirtechnicians, such action would constitute a breach of contract and thecompany might require the Government to provide substantialindemnity against any consequent loss or legal process.
Industrial *4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their lastDisputes discussion the Cabinet had invited him to consider the means byRailwaymen&apos;s which it might be possible to relate a 6 per cent increase in wages railwaymen&apos;s pay to a period longer than 12 months. He had now(Previous ascertained that the British Railways Board intended that the 6 perReference- cent award should be payable from 1st January, 1964. On this basisCM. (63) 9th it would be related to a period of 14 months since the last awardConclusions, and would thus be equivalent to an annual rate of increase of minute 5) 5 . 1 per centIn discussion the following points were made:(a) An annual increase of 5-1 per cent would be less damagingthan a simple increase of 6 per cent; but it might still have serious repercussions. It would be important, therefore, that the Board shouldnot agree to a settlement at a figure higher than the 6 per cent whichthey now had in mind.(b) In the light of recent wage settlements, particularly in theengineering and motor vehicle industries, it would become increasingly difficult to restrict wage increases to the level of 3\ to 4 per cent, thelimit justified by increases in productivity. The National economic development Council would shortly discuss incomes policy; and itwas to be hoped that their discussion might evoke a constructiveresponse both from the trade unions and from the employers.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer and of the points made in their discussion.* Previously recorded as a Confidential Annex.secret the Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage lay in withdrawing the technicians at the earliest opportunity and announcing at the same time the Governmentsprevious decision to prohibit the supply of arms and military equipment to Indonesia. No overt action should be taken, however,until there had been further consultation with Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Djakarta and the personal safety of the techniciansand their dependents was assured.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) tomake further enquiries of Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador atDjakarta about the possibility of withdrawing thetechnicians of the Decca Radar Company engaged onradar installations in Indonesia.(2) Agreed, subject to the outcome of the enquiries to be institutedunder Conclusion (1) above, that the contract for theseinstallations should be cancelled.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to give further considerationto the financial implications of the cancellation of the contract.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,IOth December, 1963.Arab-Israel 5.   The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) informedDispute the  Cabinet  that  he  had   received  representations   from  the ambassadors of Saudi Arabia, Iraq and Libya about the public criticism in the United Kingdom of the alleged pressure by ArabGovernments on United Kingdom firms who had connections, or were engaged in trade, with Israel. He had informed them that, while theGovernment had no wish to support either party in the long-standingdispute between Israel and the Arab countries, they strongly resentedany attempt to bring pressure to bear on United Kingdom firms to discriminate on any grounds between members of their staff or tocomply with the Arab attempt to impede trade with Israel.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington).
