Short Brothersand Harland(previous reference:C.C. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Aviation and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 39 and 46respectively), about a proposal to authorise Messrs. Short Brothersand Harland to proceed with development and initial production ofthe Skyvan civil freighter aircraft.The Minister of Aviation said that, as a result of uncertainty about the company&apos;s prospects, the design team at the factory wasshrinking. Although it seemed unlikely that the company could expect a long-term future as designers of aircraft and guided weapons,it would remain important that they should retain an efficient designteam for the next few years, if work on the Belfast aircraft and theSeacat missile was to be completed without interruption. The morale of the team would be considerably improved if the Skyvan project was put in hand; and, although there was some risk that the company would not succeed in selling a sufficient number of this aircraft tobreak even on their total investment, the advantages to be gained byimplementing the project would outweigh the risk that some part ofthe further investment needed to complete the programme might haveto be written off. The company were satisfied that they could find the necessary finance, amounting to some  1-6 million, within the 10 million already allocated to them under the conditional grantwhich the Government had approved in 1962 for the completion ofthe Belfast and Seacat programmes; and the Government of NorthernIreland had agreed to assume a 25 per cent share of the liabilityarising from this commitment on the same basis as their participation in the initial conditional grant.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, in the light of the continuing increase in public expenditure, it was essential that theGovernment should not embark upon additional projects unless very strong arguments could be advanced in their favour. By this criterionthe Skyvan project could not be justified. No domestic demand forthis aircraft was in prospect; and all previous experience suggestedthat this made it unlikely that it would command an extensive marketabroad. As regards the maintenance of employment in NorthernIreland, the Government were already providing substantial assistance for this purpose in various ways; and the effect of themeasures in question would be reinforced if, as was not unlikely,Messrs. Shorts received the order for the substantial number of armyhelicopters on which agreement had now been reached between theTreasury and the Ministry of Defence. Finally, it was not certainthat any support for the Skyvan would in fact encourage the designteam to remain with the company; and, if there was in any event nolong-term future for the team, it was doubtfully wise to lead its members to suppose the contrary.The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the high level ofunemployment in Northern Ireland, the future of the company wasa politically sensitive issue in Ulster. Although the company&apos;s labour force might begin to rise again from 1967 onwards, it was likely to fall during the interval before that date; and the Skyvan projectwould help to avert the risk of this decline. Moreover, it would create a very unfortunate impression if, as a result of the shrinkageof the design team, the company were subsequently driven to engageadditional personnel in order to complete the contract for the belfast aircraft.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be politically advisable to proceed with the Skyvan project. ThrGovernmenfs original commitment had admittedly been limited t.SECRET 3CM. 13 (64)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
an undertaking to provide up to  10 million if this sum was requiredin order to complete the Belfast contract. It did not automaticallyfollow that, in so far as the money was not required for this purpose,it could be diverted to some other project, particularly if the newventured prospects of commercial success were not assured. On theother hand it was widely known that a sum of  10 million in total was available to the company; and the fact that the Government ofNorthern Ireland were prepared to assume as great a liability inrelation to the Skyvan project as in relation to the purposes of theoriginal grant would make it difficult for the Government to defend a  refusal to proceed with that project. If so, however, it must beaccepted that the process of subsidising the company could not continue indefinitely and that there could be no assurance that further work for Messrs. Shorts, beyond the Skyvan project and thepossible order for helicopters, could be provided.The Cabinet Approved the proposal to authorise Messrs. Short Brothersand Harland to complete development and initialproduction of the Skyvan civil freighter aircraft on the basisdescribed in CP. (64) 39.Pension Rights        3.   The   Cabinet   had   before   them   memoranda   by   theof the Director Attorney-General (CP. (64) 43) and by the Home Secretary and theof Public Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 48), on the pension rights of theProsecutions Director of Public Prosecutions.The Home Secretary said that the Home Affairs Committee had failed to reach agreement on this issue, which required early decisionsince the present Director was due to retire in the near future andthe pension entitlement of the post was relevant to the choice of a successor.The Director was a civil servant, who had hitherto beenpensionable under the Civil Service Superannuation Acts. If a futureDirector were appointed from outside the Civil Service, he wouldprobably be unable, on retirement, to claim more than 15 years service for purposes of pension; and his entitlement under the superannuation Acts would amount, on the basis of &quot; added years &quot;,to a pension of  2,025 and a lump sum of approximately  4,000. Asan alternative, the Government could maintain on his behalf a privateinsurance contract within an annual limit of 10 per cent of salary;and this might provide an annuity of the order of  2,500. The LordChancellor and the Attorney-General, however, believed that apension on this scale would be insufficient to attract a suitablecandidate; and they had therefore proposed that the Director shouldbe granted the same pension entitlement as a judge, namely  3,375after 15 years&apos; service. Such an arrangement, however, would involve legislation; and, in view of the repercussions on other superannuationarrangements, the proposal was of doubtful validity.In discussion there was a considerable measure of agreementwith this view on the grounds that:(a) It might be desirable, as a first step, to try to recruit a newDirector on the existing Civil Service terms and only to reconsiderthese if the attempt failed.(b) The pension entitlement of  2,025 under the SuperannuationActs was based on a presumption of retirement at the age of 65. Butthere was no reason why the Director should not remain in officebeyond that age, subject to the normal considerations of health and efficiency; and the pension entitlement would then be increasedproportionately. This possibility should be made plain to potentialcandidates for the office.
Resale PricesBill(previous reference:CM. (64) 4thConclusions)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 52) about the Resale PricesBill, together with a Note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(CP. (64) 53) to which was appended the text of the Bill.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the Resale PricesBill, which he hoped to introduce in the House of Commons on25th February, gave effect to the Cabinefs decision that resale price maintenance should be prohibited, subject to the provision of a rightto apply to a judicial tribunal for exemption. The Bill made itunlawful for a supplier of goods not exempted from the prohibition to fix a price below which the goods might not be resold. The supplierwould remain free to fix and to enforce a maximum resale price andto recommend an appropriate minimum resale price; but he wouldnot be allowed to enforce the recommended minimum price bywithholding goods from a dealer who sold below that price. Therewould be a special exemption, however, enabling a supplier to withhold goods from a dealer who sold them as &quot; loss leaders &quot;,i.e., at or below the price which he paid for them. The prohibitionsin the Bill would be enforceable by civil proceedings in which, if itwere shown that a supplier had withheld goods from a customerknown to have sold below the minimum price, it would be presumed that this action was the reason for the goods being withheld but itwould be open to the supplier to rebut the presumption by proving that the goods had in fact been withheld on some other ground.CM. 13 (64)(c) Legislation to provide a higher pension for the Directorwould inevitably provoke claims for similar special treatment fromother professional members of the Civil Service, particularly as itwas often necessary to recruit them in mid-career.(d) It would be unwise, therefore, to embark on legislation inthe case of the Director without first reviewing, in terms of theprinciples involved, the conditions of service of the professionalclasses of the Civil Service.On the other hand it was pointed out that:(e) Confidential enquiries had shown that on the basis of thepresent pension entitlement it would be difficult, if not impossible,to attract to the post of Director an individual having, as was essential, the qualities and reputation of a judge of the High Court.(/) The possibility that a future Director might be permitted tocontinue to serve after age 65 was only conditional and could not properly be offered as a firm inducement to recruitment.(g) The post of Director was similar to that of the judge advocate-General; and, when the most recent appointment to thelatter post was made, the individual concerned had been promised that, on retirement, he would be given the option of a pension on either judicial or Civil Service terms. It would be possible to justifysimilar treatment for the Director.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theHome Affairs Committee should reconsider the issues involved in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion. It would be desirable, however, toreach a decision, if necessary after further reference to the Cabinet,within the next few weeks.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the Home AffairsCommittee to reconsider, in the light of their discussion, the issues raised by CP. (64) 43 and 48.
The Restrictive Practices Court would be empowered to grantexemption in respect of particular classes of goods on the applicationof suppliers, but not of retailers. The latter, however, would been abled to apply to the Court for the right of audience through arepresentative body in proceedings which concerned them. pending a decision by the Court, goods in respect of which an applicationhad been made within four months after the enactment of the bill would be treated as exempt. The grounds on which it was proposedthat exemption should be granted reflected the arguments normallyput forward in justification of resale price maintenance, namely that,in its absence, there would be a substantial reduction in the varietyor quality of the goods available to the public or a loss of retailoutlets, causing severe inconvenience, or the cessation or substantial reduction of necessary services. If one or more of these grounds were established, the applicant would be required to show that the detriment to consumers of the goods in question would outweigh anydetriment, whether by the restriction of competition or otherwise,resulting from the continuance of resale price maintenance in respectof those goods. It had been suggested that, in addition to exemptionby the Restrictive Practices Court, there should be a statutoryexemption for certain classes of goods in respect of which thepractice of resale price maintenance had already been examined either by the Restrictive Practices Court or by the Monopolies Commission.If it were accepted, however, that exemption should be a matter of judicial, rather than administrative, decision, it would be wrong andunfair to other manufacturers to take the decision out of the tribunalshands in respect of a small number of trades; and the wisest courseappeared to be to require all claimants for exemption to conform to the procedure provided in the Bill.In discussion it was suggested that one of the points to whichcriticism of the Bill was most likely to be directed was the fact thattrades in which resale price maintenance had already been held bythe Monoplies Commission or the Restrictive Practices Court to benot inconsistent with the public interest would be required to make their case again, at considerable cost, before the Restrictive PracticesCourt. There was likely to be strong pressure for books and tobacco,in particular, to be given statutory exemption. It would be wrong,however, to make a concession on this point, since the casespreviously heard by the Monopolies Commission and the restrictive practices Court had been considered on a different basis from thatlaid down in the Bill. The situation would be changed by thestatutory prohibition of resale price maintenance; and to exempttrades which had already been considered could not fail to weaken the Bill by implying that Parliament had anticipated the Court informing a view of the manner in which the criteria for exemptionwere to be interpreted and the balance of public advantage was to be judged. An alternative method of according special treatment tothe trades in question, by deeming them to have been grantedexemption under clause 5 with the consequence that it would be opento the Court to consider them after an interval of two years, would besubject to the same objections of principle. Consideration could begiven, however, to enabling the trades in question to avoid part ofthe expense of making their case afresh by empowering the restrictive Practices Court to take account of evidence given either before the Monopolies Commission or in earlier proceedings beforethe Court; and it would in any event be open to the applicants tocite the conclusions of the Commission and the Court. It would bedesirable that attention should be drawn to this fact both in debates in Parliament and in any statement made on the publication of theBill. The possibility could also be considered of allowing the applicants costs where a trade in respect of which resale price maintenance had previously been found to be not inconsistent withthe public interest was successful in obtaining an order under clause 5 of the Bill.
A further point of possible criticism was the fact that, whereasspokesmen for the Government had given the impression that any individual whose interests were affected by the Bill would have anopportunity to make a case before the tribunal for the retention ofresale price maintenance, the initiative in making applications wasin fact to be confined to suppliers. A retailer would consequentlyhave no right to be heard unless a supplier had first applied to theCourt; and, since resale price maintenance operated primarily in theinterests of retailers, it was not certain that suppliers would be readyto make application in respect of goods on which retailers wishedto see fixed prices maintained. But, while there would be undoubtedadvantage from a presentational point of view in allowing retailersto exercise an initiative in making applications to the Court, to do so would seriously delay the abolition of resale price maintenance, sincethe mere fact of an application would ensure that, until the case hadbeen disposed of by the Court, the goods in question would be exempt from the prohibition. Moreover, there might be thought tosome unreality in applying to the- Court to authorise suppliers toenforce fixed prices when, ex hypothesi, they were not interested in doing so. The associations of retailers were aware that they wouldnot have the initiative and had accepted this as a necessaryconcomitant of a scheme involving application to a judicial tribunalas distinct from an arrangement for considering applications by administrative means.In discussion of the text of the draft Bill the following main points were made:(a) The provisions of clause 5 about the grounds of exemption from the prohibitions in the Bill might be thought to be undulyrestrictive in certain respects. They were defined in terms of severeinconvenience or detriment to the public as consumers or users ofthe goods to which the applications related; and it would apparentlynot be open to a supplier, or to a retailer supporting his application,to argue that, if certain shops were not able to maintain prices for goods of one category, they would be unable to continue to supplyothers or to provide the public with a particular service, such as the delivery of newspapers. Pharmaceutical chemists, in particular,would probably wish to argue that, if their profit margins oncosmetics and toilet goods were reduced, they would be liable,particularly in rural areas, to be forced out of business, with resultantinconvenience to the public not as users or consumers of cosmeticsbut as users of the dispensing service which was in part subsidisedby the chemists general trade. On the other hand some limitation on the scope of the grounds which could be advanced for theretention of resale price maintenance was inescapable if the issue wasto be determined by a judicial tribunal; and any issue wider thanthat defined by clause 5 as drafted would be liable to be notjusticiable. Moreover, to allow advocates of resale price maintenanceto defend its retention in relation to one class of goods on the groundthat profits on those goods subsidised the sale of other goods would open the way to the retention of the practice over a wide field andwould remove the incentive, which it was one of the objects of theBill to provide, for the more effective organisation of retail distribution.(b) The structure of clause 5 required the Court, before grantingexemption, to be satisfied that one of the disadvantages indicated inparagraphs (a) to (c) of clause 5 (2) would otherwise ensue and to be convinced, in addition, that the detriment resulting to consumers orusers of the goods in question from the abolition of resale price maintenance would outweigh any detriment resulting from its continuance. It did not appear, however, that it would be sufficient,in order to satisfy the first part of this requirement, to show, forexample, that severe inconvenience would be caused to the public ina particular area or type of area; and the provision might be
clarified, without weakening its effect as a whole, by referring inparagraphs (a), (b) and (c) to &quot; the public or any substantial sectionthereof &quot;. Consideration might also be given to the question whether,in view of the duty laid down on the Court of weighing the balanceof advantage to the public, it was necessary for paragraph (b) to define the detriment to the public in terms as strict as &quot; severeinconvenience&quot;. There might be advantage in using the term&quot; substantial &quot; in paragraph (b) as well as in paragraphs (a) and (c).(c) In view of the absence of provision for retailers to initiateproceedings before the Court considerable importance would attach to their right of audience in any proceedings which concerned them;and, while it was necessary that the Court should retain discretion torefuse frivolous or vexatious applications, it would be desirable tomake it clear, explicitly in the Bill if possible, that the normal coursewould be for the right of audience to be accorded to retailers. Thepossibility might be considered of imposing a duty on the registrar of the Court to ensure that the necessary steps were taken to enableretailers with a bona fide interest in the proceedings to be heard; andin any event it should be made clear in any Ministerial statements onthe Bill that the practical effect of the provisions in clause 7 (3) wouldbe to secure a hearing to retailers with a genuine interest in theproceedings.(d) It was not yet clear whether the volume of business inScotland would be sufficient to necessitate the appointment of anadditional judge of the Court of Session; but this possibility shouldbe left open.In further discussion on the presentation of the Bill it was agreedthat it should be introduced early in the week beginning23rd February. There would be advantage in publishing theforthcoming White Paper on monopolies and restrictive practicesshortly after the Bill had been introduced and before it received its second Reading. It would be important to ensure that adequate time was allowed for the discussion of the Bill in the House of Lords.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the Resale Prices Bill provided an acceptable solution to the difficult problem of prohibiting resale price maintenance, while providing reasonable opportunities for theconsideration of claims for the exemption of particular trades. Itwas clear that, if such claims were to be dealt with by a judicialprocess, it would be unwise to provide statutory exemption fortrades in respect of which resale price maintenance had already beenexonerated by the Restrictive Practices Court or the monopolies commission; and, in meeting criticism on this point, it would benecessary to rely on such means as it might be found possible toprovide for reducing the cost to the trades in question of applying to the Court under the Bill. Nor did it appear possible significantlyto extend the grounds on which exemption might be granted or toallow retailers to exercise an initiative in making applications to theCourt. In the light of the discussion, however, further consideration should be given to drafting amendments which would enable full weight to be given to the inconvenience which the abolition of resale price maintenance on particular categories of goods might cause tosections of the public and to making it clear on the face of the bill that representative retailers would normally be heard in cases whichconcerned them. It would be important that the provisions of theBill should be fully explained on its introduction; and the necessary arrangements should be made in consultation with the minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes).The Cabinet (1) Subject to further consideration of drafting amendments suggested in their discussion, approved the introductionof the Resale Prices Bill in the House of Commons at anearly date.
*5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (CP. (64) 54) on the pay claim for postmen.The Postmaster-General said that, in accordance with the cabinets earlier decision (CM. (64) 11th Conclusions, Minute 6),he had offered the Union of Post Office Workers a three-year pay agreement, involving an increase of 4 per cent in the first year withan increase of 1\ per cent in each of the next two years. The union had rejected this offer and had indicated that they would only accepta settlement based on an increase of 5 per cent in the first year. Thiswould involve, for all those grades represented by the union who werenot covered by the central settlement for the non-industrial CivilService, an average increase of A\ per cent in the first year and 3J percent over the whole three-year period. This might be regarded as not wholly incompatible with the Governments incomes policy,particularly since, if the union&apos;s claim were not met, they mightresort to industrial action and would be liable to have public sympathy on their side.In discussion there was general agreement that an increase of5 per cent in the first year should not be conceded. It was forconsideration whether an increase of 4^ per cent should be offered,on the grounds that, even if it were refused it would demonstrate theGovernments willingness to meet the union half way. On the otherhand postmen&apos;s existing wage had been fixed by arbitration as lateas 1963, after taking into account a survey by the Pay Research unit of comparable outside employment; and an increase of 4 per centon the figure then established would compare reasonably with the subsequent increase in wages both within the Civil Service and inoutside employment. Moreover, an offer of A\ per cent, no less than an offer of 5 per cent, would constitute a breach of the governments incomes policy; and, in so far as it approached nearer to the union&apos;demand than the Governments original offer of 4 per cent, it mightbe more difficult to sustain against further pressure than the fullydefensible offer of 4 per cent. If the union were unable to accept this offer, they should be prepared to take the issue to arbitration;and the fact that they had hitherto refused to do so constituted noreason why the Government should seek to compromise with them atthe expense of the incomes policy.The Cabinet Agreed that the offer of a three-year pay agreement to theUnion of Post Office Workers should continue to be based,as regards Postmen and Postmen Higher Grade, on anincrease not exceeding 4 per cent in the first year.Cabinet Office, SWA,20th February, 1964.Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETPostmen&apos;sPay(previous reference:CM. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 6)(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to consider, inconsultation with the Minister without Portfolio(Mr. Deedes), arrangements for securing appropriatepublicity for the Bill on its introduction.(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for Industry would bring before them at an early meeting a draft white paper on monopolies and restrictive practices.
