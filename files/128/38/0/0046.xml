Parliament l.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Accommoda-rion forParliament2. The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet that the HomeAffairs Committee had recently considered the report of the Speakerscommittee on Accommodation for the House of Commons. As a resultthey had recommended that the Government should seek to reach agreement with the Opposition on the terms of a Motion whereby the House of Commons would endorse in principle the proposal to enlarge the existing accommodation; but they had suggested that the issues of the site and architectural style of the new building should be deferred for subsequent consideration in the light of the findings of an enquiry which was currently being conducted by Sir Leslie Martininto the redevelopment of the Whitehall area in general.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.Since the House of Lords would not be likely to benefit from theincrease in accommodation which was envisaged, it would be preferable that any public reference to the Governments intentionsshould be expressed in terms of an increase of accommodation for theHouse of Commons rather than for Parliament as a whole.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference :CM. (64) 30thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said thata recent debate in the House of Lords on the compensation provision which had been made, on the dissolution of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, for former members of the Federal PublicService had disclosed that a considerable body of opinion was highlycritical of the arrangements which had been made in this context. lord salisbury now intended to table a Motion as the basis for a furtherdebate; and it seemed probable that, if the Government contested it,they would be defeated. In these circumstances it was for consideration whether they should offer to reconsider the arrangements.In discussion it was suggested that, since the original settlementhad been reached only with great difficulty, it would be inadvisableon merits, and possibly damaging as a precedent, to offer to reopen it.On the other hand the provision which we normally made forexpatriate public servants at the end of a colonial administration wasappreciably more generous than that which had been accorded to themembers of the public service of the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland; and, inasmuch as the arrangements had been influenced by the amount of financial assistance which we had been preparedto provide for the purpose, it could be argued that we were under come degree of moral obligation to reconsider the question.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, the Minister of State for commonwealth relations and the Secretary for Technical Co-operation toconsider, as a matter of urgency:(a) By what means the Government could secure, in theforthcoming debate in the House of Lords on thecompensation paid to members of the public serviceof the former Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,the most favourable presentation of the attitude whichthe Government had hitherto adopted in this matter.(b) Whether, in addition, the  Government should beprepared to take some initiative in order to promotean improvement of the settlement in this respect.
ForeignAffairsSouth Africa(previous reference :Minute 1)4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that a votewould be taken that day in the Security Council of the United nations on a resolution about apartheid in the Republic of South Africa. this resolution, which had been promoted by the Norwegian delegationafter intensive diplomatic negotiations, was less embarrassing thanCM. (63) 14th we had feared at an earlier date. In particular it avoided any referenceConclusions, to economic sanctions as such and confined itself to proposing theestablishment of an expert committee to study the feasibility andimplications of measures which could be taken by the Security council under the Charter of the United Nations. In addition it reaffirmedthe CounciFs exhortation to all member States to cease forthwith thesale and shipment to South Africa of arms, ammunition, militaryvehicles and equipment and materials for the manufacture andmaintenance of arms and ammunition in the Republic. If we abstained from voting on this resolution, we should be liable to find ourselvesvirtually alone. There was therefore a strong case for voting in itsfavour, provided that, in doing so, we made it clear that, while we accepted the consequential obligation to take part in the work of theproposed expert committee, our participation would imply no commitment on our part to support the application of coercivemeasures to South Africa at any time in the future and would bedirected to eliciting the dangers and disadvantages of adopting apolicy of economic sanctions. As regards the reference to the exportof arms the United Kingdom Permanent Representative would be instructed to make it clear that our policy on this subject would remain unchanged.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage inclined in favour of participating in the work of theproposed expert committee, if only in order to ensure that we should maintain some degree of control over any enquiry into the feasibility of economic sanctions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom permanent Representative at the United Nations to vote in favour of the resolution on apartheid, to be debated inthe Security Council that day, on the understanding thatour vote would be accompanied by a public explanation of our policy in this matter, as indicated by the foreign secretary during their discussion.Laos(previous reference :CM. (64) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that our efforts to promote aninternational conference on Laos on the basis of the proposals putforward by the Polish Government had suffered a further setbackin that the Polish Government had now withdrawn their proposals infavour of others which we had not yet received. Provided that thenew proposals would constitute an adequate basis for an international conference and were not unsatisfactory in other respects, it would stillbe to our advantage to endorse them.The Cabinet-(2) Took note, with approval, of this statement by the foreign secretary.United nations conference on trade.andDevelopment(previous reference :CM. (64) 31stConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Secretary of State for Industry informed the Cabinet thatthe United Nations Conference on Trade and Development(UNCTAD) had concluded its deliberations. The outcome was not unsatisfactory from our point of view, especially in so far as the&quot; chapeau &quot; formula (which governed the resolutions relating tocommodity arrangements and access to markets for primary products)had been adopted in a form which we could accept and the Final act of the conference had contained no provisions purporting to be of a mandatory nature. Moreover, the reservations which we had been
InternationalCurrencySupport(previous reference :C.C. (63) 32ndConclusions,Minute 3)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet that,although the initiative which we had taken in 1962 in order to promote a more liberal and flexible supply of international credit had beenreceived with relatively little enthusiasm at the time, it had subsequently attracted increased support; and the United States inparticular now agreed with us that it would be desirable to take somepractical measures for this purpose. No rapid progress could beexpected, especially since the countries of the European economic community were opposed to any action which might aggravate the inflationary tendencies from which some of them were alreadysuffering. Nevertheless, there were grounds for hoping that agreement might be reached in the relatively near future on a modest expansionof the resources of the International Monetary Fund, which would contribute to our long-term objective of increasing internationalliquidity.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.NationalInsuranceShort-termBenefitsRelated to earnings(previous reference :CM. (64) 24thConclusions,Minute 4)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, as Chairman of the Committee on Pensions and national Insurance (CP. (64) 118), together with a joint memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP. (64) 121), on earnings-related short-term benefits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Committee on pensions and National Insurance had considered whether the principleof relating benefits to earnings should be extended to the short-term benefits of the national insurance scheme and, if so, whether proposalsfor this purpose should be published in a White Paper on the linesof the draft annexed to CP. (64) 118. The proposals summarised inthat draft envisaged that basic unemployment and sickness benefit would be increased by a graduated supplement amounting to three-eighths of earnings between  9 and  18. The supplement wouldbe paid for six months; but for technical reasons it could not be paid for the first week of unemployment or the first four weeks of sickness.The scheme, which would cost  50 million, would be financed by anincrease in the contribution which employers and employees alreadyCM. 32 (64)compelled to make in relation to various items during the proceedingsof the conference were fully on record. Further consideration wouldhave to be given, however, to the arrangements to be made(particularly as regards voting procedures) in connection with thenew institution which would now be established to carry forward thework of the conference.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Industry and congratulated him on the mannerin which he had defended the interests of the UnitedKingdom during the proceedings of the United nations conference on Trade and Development.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to submit in due course proposals about the policy which we should adoptas regards the arrangements to be made in relation to thenew institution which was to develop the work of theconference on a continuing basis.
paid on earnings in this range. A similar supplement, related to the husband&apos;s earnings, would be added to widows&apos; allowances. Themajority of the Committee had favoured the publication of theseproposals; but both he himself and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had felt compelled to dissent.The Minister of Labour said that these proposals had to beconsidered against the background of discussions, extending oversome 18 months, during which the National Economic development council (N.E.D.C.) had drawn attention to the advantages of earnings-related unemployment benefit and both the British Employers&apos;Confederation (B.E.C.) and the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) had indicated that they supported the concept in principle. The T.U.C. hadadvocated, in addition, that earnings-related benefit should beextended to sickness. These discussions had led the public to expectGovernment action; and it would be difficult in the present climateof opinion to avoid any expression of the Governments intentions.There was a growing tendency to regard the concept of flat-rateminimum benefits as outmoded and to consider hardship not inabsolute terms but in terms of the disparity between relatively highearnings (and the standard of living which they made possible) andthe relatively low level of benefit. There were powerful economic arguments for relating unemployment benefit to earnings. To do so would reinforce other measures to encourage the mobility of labour;it would reduce the reluctance of workers and employers to abandonboth restrictive practices and over-manning; and it would actautomatically as an anti-cyclical measure, sustaining purchasingpower in areas of high unemployment. These arguments did not applyto sickness benefit; but in relation both to sickness and to widowhoodthe need to provide protection against a sudden and sharp reductionin income was as compelling as in relation to unemployment.The majority of the Committee on Pensions and national insurance considered that, if it were decided to adopt the principle of earnings-related short-term benefits, it would be wise to publish a white Paper before the Recess as a means of indicating that theessential features of the proposals had been formulated with care,while making it sufficiently clear, as a counter to pressure forpremature legislation, that important details remained to be discussed with the interested parties.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that those who were mostconcerned with social problems, both among the government&apos;s supporters and elsewhere, now believed that resources should be concentrated on the areas of greatest need; and they would considerit a retrograde step to devote an additional  50 million a year toprotecting the more highly-paid workers against the effects of short-term unemployment. A temporary reduction in income, which was already mitigated by redundancy payments and rebates of incometax, involved considerably less hardship than was suffered by the oldand the chronic sick; and it was arguable that those in receipt of short-term sickness benefit would be helped more by payments which increased at the end of seven months than by an arrangement whichreduced them to the basic level at that point. The economic arguments in favour of the scheme were equally unconvincing. Men would hardly be brought to accept redundancy willingly because their loss of income,though substantial, was rather less than it would otherwise have been;and to the extent that the scheme encouraged employers to reduceover-manning it would discourage displaced workers from seekingearly re-employment. Moreover, the scheme would give the largestproportional benefit to single men, the most mobile section of thelabour force.In addition the proposals would entail formidable practical problems, which had not been resolved. The radical changes whichwould be necessary in the system of graduated contributions mightdiscourage the provision of private occupational pension schemes
and might precipitate demands for early increases in the flat-ratebenefits; it would be difficult to justify the disparity in treatment between those on unemployment and those on sickness benefit and between both these categories and the self-employed; and theadministrative costs would be unduly high. Finally, there appearedto be no strong demand for a scheme of this kind; and to publish theproposals in a White Paper would be liable to expose the Governmentto damaging attack without countervailing advantages sufficient tojustify the imposition of a further burden on the economy. this consideration was the more relevant in that it was clear that expenditure on benefits and assistance could not be contained withinthe limits forecast in the Governments recent White Paper on public expenditure unless the next general increase in benefits were deferred until 1966; and this would become impossible if the Government were committed to specific improvements in benefits and contributions atthis stage.In discussion it was suggested that, while both the J3.E.C andthe T.U.C. would prefer graduated benefit to be higher, bothorganisations considered that, together with other measures, it wouldmake a substantial contribution to reducing the effect of a sudden lossof income and so to facilitating the consideration of problems of redundancy and over-manning and the adjustment of displacedworkers to what might be permanently lower wage levels in new fields of employment. In view of the interest which had been generated on both sides of industry it would be difficult to explain, if theGovernment now held back, why the discussions had been allowed toproceed so far. Moreover, the capacity of the economy to sustainhigher benefits would depend on increasing expansion; and it could therefore be argued to be desirable on economic grounds to give priority to measures which would be likely to encourage growth and modernisation. The cost of wage-related unemployment benefit would fall mainly on the employer and the employee and only indirectly onthe Exchequer in the form of a reduction in the taxable capacity ofthe individuals affected; and the additional burden on industrial costs would be small in relation to the wages element and might be expectedto be offset by the increased prosperity resulting from the more economic use of labour.On the other hand a considerable section of public opinion might feel that the more highly-paid workers could be expected to draw onsavings to tide them over short periods of unemployment and that thegreater social need was for an increase in basic rates and particularly for preferential increases for the very old and the chronic sick.Moreover, it would be difficult to give higher benefits to the better-off without increasing benefits for other classes; and there might accordingly be advantage in presenting earnings-related unemployment and sickness benefit as part of a comprehensive seriesof measures, including the introduction of preferential benefits for thevery old and the chronic sick.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be desirable toavoid committing the Government at this stage to the details of aparticular scheme, since this would enable their political opponents,while purporting to offer more attractive proposals, to level damagingcriticism at particular features of the Governments scheme. It might therefore be preferable to publish a more tentative White Paper,discussing the problem and outlining the proposals in the Annex to cp. (64) 118 in general terms as one possible way of dealing with it.Alternatively, some indication of the Governments intentions mightbe given in a public speech, preferably by the Prime Minister, shortly before the summer Recess.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet favoured the principle of wage-related
8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (64) 119) about trade unions and the law, to which was annexed a supplementary report of the Official Committee on thissubject, together with an Opinion of the Law Officers on the case ofRookes v. Barnard, in which the House of Lords had ruled thatemployees threatening to strike in breach of contract, together with trade union officials acting in concert with them, were liable for damages at the suit of persons who were injured in consequence ofthe threat.The Minister of Labour said that the Trades Union Congress(T.U.C.) had recently represented to him that this judgment would be liable to have a very damaging effect on industrial relations and had asked that the Government should introduce legislation immediately in order to restore to trade unions the degree of protection in thisrespect which they had hitherto assumed that they enjoyed under theTrade Disputes Act, 1906. He had replied that, while he accepted that the present state of the law was not satisfactory, he was by nomeans certain about the extent of the change required and that itwould not in any event be possible to legislate on the issues involvedduring the remainder of the current Session. In addition he hadreminded the T.U.C. that the Government had deliberately proposedthat the projected enquiry into the state of the law relating to tradeunions in general should be deferred until after the forthcomingGeneral Election in order that it might begin its work in an atmospherefree from political controversy. The T.U.C., however, had contestedthese arguments and had reiterated their request for early legislation.In these circumstances he proposed that he should now inform themthat the Government accepted the need for a review of the law relatingto the issues which had been raised by the case of Rookes v. Barnardbut considered that this review could most appropriately beundertaken in the context of the proposed enquiry into the state ofthe law in relation to trade unions in general. If, therefore, the T.U.C.felt that this latter enquiry should be started forthwith and shouldbe invited to give early and sympathetic consideration to an amendment of the law on the issues raised by the case of Rookes v.Barnard, the Government would be willing to discuss the scope and form of the enquiry, both with the T.U.C. and with the british employers&apos; Confederation, without delay.Trade unions and the Law(previous reference :CM. (64) 19thConclusions,Minute 6)m8 SECRETbenefits, provided that a scheme for this purpose was combined withpreferential benefits for the very old and the chronic sick. But it wouldbe necessary to give further consideration to the relative priority tobe accorded to these various elements in a composite scheme and tothe form and timing of the most appropriate announcement of theGovernments intentions. Meanwhile, Government spokesmen should avoid making any statement which might be interpreted as committing the Government to the principle of wage-related benefits.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that a scheme of wage-related unemployment and sickness benefits and widows&apos;allowances should be introduced, in conjunction withpreferential benefits for the very old and the chronic sick.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theCommittee on Pensions and National Insurance to give further consideration to the issues involved on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing-up of their discussion.
Burma :War DamageClaims(previous reference :C.C. (62) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (64) 116), reporting a recommendation by theEconomic Policy Committee that retrospective legislation should beintroduced in the following Session in order to protect the Crownagainst certain types of compensation claims.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the claims which had given rise to the immediate problem related to properties destroyedby United Kingdom authorities in Burma in 1942 in order to denythem to the invading Japanese forces. In 1948 the Government of theday had paid certain of the claimants (including the claimants nowin question) a sum of  10 million on an ex gratia basis. In 1961,however, after finally failing to establish claims which they hadpromoted in the Burmese courts, certain companies had institutedactions against the Government in the Scottish courts. On theauthority of the Cabinet they were then formally warned that theGovernment were satisfied that the claim should not be met by theBritish taxpayer and that, in the unlikely event of their actionsucceeding in the courts, legislation would be introduced to indemnify the Crown against it. Despite this warning, four of the companies,subsidiaries of the Burmah Oil Company, had pursued their actions;and the proceedings had recently reached the House of Lords on a preliminary point of law affecting the admissibility of the actions in common law in the light of the fact that they had been instituted inScotland and were therefore governed by Scottish law. The House ofLords had found that the claims were admissible in law and that,provided that the facts on which they were based could be proved, the cm. 32 (64)In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If it were decided to reply to the T.U.C. on these lines, itwould be preferable to refrain from using the terms &quot; review &quot; and&quot; sympathetic consideration &quot; in relation to any amendment of the lawas a result of the case of Rookes v. Barnard in order to avoid anyimplication that the Government were committed to more than an impartial examination of the issues involved.(b) The proposed enquiry would necessarily be lengthy; and thepreparation of the evidence alone would take several months. Therewould therefore be advantage in starting it as soon as possible. Onthe other hand, it would not be wholly effective unless it obtained thefull co-operation of the T.U.C.; and it would therefore be unwise topress them to agree, against their will, that it should be initiatedforthwith.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister of Labour should inform the T.U.C. that, while theGovernment had originally proposed that the enquiry into the law relating to trade unions in general should not be started until afterthe General Election, they were ready to initiate it now if the T.U.C.so desired. If, however, they did not desire it at this stage, theGovernment would think it right to maintain their previous decision and would not be prepared to anticipate the general enquiry byinitiating action solely in relation to the implications of the case ofRookes v. Barnard. In replying to the T.U.C. the Minister should avoid implying that the Government had reached any conclusion onthe desirability of an eventual amendment of the law in this respect.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour, in replying to therepresentatives of the Trades Union Congress about the implications of the recent judgment by the House of lords in the case of Rookes v. Barnard, to be guided by the PrimeMinisters summing-up of their discussion.
claimants would be entitled to damages. These four actions, togetherwith eight similar actions which were at present stayed, involvedclaims amounting to over  100 million; and, although otherunsatisfied claims arising from similar circumstances in Burma would now be time-barred, the judgment of the House of Lords might havewidespread repercussions in relation to other claims which were notyet similarly excluded. Moreover, although that judgment was strictly limited to Scottish law, the House of Lords had declared (obiter) thatEnglish law was the same. It now appeared, therefore, that certain actsdone by or on the authority of the Crown in the defence of the realm, although lawful at common law, might nevertheless givepersons affected a right to compensation which was in principleindistinguishable from the right to damages in respect of unlawfulacts. This concept was wholly novel in English law; and it wasimpossible to foresee what claims against the Crown might arise as aresult. The Economic Policy Committee had therefore concluded thatit would be desirable and prudent to enact legislation now, dealingboth with the Burma claims and with the possible wider implicationsin respect of actions for compensation against the Crown, rather than to await the course of events and perhaps to face the need forretrospective legislation on some future occasion in order to avoid an intolerable claim.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The judgment of the House of Lords had been given by onlya narrow majority of 3 2; and some legal opinion saw greater meritin the minority judgment.(b) On occasion Parliament had enacted legislation to providecompensation for war damage; but this did not in any sense imply that the Government could accept a position in which any act of Statemight create a right to damages at law, a position for which there wasno precedent in English law as interpreted hitherto.(c) There were serious objections in principle to retrospectivelegislation; and it might therefore be expedient to defer for a timeany announcement that the Government intended to introduce ameasure of this kind. On the other hand the longer the announcement was delayed the more difficult would it become to deal with thelitigation which was currently in progress and the more invidiouswould be the Governmenfs position when the full measure of theproposed retrospection became finally apparent.(d) On the other hand the uncertainty of the legal position mightoffer scope for interlocutory proceedings by the Government whichwould constitute proper and reasonable grounds for postponing anannouncement of their intentions.(e) Even if this announcement were postponed, however, the drafting of the necessary legislation should be put in hand as rapidly as possible.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Solicitor-General for Scotland to inform thecompanies claiming war damages in respect of their assets in Burma that he had nothing to add to the statement,made in 1961, that the Government would, if necessary,introduce legislation to indemnify the Crown against these claims.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to consider, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, whether the Governmentshould institute interlocutory proceedings in connectionwith the claims.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thepreparation of legislation to indemnify the Crown, withretrospective effect, against claims for damages in respectof acts lawful at common law.
Foreign office building(previous reference :CM. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5)11. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Public Building and Works and the Secretary of State for defence (CP. (64) 114 and 113 respectively) about changes in the accommodation of Departmental staffs consequential on the decisionto rebuild the Foreign Office.The Minister of Public Building and Works said that, as a resultof the Cabinefs decision that the present Foreign Office buildings should be reconstructed, it would be necessary in due course toprovide temporary alternative accommodation for the Departmentsoccupying that building. The Home Office staff would be rehousedin new offices on the other side of Whitehall, which should become available by 1969-70. Accommodation for the staffs of the ForeignOffice and the Commonwealth Relations Office, however, would haveto be found elsewhere; and he therefore proposed that, as from theend of 1970, they should be accommodated in the Admiralty buildinguntil the redevelopment of the Foreign Office site had been completed.The problem of rehousing the Ministry of Defence staff at presentin the Admiralty could not be settled until the current study of thescope for dispersing staff of the Ministries of Defence and Aviationfrom central London had been completed.The Secretary of State for Defence said that it was undesirable to seek to decide, at least six years before the event, that the Admiraltybuilding should be made available for the displaced Foreign office staff, especially since more than half of the staff of the new Ministryof Defence were already accommodated outside London and any suggestion at the present juncture that a further measure of dispersalmight have to be contemplated would be liable to aggravate theproblem, already sufficiently complex, of reorganising the centralnucleus of the Department, which must remain in Whitehall.CM. 32 (64)Retail Prices 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 117) about recent developments in retail prices and their likely movement over the next few months.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the retail price indexhad remained fairly constant for most of 1963 but had begun to rise inthe fourth quarter of the year and had risen continuously since then.The mid-May index was estimated to be a little over 3 per cent higherthan in both October and May 1963. Part of the increase since november was the result of the seasonal movement of food prices;but the Budget increases in the taxes on alcohol and tobacco had contributed to the rise and there had also been a continuing under-lying upward movement in the prices of goods and services, togetherwith some recent signs of a slight acceleration in the rising prices of manufactured goods.In the ensuing months seasonal factors should cause the foodcomponent of the index to fall; but this might be broadly offset by anincrease in the remaining components. The housing component shouldrise only moderately over the next few months; but London fares were expected to rise substantially. The trend of labour costs remainedupwards; and the prices of imported materials had also risen overthe last year or more, although there were some signs that they hadlevelled off in the last three or four months. Some part of the increaseup to the first quarter had already been reflected in retail prices;but these might continue to rise for some time. It seemed unlikely,however, that any rise in the index between May and October wouldbe as much as a percentage point.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (64) 117.

The trend of labour costs remainedupwards; and the prices of imported materials had also risen overthe last year or more, although there were some signs that they hadlevelled off in the last three or four months. Some part of the increaseup to the first quarter had already been reflected in retail prices;but these might continue to rise for some time. It seemed unlikely,however, that any rise in the index between May and October wouldbe as much as a percentage point.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (64) 117.
In discussion there was general agreement that, when thereconstruction of the Foreign Office building began, appropriatealternative accommodation would have to be provided for the ForeignOffice and the Commonwealth Relations Office in the Whitehall area.At present there seemed no alternative to arranging for the Admiraltybuilding to be made available for this purpose in due course. Butcircumstances could change significantly in the interval before 1970.It followed that no public announcement of the governments intentions in this respect should be made; and it should be clearly understood that the decision should be interpreted as no more than abasis on which forward planning could proceed.The Cabinet Agreed that the forward planning of changes in the accommodation of Departmental staffs consequential on thereconstruction of the Foreign Office building should proceed on the basis that, from the end of 1970 onwards, theAdmiralty building should be made available as temporaryalternative accommodation for the staff of the Foreign Officeand the Commonwealth Relations Office; but that no public announcement of this decision should be made.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th June, 1964.
