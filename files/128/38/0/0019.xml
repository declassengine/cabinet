Foreign I    The Foreign Secretary  informed the  Cabinet  that the affairs Secretary-General of the United Nations had agreed to send aCyprus representative to London to be available during the constitutional(Previous        discussions about the future of Cyprus.

(63) 12thConclusions,Minute 2)discussions with ChancellorErhard2. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the results ofthe discussions which he and the Foreign Secretary had recentlyheld with the Federal German Chancellor, Dr. Erhard.Dr. Erhard had said that, if European integration were confined to economic issues, the members of the European economic community (E.E.C.) might find that they were gradually surrenderingtheir national sovereignties in the economic field not to a politicalbody but to an administrative apparatus. It would therefore become increasingly important to resolve the problem of ultimate political authority within the Community. Nevertheless, he had appreciatedour argument that the present moment was not opportune for theUnited Kingdom Government to reach a decision on the extent towhich this country might participate in any further European move towards political integration; and he had said that, althoughdiscussions on this subject would no doubt proceed within the E.E.C.,the Federal Government themselves would not take any deliberateinitiative for the time being.Dr. Erhard had confirmed that he had made it clear to president de Gaulle that the Federal German Republic did not endorse theFrench concept of Europe as a political force independent of theUnited States; nor did they share the French opposition to the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). They themselves believedthat the future of Europe would continue to lie within the atlantic community; and for this reason they would maintain their support for the concept of a multilateral nuclear force, even though theyappreciated that this project would continue to confront the UnitedKingdom Government with considerable political embarrassment.Dr. Erhard had said that public opinion in the Federal german republic attached importance to an improvement in relations withthe Soviet Union which might lead to the reunification of Germany.The Federal Government themselves were somewhat sceptical aboutthe results of any further initiative for this purpose; and they remained opposed in principle to the grant of long-term credits tothe Soviet Union, on the grounds that continued economic pressureoffered the best hope of inducing the Soviet leaders to adopt a moreco-operative attitude. It had been made clear to Dr. Erhard that wediffered from the Federal Government on this issue and must continue to regard ourselves as free to extend credit in any case whereit appeared reasonable by normal commercial criteria to do so.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.4149-
RuralTransport(previous reference :C.C. (63) 57thConclusions,Minute 7)3. The Lord Chancellor said that a Question has been placedon the Order Paper of the House of Lords, for answer on22nd January, asking the Government to amend the law in orderto enable private operators to provide transport facilities in rural areas. It would be desirable that the Government^ proposals fordealing with this problem should, if possible, be announced in replyto the Question.The Minister of Transport said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s recent decision on the subject, he had discussed with the associations representing local authorities proposals to introduceexperimental measures to improve rural transport facilities in severalareas, including the grant of licences to small private operators andthe organisation of local self-help schemes through the Women&apos;sVoluntary Services. These experiments would require the agreementof the existing rural transport undertakings, which he hoped to secureearly in the following week. It might then be convenient that heshould make a statement in the House of Commons on 22nd January,to which the Government spokesman in the House of Lords couldrefer in reply to the Question to be answered in that House.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to submit to the Prime Minister a draft statement on rural transport, to be made in Parliament on22nd January.RailwayClosures(previous reference :C.C. (63) 17thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster (CP. (64) 16) on the british railways Board&apos;s proposals for closing certain passenger services.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the rail and Road Transport Committee had considered to what extent itmight be possible for the Government to influence the sequence inwhich the Railways Board brought forward their proposals to discontinue passenger services, in order to minimise controversy andto ensure that due regard was paid to relevant Government policy.The procedure for considering proposals laid down in the transport act, 1962, however, gave little scope for intervention by theGovernment, since the initiative in publishing proposals lay with theBoard. The statutory procedure allowed seven weeks after thepublication of a proposal, during which objections could be madeto the area Transport Users&apos; Consultative Committee (T.U.C.C.),who, after hearing representations from the objectors and the Board,reported to the Minister of Transport on the question whether theproposed closure would cause hardship but were not empowered toconsider any other issue. In the light of their report and of the viewsof the Government Departments concerned, the Minister ofTransport could then approve a proposal (with or without conditions),withhold his approval or defer a decision.The Committee had concluded that it would not be possibleto seek any major alteration in the Railways Board&apos;s programme without appearing to withdraw their support from the Board plans to improve the finances of the railways. They had sought to advance the publication of proposals to close certain lines in scotland in order that an early decision might be taken in these cases; but.in the event, the objections would not be heard until February orMarch. In view of the delay in hearing objections in this and other areas, it had latterly seemed wiser to seek the deferment of thepublication of proposals in those cases where it could be argued that they were unlikely to be approved by reason of the need toretain public transport services in large conurbations or of theincreased demand for rail services likely to be created by prospective
a housing or industrial development. The Minister of Transport hadnot felt able to ask for the indefinite postponement of such proposals;but a limited postponement could be justified until it appeared thatthe relevant T.U.C.C. would be in a position to consider objectionssoon after the expiration of the statutory period of notice. TheCommittee had selected eight proposals for deferment on this basis.The Committee had also considered whether proposals relatingto holiday resorts were likely to cause special difficulty but had concluded that, in view of the steady increase in the number ofholidaymakers who travelled by road, the holiday resorts whosepassenger services it was proposed to discontinue were unlikely to suffer substantially. There might be individual cases, however, inwhich some hardship could be pleaded; and it would therefore be advantageous for the publication of the proposals to be deferredat least to the end of the coming holiday season. The committee proposed to give further consideration to this possibility.To some extent criticism of the closures arose frommisunderstanding of the procedure involved and from dissatisfaction with the absence of any opportunity for public consideration of theeconomic case for discontinuing particular services. On the otherhand the procedure could not be altered without legislation; andmany of the issues which objectors wished to canvass raised questionsof managerial responsibility which were not suitable for examination by a public inquiry. It was desirable, however, that every availableopportunity should be taken to explain the procedure to the public.In discussion it was emphasised that prolonged public controversy, such as had been aroused by the proposal to discontinuepassenger services in the Highlands of Scotland, was damaging tothe Governmenfs interests; but, while the most effective means ofreassuring public opinion would be to announce at an early stage that the Minister of Transport would not be prepared to approvea particular proposal, it was normally not possible for him to reach a decision before the statutory procedure had been completed. nor would it be possible to withdraw some cases without stimulatingwidespread demand for the withdrawal of others; and the postponement of publication of proposals on any ground other thanthe inability of the statutory machinery to examine them more rapidly would be liable to be attributed to a change of policy on thepart of the Government. If, however, the deferment of publicationwere to be based on the fact that the T.U.CCs. had for the timebeing as much business before them as they could handle, therewould be some advantage in making this fact known, since it would afford an opportunity to explain more fully to the public not onlythe nature of the statutory procedure but the care which theT.U.CCs. were exercising in the discharge of their functions.The problem of holiday resorts raised somewhat different considerations. It would not be in the Railways Board&apos;s own interests to publish proposals on which decisions could not be reached until after the holiday season, since uncertainty about the continuedavailability of a service would be liable to aggravate the losses whichit incurred. The wisest course might be to suggest to the Board thatthey should take the initiative themselves in announcing that proposals which could not be disposed of before the holiday seasonwould not be published until the end of September.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to arrangefor the Rail and Road Transport Committee to give further consideration, in the light of their discussion, tothe problem of rail closures affecting holiday resorts.
Relationswith theEuropeanEconomicCommunityand theEuropeanFree trade association(previous reference :CM. (64) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (64) 15) on United Kingdom policy and the BrusselsAgreements.The Foreign Secretary said that the European economic community (E.E.C.) had succeeded, shortly before Christmas, inresolving their internal differences on the common agricultural policy to be adopted by the Community and had agreed their negotiating position for the forthcoming Kennedy Round on tariff reductions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This episodehad demonstrated the Community&apos;s ability to reach agreement onissues which comprised sharp divergences of national interests; andit had therefore significantly reinforced the Community&apos;s cohesion.In these circumstances, and despite the recent increase in our exportsto the E.E.C. countries, our chances of achieving a wider european market were reduced; and our objective must therefore be to workfor a successful outcome of the Kennedy Round, based on a linearreduction of 50 per cent in tariffs with the minimum disparities. our efforts in this direction would undoubtedly be opposed by the FrenchGovernment; but we could probably rely on a measure of Germansupport.^ In discussion there was general agreement with these views.The following main points were made:(a) It would be important to ensure in the near future that our partners in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA) wouldendorse our policy as regards the Kennedy Round.(b) The E.E.C. proposals for dealing with agriculture in the kennedy Round might prove embarrassing to us since, if they were adopted as the basis of discussion, we might be invited to bind the levels of agricultural support in a manner which would be inconsistent with our obligations under the Agriculture Acts. We must thereforeactively press our own approach to the problem, whereby countriesimporting agricultural produce (mainly the United Kingdom andthe members of the E.E.C.) should commit themselves to certainobjectives of policy and should give assurances about access to imports on the lines which we ourselves had in mind, i.e., on thebasis that home production and imports would be so regulated thatmarket prices would remain at reasonable levels and both domestic producers and exporting countries would enjoy opportunities to share in the growth of the market. It would be important to seek to persuade the United States representatives in the forthcoming discussions oncereals and meat that proposals of this kind would afford them as favourable a degree of access to European markets as the proposalssponsored by the E.E.C.(c) We should endeavour to strengthen our links with europe in the cultural field; and the many and varied possibilities in thisrespect should be further considered.(2) Approved the proposal that the Minister of Transport should seek the postponement of the publication of the proposalsindicated in paragraph 9 of CP. (64) 16.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Minister of Transport and theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to consider themeans by which the public might be more fully informed about the statutory procedures for rail closures.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to keepthe Cabinet informed of the progress of the Rail and road Transport Committee&apos;s consideration of theproblems arising out of the British Railways Board&apos;programme of rail closures.
Commonwealth 6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PrimePolicy Minister and the Secretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 6 and 9respectively) on Commonwealth policy.The Prime Minister said that many of the government&apos;s supporters felt that insufficient action had so far been taken to implement the Governments undertaking in The Queen&apos;sspeech on the Opening of Parliament &quot; to take all possible steps to strengthen the links between the Governments and peoples of the Commonwealth &quot;. He had therefore brought together in his memorandum various suggestions which had been canvassedin this context, including proposals to establish, on a Commonwealthbasis, an Economic Development Council, an Export Council, a development Bank or Fund and other forms of co-operativeeconomic or financial institutions. It would be desirable to reach conclusions on these proposals before the forthcoming parliamentary debate on Commonwealth trade. In addition various suggestions forthe promotion of closer cultural links between members of theCommonwealth deserved examination.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom ofany formal attempt to promote closer economic collaboration withinthe Commonwealth. The economic interests of members of theCommonwealth were not necessarily complementary; and the othermembers of the Commonwealth no longer looked to the UnitedKingdom as their principal partner in trade. It was significant thatin recent years our own imports from other Commonwealth countries had declined, largely as the result of our agricultural policy, and that,although the imports of other Commonwealth countries had risen,our own share in this increase had been very small. Furtherconsideration might be given to the creation of a commonwealth development Bank or Fund; but its advantages should be weighed against the increase in the demands for United Kingdom financialassistance which it would undoubtedly provoke. On balance,therefore, we should probably be wise to refrain from seeking tocreate any further institutional means of promoting Commonwealthcollaboration in the economic field and to concentrate our efforts on adapting our trade policies more closely to the circumstances and requirements of individual Commonwealth countries. This neednot prevent us from inviting the other Commonwealth delegates tothe United Nations Conference to discuss their policies with us, inthe usual way, before the Conference opened; and it might proveadvisable to adopt the same course, at the appropriate moment, inrelation to the Kennedy Round.In further discussion there was general agreement that it wouldbe preferable to give priority to the creation of closer cultural links with other members of the Commonwealth. Suggestions for thispurpose included the following:(a) Further consideration should be given to the UnitedKingdom contribution to the Third Commonwealth EducationConference, to be held at Montreal in August.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 15.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give further consideration,in consultation with the Ministers concerned, to themeans by which we might strengthen our cultural links with Europe.
1)1(b) The conception of a Commonwealth Youth Trust deservedto be re-examined.(c) The programme of additional hostels for Commonwealthstudents in the United Kingdom had made only slow progress andmight now be accelerated.(d) The Voluntary Service Overseas scheme might be furtherenlarged.(e) The work of the British Council and the information services in Commonwealth countries might be expanded.(/) Commonwealth universities might be further encouraged toprovide additional places for British students.(g) The links between professional associations in commonwealth countries should be strengthened. In particular,consideration might be given to the establishment of a commonwealth Court, analogous to the Judicial Committee of the privy Council; and the supply of technical experts from the UnitedKingdom to other members of the Commonwealth might be improved.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Industry, theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Chief Secretary.Treasury, the Minister of Education, the Secretary for technical Co-operation and the Minister of State for commonwealth Relations (Lord Lansdowne), to give further consideration, in the light of their discussion and in preparation for a Parliamentary debate on commonwealth affairs, to the means by which the links between the Governments and peoples of theCommonwealth might be strengthened.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to report to the Prime minister the results of the enquiry to be conducted under conclusion (1) above.The School 7.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordLeaving Age     President (CP. (64) 1) and by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP.(64) 10), on the proposal that the school leaving age should be raised to 16 in 1970.The Lord President said that a majority of the Education and research Policy Committee had endorsed the strong educationalarguments in favour of this proposal. The Central Advisory council for Education had twice recommended, in the Crowther Report in1949 and in the Newsom Report in 1963, that the age should beraised. If that view were accepted by the Government, the decision should be announced at once; delay would increase uncertainty andwould reinforce the view that the Government were giving undueweight to the needs of the small proportion of children qualified for higher education while ignoring the claims of children of averageability.On the other hand it could be argued that, on the basis of previous experience, the compulsory retention at school of a large number ofunwilling children would tend to increase juvenile delinquencywithout yielding any educational benefit. Moreover, the raising ofthe school leaving age, even by 1970, would have serious financialand economic implications; and, if it were not to overstrain our resources, it might well be necessary to devise some offsettingeconomies.
The Minister of Education said that a failure on the Governmentspart to announce a firm date by which the school leaving age wouldbe raised would be widely criticised not only by the teaching profession but by public opinion generally. Nor would it be satisfactory to rely on voluntary attendance at school beyond the ageof 15. Even by 1970 it was unlikely that more than 40 or 50 per cent of the children affected would wish to take advantage of such afacility; and there were liable to be embarrassing contrastsbetween the attendance rates in different parts of the country. Itwould be necessary to ensure that appropriate curricula for the extrayear at school were devised. For children below the standard of theGeneral Certificate of Education the Government had alreadyintroduced the Certificate of Secondary Education. For the children of lower ability a new scheme would be required, possibly based on technical and vocational training.A decision to raise the school leaving age in 1970 would notentail any new building until 1968; the increase in approvedprogrammes beyond that date would amount to something over 40 million. So far as recurrent expenditure was concerned, it mightbe possible to secure some offsetting savings, e.g., by alterations inthe charge for school meals. A decision to raise the leaving age to16 might also make it desirable to reconsider the age of entry;an increasing body of opinion would probably support a decision toraise the compulsory age of entry from five to six.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while any decisionto raise the school leaving age in England and Wales would clearly have to apply to Scotland also, the political and educationaladvantages would be less apparent and the disadvantages more severe. A recent review of the educational system in Scotland,comparable to the enquiry conducted by the Newsom Committee,had advised that the provision of vocationally centred courses fornon-academic children was an essential preliminary to the raising of the age. If a decision to raise the age were to be applied to scotland, it would be necessary not only to accept a wide range ofvocational and technical instruction as falling within the definition of full-time education but also to make it clear that the change would not be implemented without regard to the availability of qualified teachers.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, in view of the extentto which approved investment programmes had already committedthe resources likely to be available, it would be necessary to relatethe cost of raising the school leaving age, in terms both of capital investment and of recurrent expenditure, to other major demands on the economy in the period in question and to maintain theprinciple that major increases in one sector of the investment programme should be counter-balanced by reductions elsewhere.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Further consideration would need to be given to thedevelopment of suitable courses of training for the children of lowestability, if they were to be required to remain at school for an extrayear. These courses should probably include a considerable element of practical and craft work, related to the Governments plans for industrial training generally.(b) While it would be necessary to avoid the danger ofoverloading the economy by piecemeal increases in public expenditure, the educational and political arguments in favour of announcing a firm decision to raise the school leaving age mightwell be decisive. In that event it would be necessary to considerwhich year of introduction would be likely, in the context of other
approved investment programmes, to involve the least additionalstrain on our resources.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Education, to circulate a memorandumdescribing the economic and other implications of adecision to raise the compulsory school leaving age to16 from 1969, 1970, 1971 and 1972 respectively.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th January, 1964.
