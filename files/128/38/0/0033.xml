resale prices Bill(previous reference:C.C. (64) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)CM. 19 ((1. The Cabinet considered the situation which confronted theGovernment in the House of Commons in the light of the amendments to the Resale Prices Bill which had been tabled by certain of their supporters.In discussion it was agreed that, if the Bill was to pass throug hall its stages in both Houses of Parliament without undue delay, itwould probably be necessary to make some concession to the criticisms which were implicit in these amendments, particularly inrelation to the provisions which would impose on any individualseeking permission to maintain resale price maintenance in respectof certain types of goods the onus of proving that it would not be contrary to the public interest that he should be allowed to do so.It would be no less important, however, to ensure that theGovernment were seen to adhere firmly to the basic purposes of theBill, which commanded a wide measure of endorsement among theGovernments supporters both in Parliament and in the country.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Ministers primarily concerned and with the chief whip, to give further consideration, in the light of their discussion, to the manner in which the parlimentary debates on the Resale Prices Bill would most appropriately be conducted.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Christopher 3.   The Home Secretary informed the Cabinet that he hadSimcox recently recommended  that a reprieve should be granted  toChristopher Simcox, who had been sentenced to death after being found guilty, for the second time, of capital murder. He had made this recommendation on his own responsibility in the exercise of hisconstitutional functions; but, in view of the degree of public commentwhich the case had provoked, he thought it right to inform theCabinet that his reason for doing so lay in the fact that, because ofhis physical condition, Simcox could only have been executed in circumstances which public opinion would have condemned.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement by the HomeSecretary.Malta 4.   The  Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that he(Previous        proposed to announce that day in the House of Commons that reference:      further discussions with the leaders of the political parties in MaltaCM. (64) 15th   about  the  Colony&apos;s  constitutional  development had ended in conclusions,    deadlock; that the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr. Borg Olivier, had minute 4)       now asked us to defer action on his earlier request that we should decide on our own responsibility the form of an independenceConstitution for the island; and that he had therefore agreed that dr. Borg Olivier might submit his party&apos;s constitutional proposals to the Legislative Assembly in Malta and subsequently to the test of a referendum in the island. There was no commitment on our part to endorse the result of this referendum; and, when its result was known, it would be necessary to consider what policy we should adopt.4415-1a 2
The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the colonial secretary.Cyprus 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary-General of the(Previous United Nations had renewed his efforts to find a mediator in the reference: Cyprus dispute who would be acceptable to all the parties concerned.CM. (64) 18th It now appeared probable that Dr. August Lindt, a Swiss and a conclusions, former United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, would be minute 2) appointed to the post.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Trade unions and the Law(previous reference:CM. (64) 18thConclusions,Minute 6)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (64) 73), to which were appended, at Annex A, a revised draft public statement announcing the governments intention to promote, in due course, an enquiry into the state of thelaw relating to trade unions and, at Annex B, the draft of a possiblesupplementary question and answer about restrictive practices oftrade unions in relation to the proposed enquiry.The Minister of Labour said that the Trades Union Congress(T.U.C.) were themselves concerned about the present state of thelaw relating to trade unions and were giving consideration to theeffect of recent legal judgments in this context. It would be helpful if these facts were publicly known. He had therefore ascertainedconfidentially that the T.U.C. would endorse an appropriatereference in the draft statement and would agree that the statementmight also indicate that, as soon as they had reached conclusions onthe issues involved, they would communicate them to theGovernment.In discussion there was general agreement that a statement onthe lines of the draft at Annex A to CP. (64) 73 should be made inthe near future. It would be preferable, however, that the sentenceindicating the T.U.C.&apos;s willingness to undertake a further exchangeof views with the Government in due course should not immediatelyprecede the sentence indicating that the Government had already reached the conclusion that a fresh review of the law relating totrade unions should be put in hand. The second paragraph of thedraft statement should be rearranged for this purpose; and several other drafting amendments suggested during the discussion shouldalso be incorporated.In further discussion it was suggested that an effective enquiry into the state of the law relating to trade unions would properlycomprise several issues which public opinion would regard as mattersof practice rather than law. Since the Cabinet had already decidedthat any enquiry into the restrictive practices of trade unions would best be effected informally (e.g., by discussion in the national economic Development Council), it would be inadvisable at thisstage to purport to give any precise indication of the ground to be covered by the enquiry into the law relating to the trade unions and it would be preferable to rest on the statement that at theappropriate time the Government would discuss with the T.U.C.,the British Employers&apos; Confederation and others concerned both theform and the scope of the enquiry.
DivorceJurisdiction(previous reference:CM. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 7)7. The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theLord Chancellor (CP. (64) 72) on the proposal to transfer jurisdiction in undefended divorce cases from the High Court to the county courts.The Lord Chancellor said that he was being pressed to announce a decision on this question, which the Government were known to be considering. A debate in the House of Lords on the issues involvedhad been postponed from 23rd March until after Easter; but if,notwithstanding the postponement, he was still unable to announce the Governments intentions, it would be difficult to avoid charges of indecision. Since the Cabinets previous discussion the archbishop of Canterbury had been consulted and, after himself taking opinion in the Church of England, had indicated that there might be considerable opposition to the proposed transfer of jurisdiction onthe grounds put forward by the Gorell Royal Commission of 1912and the Denning Committee of 1946. The Government might equallybe exposed to criticism, however, if they failed to achieve a saving of some  300,000 a year in the mounting cost of legal aid; and, on balance, the best course might be to announce in the debate thatthe Government proposed to make a purely procedural change byformally transferring to the County Courts a jurisdiction whichCounty Court judges already exercised in the capacity ofCommissioners but that legislation could not be introduced in thecurrent Session.In discussion it was suggested that some sections of publicopinion would be likely to regard the proposed transfer of jurisdiction as tending to facilitate divorce to an undesirable extent;and, since it might in fact involve some weakening of the safeguards against collusion, this objection could not be wholly dismissed.Moreover, it was necessary to give due weight to the advice of the archbishop of Canterbury about the probable balance of opinion inthe Church of England; and, since there could be no question, in any event, of legislation in the current Session, it would be undesirable to bring a delicate issue prematurely to a head. It would be reasonable, however, that the Lord Chancellor should indicate inthe forthcoming debate in the House of Lords that he was personallyin favour of the proposed transfer of jurisdiction, provided thathe also made it clear that it raised certain issues which had still to be resolved and that no legislation could therefore be introduced in the present Session.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to be guided by their discussion in answering questions about the Governments intentionson the transfer of jurisdiction in undefended divorce cases to the County Courts.CM. 19 (64)The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion, thedraft statements on the trade unions and the lawappended to CP. (64) 73.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to make these statements in the House of Commons on 19th March.
174(3HousingPolicy(previous reference:C.C. (63) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5)Rents8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing (CP. (64) 71) on the Governments policy inrelation to rents.The Minister of Housing said that he would be pressed in theforthcoming debate on housing to indicate the Governments policy on rents. At present some 4f million houses in England and Waleswere owned and let by private landlords; and the rents of some million of these were controlled under the Rent Act, 1957, at twice the 1956 gross value for rating purposes or roughly twice the lettingvalue in 1939. Considerable numbers of houses were continuing tobe released from control as a result of the death or removal of theprotected tenants; and these houses were generally re-let. But therewas constant complaint, mainly in London, that the rents chargedwere exorbitant; and some evictions had undoubtedly taken place,with resultant hardship. A committee under the chairmanship ofSir Milner Holland, Q.C., had been appointed to survey the positionin London; but it could not report before the autumn. There was nolonger any need to maintain rent control, except in London andcertain other cities where there was still a serious shortage of accommodation; but widespread removal of control would attractcriticism, which might be avoided if the progressive decontrol ofhouses on a change of tenancy was allowed to develop its full effects.Controlled rents, however, were indefensibly low and gave landlordsno incentive to maintain their property. They should be allowed torise by some 10s. a week over most of the country and by somewhatlarger amounts in London and in other areas where housing wasscarce.In replying to the debate, therefore, the Government spokesmanmight indicate that the Government intended to introduce legislation in the next Session of Parliament to permit a moderate increase incontrolled rents but that they would not propose further measuresof decontrol, apart from decontrol resulting from changes in tenancy,which would be allowed to take its course. The protection of tenants of private property not subject to rent control would be considered inthe light of the findings of the Milner Holland committee on theposition in London and of any information suggesting that similar conditions existed elsewhere; but the Government did not intendsimply to reimpose rent control by reference to some arbitrary level.It would be desirable to emphasise that the housing shortage, whichwas the basic cause of the problems under discussion, could be resolved only by the construction of more houses, which in turndepended on the availability of land, and that the remedy would therefore be provided by the Governments plans for regional development, starting with the South-East Study.In discussion there was general agreement with these views asregards the continuance of rent control and the protection of tenants of uncontrolled property. It was suggested, however, that there mightbe some disadvantage in announcing the Governments intention topermit controlled rents to be increased when there was no immediate prospect of legislation for this purpose and the amount of the increase would clearly require further consideration. On the other hand the Government might be subject to criticism if they introduced the necessary legislation early in the new Parliament without having indicated their intention in principle to allow controlled rentsto rise. Moreover, it would be important, in any event, to avoid creating the impression that the decision not to undertake furtherblock decontrol implied that controlled rents would be allowed toremain at their present level. The best course, therefore, might beto indicate that the level of rents fixed in 1957 could not be regardedas permanent and that no political party could exclude the possibility that it might have to be raised.
GovernmentOfficesRemoval of thePost OfficeSavings Bankfrom London(previous reference:CM. (64) 18thConclusions,Minute 7)9. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by thePostmaster-General (CP. (64) 66) and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP. (64) 69) about the removal of the Post Office savings bank from London.In discussion the following arguments were put forward infavour of moving the Bank to Tees-side, Merseyside and Glasgowrespectively:(a) Juvenile unemployment on Tees-side was proportionatelyhigher than in either of the other two areas; and the staffrequirements of the Bank would provide the one type ofemployment which was still not sufficiently available in North-east england. A transfer of the Bank to Tees-side would therefore finallyconsolidate the other measures which the Government had taken topromote the development of the region and would bring Tees-side to the point at which further preferential measures of assistance would no longer be necessary. Moreover, the staff concerned regarded this area as more acceptable than either Merseyside or Glasgow; and itwas important to retain their goodwill so far as possible.(b) In Liverpool the number of unemployed clerical workerswas greater than in either of the other two centres; and the disparitywas particularly pronounced in the case of unemployed women inthis category. Moreover, Merseyside, despite its urgent needs, had so far derived relatively little benefit from the Governments regional development policies.(c) In Scotland the percentage rate of unemployment was higherthan in either of the other two areas; and the emigration of school-leavers from Glasgow was particularly high. Unless theGovernment, in deciding the location of one of their ownestablishments, gave a lead in favour of Scotland, Scottish opinion would not be persuaded of the sincerity of their policies of regional development and industry would feel under no obligation to move to Scotland. The criticism that a transfer of the Bank to Glasgowwould involve the staff in lengthy daily journeys because housing wasonly available at some distance from the site envisaged for the Bankwas not well founded; a considerable amount of new housing of ahigh standard had been built in central areas of Glasgow in recentyears and only a small proportion of the Bank&apos;s staff would fail tofind accommodation in these areas.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet appeared to favour Glasgow butthat, before a final decision was taken, it would be desirable to seek to assess more precisely how far the staff concerned would be likelyto resist a transfer of the Bank to Scotland.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to ascertain the probablereaction of the staff of the Post Office Savings Bank if itwere decided to move the Bank to Glasgow.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing to be guided by their discussion in replying to the forthcoming debate about rents.
AgriculturalPolicyFarm price review(previous reference:CM. (64) 18thConclusions,Minute 5)10. The Minister of Agriculture said that he had now reached agreement with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the basis of adjustments inthe price guarantees and production grants involving a total increaseof about  31  million. This was in conformity with the Cabinetsearlier decision and could be defended on the grounds that, if the element attributable to milk was excluded from consideration, the farmers would gain only some  7 million in respect of the increasein their efficiency whereas on the basis of the principles normallyadopted in a price review they would be entitled to an increase ofabout  12 million. There were sound arguments for considering milkseparately. Producers had received no increase in their net returnover the last six years, when the Governments policy had been directed to reducing production until it was in line with consumption.Now that this purpose had been achieved it was reasonable that thereshould be an increase in the price of milk in order to enable the dairyfarmer to maintain his position.In discussion it was suggested that it might not be easy to justify a distinction between the return on milk production and theremainder of the price guarantees and production grants or to defend a  settlement which, in its totality, would raise farmers&apos; incomes by1\ per cent. Nevertheless, the outcome of the review would best be presented as proposed by the Minister of Agriculture.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the settlement which had beenreached on the Farm Price Review, 1964.IndustrialDisputesElectricityIndustry(previous reference:C.C. (63) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)*11. The Minister of Power said that the unions in theelectricity supply industry had decided to introduce working to rule and a ban on overtime with effect from Monday, 23rd March.Although the industry had a reasonable reserve of capacity, a serious shortage of power might develop. If it became necessary to proclaima state of emergency, Parliament would have to be recalled within five days from the issue of the Proclamation and the Easter Recessmight have to be adjusted for this purpose.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) So long as the action contemplated by the unions did notdevelop into a strike, it would not be necessary or, indeed, properto employ troops to operate the power stations.(b) The dispute might lead to a demand that the Minister ofLabour should appoint a conciliator. This would not be appropriate in a case where the resistance of the management to demands forincreased wages was in line with the Government&apos;s policy.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Power.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, as Chairman of the ministerial committee on Emergencies, to arrange for the committeeto keep the situation under close review.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th March, 1964.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
