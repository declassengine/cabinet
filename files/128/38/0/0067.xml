Minute 5Thursday, 11th. June, 1,96-1- at.10. 30 a.in.OFFER OF AN 5.       The Cabinet had before thern a memorandum by theART COLLECTION     Chief Secretary, Treasury (C. P. (64) 115) about the possibilityo  an offer to the United Kingdom of an important collection of modern art.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that aMr. Hirshhorn, a United States citiaen might decide to offerhis important collection of modern sculpture and paintings tothe United Kingdom Government on certain conditions.   This was probably the most important collection of modem sculpture in private hands in the world and was valued at some S5 20-30 million.If Mr. Hirshhorn decided to bring the collection to London, itwould be on the understanding that the United Kingdom Governmentwould supply an appropriate site and building and would meetthe running costs of the museum.   The site, which he wished tobe in central London, would probably be found in Regents Park.The capital cost of the building would be of the order of  jf- million to  1 million at current prices j  and the recurrent costs involved would be in the region of  150, 000 a year.   Mr. Hirshhorn would wish his present curator to remain in charge of the.collection;and he would expect to play a major part in the nomination of thegoverning body and in the formulation of the museum&apos;s policy.The acquisition would give London an outstanding public collection,which we could not hope to accumulate without such a gift;  andit would be to our advantage to seek to reach agreement withMr. Hirshhorn, although we should not necessarily succeed in doing so in view of competition from other quarters.   meanwhile it was essential that we should maintain particular discretionabout the situation.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Richmond Park might provide a more suitable site forthe collection than Regents Park;  and this and other possibilitiesshould be further considered before a decision was taken.(b) Legislation would probably be required, especially if mr. Hirshhorn sought to impose particular conditions about the composition of the body of trustees.-1-
(c)    It would be necessary to consider how best to anticipate the unfavourable comparisons which might be drawn if theGovernment undertook expenditure on the scale envisaged and atthe same time the current negotiations for the acquisition of thePollock House collection of paintings in Glasgow, at a capital cost of  300, 000 and a recurrent cost of  20, 000 a year, were allowed to fall through.The Cabinet -Approved the proposals in C. P. (64) 115.Cabinet Office, S.W. 111th June, 1964-2-
