Cyprus(previous reference :CM. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (64) 2) about Cyprus.The Prime Minister said that, as a result of proposals made bythe President of Cyprus, Archbishop Makarios, for amendment ofthe Island&apos;s Constitution, renewed communal tension had developed and fighting had broken out on 21st December. On 24th Decemberthe Governments of the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey, as thethree Powers party to the Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance, had issued a joint appeal to the Greek and Turkish communities to restore law and order; and, when it became clear that this appealhad failed, they had informed the Government of Cyprus on25th December, 1963, that they would be ready, if so requested,to intervene by means of a tripartite force composed of thetroops of the United Kingdom, Greece and Turkey, stationed in Cyprus and placed under British command. The Governmentof Cyprus had accepted this offer; and the force had beenestablished under the command of the Commander, CyprusDistrict. The Commonwealth Secretary had subsequently visited the island and, by intensive efforts of conciliation, had secured agreement on a cease-fire, the establishment of a neutral zone and the return of hostages. These measures had been successful in restoringrelatively peaceful conditions and in averting the immediate danger that Turkey might seek to invade the Island in defence of the Turkishcommunity. But they had involved us in a renewed and unwelcomeresponsibility for the internal affairs of Cyprus; and, if we were notto become committed to enforcing stability in the Island indefinitely,some fresh political solution of the constitutional problem wouldhave to be devised.The Commonwealth Secretary said that on 1st January, 1964,Archbishop Makarios had addressed a telegram to the Heads of all states, except the Guaranteeing Powers, attributing the blame forthe situation to the aggressive actions of the Turkish Governmentand announcing that, as a result, the Government of Cyprus had decided to abrogate the Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance which gave Turkey the excuse to intervene. He had protested strongly tothe Archbishop about the issue of this announcement, which hadbeen made without reference to himself although he was in Cyprusat the time; and the Archbishop had reluctantly issued a further statement of clarification, indicating that the Treaties had not beenabrogated but that the Government of Cyprus wished to secure their determination by appropriate means. The Archbishop had also agreed that the future of the Island should now be reconsidered ata conference of the three Guaranteeing Powers, the Government of cyprus and the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities inthe Island. This conference, which should be held in London, shouldbe convened as rapidly as possible, while the precarious truce whichhad now been established had some chance of persisting. Its termsof reference should be sufficiently wide to permit consideration ofany course which offered the prospect of a lasting solution of theproblem; and its main work would best be done by a sub-committee,consisting of the United Kingdom representatives and the communalleaders in the Island, which would report periodically to the mainconference. There could be no guarantee that a conference of this nature would reach a successful conclusion. Nevertheless, there were some indications in Cyprus itself that the two communities were nolonger so disposed to press for drastic solutions as they had been afew years before; and it was not wholly impossible that some genuinecompromise might be negotiated. In addition there would be advantage in associating the United Nations in some way with therestoration of peace in the Island. It would be inadvisable to invitethe Security Council to send observers to Cyprus, since they mightembarrass our forces in the enforcement of the military measures
necessary to maintain law and order and might also become thefocus of renewed communal discord. But it would be appropriate that, if the Secretary-General of the United Nations, agreed, heshould be represented in the Island by an individual who wouldbe responsible for keeping the United Nations informed of developments. It would be for subsequent consideration whether theUnited Nations should be similarly associated with the proposedLondon conference.In discussion the Cabinet expressed their warm appreciation of the efforts which the-Commonwealth Secretary had made to restore peace in Cyprus and their agreement in principle with thefurther steps which he proposed in order to ensure an orderly revisionof the Island&apos;s Constitution. It would be appropriate that theCommonwealth Secretary should himself take the chair at theforthcoming conference, notwithstanding the risk that, in order topromote a solution, he might have to appear to favour either of the communities in the Island at the expense of the other.Since the Greek and Turkish Governments had apparentlyendorsed the suggestion that a representative of the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations should be established in Cyprus, there wouldbe advantage in announcing forthwith that we intended, subject tothe concurrence of the Government of Cyprus, to address a request to this effect to the Secretary-General. It was for consideration whether we should also propose a meeting of the Security Council,in order that we might report the action which had now been takento re-establish law and order in the Island. If it was likely that weshould in any event have to face a debate in the United Nations indue course, it was arguable that we should secure the credit of takingthe initiative in the matter by ourselves proposing a discussion. Onthe other hand once the issue had been formally brought to theattention of the United Nations we should cease to be in controlof further developments; the Afro-Asian bloc would probably seize the chance to press for our complete removal from Cyprus; theGreek and Turkish Governments would be tempted to make formaldeclarations of policy which would make it even more difficult forus to achieve communal agreement at the subsequent conference;and Archbishop Makarios would be given the opportunity to propose, as he was known to have in mind, that the United nations should declare that the Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance wereinvalid. On balance, therefore, and subject to the concurrence of theForeign Secretary, it might be wiser to confine ourselves initially tosending the Security Council a written report of the steps which wehad taken to restore peace in Cyprus and of the further measureswhich we had in mind to promote a lasting solution of the Island&apos;sproblems.In further discussion it was suggested that we were now at considerable risk in Cyprus in so far as United Kingdom troopsmight at any moment find it necessary to use force to maintain the truce or might themselves suffer casualties. If a situation of thiskind developed, we must be prepared in the last resort to with drawour forces to the Sovereign Base Areas and to leave the Greek and turkish communities to deal with the problem as best they could.The damaging consequences which would follow made it all themore important that the proposed conference should be convenedas rapidly as possible and that, meanwhile, arrangements should bemade in Cyprus to promote even closer contact between the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner and the Commander, Cyprus District,in order to ensure, so far as possible, that any military action whichmight have to be taken would not be inconsistent with our longer-term political objectives.The Cabinet (1) Expressed their warm appreciation of the efforts made bythe Commonwealth Secretary, the United Kingdom High
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd January, 1964.Commissioner in Cyprus and the Commander, CyprusDistrict, to restore law and order in Cyprus and approved the action so far taken for this purpose.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for theappointment of an additional officer in Cyprus to ensureclose political liaison between the United Kingdom HighCommissioner and the Commander, Cyprus District.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) to seek the concurrence of the Foreign Secretary inarrangements whereby we should:(a) arrange, in concert with the Governments of greece and Turkey, that the Secretary-General of theUnited Nations should be invited, subject to theagreement of the Government of Cyprus, toappoint a representative in the Island, who wouldbe responsible for keeping him informed of developments;(b) arrange for the Secretary-General of the united nations to be furnished with a written report ofthe action which had so far been taken to restorepeace in Cyprus.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to make arrangements, as rapidly as possible, for a conference of the Governments of theUnited Kingdom, Greece, Turkey and Cyprus, togetherwith the leaders of the Greek and Turkish communities in the Island, to promote a long-term solution of the island&apos;s problems.
