The prime minister. The Foreign Secretary expressed to the Prime Minister the cabinet&apos;s warm congratulations on the anniversary of his birthday.The Prime Minister thanked his colleagues for their good wishes.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5)Foreign Affairs 3- The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet thatCongo M. Adoula&apos;s Government had reached the end of its term of office(Previous        on the previous day and that President Kasavubu had requestedReference:      M. Adoula and his colleagues to remain in office until the transitionalCM. (64) 30th  Government, to be appointed under the new Constitution which was conclusions,    now      subject of a national referendum, had been appointed. ItMmute 4)       was uncertain who would be invited to form this transitionalAdministration; but M. Tshombe, the former secessionist leader inKatanga, had recently returned to the Congo and might emerge asthe next Prime Minister.The Prime Minister said that the discussions about Cypruswhich he and the Foreign Secretary had recently had with M. Inonu,the Prime Minister of Turkey, had not been encouraging. M. Inonuhad refused to contemplate any solution of the problem of the island&apos;s future other than &quot;double Enosis&quot;; and, since it was very unlikely that the Greek Cypriot community or the Greek Governmentwould accept a partition of the island this implied that the TurkishGovernment would be prepared, if necessary, to seek to impose asolution on these lines by force. Nevertheless, they had now agreedto take part in the further discussions which the United Nationsmediator, Mr. Tuomioja, was about to initiate in Geneva; and, sinceboth the United States Government and we ourselves would also beunobtrusively represented during those discussions, there was stillhope that they could be restrained from adopting an extreme course.On the other hand the irregular Greek forces in the island appearedto be steadily increasing in number; and we could not dismiss thepossibility that they, too, might seek to force the issue by armedaction.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, although we continued to take part in the international discussions in connectionwith the proposed multilateral nuclear force, we had now put forwardalternative proposals of our own about the form which a force ofthis kind might assume. These, which envisaged both airborne and land-based forces, would be studied in parallel with the examinationof the proposed naval force; and in the meantime we should refrain from giving any public indication of our preference for any one ofthe possible types of multilateral force.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign Secretary.North AtlanticTreatyOrganisation:multilateral force(previous reference:C.C. (63) 60thConclusions,Minute 2)
Malta(previous reference:CM. (64) 33rdConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that, during his most recent discussions with the Prime Minister of Malta,Dr. Borg Olivier, about the form of constitution to be introducedwhen the island achieved independence, the latter had maintainedhis opposition to the modifications in the constitutional status and privileges of the Roman Catholic Church which we considered essential, despite the fact that the Vatican authorities were now prepared to endorse them.In discussion it was suggested that there could be no certainty that, even if we achieved some compromise settlement withdraw. Borg Olivier on this issue, we should succeed in reaching agreement with him on the further questions which would remain to be settled, particularly the proposed Defence Agreement and the related question whether we should be able to continue to use our military base in the island for the deployment of nuclear weapons.But unless our right to do so was clearly established, a defence agreement would be of little value to us; and it was for consideration,therefore, whether we should take the present opportunity to break off the current negotiations, basing ourselves on the issue on whichthe Government would have the maximum of support from publicopinion in the United Kingdom, i.e., the status and privileges of the roman Catholic Church. On the other hand, if we failed to reach agreement with Dr. Borg Olivier, his Government would probablyfall and all the major political Parties in the island would be liableto unite in opposition to the United Kingdom. This would be a reversal of the policy which the Cabinet had hitherto endorsed andwould be very damaging to our long-term interests in theMediterranean.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to incline in favour of a further attempt to bring the current discussions to a successful conclusion.But if this proved to be impracticable, the negotiations should be soconducted that their failure would be seen to be clearly attributable to a fundamental difference of view on the constitutional status and privileges to be accorded to the Roman Catholic Church rather than to an inability to agree on the provisions of a Defence Agreement.If the negotiations reached deadlock, it might be desirable to suggestthat they should be adjourned for a period in order to allow both parties to reconsider their positions.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary, in his further negotiationsabout the independence constitution of Malta, to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Inquiry intoAllegationsAgainst thePolice5. The Home Secretary said that it had recently beenestablished that a sergeant of the Metropolitan Police, SergeantHarold Challenor, who had been assigned to duties in connectionwith the visit of the late King of Greece to the United Kingdom inthe previous year, had connived at action by his subordinates indeliberately fabricating evidence against certain individuals who hadbeen charged with causing a breach of the peace during the RoyalVisit. The subordinate officers had now been convicted; butproceedings against Sergeant Challenor could not be instituted, since it had been established that he had been mentally unbalanced at thetime and was now insane. Public concern at these disclosures hadbeen aggravated by more recent allegations in the Press aboutcorruption in the Police Force, with which Sergeant Challenor&apos;s Name had been linked; and it was becoming increasingly clear that
F    fir&quot;-&apos;   *296CM. 34 (64)some form of independent inquiry into these allegations would haveto be instituted. As an initial step he had it in mind to exercise thenew powers which he had recently acquired under the Police Act,1964, and to appoint an independent person to hold an inquiry intothe circumstances in which Sergeant Challenor had remained on duty while insane. These powers, however, would not be availabletill August. During the interval he proposed to ask the commissioner of Police to invite an experienced Chief Constable, who had no connection with the Metropolitan Police, to investigate the newallegations and, if they appeared to provide grounds for institutingcriminal proceedings against any of the individuals concerned, toreport to the Director of Public Prosecutions. He would himselfconsider, in the light of the Chief Constable&apos;s report, whether the subsequent inquiry should be limited to the circumstances in whicha mentally unstable man had been allowed to remain in a position of authority for so long or whether it should be extended to deal withthe wider issues raised by the more recent allegations of corruptionin the Police Force.In discussion there was general agreement that public opinion would expect an inquiry to be instituted into the apparentmaladministration which had permitted Sergeant Challenor toremain at his post at a time when he was mentally unbalanced.The scope of this inquiry might need to be enlarged to include themore recent allegations of corruption; but it was doubtful whetherthe Home Secretary, in deciding this question, should rely on advice from a Chief Constable who, even if unconnected with theMetropolitan Police, might not be accepted by public opinion asimpartial on an issue of this kind. It was equally doubtful whethera Chief Constable should appear to be in any way involved in thedecision on the question whether a prima facie case existed forinstituting criminal proceedings. This was an issue which it wouldbe for the Director of Public Prosecutions to decide.On the other hand there would be value in some preliminary examination of the allegations which were now current; and,provided that it was so defined and was without prejudice to theaction which might subsequently be taken by the appropriate authorities in the light of its findings, it might be desirable, on balance, to commission a Chief Constable to carry it out. It was forconsideration, however, whether he should be assisted by an individual who would be clearly seen to be independent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be necessary, as a minimum, to institute an inquiry into thecircumstances in which Detective-Sergeant Challenor had remainedon duty after he had become mentally unbalanced. A decision thatthis inquiry would be initiated later in the summer should thereforebe announced forthwith. In the interval before it was established the Home Secretary might invite an appropriate Chief Constable toexamine the more recent allegations about corruption in the police force. In the light of his report the Home Secretary should reconsider the question whether the scope of the inquiry should be extendedmore widely; and the Chief Constable&apos;s findings should be madeavailable to the Director of Public Prosecutions in order to enable him to consider whether they provided grounds for institutingcriminal proceedings against any of the individuals concerned.These arrangements should also be announced.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to announce in Parliament thathe proposed to take steps, on the lines indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion, to institutein due course an inquiry into recent allegations aboutmismanagement and corruption in the Police Force.
United States 6.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofShipping tne Cabinet (CP. (64) 130), to which was attached a draft BillLegislation relating to shipping contracts and commercial documents.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the United StatesGovernment had intended that the form of certain contracts used by shipping companies of the United Kingdom and other countries for the carriage of cargoes to and from the United States should become subject, on 3rd July, to approval by the United StatesFederal Maritime Commission, under penalty of a payment of$1,000 a day for non-compliance. The Prime Minister had therefore sent a message to the President of the United States,President Johnson, emphasising that such action would constitute an invasion of United Kingdom jurisdiction and would haveunfavourable political reactions both within the United Kingdomand within the Western Alliance. The message had suggested thatan international conference should be convened in order to examinethe basic question of jurisdiction and that, meanwhile, United Statesaction against our shipping should be postponed.President Johnson&apos;s reply, while not overtly objecting to theproposal for a conference, had been at pains to stress that it wouldrequire thorough preparation and should not be held much beforethe end of the year. The President also appeared to have in mind aconference to consider not the issue of jurisdiction, as we had proposed, but the general question of the international regulationof shipping. He had evaded the issue of the extent of jurisdictionclaimed by the Federal Maritime Commission and had stated thatthe Commission, which operated under a statutory mandate, wouldbe asked to consider a &quot; further brief period of grace &quot; as a matter of administrative discretion but that this could not be prolonged untilthe basic issues had been discussed and settled in an international conference. He had subsequently agreed, however, that theCommission would postpone action until 1st September.In these circumstances it would be advisable that the PrimeMinister should send a further message to the President, welcomingthis deferment but stating that, in view of the continuing uncertaintyon the basic issue of jurisdiction, we had decided to seekParliamentary sanction for specific powers to secure the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom. The message might also express certaindoubts about the desirability of an international conference on thegeneral question of the regulation of shipping but might agree thatthis possibility should be further explored through diplomatic channels.Meanwhile, the draft Bill appended to CP. (64) 130 should beintroduced as rapidly as possible and should be enacted before the recess. It would enable us to exercise control over the form of contracts used in trade involving the United Kingdom and to exactpenalties from the shipping of countries which imposed penalties onour shipping for breach of requirements which infringed ourjurisdiction. The powers to be taken for these purposes werepermissive, not mandatory; and, although they would apply to all foreign countries indiscriminately, in present circumstances they/ould be directed only against the United States. They should therefore strengthen our hand significantly in any action before thePermanent Court of International Justice in relation to the UnitedStates legislation.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.The following main points were made:(a) The scope of Clause 1 of the Bill was unduly wide in sofar as it would empower the Minister of Transport to issue directions to &quot; any person &quot; carrying on business comprising the carriage ofgoods by sea and would enable him, for this purpose, to judge, solelyin his own discretion, the extent to which prohibitions or requirementsimposed by foreign legislation constituted an encroachment on Her
Land Values(previous reference:CM. (64) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)*7. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (64) 125) and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (CP. (64) 127) on land values and planning procedures.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Cabinet had invited him to arrange for further consideration to be given to theGovernment^ policy on land values in relation to urban development.Public criticism appeared to be focussed on two aspects of the matter;first, the effect which the high price of land was believed to exert onthe cost of housing; second, the large profits which were being derivedfrom the sale and development of land. Discussion among theMinisters concerned had pointed to the conclusion that there was no action open to the Government which would reduce the price of landin the short-term. Moreover, since the building industry was working to capacity and houses were readily purchased despite high prices,a reduction in the price of land, so far from helping to reduce theprice of houses, would be likely merely to inflate the profit accruing to the builder. Ministers had accordingly considered whether therewas a case for securing for the Exchequer a share in the high profitsrealised by some owners and developers. The extension over a* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.Majesty&apos;s territorial and other jurisdiction. The comparable provisionsof German legislation, which were rather more precisely defined andwere related to a more objective criterion of the national interest,might form a more suitable model.(b) In the event it might prove impracticable to institute the typeof prosecution envisaged by the Bill; and it would then be apparent that it represented an attempt to deter the United States government from enforcing their own legislation. Such an attempt might fail.(c) It was doubtful whether the enactment of the Bill would infact reinforce our case if the matter was brought before theInternational Court. On the other hand it appeared that both theUnited States Government and United States legal opinion took theview that the existence of such legislation would be material to theCourfs judgment.id) It might be desirable in any event to seek to submit the issueof jurisdiction to the International Court as soon as possible. It wasnot certain, however, that the United States Government acceptedthe jurisdiction of the Court in relation to a dispute of this nature.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation to secure Her Majesty&apos;s jurisdictionagainst encroachment by the requirements of foreign government in respect of the carriage of goods orpassengers by sea should be enacted before theParliamentary Recess.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, the Minister of Transport andthe Attorney-General, to give further consideration, inthe light of their discussion, to the form of such legislation.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thePresident of the United States to be informed of our intentions in this respect.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain whether the UnitedStates Government accepted the jurisdiction of thePermanent Court of International Justice in relation tothe issues in dispute.(5) Agreed to resume their discussion at an early meeting.
longer period of the short-term capital gains tax, which was alreadylevied on gains realised on land acquired and disposed of within three years, was unacceptable on the ground that, as a result, theamount of land coming on to the market would fall and its price would rise. Moreover, it would become necessary to deal with theadministrative difficulty of charging the tax at a reduced rate in caseswhere the gain had accrued over a considerable period. A long-termgains tax on gains realised from the sale of land, irrespective of the interval between acquisition and disposal, would be open in varyingdegree to similar objections and would be difficult to justify in the face of the Governments continuing opposition to the extension ofa long-term gains tax to transactions in property other than land.Moreover, any capital gains tax could, by its nature, be applied onlyto gains actually realised, whereas a developer who bought land at existing use value might derive considerable profit from developing the land and leasing the buildings erected on it. It was arguable,however, that, here also, the Exchequer should secure a share in theincreased value which resulted from public expenditure or fromthe grant of an exclusive right to develop. It might be desirable,therefore, that a tax should be charged on sale and development,which would be based, in the case of sales, on the difference betweenthe sale price and the existing use value or the purchase price,whichever was the greater, and, in the case of development withoutsale, on the difference between the market value with planning permission and the existing use value or the purchase price,whichever was the greater. A tax of this nature would not be free from disadvantages, since part of it would be passed on to the purchaser and would therefore increase the price of the land; and,even if the rate of tax were as low as 25 per cent, it might reducethe progress of urgently needed development and urban renewal.A number of practical difficulties would also arise, not least in the recruitment of an adequate number of experienced valuers.Nevertheless, if any action was to be taken, this seemed to be the only practical possibility. The new tax could not be introduced beforethe next session of Parliament; but it should be possible to give some advance indication of the Governments intentions, if this wasjudged appropriate.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that inthe course of the Cabinets previous discussion it had been suggestedthat some reduction in the price of land might be effected if it were possible to release land for development more freely and to simplifyand to accelerate the procedures by which planning permission was obtained. It was clear that planning procedures, as such, had no effecton the price of land, although delays attributable to them mightinflate costs. Nevertheless, they were being reviewed by theDepartments concerned, with the assistance of the recently appointedPlanning Advisory Group, which included experts drawn both from local authorities and from private practice. Substantial changes werebeing considered in those procedures which gave rise to most delay;and, while it would not be possible to announce any proposals beforethe Recess, an opportunity of discussing them in a speech to one ofthe relevant professional bodies would occur in the autumn.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Although a tax on the lines proposed could not be expectedto reduce the price of land, a case could be made on grounds of equityfor securing for the public a share in fortuitous increases in value which derived largely from public expenditure and from the decisionsof public authorities. It was doubtful, however, whether public criticism of the high profits obtained by landowners and developerswould be assuaged by a tax of the order of 25 per cent, while a taxat a higher rate would be liable to reproduce the stultifying effect on development of the 100 per cent betterment charge which the labour government had introduced and the Conservative Government hadbeen compelled to abolish.
Party Political        8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord PrivyBroadcasting    Seal (CP. (64) 122) on the allocation of time by the broadcasting authorities for post-Dissolution broadcasts by political Parties.The Lord Privy Seal said that, in addition to the allocation oftime for broadcasts by the three main Parties, the British broadcasting corporation (B.B.C.) provided facilities for a national broadcast foreach of the minor Parties, provided that it was represented by a certain minimum number of candidates after nomination day. FormalSECRET4858-3 b(b) Against the background of the failure of previous attempts to tax land values and of the attitude towards proposals of this kind which the Government had adopted hitherto, a decision to introduce a tax on development values at the end of the life of the present parliament would be likely to be attributed to political motives andmight be misunderstood both by the Governments supporters and bythe public at large. On the other hand it was only in recent yearsthat the price of land had risen sharply; and it could be argued that a new situation had arisen, which justified the re-examinationof the problem. The rapid expansion of public investment had created new opportunities for making profits out of land anddevelopment; and the corresponding need to finance a high level ofpublic expenditure justified a search for new sources of revenue.(c) It would be desirable to examine the details of any proposalclosely before the Governments intentions were made public, sincethe application of the general principle involved would raise a numberof difficult issues. For example, it might be necessary to exempt from the new tax land sold in order to pay estate duty; and it mightbe suggested that, if the public were to share in profits accruing tothe individual as a result of public decisions, they should equallybe obliged to compensate individuals whose property depreciated inconsequence of such decisions.(d) The timing of any indication of the Governments intentionswould require careful consideration. It would not be appropriate tointroduce, otherwise than in a Finance Bill, a measure which,although its nature was akin to a charge for the grant of a franchise,would be popularly regarded as a tax. On the other hand proposals could hardly be announced shortly after the conclusion ofParliamentary consideration of the current Finance Bill. TheGovernment could perhaps give some indication that they mightintroduce a measure in the new session of Parliament; but it wouldbe necessary to avoid, on the one hand, being drawn into discussionof detail and, on the other hand, giving the impression that asatisfactory solution to the problem had not yet been found.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that it might prove desirable to introduce a measure on the lines proposed in CP. (64) 125, if on further examination it proved possible to overcome the practical difficulties.It would be unwise, however, to make any immediate announcementof the Governments intentions; and further consideration should begiven by the Ministers immediately concerned to the form in whichthey might be announced at a rather later stage.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment, to consider, in the light of their discussion,the form and timing of the most appropriate indication ofthe Governments policy in relation to land values.
Televising 9.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Privythe State Seal (CP. (64) 120) about the televising of the Opening of the firstOpening of      Session of the new Parliament.Parliament(Previous The Lord Privy^ Seal said that in the past it had been held that reference:      the Opening of Parliament should be televised only infrequently andC.C. (61) 27th   that there would be advantage in selecting the Opening of the firstConclusions,    Session of a Parliament for this purpose. He proposed, therefore,Minute 8)       that, subject to The Queen&apos;s consent and the formal approval of theLord Great Chamberlain, the British Broadcasting Corporation(B.B.C.) should be informed that the Government agreed that theOpening should be televised in the autumn. It would no doubt bearranged, as on the previous occasion, that the B.B.C. picture shouldalso be made available to Independent Television. In 1958 theOpposition were consulted before an announcement was made andwelcomed the proposal. It would be appropriate that they should be consulted on the present occasion.In discussion there was general agreement with these views.The Cabinet-Approved CP. (64) 120.responsibility for deciding this figure rested with the B.B.C.; butthey had been willing to take account of representations from themain Parties. In 1945 the qualifying figure was 20; and since then it had been 50. The announcement that this figure would bemaintained in relation to the forthcoming General Election hadevoked protests from the Welsh Nationalists (Plaid Cymru) and theCommunist Party. Plaid Cymru complained that, since there were only 36 constituencies in Wales, they were automatically precluded from qualifying. The Communist Party claimed that the figure shouldbe fixed at 20, coupled with a minimum of 10 minutes broadcastingtime for any Party which could not claim more.It might be politically desirable to seek to persuade the B.B.C.to reduce the qualification to, say, 30 candidates. Such a changecould be justified by relating it to Plaid Cymru and would be well received in Wales. Presentationally, it could also be related to theposition of the Scottish Nationalists, although they would be unlikely to benefit since they were not expected to be represented by morethan 16 candidates. Nor would Northern Ireland, where there were only 12 constituencies, expect to take part.In discussion the view was expressed that there would be some advantage in a concession which would provide greater scope forthe views of the minority nationalist Parties. On the other hand itwould not be in the national interest to provide facilities which would encourage small Parties. Moreover, the qualifying limit of 50candidates had already been announced to the Press. It might be disadvantageous now to seek to change it; and it would be preferable to continue to maintain that the issue must be left to the B.B.C.&apos;decision.The Cabinet Agreed that no attempt should be made to persuade theBritish Broadcasting Corporation to vary the decision,which they had already announced, that facilities for post-Dissolution broadcasts would be provided only to political Parties represented by not less than 50 candidatesafter nomination day.
Amendmentof CanadianConstitution10. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (CP. (64) 126), to which was appended an address to The Queen from the Senate and House of Commons ofCanada, praying that legislation be laid before the Parliament at westminster to amend a section of the British North America Act,1867, dealing with legislation in the Canadian Parliament respectingold age pensions.In discussion there was general agreement that this request shouldbe met.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the current session of Parliament to amend the British north america Act, 1867, in the sense proposed in the Addressfrom the Canadian Parliament annexed to CP. (64) 136.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for the draftof a Bill for this purpose to be brought before theLegislation Committee at an early date.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd July, 1964.
