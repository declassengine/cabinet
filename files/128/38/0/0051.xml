SubjectMalta
Malta The Cabinet resumed their discussion about the independence(Previous       of Malta. They had before them a Note by the Secretary of the reference:      Cabinet (CP. (64) 134), to which was appended the draft of a privateC.M. (64) 36th  and confidential letter which the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr. BorgConclusions)    Olivier, would be willing to write to the Colonial Secretary about thedefence agreement which was to form part of the independencesettlement, together with the draft of a public statement which hewould propose to make on the conclusion of the agreement.The Colonial Secretary said that Dr. Borg Olivier was now prepared to sign a defence agreement containing no restriction onour entitlement to use our base in the Island for the storage of nuclear weapons, if we found it necessary to do so. But he would feel itnecessary to send us, at the same time, a private and confidentialletter explaining that he had found it possible to acquiesce in anagreement of this ,kind only on the basis of certain assurances whichwe had given him and reserving the right of the Government of Malta to raise objections to the use of the Island as a nuclear base at anytime in the future. This letter, to which we should not be expected tosend any answer, would have no legal effect and would not modify the agreement in any way. But Dr. Borg Olivier regarded it as essentialthat he should be able to satisfy his colleagues in the Governmentof Malta, on his return, that he had not consented to the establishmentof a stockpile of nuclear weapons in Malta; and he made it clear that,if the negotiations on Malta&apos;s independence finally broke down, hewould publicly ascribe their failure to our intransigence on this issue.In discussion it was suggested that this course was open to serious objection. There was a considerable risk that the terms of theproposed letter would eventually be disclosed; and, if it became known that a defence agreement purporting to give us an unrestrictedright to enjoy defence facilities in Malta was qualified by a confidentialunderstanding, the Government would be placed in an embarrassing position in relation to Parliament and public opinion in the UnitedKingdom. Moreover, the letter would be liable to place an unacceptable limitation on our freedom of action to use Malta as a nuclear base if it became necessary to do so; and, if its disclosureprompted the Governments of other oversea territories where we haddefence facilities to seek to qualify our rights in respect of thosefacilities in a similar way, its effects would be even more damaging.For these reasons it might be preferable to seek to compromise withdraw. Borg Olivier on the basis of an oral assurance that we were notcurrently contemplating using Malta as a nuclear base, coupled withthe incorporation in the proposed defence agreement of a clauseleaving it open to both parties to raise any issue connected with it, ifthey found it necessary to do so in the light of changing circumstances. Any implication that this arrangement would entitleeither party to review or reconsider the terms of the agreement mustbe avoided, since we should otherwise be completely at the mercy ofany future Government of Malta which was hostile to our interests.... It would be necessary, therefore, to make it clear that neither party would be committed in advance to accept any amendment of the. agreement which the other might propose. Since it was desirable thatthe provision of financial aid should be linked with the defence agreement, it would be necessary to incorporate a correspondingclause in the financial agreement in order to enable it to be amended in line with any changes in the defence agreement.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) The United States Government would be liable to be asdisturbed by a breakdown of the negotiations for Malta&apos;independence as by a unilateral departure on our part from theprinciple, which both we and they had hitherto maintained, that weneither confirmed nor denied the presence of nuclear weapons in
any particular part of the world. Nevertheless, it was for consideration whether the United States authorities should be consulted before we took any step of the kind now in contemplation.(b) Agreement had not yet been reached on the question of theconstitutional status and privileges to be accorded to the roman catholic Church in the independence constitution. It might bedesirable, therefore, to explore this issue further with Dr. Borg Olivierbefore considering any concessions in relation to the defence agreement since, unless agreement was reached on the position of theChurch, it was unlikely that Parliament would be prepared to approveMalta&apos;s independence. On the other hand it might be to our tacticaladvantage to defer discussion of the outstanding issues affecting theChurch until the latest possible stage in the negotiations, sinceDr. Borg Olivier might be prepared in the last resort to accept theconstitutional provisions which we had proposed in this context and,if the negotiations subsequently failed, it would then be clear that itwas solely on the question of our right to store nuclear weapons in the island that they had broken down.(c) If we sought to escape from the dilemma by postponing thenegotiations until the autumn, we might merely damage the political position of Dr. Borg Olivier and accelerate the return to power of theOpposition leader, Mr. Mintoff, who might refuse to conclude anydefence agreement with us at all.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was greatly in our interest to conclude an agreement on Malta&apos;independence, if this were possible on acceptable terms. In view ofthe embarrassment to which we might be exposed if we concludeda defence agreement which was qualified by an exchange of confidential letters about our intentions as regards the storage of nuclear weapons in Malta, it might be preferable to confine ourselves to incorporating in the proposed defence agreement a provision (witha corresponding clause in the proposed financial agreement) that itwould be open to either party, in the event of any subsequent changeof circumstances, to raise any issue that they wished, without commitment on either side to amend the agreement. He would beprepared, if necessary, to discuss with Dr. Borg Olivier anarrangement on these lines and would consider whether, if so, wecould give him, orally, some additional private assurance about our intentions as regards the use of Malta as a nuclear base.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the foreign secretary, the Colonial Secretary, the Secretary of Statefor Defence and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to draft a clause, in the sense indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion, for incorporation in theproposed defence agreement with the Government of malta; and to consider whether any correspondingadjustment should be made in the proposed financial *agreement.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to pursue with Dr. BorgOlivier   the   outstanding   issues   in   respect   of   theconstitutional status and privileges to be accorded to the.   Roman Catholic Church in the independence constitutionof Malta.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th July, 1964.
