Cyprus(previous reference :CM. (64) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)4149-3a 21. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet thathis current discussions with the leaders of the Greek and Turkishcommunities in Cyprus continued to show little prospect of a successful outcome. Meanwhile the situation in the Island itselfremained critical; and there was a continuing risk that a deadlock inthe London negotiations would precipitate a renewal of communalfighting, which the Turkish Government might seek to use as a pretext for invading the Island. In those circumstances it would become impossible for us to carry single-handed the responsibility for thepeace-keeping operation which we had initially undertaken; and weshould need to transfer this responsibility, if possible, to aninternational force. We were therefore seeking to arrange with theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) the creation of a force which, though not explicitly a NATO force, would consist ofcontributions from various members of the Organisation. The UnitedStates Government, who had initially been reluctant to contribute tothis enterprise, now appeared to be less unwilling to be associatedwith it. Their participation would be particularly valuable in persuading Archbishop Makarios to accept a force of this natureas a guarantee of whatever political solution ultimately emerged.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether, if communalviolence in Cyprus were renewed, public opinion would acquiesce inour transferring responsibility to an international force. On theother hand if we attempted to continue to carry the whole of theresponsibility for keeping the peace, we should have to reinforceour troops in Cyprus on an unacceptably large scale, particularly ifthe only political solution which appeared feasible was some formof physical separation of the two communities and a partition of the island. It was known that a solution of this nature would be unacceptable to Archbishop Makarios; and, if it had to be adopted,it might have to be imposed. The task of enforcing it, therefore, wasnot one which we should shoulder alone; but we could reasonablylook for assistance to certain members of NATO, who should be anxious to do all that they could to avert the risk of war between two members of the Organisation. It was for consideration whetherthe United States Government could contribute to this purpose by appropriate deployment of the Sixth Fleet in the Mediterranean.If it proved impracticable to create a force drawn from member countries of NATO, it might become necessary to move the united nations to establish a military presence in the Island, in order tomaintain law and order and to enforce the political solution, whatever it might prove to be. This course, however, was open to certainobjections. Once the United Nations were formally involved in theproblems of Cyprus our own right to retain our Sovereign Base Areasmight well be called in question. Moreover, the Soviet Union wouldbe entitled to take part in both the military measures and the political settlement promoted by the United Nations; and if, in an attemptto avoid Soviet participation, we agreed that both we and the UnitedStates would similarly stand aside, the fate of the Island might wellbe decided by the Afro-Asian group. Bearing in mind the precedent of the United Nations force in the Congo and the known desire ofArchbishop Makarios to enlist Afro-Asian support, we might be wise to avoid any appeal to the United Nations, if possible.In further discussion it was suggested that the situation in Cyprusmight soon compel the Commander, British Forces, to exercise hisdelegated authority to arrange for the emergency evacuation ofBritish families to the Sovereign Base Areas. For this purpose hewould require the use of Nicosia Airport; and, since this airportmight well become the scene of conflict between Greek and Turkish forces, it was desirable that the Commander should be given authorityto seize control of it, a step which we were entitled to take under
the 1960 Treaty. In these circumstances it might be impossible toavoid the use of force by British troops, which had hitherto been oneof our main objectives.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that it would be desirable to seek totransfer our responsibility for maintaining law and orderin Cyprus to an international force, which wouldpreferably be constituted by contributions from certainmember countries of the North Atlantic treaty organisation.(2) Approved the issue to the Commander, British Forces, of an instruction empowering him to take control of NicosiaAirport if he judged this to be essential in order to securethe evacuation of the families and dependents of UnitedKingdom personnel in Cyprus.East Africa 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that it had become(Previous        necessary during the previous weekend to implement our undertakingReference:      to the Government of Kenya to assist them in quelling a mutiny of cm. (64) 6th   their armed forces and to respond to a similar request for assistanceConclusions.    from the Government of Tanganyika. British forces had accordinglyMinute 2)       entered both countries and had succeeded in restoring order. Therehad been no doubt that our intervention had been necessary; and the speed and efficiency with which it had been carried out reflected greatcredit upon all who had been concerned. But we could not carryindefinitely the responsibility of maintaining order in territories over which we no longer exercised any political control; and we must therefore review our policy in East and Southern Africa as a matterof urgency.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. It was clearly desirable that British troops should be withdrawn from EastAfrica as soon as possible; at the same time it would not be in our interest to leave the countries concerned to the mercy of whateversubversive forces had prompted the recent mutinies. There were some indications that the East African Governments themselves were now beginning to think of organising their security on some kindof collective or federal basis; and it would be to our advantagediscreetly to encourage this tendency and to seek to promote a pattern of regional co-operation by such practical assistance as we could resonably provide.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to United Kingdom policy in Eastand Southern Africa.Indonesia 3.   The Prime Minister said that he had impressed on the United(Previous        States Attorney-General, Mr. Robert Kennedy, during his recent visitReference :      to the United Kingdom, that, while we fully accepted the importanceCM.

He had therefore emphasisedto Mr. Kennedy that, although we endorsed the proposed conference between the Heads of Government of Malaysia, Indonesia and the philippines, we could not agree to withdraw our troops from theBorneo Territories until we were fully satisfied of Indonesian good faith and we were anxious that the United States should avoid
FutureAgriculturalPolicy :Cereals(previous reference :CM. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Minister of Agriculture said that it had not yet beenpossible to secure the co-operation of our main oversea suppliersin arrangements for regulating the United Kingdom cereals market.The proposals which we had put forward for discussion comprisedrestraints on home production by the establishment of standard quantities, combined with safeguards against excessive imports atuneconomic prices; and, in return for the acceptance of arrangements on these lines, we should have been prepared to give exporting countries assurances about continued access to the United kingdom market and to undertake to put remedial action in hand if the proposed measures to restrain home production proved ineffective and importstherefore fell significantly below the agreed levels.In the present negotiations the level of the standard quantity for domestic production had proved to be the chief obstacle to agreement. The representatives of our own producers had made itclear that they would object to any standard quantity below 10 million tons, although they might reluctantly accept a figure of 9J million tons. Their argument was based largely on the fact that, given averageweather, the harvest for 1964 would be likely to amount to 10-million tons on the basis of the acreage already sown. The exporters,on the other hand, had been unwilling to contemplate a figure inexcess of 9-3 million tons, although 9-5 million tons might be acceptable to them as an upper limit. In these circumstances it wasnecessary to decide whether we should continue to seek a solution which would be acceptable to the exporting countries, even if we hadto impose it on our own farmers, or whether, alternatively, we should refuse to consider any solution which our own farmers were notprepared to accept voluntarily. In the latter case the negotiations might well break down.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be unwise to enter into an agreement which would have to be imposed on the home producer. If the negotiations were to fail, it was better that they should be seen to have done so as the result of a refusalby the exporting countries to accept conditions which were not onlyreasonable in themselves but also compared favourably with arrangements already in force in other Western European countries.The failure of the negotiations, however, was not yet inevitable. Itappeared that a standard quantity either at, or centred on, a level of9f million tons might be accepted by the oversea suppliers and wouldCM. 7 (64)lending themselves to manoeuvres by President Sukarno which would undoubtedly have this objective. Mr. Kennedy had appeared to appreciate our views and had promised that, if President Sukarnodid not effectively abandon his present aggressive policy towardsMalaysia, the United States Government would cease to supply aid to Indonesia. But the terms of his mission had not empowered himto give us an assurance that the United States Government would support us in any action which might have to be taken if the trypartite discussions failed to reach satisfactory agreement.Mr. Kennedy had also suggested that we should make renewedefforts to explain our policy to South-East Asian countries.Arrangements for this purpose were already in hand. Meanwhile,it remained our immediate aim to seek to ensure that as little damageas possible to our position in South-East Asia resulted from theproposed tripartite discussions.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
be unlikely to be rejected by our own farmers. It would be desirable,therefore, that the Prime Minister should personally emphasise tothe Heads of the other Governments concerned the importance whichwe attached to reaching agreement with their exporters, if possible,on this basis.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed the importance of concluding with our mainoversea suppliers an agreement for the regulation of theUnited Kingdom cereals market.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture, in the course of negotiations, to offer to set the standard quantity for the domestic production of cereals in 1964 at a level of 9-75million tons or the equivalent thereof.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would communicate withthe President of the United States and with the PrimeMinisters of Canada, Australia and the Argentine,impressing upon them the importance which we attachedto a successful outcome to the current negotiations.White Paper 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as a result of theon Gaming decision, announced in the Budget speech of 1963, to require the registration of gaming establishments, a considerable amount offactual and statistical information about gaming activities in theUnited Kingdom had become available. He sought the authorityof the Cabinet to publish this information as a White Paper.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to publish a white Paper containing certain factual material aboutgaming activities in the United Kingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th January, 1964.
