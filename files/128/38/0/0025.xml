Foreign AffairsIndonesia(previous reference :CM. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 1)Malta(previous reference :CC. (63) 51stConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said thatthe meeting in Bangkok of the Foreign Secretaries of Malaysia,Indonesia and the Philippines had ended inconclusively. Although a formula for the withdrawal of Indonesian guerillas from Malaysianterritory had been agreed, it would be unlikely to be accepted by president Sukarno.The United States Government, whose attitude had beenuncertain, appeared now to be taking a more realistic view of thesituation.The Commonwealth Secretary said that a cease-fire whichallowed armed Indonesian guerillas to continue to move insideMalaysian territory would be very dangerous; it should be made clear that all firing up to the present had taken place well withinMalaysia.The Cabinet (1) Took note of these statements.The Commonwealth Secretary said that it had been proposedthat the United Kingdom Government should arbitrate in the present constitutional crisis in Malta. The matters in dispute, however, were of such a kind as to make an arbitration impracticable unless itsfindings had first been accepted in principle by the parties concerned.In further discussion with the Government of Malta and the mainOpposition Parties he would consider how such a result might best be achieved.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.3. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the United kingdom high Commissioner in Cyprus and the United States Under-Secretaryof State, Mr. Ball, had put revised proposals for an international peace-keeping force to President Makarios. These, however, had not proved acceptable. One possibility now being considered was thecreation of a force consisting of contingents from commonwealth and certain European countries. It was unlikely, however, that anyCommonwealth country except Canada and perhaps Australia would agree to provide troops. It might be undesirable, however, to divertthe attention of the Australian Government from the militarysituation in Malaysia.It was reported that the United States Government had askedboth the Greek and Turkish Governments to increase their forcesin Cyprus. We had not been consulted in this matter, which could have serious repercussions; and further information was being sought.Meanwhile, the situation in Cyprus itself was deteriorating andtension was rising.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.SECRET4251-3 a 2Cyprus(previous reference :CM.

The Lord Chancellor said that, in further discussion of the(Previous        Memorandum of Understanding now under negotiation with the reference:      United States Government on claims and indemnity for accidentsCM.

United States representatives had proposed a satisfactory form of minute 4)       words to cover the acceptance of sole and absolute liability by the operators of such vessels. It was being suggested to the Prime minister that, in the course of his current discussions in Washington, he should seek to persuade President Johnson of the importance of accepting the form of words now proposed. In default of agreement, however,it would be better to omit from the memorandum any reference tosole and absolute liability than to protract the negotiations further.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Lord Chancellor.British sugar corporation(previous reference:CM. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (CP. (64) 41) on the future of the British sugar corporation.The Minister of Agriculture said that at their last discussion theCabinet had taken the view that no reorganisation of the capitalstructure of the British Sugar Corporation would be acceptableexcept on the understanding that any increase in the Corporation^dividend should be deferred for a year.The Chairman of the Board of the Corporation had nowindicated that he would be prepared to recommend the payment ofa dividend at the current rate for the half year ending in September1964. He would wish, however, to announce as part of there organisation scheme that an interim dividend, probably of theorder of 3-J to 4 per cent, would be paid early in the next financialyear, which under the revised arrangements now being introducedwould run from October 1964.In the course of discussion, however, he had reconsidered withthe Chairman the earlier proposals for the conversion of the ordinary shares of the Corporation into preference shares. Under theseproposals the shareholders would give up all claims on the assets and profits of the Corporation other than those required to meet thepreference dividend; and the equity of the Corporation would be left in public hands, preferably with the Treasury. The scheme had themerit of simplicity. It had the disadvantage, however, that, in orderto persuade the shareholders to accept it, it would be necessary to concede a high dividend on the preference shares, probably of theorder of 9 or 10 per cent.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The creation of preference shares, virtually guaranteed by theGovernment and carrying so high a rate of interest, would be politically objectionable. It would also be undesirable to leave the equity of the Corporation in public hands while making the paymentof a fixed dividend to private shareholders a first charge on the assets and profits.(b) A scheme under which the equity was publicly owned mightavert proposals for nationalisation of the Corporation on the grounds that it represented in itself a significant measure of public control;on the other hand it would be liable to criticism on precisely the samegrounds. On balance it would be preferable to proceed with thescheme for converting the present capital of the Corporation intogenuine risk-bearing capital.(c) The proposals put forward by the Chairman of the board for the postponement of the payment of an increased dividend were
*6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (CP. (64) 40) about the current pay claim forPostmen and Postmen Higher Grade.The Postmaster-General said that the Union of Post office workers had been offered a three-year agreement involving threeannual increases of 3J per cent. They had accepted this for all gradesexcept Postmen. In their case the union would be unlikely to accept an increase of less than 4-J- per cent to 5 per cent in the first year.Feeling among the Postmen was running high and had been aggravated by what they regarded as an unjust award by the arbitration Court last year of less than 2 per cent at the Postman&apos;smaximum. If they failed on the present occasion to obtain what they regarded as an acceptable increase, there could be little doubt thatthey would resort to industrial action.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The recent central pay settlement for the non-industrial CivilService was equivalent to three annual increases of 4 per cent, 3-J- percent and 3-J per cent. The National Staff Side had reluctantlyaccepted these figures on the understanding that they were themaximum to which the Government could agree. To accept a higher figure for the Postmen now would therefore be liable to have serious repercussions.(b) To accept an argument based on the alleged unfairness ofan arbitration award would appear to encourage the Postmen to set aside the agreed arbitral machinery. The argument was the lessjustifiable in that the award in question reflected the findings of the pay Research Unit that Postmen were paid more at the maximumthan their outside analogues.(c) It could be argued that an award to the Postmen of anincrease of A\ per cent and the simultaneous award to the higher grades of an increase of 34- per cent would amount to an average* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET4251-3 a 3Postmen&apos;s Pay(previous reference :C.C. (62) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)acceptable. Further consideration, however, should be given to theproposal that, as part of the reorganisation scheme, 25 per cent ofthe new equity should be acquired by the Sugar Board. There werearguments to suggest that it might be preferable that the treasury should acquire it.(d) It would be necessary to consider carefully the timing and presentation of any scheme finally adopted. Any announcement bythe Board of the Corporation to their shareholders should be accompanied or preceded by a statement of Government policy.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the capital structure of the British sugar corporation should be reorganised as proposed in CP. (64) 24,subject to deferment of the payment of an increased dividend on thelines noted in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further consideration to theproposal that a quarter of the equity of the Corporation should be acquired by the Sugar Board.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to consider the form and timing of an announcement of the Governments policy.
award of no more than 4-2 per cent. As against this the fact that thePostmen were so large a group would tend to deprive such an argument of its practical force in relation to the non-industrial CivilService. Moreover, any offer exceeding 4 per cent at the present stage would be inconsistent &quot;with the Governments incomes policy.(d) It should not necessarily be assumed that industrial action by the Postmen would lead to a resumption of negotiations on thenormal industrial pattern. Questions of discipline would also be involved. Nevertheless, it would be only prudent to assume that, inthe event of industrial action, it might be necessary to make some finalconcession in order to secure a return to full normal working. Thiswas an added argument for setting any offer at the present stage at a level which would leave room for manoeuvre later.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Postmaster-General to offer the Union of post Office Workers a three-year pay agreement for thePostmen grades based on three annual increases of 4 percent, 3^ per cent and 3^ per cent respectively.(2) Took note that the union had already indicated their willingness to accept a three-year pay agreement forgrades other than Postmen based on three annual increases of 3^ per cent, 3j per cent and 3J per cent respectively.(3) Agreed that, if the Postmen were to resort to industrial actionin support of a larger increase in the first year of theagreement, it might be necessary to reconsider, in the lightof circumstances at the time, the conclusion recorded&quot; at(1) above.Divorce 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordJurisdiction      Chancellor (CP. (64) 38), proposing that jurisdiction in certaindivorce cases should be transferred to the County Court.The Lord Chancellor said that the cost of legal aid was risingrapidly and was expected to amount in 1964-65 to  5-6 million, ofwhich  3 million would be attributable to divorce. He had undertakena review of the system and had sought the assistance of the BarCouncil and the Law Society, who had been unable to put forwardany proposals which would effect more than a marginal saving. a saving of some  300,000, however, could be achieved by transferringjurisdiction to try undefended and short defended cases of divorcefrom the High Court to the County Court: and this proposal had much to commend it on merits. Short defended cases and nearly90 per cent of undefended cases v/ere already tried by County court judges, sitting as Commissioners of the High Court, sometimes intheir own County Courts, and distinguished only by the robe and form of address appropriate to a High Court judge. To transferjurisdiction to the County Court would therefore make no difference to the conduct of the cases themselves. The saving would result fromthe fact that solicitors would have the right of audience and in asubstantial number of cases could be expected to appear withoutCounsel and from a reduction in the costs incurred by bringingparties and witnesses to the towns in which divorce cases were nowtried. These savings v/ould also accrue to parties who were not legallyaided. The proposal might be criticised on the ground that the GorellRoyal Commission of 1912, the Denning Committee of 1946 and theMorton Royal Commission of 1956 had all endorsed the view thatjurisdiction to try matrimonial cases should be vested in the HighCourt exclusively, on the ground that the importance of the questions at issue made it desirable that they should be determined by the superior courts with the assistance of the Bar. The Denning Committee
had considered that the careful and dignified proceedings of the HighCourt might help to maintain a respectful view of the marriage tie.The first of these arguments now carried considerably less weight,however, in view of the general use of County Court judges asCommissioners; and Lord Denning himself had changed his mind and would now be willing to support the proposed transfer of jurisdiction. Cases would continue to be started in the High court and would be transferred only when it appeared that they wouldbe undefended or would occupy no more than three hours.It would be desirable for a decision to be announced in the nearfuture, since it had already been disclosed to the Public accounts committee that the proposal was under consideration and there was some Parliamentary pressure for the Government^ conclusions tobe made known. If the proposal were approved, it might be useful to introduce a Bill, even if there was little prospect of its reaching the Statute Book during the present Parliament. It would be convenient at the same time to discontinue the unsatisfactory practiceof using Queen&apos;s Counsel as Commissioners to try divorce cases; andthe Treasury had agreed to the appointment of two additional judges in the Probate, Divorce and Admiralty Division for this purpose.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be wrong to seek to secure economies by measureswhich might reduce the standard of care with which divorce cases were considered. Difficult issues concerning the custody of childrenmight arise in undefended cases; and it was in such cases that therisk of collusion commonly arose. A solicitor would be more vulnerable to pressure to countenance improper conduct if he wasnot under an obligation to consult a member of the Bar. Certainsafeguards, however, could be provided. It would remain open toparties to refer questions of custody to a Divorce Registrar; and,as officers of the court, solicitors would be subject to the jurisdiction of the judge in their professional conduct.(b) It was arguable that defended cases in which respondentswere exposed to the risk of being found guilty of conduct whichcarried social condemnation ought to remain with the High Court.On the other hand Counsel would no doubt continue to be briefedin many defended cases tried in the County Court; and there would therefore be no real change in the character of the proceedings.(c) The proposals might be misrepresented by those who wereunaware of the extent to which divorce cases were already tried by county Court judges; and same sections of opinion would continueto share the views of the two Royal Commissions and the DenningCommittee. There was some reason to think, however, that the church of England would not oppose the proposals; and it would be useful to obtain privately the views of the Archbishop of Canterbury.(d) The increasing cost of legal aid would in itself attractcriticism, which would be liable to be directed particularly againstthe high proportion of legal aid funds which was absorbed by divorceand therefore prevented the extension of legal aid to other categories of case.(e) It would in any event be inappropriate to introduce, towardsthe end of the last Session of Parliament, a measure which was likelyto be controversial.The Lord President, summing up the discussion, said that, while there was general agreement that jurisdiction in undefended cases should be transferred to the County Court, the Cabinet were not yet ready to reach a conclusion on defended cases or to contemplate the early introduction of legislation. They would be assisted in their consideration of the matter if a more detailed statement of the
IllAgriculturalPolicy: Meat(previous reference :CM. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (CP. (64) 42), reporting the latest developments in thenegotiations with our principal oversea meat suppliers.The Minister of Agriculture said that the negotiations had nowbeen adjourned without agreement. The real breaking point hadbeen the level of the import quotas for beef and lamb. Our own finaloffer had been at a level which, allowing for reasonable standard quantities for home production, would have led to total meat supplies on the United Kingdom market next year well in excess of recentlevels. To have accepted the still higher figures proposed by the exporters would thus have involved a serious risk to the stability ofthe market. Even though the gap between the two sets of figures hadbeen narrowed to a few thousand tons, he had felt unable torecommend any further concession. This was a disappointing result,since we had been in sight of an agreement which would have markeda substantial step forward in the development of the Governmenfsagricultural policy and would have been of advantage to the home producer, the oversea supplier and the Exchequer alike.If the Cabinet accepted the view that negotiations should not be resumed, it would be necessary to consider how best to protect theUnited Kingdom market against excessive imports and a resultantcollapse in prices. The danger would be the greater both because themedical objections which had hitherto prevented the import of meat from France no longer applied and because the australian government had recently agreed to reduce their meat exports to theUnited States by 15,000 tons a year and would be seeking alternativemarkets for this quantity. He would wish to give further considerationto the tentative proposals in CP. (64) 42 for the creation of a jointbody to discuss estimates of levels of home production and imports and their effect on marketing policy.In discussion the following points were made:(a) No attempt should be made at the present stage to resume negotiations for an agreement on the management of the UnitedKingdom market in meat. The oversea suppliers themselves recognisedthat the import quotas which we had offered them were fair and reasonable; and the fact that they had found themselves unable toaccept them had been due to their own inability to agree how best to divide up the total quotas proposed among themselves.(b) Under any alternative arrangements which might now be putforward for discussion it would be necessary to safeguard the positionof the minor suppliers, since the prospects for our industrial exportsmight be significantly improved if we agreed to accept a modestquantity of agricultural imports from, e.g., France and Roumania.probable form of the appropriate Bill were prepared and laid beforethem, together with an indication of the views of the archbishop of Canterbury. In the meantime no public indication of the government&apos;s intentions should be given.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to seek the views of the archbishop of Canterbury privately upon the proposals in CP. (64) 38.(2) Took note that the Lord Chancellor would bring beforethem in due course a more detailed statement of the contents of the Bill which would be required to give effectto the proposals.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Trade Unions 9.   The Cabinet were informed that two groups of private and the Law Members in the House of Commons were considering putting downMotions on the state of the law relating to trade unions as a resultof the judgment in the recent case of Rookes v. Barnard. One group,which included Mr. Iain Macleod, M.P., had drafted a Motion calling upon the Government to appoint a Royal Commission to considerthe role of the trade unions in a modern economy. The other groupintended to put down a more comprehensive Motion, calling for an inquiry into the effectiveness of both employers associations and tradeunions and into the changes which might be necessary to assist these organisations to make a constructive contribution to the full development of a prosperous economy.The Minister of Labour said that the doubts which the judgement in Rookes v. Barnard appeared to have cast on the legal protection afforded to the trade unions by Section 3 of the Trade Disputes Act1906 would  provide  a  suitable  opportunity for  securing  the cm. 11 (64)(c) Once it became known that the negotiations for an agreement had failed there would be pressure on the Government to takeunilateral action to control meat imports. It would be necessary toconsider carefully the implications of any action on these lines,having regard to our existing obligations under treaty or international agreement.(d) It would in any event be desirable that the Minister ofAgriculture should ascertain in further negotiation the extent to which our main oversea suppliers might be prepared at this stage to acceptvoluntary arrangements for the phasing of their imports within agreedlevels. On the other hand the fact that in the course of the recent negotiations they had sought our agreement to import quotas at anunacceptably high level made it the less likely that they would nowbe prepared to acquiesce in voluntary arrangements which we should find satisfactory.(e) It would be necessary to make an early announcement of thefact that the negotiations on meat had been broken off and would notbe resumed. At the same time the Government would have to declareat least the outlines of an alternative policy. Further consideration should be given to the terms of such an announcement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no further attempt should be made to negotiate a meat agreement in 1964 involving control of the levelof imports and standard quantity arrangements at home.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theEconomic Policy Committee to consider the alternative policy which it might now be appropriate for theGovernment to adopt.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to circulate forconsideration by the Economic Policy Committee thedraft of an announcement that the negotiations for ameat agreement had been unsuccessful, together withsome indication of the lines of the Governments future policy in this respect.(4) Invited the Minister of State, Board of Trade, to arrangefor the circulation to the Economic Policy Committee ofa memorandum setting out the existing obligationsaffecting agricultural imports which the United kingdom had accepted either under treaty or under international agreement.
appointment of a Royal Commission, if the Government decided infavour of such a course. A Royal Commission to consider thefunctions of the unions and the employers organisations in modernindustry would be welcome to many supporters of the Government.On the basis of the second of the proposed Motions it might bepossible to secure the agreement of the Trade Union Council to theappointment of a Royal Commission; but they might well refuse toco-operate if a considerable body of Members of Parliament declaredthemselves in favour of a Royal Commission to inquire into the tradeunions alone. It would therefore be desirable to secure that a Motionwas tabled on the lines proposed by Sir William Robson-Brown butin terms which would also attract the support of those who wishedto see a Royal Commission appointed. The effect of the judgment inRookes v. Barnard was already under consideration by the Ministryof Labour in consultation with the Law Officers.In discussion it was observed that a recent report of an official committee on Trade Unions and the Law had reached largelynegative conclusions on the practicability of introducing more effective measures for the maintenance of industrial discipline; andthe value of a Royal Commission might therefore be open to doubt.While no immediate decision on the appointment of an inquiry need be taken, it would be useful if any such decision could be announced at the same time as the introduction of the Resale Prices Bill. In themeantime, it would be sufficient for the Minister of Labour, ifquestioned, to say that the effect of the Rookes v. Barnard judgmentwas under consideration.The Lord President, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be desirable to ensure that a Motion was tabled in a form which would not prejudice the Minister of Labour in securing theagreement of the trade unions to whatever form of inquiry theGovernment might consider it useful to appoint in the light of their further consideration both of the effect of the judgment in Rookesv. Barnard and of the recent report of the Official Committee. he understood that the Prime Minister had already made arrangements to review the position with the Ministers concerned on his return from washington.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Minister of Labour was seeking theopinion of the Law Officers on the effect of the judgement in the case of Rookes v. Barnard on the law concerningtrade unions.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister on his return would arrange to discuss with the Ministers principally concerned the situation created by the judgment.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to discuss the proposedParliamentary Motions on this subject with their sponsors,in order to ensure, so far as possible, that they would be acceptable to the Government.(4) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate to the Cabinetthe Report of the Official Committee on Trade unions and the Law.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1964.
