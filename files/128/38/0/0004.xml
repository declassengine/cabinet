Parliamentary 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business Parliament in the following two weeks. They also considered thearrangements to be made for the Debate on the Address.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the course of this debate, Opposition spokesmen would be likely to allege both that the programmes of expansion which the Government proposed were inadequate and that they would involve an excessive strain on the economy. It would be desirable to expose the basic inconsistency ofthese charges by publicly disclosing forecasts of the public expenditurein future years which the Governments policies involved. Thesefigures which had been circulated to the Cabinet in C. (63) 140,indicated not only that expenditure would rise sharply as work onthe programmes proceeded but also that the increase should not be inconsistent with an annual rate of growth of 4 per cent in the gross national product, which the Government had announced as their objective.The Cabinet-Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announce inParliament, in the course of the Debate on the Address, theestimates of public expenditure over the next five years which the Governments present policies involved.ForeignAffairsVietnamBerlin(previous reference:CM. (63) 1stConclusions.Minute 4)2. The Foreign Secretary said that on 8th November the UnitedKingdom had recognised the Government which had taken office in vietnam after the recent insurrection. The new Government appearedto be vigorously prosecuting the struggle against the Viet Cong.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary said that no response had been receivedfrom the Soviet authorities to the communication made on29th October, informing them of the harmonised procedures whichhad been agreed by the United Kingdom, United States and french governments for Allied convoys using the Berlin Autobahn.Nevertheless, a United States convoy had passed through the Sovietcontrol points earlier that morning without difficulty; and, while therisk of further incidents could not be excluded, there appeared to beno cause for immediate concern. The United States Government,however, were disposed to take a serious view of the situation; andit would be inappropriate for us to consider any further approach tothe Soviet Government except in concert with the Governments ofthe United States and France.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the foreign secretary.Commercial 3.   The Secretary of State for Industry said that the United states policy Under-Secretary of State, Mr. George Ball, who would be visitingTrade with the London on 15th November, could be expected to seek our support forSoviet bloc measures to restrict the provision of credit by the Western Powers for(Previous trade with the Soviet bloc. We favoured a more generous attitude in reference: this matter than the United States; and it would be necessary toC.C. (63) 57th maintain our view. The recent sale of large quantities of wheat by them S4)nS&apos; United States t0 the Soviet Union would make it less likely that other western countries would now be prepared to forgo opportunities of expanding their own trade with the Soviet bloc.
South Africa(previous reference:CM. (63) 3rdConclusions.Minute 2)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary (CP. (63) 8 and 10respectively) on South Africa.The Foreign Secretary said that the United Kingdom permanent representative at the United Nations had had further discussions with the Representatives of the United States and Norway on thepossibility of tabling in the Security Council a draft resolution on the subject of apartheid which would not call for the impositionof economic sanctions against South Africa and would thus extricateus from the embarrassment of having to use the veto. This resolution,the text of which was appended to CP. (63) 8, proposed, albeit in non--mandatory terms, an embargo by all States on the sale andshipment to South Africa of materials and equipment for themanufacture of arms and ammunition. Both the United States and norway were prepared to vote for this proposal, although the UnitedStates would make it clear that they would interpret the relevantparagraph of the resolution as relating only to equipment and materials obviously and exclusively designed for the manufacture ofarms and ammunition. We could not support the proposal withoutextending our existing policy which, as agreed by the Cabinet attheir meeting on 23rd September, required us to prevent the export to South Africa of armaments which would enable the policy ofapartheid to be enforced but placed no restriction on the exportof other types of armaments or of equipment and materials. Onthe other hand, if we did not endorse the present proposal, it mightnot command sufficient support in the Security Council to be carried;and it might then be supplanted by a more extreme Afro-Asianresolution, which might propose not only a total embargo on theexport of arms and armament materials to South Africa but also theintroduction of some form of economic sanctions against the SouthAfrican Government. Such a resolution would place us in even greater difficulty, especially since we could not rely on its beingvetoed by any other country. In these circumstances it would be rightto accept the extension of our present policy which was implicit inthe proposed resolution. In supporting the operative paragraph,however, the United Kingdom Permanent Representative wouldmake it clear that we should regard it only as a recommendation and that we should place our own interpretation on it. In practice this would not involve us in doing more than preventing the export,subject to existing contracts, of specialised machinery and equipment for the production of repressive weapons.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There might be advantage in refraining from drawing any distinction between materials and equipment for the manufacture of weapons which could be used for repressive purposes and other types of materials and equipment. But to abandon the criterion of repressiveuse would not only be inconsistent with the policy which theGovernment had adopted hitherto but would also place at riskimportant contracts for the export to South Africa of machinery forthe production of defensive guided weapons.(b) In many cases there would be considerable administrativedifficulty in distinguishing between materials and equipment for themanufacture of weapons and ammunition and materials andequipment imported into South Africa for other purposes. The UnitedStates intended to confine their restriction to imports &quot; obviously andexclusively &quot; intended for weapons or ammunition manufacture; andwe should adopt the same criteria.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Industry.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th November, 1963.(c) The additional proposal in the draft resolution that a group of experts should be established under the auspices of the united nations to examine alternative possibilities of constitutional development in South Africa would need further consideration. Theadvantages of our participating in this study would need to be weighed against the risk that, if we felt obliged to dissociate ourselves fromthe more extreme recommendations which it might sponsor, we might appear as in some sense apologists for the policies of the SouthAfrican Government.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, for the purposes of the forthcoming debate inthe Security Council of the United Nations, theGovernment should be prepared to accept an obligationto prevent the export from the United Kingdom to SouthAfrica of materials and equipment obviously andexclusively designed for the manufacture of weapons andammunition which would enable the South african government to enforce repressive policies in support ofapartheid.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Industry and the Minister ofDefence, to arrange for appropriate instructions to besent to the United Kingdom Permanent Representative atthe United Nations.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would give furtherconsideration to the question whether the United kingdom should participate in the work of the group of expertswhich it was proposed to establish under the auspices ofthe United Nations in order to examine alternativepossibilities of constitutional development in South Africa.
