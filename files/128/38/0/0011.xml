PensionsPublicServicePensions(previous reference:CM. (63) 9thConclusions,Minute 1)Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th December, 1963.The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal that the widows of officers of the Armed Services who had died before4th November, 1958, should receive the same proportion of their husbands&apos; pensions as the widows of officers who had died after thatdate.In favour of the proposal it was argued that the class of widowsinvolved was small; that the widows were in many cases sufferinghardship; and that, since the change proposed would not create anew entitlement to pension but would merely affect the percentageof her late husband&apos;s pension (which would itself remain unchanged)which the widow would draw, it would not only create no precedent in other fields but would make it easier for the Government to resist pressure for other and wider changes in Service pensions generally.Against the proposal it was argued that there was a very large numberof cases in the public service in which the amount of a pension was determined by a particular date and that, if the Governmentacquiesced in a breach of the principle that an entitlement established as from a given date could not be applied to cases arising before thatdate, they would find it impossible to resist pressure for correspondingchanges in public service pensions generally; that the widows inquestion had already received special treatment under the latestPensions (Increase) Act and were in less need than other widows inreceipt of public service pensions; that, so far from making it easier for the Government to resist pressure for other changes, the proposed concession would make resistance more difficult; and that, if this concession were now made, the Government would find it difficultto reconcile the decision with their earlier refusal to entertain theproposal on the grounds that it would create a precedent for similar,and far more costly, concessions elsewhere.After further discussion the Prime Minister said that, althougheither course involved considerable difficulty, the balance ofadvantage appeared to incline in favour of making the proposed concession. It would be necessary, however, to resist firmly any pressure for other and wider concessions and to defend the presentdecision on the grounds that it involved no more than the correctionof a unique anomaly.The Cabinet Agreed that the widows of officers of the Armed Serviceswho had died before 4th November, 1958, should receivethe same proportion of their husbands&apos; pensions as the widows of those who had died after that date.
