ForeignAffairsCyprus(previous reference :CM. (64) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Foreign Secretary said that there was increasing concernin the House of Commons about the status of the troops formingthe United Kingdom contingent in the United Nations peace-keepingforce in Cyprus; and Members of Parliament were pressing for publication of the directive to be issued by the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations to the Commander of the force. The directivewas in fact reasonably satisfactory from our point of view; but itwould be doubtfully wise to press the Secretary-General to consent to its publication since, if the Greek Cypriot community or any other interested party objected to it and the Secretary-General was subsequently compelled to amend its provisions, the protection whichit afforded to our contingent in the peace-keeping force might bereduced. It might therefore suffice to inform Parliament that the directive would empower our troops to use force both in self-defence and for the effective discharge of their mission. In addition theSecretary-General had indicated that the text of the directive itselfmight be shown privately to the Leader of the Opposition and otherMembers of Parliament who were particularly concerned; and hewould probably be prepared to agree that a further document,entitled &quot; United Nations Force in Cyprus: Standing OperationProcedures &quot;, might be made available to Members of Parliamentgenerally, e.g., by being placed in the Libraries. Until we receiveda copy of this document, however, we could not be certain that itwould suffice to allay Parliamentary concern. Meanwhile, theSecretary-General had received assurances of additional nationalcontributions to the peace-keeping force and felt able, therefore, toaccept a progressive reduction of our own contingent to a level of2,000 troops.In discussion it was agreed that the balance of advantageprobably inclined against publication of the directive on the grounds that disclosures of operation orders would be contrary to precedentand to accepted practice. The proposed reduction in the size of theBritish contingent should be welcomed in principle, provided that the reduced unit remained realistic in logistic and administrative terms.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that it would be desirable to resistParliamentary pressure for the publication of the directiveto be issued by the Secretary-General of the united nations to the United Nations peace-keeping force in cyprus.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would discussconfidentially with the Leader of the Opposition thereasons for this decision and would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the desirability of making available to Members of Parliament a copy of the&quot; Standing Operation Procedures &quot; of the peace-keepingforce.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary, to consider the means by which effect might appropriately be given to the proposals by the Secretary-General of the United Nations to reduce the size of theUnited Kingdom contribution to the peace-keeping force.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The Yemen The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that it had recently(Previous        been decided to authorise an air attack on a fort at Harib on the reference:      Yemeni side of the frontier between the Yemen and the FederationC.C. (63) 43rd of South Arabia. This incident had evoked considerable resentmentConclusions,    in the Arab world and was to be debated in the Security Council of minute 3)       the United Nations on the basis of a resolution sharply criticisingour action. Our efforts to modify the terms of the resolution hadbeen only partially successful; and, in the form in which it was likelyto be tabled, it would &quot; deplore &quot; our action. The United kingdom permanent Representative at the United Nations had advised that,even so, we should not seek to veto it but should abstain from voting in the debate and should make a suitable statement in justification ofthe attack on the fort. The resolution might attract sufficient support to be carried; and we could not exclude the possibility that the UnitedStates Government might vote in its favour.In discussion there was general agreement that, on balance, thiswould be the right course. Nevertheless, it was very regrettable that international opinion should so seriously misinterpret a step which,after enduring prolonged provocation, we had been obliged to take in discharge of our treaty obligation to protect the Federation ofSouth Arabia. Our statement in the United Nations debate should therefore emphasise that, if there were any recurrence of unprovokedYemeni aggression against the Federation, we should refer the issueforthwith to the Security Council and, if the Council were unableto guarantee prompt protection for the Federation, we should reserve our right to take whatever further steps we judged necessaryfor this purpose. It would be particularly unfortunate, and potentiallydamaging to Anglo-American relations, if the United StatesGovernment felt unable to support us in the debate in the security council. The action which we had taken against the Yemen was similar in principle to the action which the United States government themselves had taken against Cuba; and it could be argued that itwas United States policy towards the United Arab Republic whichhad placed us in a position in which, if we were to sustain the morale of our friends and allies in southern Arabia, we had no alternative to seeking to deter Yemeni aggression by appropriate retaliatorymeasures. It would be necessary to represent these considerationsforcibly to the United States &quot;Government and to consider alsowhether we should make a fresh attempt, with their support, to revivepressure by the United Nations for the implementation of theresolution requiring the withdrawal of troops of the United A.rabRepublic from the Yemen.In addition public opinion in the United Kingdom would be liable to be considerably disturbed if the Security Council endorsed the resolution condemning the attack on the fort at Harib; and itwould therefore be important that the reasons for our action shouldbe made known, as fully and clearly as possible at an early opportunity.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that we should not seek to veto the resolution in thethe Security Council of the United Nations deploring ourattack on the fort at Harib but should abstain from voting in the debate and should make a full statement injustification of our action.(5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom permanent Representative at the United Nationsaccordingly and to represent forcibly to the United StatesGovernment the displeasure with which public opinion in the United Kingdom would regard United states support of the resolution.(6) Took note that, if necessary, the Prime Minister wouldaddress a personal message to the President of the United
SouthernRhodesia(previous reference :CM. (64) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)The prospects for Taxation,1964-67(previous reference :CM. (64) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, (CP. (64) 65)on the prospects for taxation in the years 1964-67.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the White Paper on public Expenditure (Command 2235) had forecast a \1\ per cent increase of public expenditure at constant prices from 1963-64 to1967-68. On the assumption of a 4 per cent minimum rise in the gross National Product (G.N.P.), this represented an increase in the ratio of public expenditure to G.N.P. from the present 40 per cent to about 41^- per cent, as compared with 36 per cent in 1947.Moreover, since the publication of the White Paper substantial new commitments had been undertaken or were in prospect. It would therefore become necessary by 1967 to raise an additional  300- 400million a year in taxation; and, even if the economy expanded at thefull growth rate, this would require an annual increase in the ratesof taxation sufficient to produce an additional  75- 100 million. Ifthis increase were obtained primarily from indirect taxes, prices and states in reinforcement of the representations to be madeunder Conclusion (5) above.(7) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give further considerationto the desirability of taking a fresh initiative in the united nations to secure the withdrawal of troops of the united arab Republic from the Yemen.The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that, as a resultof the dissolution of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia had recently found it necessaryto enact a Bill incorporating certain Federal laws in the Colony&apos;slegislation. Some of these laws were discriminatory in their nature.The Government of Southern Rhodesia had nevertheless decidedthat they should not be brought within the jurisdiction of theConstitutional Council which v/as required, under the Constitutionof Southern Rhodesia, to review discriminatory legislation passedby the Colony&apos;s own Legislature. It would be possible for us to objectto this decision; but it would be preferable to refrain from doing sopartly on the ground that the extent of discriminatory legislation in southern Rhodesia would be no greater than in the period when theFederal laws had been in force and partly on the ground that thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Winston Field, had undertaken to reconsider the possibility of bringing the formerFederal laws within the jurisdiction of the Constitutional council when it next became necessary to amend the Constitution of theColony.The Cabinet (8) Took note, with approval, of this statement by the colonial secretary.Zanzibar The Colonial Secretary said that there were increasing indications(Previous that Zanzibar was falling under the influence of the Sino-Soviet bloc.Reference: We were keeping the situation under close review, in collaborationCM. (64) 10th with the Governments of Kenya, Tanganyika and Uganda, who had conclusions, invited the President of Zanzibar, Mr. Karume, to attend a minute 2) forthcoming meeting of Heads of African States at which they hoped to exercise some moderating influence upon him.The Cabinet (9) Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.
Postmen&apos;s Pay 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Postmaster-General (CP. (64) 85) about the effect on postal servicesReference: of the industrial action which the Union of Post Office WorkersCM. (64) 13th were expected to take in support of their claim for increased payConclusions, for postmen.Minute 5)The Postmaster-General said that, although efforts to reach agreement with the Union continued, it now appeared that industrial action was unavoidable. The union proposed to call a one-day strike on 16th April, to ban overtime and Sunday work from 17th Aprilfor at least two weeks and to work-to-rule during the same period,at the end of which they had indicated that they would review thesituation. Since any attempt to compel postmen to work overtimeor on Sundays or to employ Servicemen or civilians on postal duties would be likely to lead to further industrial action by the union, itwould be necessary to reduce the postal services to a levelcorresponding with the reduced number of hours which the staffm6 secret the cost of living would be liable to rise, with adverse effects on incomes policy. If it were obtained from direct taxation, incentive and enterprise would be reduced. It was therefore necessary to consider carefully what upper limit should be imposed on the rate of growth of public expenditure.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The increased yield which would be required from taxationrepresented a comparatively small sum in relation to a G.N.P. ofover  26,000 million. On the other hand the necessary annual increasein the rates of taxation would bear particularly hardly on individualswith small fixed incomes.(b) It might be desirable that, in so far as additional revenuehad to be raised, it should be obtained primarily from indirect taxation, e.g., on oil.(c) The recent change of policy in relation to agricultural support had involved an increase in market prices for foodstuffs,with a consequent saving, of the order of  50 million in the current year, in the estimated cost of the agricultural guarantees. there might be advantage in pursuing this policy further. On the otherhand it could be argued that the prices of basic foodstuffs should bekept as low as possible.(d) The cost of defence represented a large and increasing proportion of total Governmental expenditure. Further consideration might have to be given to this item; but it was unlikely that any large economies could be obtained in this field except by theabandonment of some of our major oversea commitments.(e) The potential sources of increased taxation in the longer term should be systematically examined.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 65 and of the points made in their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, to circulate, after theforthcoming Budget, a further memorandum on the potential sources of increased taxation in the longer term.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meetingon the basis of the memorandum to be circulated inaccordance with Conclusion (2) above.(4) Agreed to resume at an early meeting their examination ofthe public investment programme.
United Nations        5.   The Secretary of State for Industry said that the initialConference on proceedings of the United Nations Conference on Trade andTrade and      Development had been unproductive and the views advanced byDevelopment    other countries had evoked little support. He had therefore been invited by the representatives of the Commonwealth Governmentsattending the Conference to take the initiative in making constructive proposals. His speech, which was based on earlier discussions in theEconomic Policy Committee, had been well received; and it shouldhave helped the Conference to appreciate that there was no generalCM. 21 (64)would work. The objective should be to maintain the first-class letterservice; and for this purpose it was proposed to suspend from midnight 15th-16th April the inland parcel post, the inland printedpaper service and the house-to-house unaddressed delivery service.In order to enable the public, and particularly business houses, tomake alternative arrangements, the proposed restrictions would be announced on 13th April. It was doubtful whether the suspension of certain services would infringe any implied obligations of thePostmaster-General under the Post Office Act 1953 and the relevantregulations and whether regulations under the Emergency powers act 1920 to relieve him of any such obligation would be intra vires.In the past it had been held that, if legal action were taken againstthe Postmaster-General on these grounds, recourse should be had toa Bill of Indemnity.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be impossible to make any concession to the Unionwithout undermining the principle of fair comparison, subject to theright to go to arbitration, which governed the determination of paythroughout the Civil Service. The leaders of the other Civil Serviceunions, which adhered to this principle and were anxious that theexisting arrangements should not be prejudiced, might be able togive some informal assistance in promoting a settlement; and it waspossible that the postmen themselves, having made a demonstrationin support of their claim, would not be anxious to prolong the dispute.(b) On the other hand the general public were largelyuninformed about the issues involved in the dispute and would be liable to sympathise with the postmen. Arrangements should therefore be made for the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePostmaster-General to hold an appropriate Press conference, whichmight conveniently take place on 10th April.(c) Public resentment of the restrictions on the postal servicesmight be reduced if the withdrawal of the parcel service could belimited to large packages.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to give further considerationto the possibility of maintaining a parcel service in respectof small parcels only.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, approved the proposals inC.P. (64) 85.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thePostmaster-General would take steps to inform thegeneral public of the grounds on which the government felt obliged to reject the wage claim of the Union of post Office Workers.
or automatic solution to the problems involved but that betterprogress would be made by examining the individual remediesappropriate to specific situations. The episode had providedinteresting evidence of the continuing value of the commonwealth connection, to which he would pay public tribute at an early opportunity.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement by the Secretaryof State for Industry.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th April, 1964.
