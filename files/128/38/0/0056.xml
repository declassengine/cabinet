TheGovernment of Jordan had recently recognised the Republican regime in the Yemen; the Royalist forces in the Yemen were becoming increasingly disheartened; and the Government of Saudi Arabiaappeared to be contemplating some rapprochement with the united arab Republic. We should need to review our policy in the area in the very near future.*3. The Cabinet had before them: (i) a memorandum by theMinister of Aviation (CP. (64) 157), to which was appended an interim report by Sir John Lang on certain contracts between theMinistry ; of Aviation and Ferranti Limited for the production of equipment connected with the Mark I BLOODHOUND guidedweapon system; (ii) a Note by the Minister of Aviation(CP. (64) 158), to which were annexed the texts of letters exchangedwith Mr. Ferranti, and the draft of a Parliamentary statement, onthis subject.The Minister&apos; of Aviation said that the Lang Report, whichwould be published that afternoon, revealed that Ferranti Limitedhad made a profit of nearly  5  million on 40 contracts, for whichthe total value of the agreed prices was just over  12,800,000. this represented a return of 82 per cent on costs and 45 per cent onselling prices. The report criticised both the Ministry of Aviation inrespect of their contract procedures and Ferranti Limited forsubmitting quotations and agreeing prices which they knew were.likely to yield profits which could not be regarded as fair and1 reasonable. In subsequent discussions the firm had agreed to makea refund of  4^ million in respect of the contracts in question. This; agreement had been confirmed in an exchange of letters between mr. Ferranti and the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry of aviation, in which the former had been assured that the ministry had confidence in him, his company and its technical ability and thatthere would be no discrimination against the company so far as\ future contracts were concerned.Discussion showed general agreement that, although theGovernment might properly express continuing confidence in the firm&apos;s technical competence and could certainly undertake to exerciseno discrimination against them in future, it would be inconsistentThe LangReport oni   the FerrantiContract   I
Land Values(previous reference:CM. (64) 34thConclusions,Minute 7)*4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (CP. (64) 145) on land values.The Minister of Housing and Local Government recalled thatthe Cabinet had decided at their earlier discussion that, while itmight prove desirable to introduce a tax on profits arising from thesale or development of land, it would be unwise to make any immediate announcement on the subject and that furtherconsideration should be given by the Ministers concerned to the formin which the Governmenfs intentions might be announced at a laterCM. 42 (64)with the findings of the Lang Report to express unreservedconfidence in Mr. Ferranti and his company. In addition the reference in the exchange of letters to a refund of  4  million mightbe held to be misleading in so far as it implied that the whole ofthis sum would be paid at once. In fact, the payment would be discharged by a number of instalments, extending over several years;and the initial instalment would, in effect, be offset against therefund of tax to which the company would be entitled. For these reasons it would be desirable for the letters to be modified in certain respects. They should confine themselves to stating that it had beenagreed that the company would refund  4^ million and thatarrangements for the discharge of this liability would be the subjectof further discussion. They should also go no further than assuringMr. Ferranti that there would be no discrimination against thecompany in the allocation of future contracts, although this mightbe coupled, if he so wished, with an assurance of the Governmenfsconfidence in the firm&apos;s technical ability. The text of these lettersshould be circulated in the Official Report, immediately after thestatement which the Minister of Aviation would make that afternoonon the publication of the Lang Report.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It would be necessary to review, in the light of the LangReport, the procedures in the Ministry of Aviation for the placing of contracts, together with the related question of the adequacy of departmental staffs in general for the supervision of very largecontracts involving a high degree of technical expertise.(b) The Press had prematurely obtained information about theproposed refund by Ferranti Limited. Enquiries suggested that thesedisclosures had probably originated not from any official source but from the firm themselves. It might be necessary to make this clear in public, particularly if Mr. Ferranti v/ere willing to confirm it.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 157 and 158.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with theLord Chancellor and the Chancellor of the Exchequer,to arrange for the modification of the letters exchangedwith Mr. Ferranti on the lines indicated in their discussion.(3) Invited the Minister of Aviation to ascertain whether Mr.Ferranti would confirm that the premature disclosure tothe Press about the refund to be made by the company had originated with the company themselves.(4) Agreed to resume, at a subsequent meeting, their discussionof various issues arising from the Lang Report.
stage. There were now indications, however, that the issue mightassume considerable prominence in the near future; and ministers might therefore be embarrassed if they were unable to disclose theGovernments intentions. There was no doubt that public opinion was disturbed by the high profits accruing as the result of publicdecisions relating to planning and development; and it had become apparent that some of the Governments supporters, together withreputable firms engaged in large-scale developments, would welcomea form of tax on land values, possibly at a higher level than theGovernment themselves would contemplate. The release of moreland for development, even in the extreme and unacceptable formof the sacrifice of the Green Belt, would reduce prices onlymarginally; but the public might be willing to accept the fact thatthe price of a scarce commodity would remain high if they could be assured that the Government intended to levy a charge on profits,which would yield a useful revenue while not prejudicing the supplyof land. The change of policy could be defended by reference to thenew situation created by the much steeper rise in land prices inrecent years, which had resulted from the Governments own success in stimulating house-building and other forms of development.In discussion it was suggested that to announce in the nearfuture a proposal to introduce a new tax on land values would be liable to be interpreted as an admission that the Government hadbeen mistaken in their policies during the previous 12 years; andit would be difficult to reconcile a decision to sponsor such a taxat this stage with the Governments failure to introduce it in theFinance Bill which had only been enacted in the last few weeks.The public would find it difficult to understand why the conservative party, which had given such prominence in 1951 to their intentionto abolish the development charge, were now proposing to introduce a similar levy, albeit at a lower level; and those who were in favourof a charge might well think that a levy as low as the Governmenthad in mind would be inadequate as a means of obtaining for thecommunity an equitable share of the high profits which were nowbeing made. Moreover, a tax on profits derived from the developmentof land might be regarded as merely the prelude to a full-scale tax on capital gains. It could not be distinguished from the latter solely on the ground that profits derived from the development of land wereattributable to decisions of public authorities, since other forms ofcapital gain might similarly be argued to derive largely from the policies adopted by the Government in the management of the economy. The better course, therefore, might be to develop theGovernments existing policies in two main directions. First, it shouldbe publicly emphasised that the community already shared in theenhanced value of land through the taxation of profits (including the short-term gains tax introduced in 1962) and through the enhancementof rateable values. Second, renewed efforts should be made to increasethe supply of land and, in particular, to acquire land in areas expectedto be developed through public agencies, which would provideopportunities for development by private enterprise as well as by public authorities.On the other hand the public conscience was rightly disturbed by the spectacle of high profits being made merely as a result of the selection of a particular area for development; and the government ought to be seen to be taking some part of the profit for the benefitof the community. The Government might otherwise suffer from theresentment generated in the minds of the public by a comparison between the incidence of taxation and of the Governments incomes policy on the ordinary wage and salary earner and the enjoyment of large and apparently untaxed profits by owners and developers ofland. The change of policy could be convincingly defended on theground that prices of land had only recently increased steeply, that new sources of revenue were known to be necessary and that
informed opinion, including that of some developers, now supportedsome form of taxation of land values. Public opinion would be more favourably impressed by a change of policy which indicatedrecognition of the reality of the problem than by the sophisticatedarguments which would have to be deployed in order to justify themaintenance of the existing policy. The administration of a new tax,however, would not be simple; and any announcement of theGovernments intention to introduce it should be expressed, at thisstage, in general terms.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould help the Cabinet to reach a decision if they could considerthe draft of a statement indicating the terms in which theGovernment might announce a decision to introduce a new tax on land values in the next Parliament and, as an alternative, the draftof a statement indicating the terms in which they might defend adecision to adhere to the existing policies.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to circulate alternative drafts of possible statements ofpolicy on the subject of land values on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th July, 1964.
