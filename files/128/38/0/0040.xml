ForeignAffairsForeignSecretary&apos;sVisitAden(previous reference:CM. (63) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said thatthe Foreign Secretary had now concluded his recent oversea tour byvisits to Japan and the Philippines. His discussions in relation to indonesia in both capitals had been very helpful.The Secretary of State for Defence said that we were still seeking to verify the allegation that two United Kingdom soldiers recentlykilled in action in the South Arabian Federation had been beheadedby Yemeni tribesmen. Meanwhile, he had issued instructions to themilitary authorities on the need for consultation with the local political authorities before any official statement was made in future in relation to an incident of this nature.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Malta(previous reference:CM. (64) 25thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Colonial Secretary said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s latest decision about the constitutional development of malta, a referendum had recently been conducted in the Island on theissue of independence on the basis of the constitution proposed by theNationalist Party. The results would require detailed analysis; and weshould also need to be satisfied, by the United Kingdom observerswho had attended the referendum, that it had been fairly conducted.Nevertheless, it was already clear that a large majority of the totalelectorate had voted for independence, although they had been divided on the form of independence constitution to be adopted. he might therefore have to advise that we should shortly concedeindependence to Malta. It would not now be practicable for the island to become independent by 31st May, the date originally envisaged;but, once the decision of principle had been taken, there could be nolong delay in putting it into effect. Moreover, a refusal to grant independence would be the one step which would unite the parties in malta in opposition to the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for Defence said that, in the light of theinsecurity of our position in Cyprus and in Libya, the independence of Malta might constitute a serious threat to our defence interests inthe Mediterranean. Restricted defence facilities in an independentMalta, by which, for example, our base could not be used by ships or aircraft carrying nuclear weapons, would be of little value to us.It could be argued that in these circumstances we should do better to cut our losses now than to seek to maintain costly defence facilities which might have to be abandoned in a few years time. On the otherhand a withdrawal from Malta would have serious repercussions onour global strategic interests, particularly if, as a result, we were compelled to rely, for communication with the Far East, on the routeround the Cape.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) A refusal to grant independence to Malta would be likely to lead to the fall of the present Government and to the succession of theOpposition Party led by Mr. Mintoff. The latter might refuse tonegotiate any defence agreement with us at all.(b) The constitution put forward by the Nationalist Party as thebasis of the referendum contained features which were repugnant tocertain sections of public opinion in the United Kingdom, particularlyCM. 26 (64)Parliament 1,   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 92) on negotiations with the federal german Government about new arrangements to offset the balanceof payments cost of our forces in Germany.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he had been invited bythe German Minister of Finance, Dr. Dahlgruen, to visit Bonn on20th May in order to negotiate new arrangements to offset the costof maintaining our forces in Germany for the period beginning1st April, 1964. The German obligation in this respect during 1962-63and 1963-64 had amounted to DM600 million and had been discharged by means of a combination of defence contracts and civil purchases. During his visit to London in January 1964 theGerman Federal Chancellor, Dr. Erhard, had spoken in terms ofDM250 million (about  22 million) a year as the prospective figure for defence payments to meet our stationing costs over the two years ahead; and the German authorities had now formally confirmedthis as the basis for the proposed negotiations, although they had proposed no specific level of defence contracts or civil payments.This offer by the German Government fell far short of the sum required to offset the cost of stationing our forces in Germany, whichhad now risen from about  70 million a year to an estimated 85 million for 1964-65. It might be unrealistic to expect the GermanGovernment to maintain their payments at the level of DM600 million a year; and we could probably be content with a figure ofDM450 million ( 40 million) a year for the next two-year period.Even so, a settlement on these terms would be less favourable thanthe agreement between the Federal Republic and the United States,under which the Federal Government had undertaken to offsetentirely the foreign exchange costs of the United States forces inGermany by purchases of United States arms. Moreover, while therewere indications that Dr. Dahlgruen, if pressed, would be preparedStationingCosts inGermanyas regards the privileged status which it accorded to the roman catholic Church. In this respect at least the constitution advocated byMr. Mintoff was not open to objection and could be argued to be broadly in line with our own.(c) Even if it were decided in principle to grant independence to Malta, the discussions on the form of the constitution, on theprovisions of a defence agreement and on the future financialrelationship between the Island and the United Kingdom might wellbe protracted; and the economic importance to Malta of our baseon the Island might provide a means of inducing the maltese government to conclude a defence agreement on reasonably satisfactory lines. On the other hand, once we had accepted theindependence of the Island in principle, we could not delay itsimplementation for any length of time without provoking serious political repercussions and thereby jeopardising our own interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to give further thought to the issues involved inthe light of a more detailed study of the results of the recentreferendum and of the implications for our defence interests of adecision either to grant or to refuse independence to Malta.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Defence, to give further consideration to the resultsof the recent referendum in Malta and to the implications for United Kingdom interests of a decision either to grantor to refuse independence to the Island.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
to make a substantial improvement on the figure of DM250 million a year, it was not certain that he would offer an alternative figure which would be acceptable to us.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador at Bonn had reported that theFederal Chancellor and his State Secretary, Dr. Westrick, had expressed the view that, if the United Kingdom was in a positionto grant extensive credits to the Soviet bloc, they should be able tomeet a larger proportion of the stationing costs of their forces in theFederal Republic. On the other hand it could fairly be argued thatthe credits in question had been granted in order to promote thetrade which was necessary to improve our balance of payments.(b) It was now generally accepted that an outbreak of war in theEuropean theatre was unlikely. In these circumstances there was little military justification for deploying in Europe so large a proportion of our armed forces at such great expense; and it was for consideration whether our forces in Germany might be reducedto some extent. On the other hand, although a reduction of this kindmight result in considerable savings of foreign exchange, theredeployment of the troops concerned might involve heavy expenditure on the reprovision of accommodation and facilities inthe United Kingdom. This question required further examination.(c) Any approach to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation(NATO) to negotiate a further reduction in our forces in germany would have serious implications in terms of our relations with otherNATO countries; and it would be politically undesirable to take any steps at this juncture which would be likely to lead to a public controversy on this issue. Moreover, the Federal Government were well aware that failure to agree on a satisfactory arrangement foroffsetting the cost of our forces in Germany might eventually compel us to reduce their strength; and any threat to restrict the building programme for our forces in Germany pending a satisfactoryoutcome of the financial negotiations would be unlikely to exertadditional influence on the Federal Government and might well havea damaging effect on the morale of the troops. It should be made clear to the German authorities, however, that, if a satisfactoryfinancial arrangement could not be reached, we should need to reserve our position about the manner in which we should best dealwith the problem of the balance of payments implications ofmaintaining forces in Germany.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, in his negotiations with the German Minister of Finance, the chief secretary should certainly press for satisfactory arrangements tomeet the stationing costs of our forces in Germany, while avoidingat this stage any public controversy on the issue. If, however, it proved impossible to obtain a reasonable settlement, the cabinet should reconsider the situation.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of CP. (64) 92.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to be guided by their discussion during his forthcoming negotiations with theFederal German Government.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theDefence and Oversea Policy (Official) Committee toconsider, in relation to our strategic policy in Europe, therelative costs of maintaining our present level of forcesin Germany and of transferring a substantial number ofthem to the United Kingdom.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
Fishery Limits(previous reference:C.C. (63) 26thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before thern^ memoranda by the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General (C.F. (64) 93 and 95 respectively)about United Kingdom fishery limits, together with a Note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (CP. (64) 94) to which was appended thedraft of a Bill on this subject.The Lord Chancellor said that the Bill had been drafted in orderto extend our fishery limits in conformity with the recent EuropeanFisheries Convention. For this purpose it provided that those limitsshould be extended to 12 miles from specified base-lines, this distancebeing divided into two zones, each of 6 miles, in the first of whichwe should claim exclusive fishery rights and in the second the rightto regulate fishing by other countries. There would be considerable advantage in bringing the new limits into force as soon as possible;and, since we could not do so until we had ratified the convention and ratification was itself dependent upon the enactment of thenecessary legislation, it was desirable to introduce the Bill with theminimum of delay. No change was proposed in the limits of UnitedKingdom territorial waters, which would remain at 3 miles. it followed that, if the Bill was introduced in its present form, it couldbe argued that, in so far as we should be assuming the right unilaterallyto enforce the new fishery limits against any country, we might be in breach of international law in relation to the vessels of countrieswhich had not adhered to the Convention, (particularly the soviet union, Poland and Norway) but continued to seek to fish within our new limits. This view derived some support from the fact that the1958 Convention on the High Seas, which we had signed and ratified,did not recognise fishery limits extending beyond the territorial sea and permitted an unrestricted right of fishing outside the limits of territorial waters. On the other hand international law had graduallychanged since the 1958 Convention had been adopted; and many countries had now established fishery limits extending beyond thelimits of their territorial waters. It should therefore be possible forus to contend that we were not in breach of international law by maintaining that, even if we had implicitly extended our territorial sea to 12 miles, we had done so only for purposes of fisheryjurisdiction and that the limits within which we should seek toexercise the rights appropriate to territorial waters would remain unchanged. A recent judgment of the International Court in relationto the extension of Norwegian fishery limits suggested that this contention should prevail. On balance, therefore, the wisest coursewould be to enact the Bill in its present form, while seeking, at thesame time, to persuade the Governments of the Soviet Union, poland and Norway to acquiesce in its provisions.The Attorney-General maintained that, in so far as the bill would extend our exclusive fishery limits to 12 miles (i.e., beyondthe area specified by the recent Convention) and would purport toconfer on us a unilateral right to enforce those limits not only againstcountries party to the Convention but against the whole world, itwould go beyond a mere implementation of the Convention; and, ifwe were challenged on its validity in relation to international law,we should be bound to admit that its enforcement could be justifiedonly on the basis that it involved an extension of the territorial sea,to which we had hitherto seen considerable objection on grounds ofinternational policy and strategic interest.In discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable to redraft the Bill in such a form as to provide for the extension of ourfishery limits only (a) by agreement or (b) in relation to any other states which applied similar limits against us on a basis of reciprocityor (c) on any other grounds recognised by international law. Thiscourse need involve no delay as regards either the introduction of theBill or the implementation of the new limits; it would have theadvantage of excluding the Soviet Union and Norway by referenceto the criterion of reciprocity; and it would be clearly in conformity
with international law. On the other hand the criterion of reciprocitywould permit countries such as Japan and Israel, which were notparty to the recent Convention, to fish in our waters; and publicopinion would be reluctant to accept this situation as a reasonableoutcome of an initiative which we had taken in order to establish newfishery limits on a non-discriminatory basis. Moreover, many countries now maintained fishery limits extending beyond theirterritorial waters; and, although this might be inconsistent with international law, recent practice had endorsed the inconsistency.It was possible to exaggerate the strategic implications of an impliedextension of the territorial sea; and here, too, such theoretical case as might have formerly existed had by now largely gone by default.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in introducing the Bill in itspresent form and accepting the risk that its provisions might eventually be challenged before the International Court. We should seek to enact the Bill during the current session; but its introductionshould be deferred for as long as was consistent with this objective in an attempt to secure, before it was introduced, the acquiescence ofthe Soviet Union, Norway and Poland in its provisions.The Cabinet Agreed that the Bill on United Kingdom fishery limitsshould be introduced in the House of Commons in the formof the draft appended to CP. (64) 94, subject to the points made by the Prime Minister in his summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.J,7th May, 1964.
