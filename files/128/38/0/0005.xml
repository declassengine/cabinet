Foreign AffairsIraq(previous reference:C.C. (63) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)Tribunals of 2.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the inquiry Home   Secretary   and   the   Secretary   of   State   for   Scotland(Previous (CP. (63) 11) on the Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.Reference:C.C. (63) 36th The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the CabinefsConclusions, earlier discussion on this subject, he had held further discussionsMinute 4) with the Ministers principally concerned on the desirability of instituting some form of review of the procedures adopted bytribunals appointed under the Act of 1921. It appeared clear thatthe inquisitorial method of inquiry by a tribunal must be retained for use in cases in which the public interest required some matterof importance to be impartially investigated by a body having thenecessary powers; and the modifications which had already beenmade in the procedures adopted by such tribunals had met mostof the main criticisms which had hitherto been advanced in thisconnection. It appeared unnecessary, therefore, for the Governmentto take any initiative to amend the Act; nor did it appear likely that there would be any practical advantage in constituting a review of its operation. Even so, however, public disquiet aboutthe procedures adopted under the Act might be thought to makeit politically desirable to institute some inquiry into its working.If so, such an inquiry should be entrusted to a Royal Commission.In discussion there was general agreement on the importanceof allaying, so far as possible, the continuing public anxiety aboutthe manner in which inquiries established under the Act of 1921were conducted. On the other hand the authority of the Governmentwould be liable to be diminished if they appeared to endorse the growing practice of remitting to independent examination issues which they might be expected to determine themselves. Moreover,careful examination had suggested that there was little scope for improvement in the operation of the Act of 1921, since most ofthe criticisms which could still be advanced against it related tofeatures of its working which were inseparable from the purposes for which it had been enacted. The most valid of these criticismsderived from the fact that, since a tribunal appointed under theAct was required to hold its hearings in public so far as possible,innocent persons might suffer damage to their reputations as theresult of allegations made against them and reported in the Press,which could only be shown to be unfounded when the tribunaleventually reported. This was regrettable; but it appeared to be unavoidable in the light of the fact that the public interest requiredthat the hearings by a body so exceptional as a tribunal constituted under the Act of 1921 should continue to be in public.In these circumstances the wisest course might be to arrange a debate in the House of Lords, in which the issues involved wouldbe open for discussion by senior members of the Judiciary and itmight become clear, as a result, that there would be little advantage in an independent inquiry into the operation of the Act. If sucha debate were held before the House of Commons considered theReport of Lord Denning&apos;s inquiry into allegations arising fromSECRET4006-2 a 21. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that thefactional dispute which had broken out within the Governmentof Iraq appeared to be continuing and that the situation remainedprecarious. This reinforced the need for a continuing UnitedKingdom r,JIitary presence in the Middle East, if our interests in kuwait were not to be endangered.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
the resignation of the former Secretary of State for War,Mr. Profumo, it might be possible to satisfy the House of Commons,during their debate on that Report, that no further action was required to amend the Act of 1921 or substantially to modify the procedures adopted by tribunals appointed under that Act. Thiswould not preclude the Government from undertaking to consider any suggestions for improvement which might be made during bothdebates.The Cabinet Invited the Leader of the House of Lords, in consultationwith the Lord Chancellor, to consider, in the light of their discussion, the possibility of arranging a debate in theHouse of Lords at an early date on the operation of the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.The Corbett 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theReport on the Minister of Aviation (CP. (63) 14) on the financial problems of theOrganisation    British Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) and its futureJ^fn^e    organisation and management,of B.O.A.C. c ^(Previous The Minister of Aviation said that B.O.A.C.&apos;s accumulatedReference:       deficit would probably rise by the end of the financial year to aC.C. (61) 45th total of nearly  100 million. A detailed study of the causes of this conclusions.    deficit had now been concluded, based partly on a report by a minute 5)       leading accountant, Mr. John Corbett. This study showed that about  half  of the deficit could  be  attributed  to  misfortune,particularly the disaster to the Comet I, and about half to badmanagement. In these circumstances he proposed:(i) To publish the draft White Paper attached to his memorandum. He had already explained in Parliament that itwould not be possible to publish the Corbett Report itself, since it had been commissioned on the basis that it would remainconfidential and much of the information contained in it had beenobtained on this understanding. The draft White Paper did notpurport, therefore, to be in any sense a summary of the CorbettReport; it was the Governments own analysis of B.O.A.C.&apos;s deficit.Mr. Corbett, however, had seen the text and, subject to one ortwo amendments v/hich had now been incorporated, had said thathe was satisfied with it.(ii) To make a statement in Parliament, simultaneously withthe publication of the White Paper, describing the changes in themanagement of B.O.A.C. which the Government proposed,including the retirement of Sir Matthew Slattery and Sir BasilSmallpeice from the posts of Chairman and Managing Directorrespectively and the appointment of Sir Giles Guthrie as Chairman.(iii) To announce in the same statement that the newmanagement of the Corporation would be invited to prepare,during the coming year, a plan for making the Corporationfinancially sound. This plan would be based on a directive to theBoard, of which a draft was appended as Annex A to CP. (63) 14.(iv) To introduce legislation to extend the powers under theAir Corporation Act, 1962, to make loans to B.O.A.C. for thepurpose of financing deficits, on the understanding that thequestion of writing off the accumulated deficit would be forconsideration when the Board&apos;s plan for the reorganisation of theCorporation^ activities was available.In. discussion the following main points were made:(a) There would be considerable objection to publishing theCorbett Report, particularly as regards the probable effect on the reputation and standing of the United Kingdom aircraft industry.
PensionsEarnings Rulefor Widows&apos;Pensions(previous reference:C.C. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (63) 13) on the earnings rulefor widows&apos; pensions.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Governmentwould be under pressure in the coming Session to abolish the ruleby which widowed mothers&apos; allowances, together with retirementand widows&apos; pensions, were reduced where earnings exceededcertain levels, particularly since a Bill to abolish the earnings ruleOn the other hand its contents were bound to become known indue course; and, since it could be argued that it showed the actions of both the Government and B.O.A.C. in a less favourable lightthan the draft White Paper, the Government would be open to thecharge that the White Paper had adapted Mr. corbetts text totheir own advantage. The difficulty in this respect would beincreased if the Opposition asked to be permitted to read the full report, even if only on a confidential basis.(b) Although it was clearly indicated in the draft White paper that it was not in any sense merely an expurgated version of theCorbett Report but consisted of the Governments own examinationof the issues involved, it was in fact based largely on Mr. Corbettsanalysis. The Government would therefore be in a more defensibleposition in maintaining their refusal to publish the Report if theirown White Paper adopted a wholly different approach. a considerably shorter document, confined to a statement of theCorporation^ deficit, an explanation of the reasons for it and some reference to the remedial measures proposed, would not be opento the charge of being a partial and selective reproduction of theReport and should suffice as the basis for a Parliamentary debate in which the Government could elaborate in greater detail theirattitude towards the issues involved.(c) On this assumption the publication of the White paper should, if possible, be linked with the introduction of the legislation to renew and to increase the powers of the Minister of Aviationto make loans to the Air Corporations for the financing of deficitson revenue account. If so, however, the White Paper should include an adequate explanation of the very large deficit which B.O.A.C.had now accumulated.(d) Sir Matthew Slattery and Sir Basil Smallpeice had notyet been shown the Corbett Report. It was for consideration whether the Government might be spared subsequentembarrassment if, when the White Paper had been revised, it wasmade available to them, together with a copy of the Report.(e) Meanwhile, it would be preferable that their retirementfrom the Board of B.O.A..C. should not become public knowledgeuntil a revised text of the White Paper was ready for publication.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to arrange, as a matter of urgency,for the White Paper on the finances and management of B.O.A.C. to be redrafted on the lines indicated intheir discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to defer for the timebeing the final negotiation with Sir Matthew Slatteryand Sir Basil Smallpeice of the terms of their retirementfrom the Board of B.O.A.C.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of the issues arisingfrom CP. (63) 14 at an early meeting.
for widows might be introduced by a Private Member. It couldbe argued that the Governments wisest course in thesecircumstances would be to introduce, at an annual cost of li million, a measure of their own, confined to widowed mothersas the category commanding most sympathy. This proposal,however, was open to the objections that the abolition of the earnings rule, even for this limited class, would be inconsistent with a fundamental principle of the Beveridge scheme; that therewere no tenable grounds for abolishing the rule in relation towidowed mothers and retaining it in relation to other widows andto retirement pensioners; and that it would be inconsistent both with the Governments policy of selective benefits and with theadvice of the National Insurance Advisory Committee to abolish the earnings rule for the benefit of some 15,000 widowed mothersmany of whom were able to earn substantial salaries and wereconsequently less in need than widowed mothers in general. Similararguments applied to relaxing, as distinct from abolishing, the earnings rule; and the Committee on Pensions and national insurance had therefore concluded that the best course was to resist pressure for either abolition or relaxation and to justify this attitudeby following a consistent policy of giving selective benefits to those most in need.In discussion there was general agreement with this view.Some alternative means of helping widowed mothers generally,however, should be sought. This might take the form of anincrease in the amount of the grants paid in respect of the children of widowed mothers. Such an increase would have the advantageof benefiting those v/idows who, bv reason of their family responsibilities, ought to be encouraged to remain at home andwere frequently in greater need than those who took employment.This possibility should be further examined in relation to proposalscurrently under discussion for improving the education maintenancegrants payable by local education authorities in respect of certain categories of children who remained at school after compulsoryschool age.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National insurance to circulate a memorandum on the feasibility of assistingwidowed mothers by increasing the amount of thechildren&apos;s allowance.(2) Took note that the Minister of Education would circulateproposals in relation to the education maintenanceallowance payable by local education authorities.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion in the light of the memoranda circulated in pursuance of Conclusions (1)and (2).The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury, (C. (63) 160) on public service pensions.The Minister of Defence said that pressure for the improvementof service pensions was now concentrated on the position of the widows of officers who had died before 4th November, 1958. As aresult of the Grigg Report the widows of officers who had diedafter that date received one-third of their husbands&apos; pensions,whereas widows bereaved before that date received a lowerproportion of a pension which itself was at a lower rate. It was not suggested, as regards the latter category, that the basic rate of the pension should be increased but simolv that the proportion of the pension payable to the widow should be raised to one-third. Therewas no reason to think that, if this limited concession were made,there would necessarily be repercussions elsewhere in the publicPublic service pensions(previous reference:C.C. (63) 57thConclusions.Minute 6)
Hill Cow 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSubsidy Minister of Agriculture (CP. (63) 9) about the hill cow subsidy.(Previous .Reference: The Minister of Agriculture said that, in the light of theC.C. (63) 56th Cabinefs earlier discussion, he had considered whether payment of conclusions. this subsidy could be continued after the end of 1964 or whether,Minute 5) alternatively, the conditions of eligibility could be so redefined asto preserve the entitlement of a reasonable number of farmers,while excluding those who, in the light of a recent survey, were clearly no longer eligible to receive the subsidy. It would be neitherright nor justifiable on grounds of agricultural policy to continuepayments after 1964 to those farmers who had finally to be excludedfrom the scheme. As regards eligibility, however, some 600 of the1,700 farmers in question were in areas which, although notconsisting &quot; predominantly of mountains, hills or heath&quot;,nevertheless appeared to be substantially suitable only for livestockrearing; and it would be appropriate, therefore, to schedule the cm. 5 (63)service or, in particular, that a concession to persons already entitledto pension would provoke claims from those who had never had any such entitlement at all.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that Government spokesmenhad stated on more than one occasion in Parliament that therewas no basis on which the pre-Grigg widows could be distinguished from other categories of existing pensioners and that a concession in their favour could not be justified unless other public service pensions were reconsidered at the same time. The proposed concession to the pre-Grigg widows would therefore expose theGovernment to virtually irresistible pressure from other publicservice pensioners, particularly retir-H officers and the widows ofcivil servants who had died before 1949. Moreover, if it was conceded that it was a hardship that an arbitrary date should determine whether an officers widow received a greater or smallerpension, it would be forcibly argued that it was a greater hardshipthat an arbitrary date should determine, as it did in the case of the widows of many other ranks, whether a widow received any pension at all. On merit there was no case for giving further assistanceto the pre-Grigg widows, who had already received, under thelatest Pensions (Increase) Act, not only a generous percentage increase in their pensions but also a lump sum addition which hadbeen specifically intended to help the older widows who composedthe greater part of this group.In discussion it was suggested that demands for consequentialconcessions to other public service pensioners might not be so great as was feared. It was widely recognised that the pre-Grigg widowsconstituted a special class, whose claims were unrelated to thedemands for parity in the case of officers&apos; pensions; and it was unlikely that claims would be pressed on behalf of pre-Griggwidows of other ranks. On the other hand there could be no guarantee that a concession to the pre-Grigg widows would not bemade the justification for claims short of parity for officers whosepensions were similarly determined by an arbitrary date. Moreover,there was a considerable risk that the Government would be criticised, on political grounds, for discriminating between officersand other ranks; and it would be difficult to justify making a concession to a particular group of widows in the face of the greaterneeds of other classes of the population.The Cabinet (4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
rural districts and parishes concerned and to pay subsidy on any land within the scheduled areas which at present attracted subsidyand appeared, on inspection, to be capable only of sustaining therearing of livestock. This arrangement, coupled with the continuation of subsidy during 1964 even to those farmers who would eventuallylose it on the ground that their land was too good to qualify, wouldappear to be a reasonable settlement.In discussion there was considerable support for this view.On the other hand an immediate announcement of a decision onthese lines would be liable to be badly received in Scotland, wherefarmers were already disturbed by the current review of theconditions of entitlement to financial assistance under the &quot; winterkeep &quot; scheme and would be likely to react even more sharply ifthey thought that the scope of the hill cow subsidy in Scotland might also be reduced by analogy with the reductions south of the Border.It might be desirable, therefore, that any announcement about the curtailment of the hill cow subsidy in England and Wales shouldbe deferred for a short time.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to submit to the PrimeMinister the terms in which it might be announced thatcertain farmers in England and Wales would no longer be eligible for the hill cow subsidy after 1964.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State forScotland, would give further consideration to the issues raised by CP.
