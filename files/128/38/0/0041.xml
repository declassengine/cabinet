Foreign 2.   The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) said thatAffairs there were some indications that, although the Greek GovernmentCyprus might continue to advocate that a solution of the problem of Cyprus(Previous        should be based on the creation of a unitary state, they were becomingReference:       increasingly apprehensive that a settlement of this kind might exposeCM.

(64) 26thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that, in the lightof recent developments in connection with the suppression of thetribal revolt in the Radian area of the Federation of South Arabia,it had been decided that the Colonial Secretary should assess thesituation by a personal visit to the Federation. In two telegrams whichhad subsequently been received from the High Commissioner in Aden(Soslon 52 and 53) the Colonial Secretary had put forward proposalsfor the constitutional development of the Federation and for theintensification of the military measures against the rebel tribesmen.As regards the former he had undertaken, in response torepresentations from Ministers in both the Federal Government andthe Government of Aden, that the constitutional discussions whichhad been projected in December 1963 but had been postponed as theresult of an outbreak of violence in Aden should be resumed in June.As regards the latter he had emphasised that, if we were to dissuadetribesmen in the Federation from harbouring the agitators who werecovertly entering Federal territory from the Yemen in order topromote disaffection in the Radfan area, there was no alternative toemploying air proscription for this purpose. He therefore suggestedthat warning leaflets should now be dropped in the areas concerned,requiring the Radfani rebels to make submission to the federation government and to give guarantees of future loyalty, and that, if the tribesmen did not comply with these requirements, attacks should be delivered by aerial gunfire on livestock and men outside the villagesin the area.In discussion there was general agreement that it would benecessary to consider carefully, in the light of the Colonial Secretary&apos;sassessment of the political situation in the Federation, the further measures of constitutional advance in both the Federation and Adenwhich we might be able realistically to propose during the discussions to be held in June.In further discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom of embarking on a policy of proscription on the lines recommendedParliament i.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week after the Whitsun recess.
investment programme(previous reference:CM. (64) 21stConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onthe investment programme:(a) Public Service Investment 1965-66(i) CP. (64) 96: memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury.(ii) CP. (64) 100: memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer.(b) Housing Programme(i) CP. (64) 97:   memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government(ii) CP. (64) 10! : memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.(c) Capital Finances for the UniversitiesCP. (64) 98: memorandum by the Home Secretary.(d) Major Defence Works(i) CP. (64) 84: memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Defence and the Minister of Public building and Works.(ii) CP. (64) 87: memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury.(iii) CP. (64) 99: memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Defence.by the Colonial Secretary. It had clearly been necessary to authoriseair attacks in direct support of the United Kingdom troops who were engaged in repressing the revolt in the Radfan area; but it was morearguable whether we should extend the scope of these operations tocomprise intimidation of tribesmen who, although prepared toharbour the rebels, might not themselves be actively participating inthe revolt. The objections to this course were the stronger in that there could be no guarantee that women and children, as well as men, mightnot be injured or killed. On the other hand, if we were not to find ourselves involved in a protracted campaign which might require veryconsiderable reinforcements of ground troops before it could be concluded, it was essential to inhibit the local tribesmen fromprotecting and assisting the rebels. The balance of advantage thereforeprobably inclined in favour of adopting air proscription for thispurpose, provided that the targets were confined to livestock andcrops, at least until the Colonial Secretary had returned and theCabinet had had an opportunity to consider the situation in the lightof his report. In addition tribesmen who attacked our aircraft withground fire, together with concentrations of rebel tribesmen in thegeneral Radfan area, would constitute permissible targets.In order to try to anticipate misrepresentation of our policy inthe matter the scope and purpose of the action to be taken shouldbe presented to the Press and to public opinion, both in Aden and inthe United Kingdom, with particular care.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the colonial secretary in Aden of their views about the scale and natureof the measures of air proscription to be adopted inconnection with the suppression of the revolt in the Radfanarea of the Federation of South Arabia.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to seek toensure the most favourable public presentation of these measures.m
The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, on the basis of the forecasts available in January 1964, public service investment hadbeen expected to rise between 1964-65 and 1965-66 (at constant prices) by  95 million, from  1,275 million to  1,370 million. officials had been instructed to consider ways of restraining this increase andhad proposed the creation of a reserve of investment projectsamounting to slightly less than  30 million. The revised forecastswhich had subsequently become available, however, indicated thatthe total investment for 1965-66 was now expected to be  1,535million, of which  88 million was attributable to price increases and 77 million reflected an increase in real terms. In the light of thesefigures and of the continuing pressure on the economy it had become essential to reach an immediate decision that public investment in1965-66 should be held at  1,440 million, the level (at 1964 prices)envisaged by the original proposals to create a reserve of  30 million.The alternative to a planned reduction in the rate of increase in public investment was unplanned failure to achieve the Governmentsobjectives as a result of the further increases in costs which wouldbe provoked by overloading the construction industry.The proposed reduction would necessitate holding the numberof new houses approved for public authorities in England and wales to 116,000 against the 125,000 now forecast, thus saving  13-J million.The Scottish housing programme had risen from an estimated 72 million at the beginning of the year to  96 million; and a further 18 million should be saved by reducing this figure to  78 million,allowing only for the increase attributable to rising prices. Theseproposals would not jeopardise the Governments policy of achievingan annual rate of 400,000 houses a year by the late sixties. proposals to reduce the increase in expenditure on university building wereindicated in the memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. (64) 98).Reductions elsewhere, as indicated in detail in the Annex toE.P. (64) 62, would account for a further  27 million. It would alsobe necessary to hold the increased expenditure on major defenceworks in the United Kingdom at a level (excluding provision of married quarters) not more than 5 per cent above that of 1964-65.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, inorder to meet the minimum need for local authority housing, it wouldbe necessary to approve 125.000 starts this year. Continued prioritywould have to be given to certain authorities in order to secure the rehabilitation of the industrial north, to ensure the clearance of the worst slums and to meet the pressing needs of Wales and London.Elsewhere authorities were already restricted in the number of housesthey could build, even for the acknowledged needs of theovercrowded, the homeless and the old. Almost the whole of theexpansion in recent years had been directed to the priority areas;and, if these were not to be held back, the reduction proposed bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury, could not be achieved unless starts inother areas were cut by as much as 30 per cent of the figure for 1963.This could not be done without exposing the Government tostrenuous public criticism from the local authorities in question andby reducing confidence in the expansion of the public housing programme. It would also jeopardise the progress which was beingmade towards greater efficiency by the development of local authoritybuilding consortia and by the encouragement of the use of industrial building techniques.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a reduction of theScottish public housing programme by  18 million would not onlyfall with a disproportionate severity on Scotland but would alsonecessitate immediate overt action, including the institution, for thefirst time since the Government took office, of a system of allocation to control the numbers of houses started by local authorities. drastic action of this kind could hardly be justified in the face of the need
for development in central Scotland, the heavy concentration of slumsin Glasgow and elsewhere and the fact that in Scotland the buildingindustry was not under pressure.The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had invited him toexamine, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, the proposalsfor capital investment submitted by the University Grants Committee(U.G.C.) with a view to reducing the cost of providing additionaluniversity places to the minimum necessary to implement theGovernments undertaking to make available the resources requiredto give effect to the recommendations of the Committee on higher education (the Robbins Committee) on the expansion of universities and similar institutions. The U.G.C. had proposed that the investment programme for the universities (which had already been increased from  33-1 million to  48-1- million in 1964) should be increased in1965 to  5S-J- million and had said that, if resources were not provided on this scale, the objective of creating 170,000 university places by1967-68 would not be attained. It seemed possible, however, that theU.G.C. would be willing to accept, as a compromise, a total provisionof  54-^- million, spread over 1965 and the first quarter of 1966, theprogramme thereafter being related to financial, instead of calendar,years; and it was proposed that, in order to ensure that the universitiesobtained full value for the money invested in building, the organisationof the U.G.C. should be strengthened and that they should be urged to apply techniques which would put the least strain on theconstruction industries.The Minister of Defence for the Army said that, since expenditureon work arising out of international commitments clearly could notbe reduced, a limitation of expenditure on other defence works inthe United Kingdom to a 5 per cent increase in 1965-66 would mean that a heavier percentage reduction would fall on other work, inparticular the provision of married quarters and new barrackaccommodation. On the other hand it was a corollary of the recent decision to limit the number of service families accommodatedoverseas that the provision of accommodation at home should not be restricted. Against this background the proposed reduction in theprogramme would have an adverse effect on service morale whollyout of proportion to the relief which could accrue to the construction industry and would be liable to expose the Government to severe criticism from their own supporters. In these circumstances the best course seemed to be to postpone a decision on defence works untilthe results of the long-term defence costings were available.In discussion it was argued that it was essential to restrain theexpansion of public investment in 1965-66 in order to avoidaggravating the adverse balance of payments which would probablydevelop in the next two years. Moreover, it would be necessary to reinforce the restraint in the public sector by urging the need for similar moderation on the Chairmen of the Boards of the nationalised industries. On the other hand there was a risk, which must be avoided, of creating the impression, by measures which would inevitably become known to the public, that the Government wereonce more resorting to a policy of &quot; stop and go&quot;. Any suchimpression would jeopardise the success of the positive measureswhich were being taken, through the National Building Agency andby means of consultation with the undertakings concerned, to increasethe production of materials for which demand was high and toencourage the use of modern building techniques which did notimpose heavy demands on scarce resources either of men or ofmaterials. In addition the Government would be exposed to severe criticism if they sought to curtail public housing programmes in the face of the expansion of private house-building or to imposerelatively minor reductions in expenditure on hospitals in view ofthe fact, which was becoming widely known, that it would beimpossible to complete the 10-year hospital programme announced in the previous year within that period.
On the other-hand the policy of restraint could be presentedpositively as an endeavour to ensure that the public building programme was achieved in the most efficient and economicalmanner. The onus should be put on local authorities, universities andothers to avoid making unnecessary demands on scarce resources by seeking the assistance of the National Building Agency andemploying industrialised building techniques. Those who failed to doso would attract criticism to themselves if they were in consequenceunable to achieve their building objectives. In the field of public housing local authorities whose programmes appeared to be undulycostly were already being pressed to consult the National BuildingAgency; and by this and other means delays were being imposedwhich should reduce the number of starts in 1965 to rather less than125,000. Little more could be achieved by this means; but everything possible should be done, short of measures which would evoke public criticism, to keep the total below that figure.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, inview of the public interest in housing, health and education, it wouldbe unwise to press the Ministers concerned to reduce their programmes more drastically than they believed to be practicablewithout attracting public criticism. The Minister of Housing should endeavour, by administrative means and by maintaining pressure on local authorities to employ modern building techniques, to hold thestarts for 1965 at a level as little as possible above 120,000; theSecretary of State for Scotland should discuss the Scottish housing programme further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer; and, in authorising the expenditure on university buildings proposed in cp. (64) 98, the Secretary of State for Education and Science shouldtake steps to ensure that the universities were encouraged to obtainthe best value for their investment. In view of the absence of theSecretary of State for Defence it would be necessary to considerexpenditure on major defence works in the United Kingdom on another occasion. The remaining Departments, with the exception ofthe Ministry of Health as regards the hospital programme, should now take steps to give effect to the proposed reductions in their programmes; and further consideration should be given by theMinisters principally concerned to the most appropriate means of presenting the Governments policy as a positive approach to theproblems of the construction industry, designed to secure themaximum value for the public money invested, and of bringing pressure to bear on the industry to create an impulse towardsmodernisation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that restraint in the expansion of the public investment programme should be sought on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider further,in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Public Building and Works and other ministers principally concerned, the most appropriate means of presenting the Governments policy as a positiveendeavour to promote efficiency in the execution of thepublic building programme.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Education and Science toinform the University Grants Committee of theGovernments decision on university building on thelines indicated in CP. (64) 98 and to announce thisdecision by means of a written reply to a parliamentary question.(4) Agreed to defer their discussion of major defence works.
The kennedy round(previous reference:CM. (64) 25thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Secretary of State for Industry said that the inauguralmeeting of the Kennedy Round on tariff negotiations had been held the previous week in Geneva. The meeting had proved to be premature in the light of the slow progress which had been made inthe preliminary discussions on rules for the negotiations and of the major differences between the parties on agricultural policies.Moreover, the attitude of the United States Government towardsthe European Economic Community (E.E.C.) had been unsatisfactory.In earlier discussions in Washington they had indicated that theywould not seek to put undue pressure on the Community in the initiaistages of the negotiations in the Kennedy Round; but this understanding had not been fully reflected in the attitude of theirrepresentatives at Geneva. Their pressure had been ineffective,however, in the face of French opposition, which had compelled themto agree that the negotiations should proceed on &quot; a workinghypothesis &quot; of a 50 per cent reduction in tariffs instead of &quot; on thebasis of &quot; a 50 per cent reduction, as they would have preferred. Inaddition they had had to acquiesce in an arrangement whereby theproposals of individual countries for exceptions from the 50 per cent reduction were required to be published by 10th September, althoughit was widely known that, for political reasons connected with theforthcoming Presidential election, they would not be able to publishtheir own proposals until November. As a result the negotiations inthe interim would have to concentrate on non-tariff barriers to tradeand on agricultural policies.The French attitude derived largely from the resentment of theFrench Government at the manner in which they had been overborneby the United States Government in initial discussions on the kennedy Round a year ago, at a time when the E.E.C. had still 1?eenweakened by internal differences on the issue of United kingdom membership. It was clear, however, that the Community had nowregained its unity and cohesion and that the French Government hadre-established their ascendancy over the other members. In thesecircumstances it might be unwise for us, in the further negotiations in the Kennedy Round, to continue to base our policy solely on theneed to preserve our alignment with the United States Government;we should feel free, as between the United States and the E.E.C., to consult our own interests.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Secretary of State for industry.United nations conference on trade andDevelopment6. The Secretary of State for Industry said that at the united nations Conference on Trade and Development the United Kingdomspokesmen had taken the lead among the developed countries inputting forward constructive proposals on which agreement might bereached with the developing countries, despite their more extremeexpectations. They had also supported the United states representatives in recommending arrangements in the intervalsbetween conferences which might avert the pressure for theestablishment of a new international organisation. Although theconference was due to end in the second week in June, a period of intensive discussion appeared to lie ahead and it was still difficult to predict the outcome.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Secretary of State for industry.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th May, 1964.
