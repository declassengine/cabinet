Foreign AffairsCyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 1stConclusionsEuropeanEconomicCommunity(previous reference:CM. (63) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped to create afavourable atmosphere for the opening session of the CyprusConference on 15th January by preliminary and informal discussions with the Foreign Ministers of Greece and Turkey, who would arrive in London shortly before the conference began. Meanwhile,negotiations for the despatch to Cyprus of a representative of theSecretary-General of the United Nations were making satisfactory progress. It would be liable to be more difficult, however, to makea similar arrangement in relation to the London conference, in viewof the probable objections of the Turkish Government to anyparticipation by the United Nations on that occasion. It would benecessary to weigh those objections against the importance ofdivesting ourselves, if possible, of sole responsibility for solving theproblem of the Island. There was little prospect of obtaining any effective assistance from the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation inthis context.The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal German Chancellor,Dr. Erhard, had recently reaffirmed to the President of the UnitedStates the determination of the Federal Government to make a constructive contribution to the forthcoming Kennedy Round ontariff reductions in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.There was reason to believe, however, that the French Governmentwould seek to prejudice the success of these negotiations by divertingattention to the United Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment, which would take place in Geneva before the openingof the Kennedy Round itself. The Cabinet would shortly need to give further consideration to these issues, in view of their bearing on our future relationship with the European Economic Community.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary.Indonesia(previous reference:CM. (63) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (64) 5) on policy towards Indonesia.The Foreign Secretary said that the Minister of Defence had agreed with the Prime Minister of Malaysia, during his visit to theFar East, that for the time being no overt action should be taken against Indonesian forces in Sabah and Sarawak. It was clear,however, that the Prime Minister of Malaysia expected that we would now intensify our efforts to promote a political solution of the differences between Malaysia and Indonesia; and it would benecessary to consider the means by which this would best bearranged, since we could not contemplate the indefinite continuanceof our present military commitment in the Borneo territories.Parliamentary ].   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business        Parliament during the following week.In discussion it was noted that the Leader of the Opposition,Mr. Harold Wilson, M.P., had indicated that he intended to suggest,during the forthcoming Parliamentary debate on defence, thatconfidential discussions on defence policy might be arranged betweenthe Government and the Opposition. There was general agreement that it would be appropriate that the Prime Minister, in replying toMr. Wilson, should not reject this suggestion but should point outthe objections which had been raised to similar proposals in the past.
Widows&apos;Pensions(previous reference:CM. (63) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance (CP. (64) 4) about theproposal that the National Insurance increases for widows&apos; children,which the Cabinet had approved on 9th December, 1963, should be disregarded in the calculation of National Assistance payments.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that further consideration had shown that this proposal was open to several objections. In the first place, it would have the effect ofmaintaining at about the present level the number of widowed mothers on National Assistance; and this would be a reversal of previous policy, under which successive special increases for widowed mothers had not been accompanied by increases in national assistance payments, with the result that the numbers on national assistance had tended to fall. Second, the proposal would constitute the first disregard of any part of an ordinary National insurance benefit and would therefore call in question the principle that assistance payments were intended to supplement insurancepayments only in those cases where the latter would otherwise be inadequate to avoid hardship. Once this principle had been abandoned it would be very difficult to resist the extension ofdisregards. Third, the disregard would require National AssistanceBoards to differentiate between widowed mothers and other classesof lone women with children, e.g., those who had been deserted bytheir husbands or were unmarried. For all these reasons it wouldbe preferable that the National Insurance increases now to be givenin respect of widows&apos; children should not be disregarded in the calculation of National Assistance benefits. The number of widowed mothers who, on this assumption, would receive no immediate benefit would be less than on the earlier occasion in 1956 when preferentialbenefits for widowed mothers&apos; children of a similar kind had been introduced without any provision for disregards.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be unwise to base a decision on the earlier decision in 1956. In the interval a livelier public interest had developed in questions of social welfare and the distribution of benefits; and therewould now be liable to be a more critical reaction if 14,000 widowed mothers were denied any net benefit under the Government^proposals. Moreover, the Government could be charged withinconsistency if they refused to abolish the earnings rule, on thegrounds that its abolition would be of advantage only to thosewidowed mothers who were relatively well off, but failed to provideany help for those who were the poorest members of the class.(b) It would not necessarily be a matter for condemnation if thenumber of individuals receiving National Assistance payments werenot reduced. The Government should take credit for the rise in thestandard of living which they had promoted; and it could not beheld against them that individuals who had suffered misfortune intheir personal lives should need to continue to rely on national assistance.The Prime Minister said that the issues involved should beconsidered in greater detail immediately after the return of theMinister of Defence in the following week. Subsequently, the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner in Kuala Lumpur, Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Djakarta and the Commander-in-Chief, Far East,might be recalled for consultation.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
(c) The Government should not be deterred by the risk that thedisregard now in question might become a precedent. The disregardsalready in operation were selective in character and had been designed to give special treatment to special classes, e.g., war widows.They were also partial in that they applied not to the whole of a given benefit but to only a proportion of it. The present proposal was consistent with these criteria and could be defended on thegrounds that the Government wished to extend specially favourable treatment to widowed mothers.The Cabinet Confirmed their decision that the amount of the proposed increases in National Insurance allowances to the children of widowed mothers should be disregarded in the calculation of National Assistance benefits.Rates(previous reference:C.C. (63) 59thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum on rates bythe Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government (CP. (64) 7).The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that in1963-64 the total amount collected in rates would probably represent an increase of more than  80 million over the amount collected in1962-63, which itself had shown a similar increase over the previous year. A further substantial increase was expected in 1964-65, withthe result that the demand on individual ratepayers would be likelyto rise on average by about l\ per cent and in some areas by asmuch as 20 per cent. In those cases where this increase would involvehardship the Rating (Interim Relief) Bill, now before Parliament,would provide relief. But there was little evidence of actual hardship;and the majority of ratepayers appeared to be meeting the demandswith relatively little complaint. There was therefore no case forfurther action until the Committee under Professor R. D. G. Allen,which was examining the impact of rates on householders, had completed its work and the Government had received the resultsof the interdepartmental review of the financial basis of localgovernment, which was currently in progress.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It was doubtful whether action limited to the measures inthe Rating (Interim Relief) Bill would suffice to allay the increasingpublic apprehension about the continuing rise in the level of rates,which was particularly pronounced in residential areas where the householder had to carry the greater part of the burden with little or no assistance from industry.(b) On the other hand any additional Exchequer subvention tothe rates, if applied uniformly throughout the country, would haveto be very substantial indeed if it was to provide significant relief to the average householder; and it would be wholly unjustifiable toincrease taxes in order to ensure an alleviation of a rate liabilitywhich in many cases caused neither hardship nor discontent. Ifrelief was to be provided only where it was needed, therefore, some more discriminatory system would be required; and it was thepurpose of the interdepartmental review to ascertain whether sucha system could be devised.(c) This review would need to examine, among other issues, thedesirability of transferring a greater part of the cost of the education services from rates to taxes. It could be argued, on the one hand,that education was essentially a local service and should remain so and, on the other hand, that it was unreasonable that the increasingly
large sum involved should be financed to as great an extent as atpresent from a source of revenue which, unlike taxes, did not makesufficient allowance for individual circumstances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that,while it might be accepted that any eventual adjustment of thepresent system of rates should be discriminatory in character, it was for consideration whether some immediate action could be taken either in relation to the work of the Committee under thechairmanship of Professor Allen or by means of greater publicity for the interdepartmental review to satisfy public opinion that theGovernment were conscious of the problems involved and were determined to secure a more equitable apportionment of liabilitybetween the ratepayer and the tax payer. It might well be desirablethat a statement to this effect should be made in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and the Minister of housing and Local Government, in consultation with theLord President, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of Education, to give further consideration,on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up, to the issues raised by CP. (64) 7.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th January, 1964.
