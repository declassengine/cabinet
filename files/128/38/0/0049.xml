Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Foreign AffairsSpanish decisionto build UnitedKingdom typewarships(previous reference:CM. (64) 31stConclusions,Minute 2)Italy(previous reference:CC. (60) 59thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that, although the SpanishGovernment had indicated that they no longer wished to pursue their proposal to construct certain frigates in Spain on the basis ofUnited Kingdom designs, they were apparently encounteringdifficulties in attempting to divert this order to other countries andmight well be prepared to leave the matter in abeyance for a furtherinterval if, by so doing, they could hope to revive their originalproject in circumstances in which it might occasion less political controversy in this country.In discussion there was general agreement that, if mattersdeveloped on these lines, it should be of advantage to the UnitedKingdom. On the other hand it would be undesirable that theGovernment should appear to be in any way acting in connivancewith a foreign Government in relation to a matter which mightremain the subject of active Party political discussion in thiscountry in the period immediately before the forthcoming GeneralElection. While there might be no harm, therefore, in our indicatingprivately to the Spanish Government that it would be acceptable tous if they found it possible to refrain from taking any irrevocabledecision for a short period, the initiative in the matter must restclearly with them and any decision to defer action must be seen torepresent a spontaneous gesture on their part.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by the general sense of their discussion in any further exchanges with theSpanish Government about the possible construction in spain of warships to United Kingdom design.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that Signor Moro,the Prime Minister of Italy, whose Government had resigned a fewdays before, had undertaken to seek to form a new Administration.The Congo(previous reference:CM. (64) 34thConclusions,Minute 3)The Foreign Secretary said that M. Tshombe had now been invited to form a new Government in the Congo. It would be forconsideration, in the light of subsequent developments, whether theGovernment should claim at some appropriate moment that this factvindicated their earlier views on the part which might be played byM. Tshombe in the politics of the Congo.Aintree 3.   The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thatRacecourse the owners of Aintree Racecourse had recently decided to sell thecourse for housing development. In his capacity as Minister withspecial responsibility for sport he had subsequently been approached by Crockfords, the London gaming house, who had offered to buy the course, on the basis that they would contribute pound forpound with the Government, and to maintain it in being for racingpurposes provided that the Government would undertake to amend the Betting, Gaming and Lotteries Act, 1963, in such a manner asto make it legal for Crockfords to operate a sweepstake on theGrand National race.
In discussion there was general agreement that this proposal should be rejected. The Government should not be seen to stand inthe way of the provision of new housing which was urgently needed in the Liverpool area; and it would be wrong in principle toundertake the amendment of an Act of Parliament on any groundsother than evidence that the Act itself was unsatisfactory orinadequate.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science,in consultation with other Ministers concerned, to considerthe terms in which Crockfords would most appropriately be informed that the Government were not prepared to entertain their proposal to purchase the Aintree Racecourse.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the recent strikeby the employees of the independent television companies had beenbrought to an end and negotiations for a settlement of the currentwages dispute had been resumed. The outcome was uncertain; butit was not impossible that the employers would concede a more generous wage increase than would be consistent with the government&apos;s incomes policy. If so, it might be necessary for this to be made clear.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Itwas unfortunate that this claim should be engaging public attentionat the same time as the wage claim by the postmen; and any significant disparity between the awards in the two cases might be embarrassing.IndustrialRelationsIndependentTelevisionAuthorityMalta 5.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that his discussions with(Previous the Prime Minister of Malta, Dr. Borg Olivier, about the reference: independence of the Island had now reached a deadlock. ThreeCM. (64) 34th issues were outstanding a financial settlement; a defenceConclusions, agreement; and the constitutional status and privileges of the minute 4) Roman Catholic Church in Malta, with which was linked theamendment of the Island&apos;s electoral law which would be required inorder to prevent the Church from exercising, by the threat ofspiritual sanctions, undue influence during elections. The difficultiesin the way of a financial agreement were not insuperable; and,since we had now succeeded in enlisting the support of the Vaticanauthorities for the amendment of the electoral law which we had inmind, it was possible to hope that this question also might eventually be satisfactorily resolved. But this issue should be kept open since,if the negotiations finally broke down, it would be to our advantage that they should be seen to do so on an issue on which theGovernment could expect the maximum of support from parliament and public opinion in this country. Dr. Borg Olivier, on the otherhand, would wish to be able to attribute the failure of thenegotiations to our inability to accept his conditions for a defence agreement, particularly his stipulation that we should not be entitledto use Malta, after it became independent, for the storage of nuclear weapons, if we thought fit to do so. The Chiefs of Staff held thatwe could not afford to compromise on this issue, not merely becauseany limitation of our freedom of action in this respect would be unacceptable in relation to Malta itself but also because it would establish a precedent which could be employed to our disadvantage in relation to other military bases overseas where it would remainessential that we should be able to maintain stockpiles of nuclear weapons, if circumstances so required. Nevertheless, it would be embarrassing if Dr. Borg Olivier succeeded in creating the impression
United States 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theShipping Secretary of State for Industry and the Minister of TransportLegislation (c.p. (64) 132) about legislation to secure United Kingdom(Previous jurisdiction against encroachment by foreign authorities, togetherReference: with a draft Shipping Contracts and Commercial Documents Bill.CM. (64) 34thConclusions, The Secretary of State for Industry recalled that at their minute 6) previous meeting the Cabinet had agreed that legislation should beintroduced to protect our jurisdiction against encroachment by foreign Governments in respect of contracts for the carriage of goods and passengers by sea but had considered that the draft Bill for thatpurpose which they had then had before them (CP. (64) 130)conferred on the Minister of Transport unnecessarily wide powersto give directions to shippers and shipowners. The revised draft ofthe Bill sought to meet this objection by confining the exercise ofthe Minister^ powers to a situation in which measures had beenCM. 35 (64)that it was on this issue that the negotiations had failed; and, if he went so far as to suggest that, while he was not prepared to compromise on the defence agreement, he would accept the proposed amendment of the electoral law and would dispense with a financial agreement altogether, we should then have no alternative but toindicate that we must insist on the incorporation in the defence agreement of acceptable provisions as regards nuclear weapons. Itwould thus become clear that the question of nuclear weapons wasthe real cause of the breakdown in negotiations; and the Governmentwould then be in an embarrassing position.In discussion there was general agreement that, if, as a resultof the failure of negotiations, Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s Government felland was succeeded by an Administration under Mr. Mintoff, Malta would be likely to succumb to the influence of the United arab republic and, possibly, the Soviet Union. This made it very desirableto reach a settlement with Dr. Borg Olivier if at all possible.Alternatively, we could now abandon the negotiations and allowMalta to remain indefinitely in its present Colonial status; but this,too, might merely accelerate the fall of Dr. Borg Olivier and promote Mr. MintofFs prospects. Moreover, a breakdown in thenegotiations on the issue of our right to maintain a stockpile of nuclear weapons in Malta would be as likely to bring this sensitiveissue to public attention as the conclusion of a defence agreement which specifically limited our freedom of action in this respect.It was worth considering further, therefore, whether we need insist on an unrestricted right in this respect or whether we could afford to accept the limited facilities as regards the temporary transit ofsuch weapons through the Island which Dr. Borg Olivier was apparently prepared to contemplate. This issue had to be considered in relation to the other oversea bases where it was essential thatwe should be free to exercise the right to store nuclear weapons,if necessary; and, in reaching our decision, we must not ovelook the interests of the United States Government, who were disturbedabout the possible repercussions on their own oversea bases if we accepted any limitation on our right to store nuclear weapons in malta.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to have the advice of the Chief of the DefenceStaff before forming a final view on the difficult issues involved.An early meeting would be arranged for this purpose.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
taken by the authorities of a foreign country to control the termsof contracts for the carriage of goods and passengers by sea andthese measures purported to deal with matters which, under international law, fell to be dealt with in accordance with the laws of the United Kingdom. When it appeared to the Minister thatthese circumstances existed, he would have discretion to applyClause 1 of the Bill to the measures in question. Two consequences would follow: first it would be obligatory on shipowners andshippers in the United Kingdom to notify the Minister of any requirement imposed on them under the measures in question;second, the Minister would have power to give shipowners andshippers in the United Kingdom such directions, prohibitingcompliance with requirements made under the measures, as he considered necessary to prevent foreign interference in matters which should properly be dealt with under United Kingdom law.Failure to notify the Minister of requirements imposed under foreignmeasures or to comply with his directions would be a criminal offence punishable on indictment, in the case of individuals by amaximum fine of  1,000 and in the case of corporations by a fineat the discretion of the court.Clause 2 of the Bill empowered specified Ministers to direct aperson in the United Kingdom not to comply with requirements tofurnish documents or information, if the requirements constitutedan infringement of jurisdiction appertaining, under internationallaw, to the United Kingdom. It had not been found practicable to limit the scope of this clause on the lines adopted in Clause 1 inview of the wide range of circumstances in which the production ofcommercial documents might be required.A Bill in the form now proposed, incorporating more closelydefined Ministerial powers to issue directions, should be clearly seen to be a defensive measure, designed essentially to preventencroachment on our jurisdiction; and it would furnish adequateground for the submission of a case, if necessary, to the PermanentCourt of International Justice. The Federation of British industries and representatives of the shipping interests, who had been consultedbriefly, had raised no objection to a measure in this form.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) A maximum penalty of  1,000 for an offence by an individual might appear to be unduly severe. But it was desirablenot to leave the maximum undefined, since the inclusion of a figure would indicate to the United States Administration thatencroachment on our jurisdiction was regarded seriously and wouldalso limit the scope for amendments to the Bill in Committee. Therewas reason to think that the shipping interests would be ready tomake it known that they accepted the high penalty.(b) The Minister of Aviation should be added to the Ministersauthorised to issue directions under Clause 2, since aviation no lessthan shipping concerns might be subject to objectionablerequirements to produce documents.(c) In order to avoid the implication that we were at odds withthe United States Government on a major issue of policy, it wouldbe desirable for the Bill to be presented, so far as possible, as a technical measure concerned with matters of international law. Inview of its importance to our shipping interests, however, it wouldbe appropriate that its Second Reading should be moved by theMinister of Transport; and the Attorney-General might convenientlywind up the debate. The Bill should be introduced on 8th July andshould receive its Second Reading, if possible, on 13th July. But,since this allowed less than the customary interval before SecondReading, it would be desirable that the Minister of transport should explain the BuTs purpose informally to supporters of theGovernment and to the members of the Opposition principally concerned.
Short-TermBenefitsRelated to earnings(previous reference:CM. (64) 32ndConclusions,Minute 7)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance (CP. (64) 128) aboutearnings-related benefits.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that on18th June the Cabinet had decided that short-term benefits forunemployment, sickness and widowhood should be related to earnings. They had also decided, however, that it would be inadvisable to publish a White Paper outlining these proposals; andthey had agreed to consider further the best means of presentingthem publicly. This could be done by describing them during thecourse of a Parliamentary debate; or by making them the subject ofa Parliamentary statement; or by announcing them in a speechoutside Parliament; or by reserving them for disclosure at thebeginning of the forthcoming Election campaign. If, however, a parliamentary debate on pensions took place in the next few weeks,it might be embarrassing to refrain from indicating the governments views but to publish detailed proposals shortly thereafter. moreover the Government were known to have been considering the questions involved for some time; and there might be political advantage inmaking their intentions clear at an early opportunity. On the otherCM. 35 (64)(d) The Bill should also be explained in a statement by theMinister of Transport in the House of Commons on 8th July andat a Lobby conference on the same afternoon. It would be desirableto take this opportunity to emphasise to the Press that theGovernments decision to introduce the Bill was reinforced by thefact that some legal opinion in the United States considered ourlaw relating to jurisdiction to be defective in the absence oflegislation of the nature proposed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theShipping Contracts and Commercial Documents Bill should beintroduced immediately. As a matter of courtesy he would informthe President of the United States of its introduction; and consideration should be given to informing the Governments ofthe other countries with whom we had been in consultation. It wouldbe convenient if the Minister of Transport would consider further with the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), the Attorney-General and the Chief Whip the arrangements whereby the bill would most appropriately be presented to public opinion which,both in this country and in the United States, would be largelyunprepared for so radical a measure.The Cabinet (1) Approved, subject to the amendment mentioned at (b)above and to any other drafting amendments whichmight be found necessary, the early introduction ofthe Shipping Contracts and Commercial DocumentsBill.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform thePresident of the United States of the government&apos;s decision to introduce this Bill.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theMinister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), the Attorney-General and the Chief Whip, to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to thearrangements for public presentation of the Bill.
hand, if the proposals were reserved for announcement in theConservative Party&apos;s Election Manifesto, they could then be presented as a complete policy and would be seen to constitute a comprehensive declaration of the Governments intentions duringthe next Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that the proposals might with advantage be presented in the course of an early speech by thePrime Minister devoted to economic affairs, in order that their economic, as well as their social, advantages might be given dueemphasis. On balance, however, it was agreed that, while it mightbe difficult to avoid giving some indication of the governments views if a Parliamentary debate on pensions were arranged duringthe remainder of the current Session, it would be preferable to delayany announcement until the early autumn, when the Governmentwould have had a further opportunity to consider the relativepriorities to be accorded to the scheme of earnings-related benefits and the proposal to grant preferential benefits to the very old andthe chronic sick.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that any statement of the Governments intentions as regards earnings-related benefits for unemployment,sickness and widowhood would most appropriately bemade during the early autumn, preferably before thepublication of the Conservative Party&apos;s election manifesto.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to thepublic presentation of the proposals at that juncture.ConcessionaryFares(Previous.Reference:CM. (64) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)8. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Court ofAppeal had ruled in 1954 that concessionary fares for old-age pensioners on municipal transport were ultra vires. The legislation which had been passed in the following year in order to validatethe arrangement had been narrowly drafted in order to restrict the concessionary fares to those in operation at the time. Subsequentchanges, including the introduction of new types of vehicle, the modification of services and the alteration of routes, had successivelyeroded the existing concessions, thereby causing dissatisfactionamong those who were deprived of them. Discussion in the HomeAffairs Committee and informal consultation with the Members ofParliament representing the constituencies particularly concerned had disclosed general agreement that it would be unacceptablemerely to leave matters as they were; and it would be equallyundesirable to introduce, at this stage in the life of Parliament, aBill to prevent further erosion of the concessions, since this would offer excessive scope for contentious debate on all the issues involved, including the further extension of the concessions. Thebest course, therefore, would be to announce the governments intention to consult the local authorities concerned with a view to working out the terms of legislation to maintain the existingconcessions, which could be introduced in the next Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in extending the ambit of these discussions to include the wholeissue of concessionary fares. Some local authorities who were atpresent prevented from operating arrangements of this kind were anxious to do so; and there were economic arguments in favourof extending concessionary fares for travel at off-peak hours.
School BuildingSurvey(previous reference:CM. (64) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4)9. The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had agreed at an earlier meeting that the survey of school buildings, which hadbeen initiated in 1962, should be published and had invited him toarrange, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, for thepreparation of a White Paper which would place the findings of the survey in proper perspective in relation to the recent expansion ofthe school building programme. The Education and ResearchPolicy Committee had now considered a draft of a White Paper forthis purpose. But they had concluded that, since the survey hadbeen concerned only to establish the extent of &quot; defects &quot; in the schools by reference to a theoretically ideal standard and aconsiderable time had now elapsed since it was originally undertaken,it would be impossible to publish the figures derived from it withoutmisleading the public about the present condition of the schools and failing to do justice to the considerable expansion of expenditure,not only on the provision of new buildings but also on minor works,which was enabling local education authorities to remedy, at an increasingly rapid rate, the unsatisfactory features identified in the survey.In discussion there was general agreement that the results ofthe survey should not be published in their present form. It wassuggested that if, notwithstanding the absence of recent publicinterest in the subject, the Government were criticised for delay in publishing the results of the survey, it would be appropriate toexplain that they were concerned not to publish material whichwould now be out of date in certain respects and thought itdesirable, in view of the changes which had occurred since the surveyCM. 35 (64)Moreover, a more comprehensive enquiry into the principle ofconcessionary fares would enable the Government to propose theabolition of existing concessions if it became clear that assistanceto the various categories of handicapped individuals was more appropriately provided in cash than in kind. On the other hand there would be liable to be strong political objection to the abolitionof existing concessions; and there might be political embarrasment in promising a wider enquiry at this stage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of advantage appeared to lie in confining the enquiry, atthis stage, to the relatively narrow scope envisaged by the chief secretary, Treasury, while not excluding the possibility that it mightlater be extended if this proved to be desirable.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to announce that theGovernment intended to consult those local authorities who provided concessionary fares on municipal transportwith a view to working out the terms of legislation in thenext Parliament to maintain existing fares of this kind.(2) Agreed that the possibility of an extension of these discussions at a later stage in order to include the wider aspects of the question of concessionary fares should notbe excluded.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to consider, in consultationwith the Chief Whip, how the announcement of theGovernment&apos;s intentions could most conveniently bemade.
(was first undertaken, to publish an explanatory White Paper,which was in course of preparation. There was general agreementwith this view.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to give further consideration, inthe light of their discussion, to the manner in which publicopinion might most appropriately be informed, in due course, about the results of the school building survey.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th July, 1964.
