1. The Minister of Public Building and Works said that at theCabinet meeting on 25th June (CM. (64) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 4)he had been invited to consider whether the lighting in the streets inthe neighbourhood of St. James&apos;s Park could be improved withoutreplacing the existing lamp standards by modern ones. There hadbeen frequent complaints about the indifferent standard of lightingin these streets; and a decision to improve it had been announced in1962. Technical considerations made it impracticable to bring the lighting up to the requisite standard by converting the existing gaslamp standards to electricity. New standards were already beingerected in Birdcage Walk; and to stop work now would cost about 10,000. Work on the approach road to the Horse Guards Parade hadnot yet been started; but the contract had been let and its cancellationwould probably cost about  1,000. The contract for Constitution Hillhad not yet been placed. On balance it was desirable that, in theinterests of public safety, these contracts should be completed.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The area in question was of interest not only to Londonersbut particularly to oversea visitors; and, while there had as yet been no public criticism of the change, this might be expected when thenew lamp standards were in operation.(b) On the other hand the present standard of lighting wasdangerous; and all the traffic accidents recently reported in this area had taken place after the hours of darkness. The police had recommended the change on grounds of safety.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet must take account of the possible risks to traffic, theimportance of preserving the amenities of the area must also be givendue weight. Since the work in Birdcage Walk was already in hand,it would be inappropriate to cancel the contract; but it would be inaccordance with the general view of the Cabinet if no changes weremade in the other streets in the immediate future and if, in BirdcageWalk, the existing lamp standards were retained even when the newlighting was installed.The Cabinet Agreed that the existing lamp standards should be retained in the streets in the neighbourhood of St. James&apos;s Park butthat the work on new lamp standards in Birdcage Walk, atpresent in progress, should be completed, provided that theexisting standards were retained in addition.LampStandardsin theWestminsterArea(previous reference:CM. (64) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4)StationingCosts inGermany(previous reference:CM. (64) 30thConclusions,Minute 10)2. The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that at their meeting on 4th June (CM. (64) 30th Conclusions, Minute 10) the Cabinet had authorised him to seek agreement with the Federal Government ofGermany about the balance of payments cost of our forces inGermany on the basis of a formula whereby the Federal Governmentwould undertake in general terms to do their best over a two-year period to offset our expenditure in this regard by both military and civil purchases. The Cabinet had also agreed that he should seek anadditional undertaking, on lines proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Defence, that the Federal Government would so direct their defence procurement planning that in the longer term their defenceorders might offset our outlay. The Federal Government had nowproposed further official discussions on the basis of a revised draft4932-2a 2
agreement which, while accepting the principle of including civilpurchases, was unsatisfactory in other respects. It weakened theundertaking to offset our expenditure and reverted to the earlierproposal of linking the agreement more closely than we would welcome to changes in the respective balance of payments positions of the two countries. Moreover, the Federal Government had not approved an undertaking on the lines proposed by the Secretary ofState for Defence; and, while this might be the result ofmisunderstanding, it might also indicate that they were now seeking to reject the whole concept of a continuing commitment. They had also proposed that, in addition to the agreement, there should be a confidential exchange of letters whereby we would recognise that theywere unlikely to be able to make purchases at a higher level thanDM350 million (approximately  30 million) a year. This figure mustbe compared with the previous two-year agreement, whereby theFederal Government had undertaken to make purchases amountingto  53-J- million a year in relation to an expenditure by ourselves ofsome  70 million a year in respect of the stationing of our troops inGermany. This latter figure had currently risen to  85 million a year.The figure now proposed by the Federal Government was thereforeunacceptable; and in the forthcoming discussions we should be facedwith a choice between two possible courses. On the one hand wecould confine ourselves to an attempt to reach agreement on asettlement in general terms, whereby the Federal Government would undertake to use their best endeavours to offset our foreign exchangecosts on a basis similar to that envisaged in the agreement which theyhad concluded with the United States Government. Under thisagreement the Federal Government had virtually offset the UnitedStates foreign exchange costs by their own purchases in 1963, although they would probably fall short of the same objective in the current year. Alternatively, if the Federal Government pressed for a specificsum to be mentioned in an exchange of letters, it might be desirableto insist on the DM equivalent of  40 million a year, which the Cabinetin their earlier discussions had regarded as the minimum acceptablefigure. But it might be even wiser to avoid mentioning any specificamount.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofadvantage lay in refraining from seeking to reach agreement on a specified sum, since it was unlikely that any figure which the federal government might be prepared to accept would represent an adequateproportion of our current costs or bear any reasonable relationship to the terms which they had conceded to the United StatesGovernment. Moreover, it would be undesirable to make use of the argument that, in the absence of an acceptable agreement, we mightbe forced to withdraw some of our troops at present stationed inGermany since, if we succeeded in reaching agreement with theFederal Government on the issue of stationing costs, we should thenbe implicitly inhibited from making any reduction in the strength ofour forces in Germany which we might wish to make on more general grounds.The Cabinet Authorised the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in his forthcoming discussions with representatives of the Federal Governmentof Germany on stationing costs, to seek to reach agreement for a two-year period on the basis of a formula whereby the Federal Government would undertake in general terms to do their best to offset by their military and civil purchasesthe continuing burden on our balance of payments arisingfrom our military expenditure in Germany, together withan additional undertaking that the Federal Governmentwould so direct their defence procurement planning in the longer term that their defence orders might offset this expenditure.
vc10s(previous reference:CM. (64) 38thConclusions,Minute 7)4932-2a 33. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandumby the Minister of Aviation (CP. (64) 141) about the Super VC.10and a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (64) 142) aboutthe VC.10 and the South American services of the British overseas airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.).The Minister of Aviation said that, since the Cabinefs discussionof these issues on the previous day, it had emerged that in the 1970sB.O.A.C. might need five aircraft over and above the 47 aircraft whichthey had estimated to be their requirement in the period up to 1968or shortly thereafter. If allowance was made for this additionalpossibility but, as the Cabinet had contemplated, the Corporationcancelled their order for 10 Super vc10s, their fleet would be deficientand they would have no alternative to purchasing five new Boeings707/820, which would cost some  23-25 million. This potentialaddition to the costs of cancellation should significantly reduce theobjections to his own proposal that no part of the order for SuperVClOs should be cancelled.In discussion it was generally agreed that this new factor was not strictly relevant to the decision which the Cabinet now confronted.The changes which the Corporation had made in their estimate oftheir probable requirements of aircraft in the longer term had been so many and so frequent that the Government were bound to base their decision on the Corporation^ own statement that they would need 40 aircraft in the period up to 1968 and, probably, a further sevenshortly thereafter. On this basis the issue remained as before, namely,whether 10 Super vc10s should now be cancelled.The Cabinet had before them the draft of a statement, preparedby the Lord Privy Seal after consultation with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the Minister of Aviation, suggesting the terms in whicha decision on this issue might be announced in Parliament. It indicated that, while the Government adhered to their directive requiring theCorporation to conduct their affairs in accordance with commercialcriteria, they felt that in this particular case wider considerations mustbe taken into account; that they had therefore decided that work onthe 10 Super vc10s in question should be suspended until the endof 1964; and that in the interval the Corporation, in consultation withthe Government, would consider whether there would be an eventualrequirement for these aircraft or for any further development ofthem.Some doubt was expressed whether a statement on these lines would carry full conviction. In the first place it would imply that, ifthe Corporation finally decided that they would require 10 aircraft inaddition to those already on order, these 10 aircraft would have tobe Super vc10s and that the Government were therefore decidingnow that the Corporation should be denied, in six months&apos; time, thealternative option of ordering additional Boeings. It was not clearon what grounds a decision to this effect could be justified. Moreover,the statement would also imply that it would be possible for theCorporation to reach a decision on this complex issue in so short aperiod as six months, whereas they might well prefer to postpone thedecision for a considerably longer interval, at the end of which theymight decide that the more highly developed type of Boeing aircraft would meet their requirements more efficiently than the Super VC10.In so far as the Corporation might see fit to make a public statement to this effect it would be seen that the proposed statement by theGovernment was no more than an attempt to elide the basic issueinvolved namely, that they were purporting to reinterpret, for thebenefit of the United Kingdom aircraft industry, their ownrequirement that the Corporation should conduct their affairs on a purely commercial basis.
On the other hand the Government were bound to take accountof the fact that the cancellation of 10 aircraft would involve theCorporation in a breach of a contract which they had signed and thatthe consequent cancellation charges would impose a heavy andunwelcome burden on the taxpayer. Moreover, the Corporation^requirement for additional aircraft in the 1970s had to be considered in terms not only of the number of aircraft which they would needbut also of their technical capability; and it would not be unreasonable to suggest that they should be given the benefit of a further intervalin which to decide, in the light of the modifications of the aircraft which might be made during that period, whether it would thereaftersuffice to meet their probable requirements in the longer term. Ifthese facts could be given greater prominence in the proposed statement, it should be possible to present a reasonable defence of adecision to suspend final judgment on the 10 aircraft in question untilat least the end of the year and, preferably, mid-1965.The Cabinet then considered whether a decision to this effect would be affected either by the proposal that three of the outstandingSuper vc10s should be acquired for the Royal Air Force or by theproposal, advanced in CP. (64) 142, that B.O.A.C should be directed to maintain services down the east and west coasts of South America,despite their own conviction that these services would not pay their way in the foreseeable future.In discussion it was agreed that a Parliamentary statement onthe lines which the Cabinet had now approved could not be sustained, in terms of the comparative costs involved, unless three ofthe Super vc10s were purchased for the Royal Air Force and thatthe long-term defence costings should therefore provide accordingly,without prejudice to the entitlement of the Chancellor of theExchequer in due course to require compensating defence economies,if necessary. As regards the South American services it was recognisedthat, if the Corporation were required to maintain these servicesagainst their commercial judgment for a trial period of five years, theywould require an additional subsidy of some  1 -6 million per annum.The Government had hitherto refused to subsidise shipping services to South America; and this issue would be liable to be reopened ifthey were now seen to be willing to subsidise air transport services.On the other hand there should be considerable benefit both to our export trade and to our interests in general if the Corporation wereto be seen to retain their interest in South America. If so, however,any subsidy for this purpose should be charged to the Foreign OfficeVote. It was for consideration whether an alternative approach tothe problem might lie in an attempt by the Corporation to introduce a greater measure of flexibility in their fares on these services or toenter into partnership, as regards the South American routes, with another airline.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, the Minister of Aviation, the Ministerof Defence for the Royal Air Force and the Chief Whip,to redraft in the light of their discussion and tosubmit to the Prime Minister for approval the proposedParliamentary statement about the VC.10 aircraft.(2) Invited the Minister of Aviation to ascertain, on a strictly confidential basis, the views of the British overseas airways Corporation and the British Aircraft corporation on the redraft of the statement.(3) Agreed that, without prejudice to the entitlement of theChancellor of the Exchequer to require a correspondingeconomy in due course, three of the Super vc10s inquestion should be purchased for the Royal Air Force.
UnitedNationsConferenceon Trade andDevelopment(previous reference:CM. (64) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Industry (CP. (64) 138) about institutions to develop thework of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the United nations conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) had proposed,as a means of continuing its work in the future, that the conference should be established as a permanent organisation of the united nations General Assembly, meeting once in every three years, andthat a Trade and Development Board, consisting of 55 member selected by the Conference, should continue its work between sessions.The Secretary-General of the United Nations had established acommittee to consider the voting procedure of the Board and to institute a process of conciliation to take place before voting. Twoproblems required consideration: the location of the new organisationand the attitude which we should adopt towards proposals putforward by the United States delegation to UNCTAD on votingprocedure.The choice of location lay between New York and Geneva. Thelatter would have the advantage that Governments would tend to berepresented by trade experts and possibly to combine theirrepresentation with that to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT), with the result that there would be more likelihood of practical considerations prevailing over political and better relationsbeing established between the new organisation and the GATT.Location in New York, on the other hand, might enable the united nations Secretariat to check the natural tendency of the secretariat of the Board to encourage it to develop into a separate international trade Organisation; and it would be liable to produce both a morebalanced view of the scope of the Board and a closer control of itsbudget. The balance of advantage seemed to favour Geneva. But weshould be prepared to accept New York if, as seemed probable, this proved to be the preference of the majority of member Governments;and we should be prepared to agree to meetings both of theConference and of the Board being held from time to time elsewhere.As regards the question of dual voting the United states delegation had informed us that their Governments acceptance ofthe proposed new institutions would depend on the adoption of a procedure which would require a majority of developed, as well as of developing, countries in addition to a majority of the whole body.An earlier proposal designed to weight the voting in favour of themore economically powerful countries had, however, aroused the hostility of the developing countries, who had announced that theywould be unwilling to accept a departure from the normal system of voting by a two-thirds majority on matters of substance. There wasconsequently little likelihood of dual voting being accepted; and anattempt to press it might prejudice the development of conciliationprocedure such as that practised in the GATT. There was some danger, however, that special procedures, whether for voting or for conciliation, would expose member states to moral pressure to complywith recommendations adopted in accordance with any suchprocedure; and our interest lay in avoiding any arrangement whichwould tend to give such recommendations either mandatory force orCM, 39 (64)(4) Invited the Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) togive further consideration, in the light of their discussion,to the desirability of maintaining B.O.A.C.&apos;s services to south America, on the basis that, if these services were kept in being, the Exchequer subsidy which would beentailed would be a charge to the Foreign Office Vote.
Postmen&apos;sPay(previous reference:CM. (64) 23rdConclusions,Minute 2)*5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster General (CP. (64) 139) on postmen&apos;s pay.The Postmaster-General said that at a recent meeting with theUnion of Post Office Workers (U.P.W.) he had reiterated the government&apos;s offer of an increase of pay of 4 per cent, back-dated to 1st January, 1964, together with a similar back-dating for whateverfurther increase might result from a review by the Pay Research Unit(P.R.U.) on the basis of the Report of the Committee on the Pay ofPostmen. In reply the Union had made it clear that nothing less than an increase of 104- per cent, together with any amount recommendedby a P.R.U. enquiry, would be acceptable. Despite their previousagreement to accept arbitration if the dispute could not be settled by negotiation, they had indicated that they were no longer prepared todo so. The Union hetd arranged a. one- day strike on the previous day and were continuing to impose a ban on overtime. It would now benecessary, therefore, to impose restrictions on parcels and certain types of mail and to appeal for restraint on the part of the public in sending mail over the next few days, in order that the currentaccumulation might be cleared. On this basis the Post Office might hope to maintain a reasonable service for fully paid letters. there appeared to be no immediate means of resolving the deadlock withthe Union; but the passage of time might bring them to adopt a moreconciliatory attitude, when arbitration might be less repugnant tothem. It might then be advisable for the Government to offer a small increase on their present offer of 4 per cent. But no margin ofimprovement would be likely to be acceptable to the Union at present.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It had been alleged by the Union that the Governmenfs offer of a P.R.U. review would result in considerable delay, amounting toperhaps six months. In fact such a review could be completed in about six weeks; and this might be publicly emphasised with advantage. On the other hand the length of time required for the review was partly dependent on the co-operation of the Union.additional moral weight. The best course seemed to be to discuss withthe United States Administration the objections which we saw to dualvoting procedure and to continue to review the possibility of finding,as an alternative, some satisfactory procedure for conciliation.In discussion there was general agreement with this view. Inparticular, it was pointed out that dual voting might be disadvantageous to our interests, since there was a risk that we should find ourselves in a minority not only on the Board as a whole butamong the developed countries.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Industry:(i) to arrange for the question of the location of theproposed institutions to develop the work of theUnited Nations Conference on Trade andDevelopment to be handled on the lines indicated in cp. (64) 138;(ii) to  arrange for the  question  of dual  voting  and conciliation procedure to be discussed withrepresentatives of the United States Government inthe near future; and to bring the matter before theCabinet again at a subsequent meeting.
Electricity 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the transmission Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 135) on the electricityL,nes transmission line between Bolney and Lovedean.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Central electricity generating Board (C.E.G.B.) had developed a policy of generatingelectricity in large stations and transmitting it by a &quot; supergrid &quot;,which involved heavy transmission lines and taller lattice towers thanthose necessitated by the older system. The problem for consideration was the location of one such line, from Dungeness to Cornwall, whichcrossed 15 miles of the Sussex Downs recently designated by theMinister of Housing as an area of outstanding natural beauty. Apublic inquiry on the route proposed by the C.E.G.B. had been heldby inspectors of the Ministries of Power and of Housing, who had recommended an alternative route for part of the way, between Bolneyand Lovedean. The Economic Policy Committee had asked theMinister of Power to arrange for the C.E.G.B. to study this route.But they had not appreciated that it could not be examined unlessthe inspectors&apos; report was made available to the Board and that, inaccordance with the recommendations of the Committee on administrative Tribunals, it could be disclosed to them only if it wasdisclosed at the same time to all the parties to the inquiry. It had not,in fact, been so disclosed; and no study had been made. To disclose the report now would cause anxiety to those affected by the alternativeroute without allaying the concern of those who objected to theoriginal proposals. Moreover, examination of an alternative routewould involve a delay of between twelve and eighteen months, whichwould place the electricity supplies for the area in the winter of1966-67 in jeopardy. The Minister of Power had suggested three courses to the Committee: (i) to postpone a decision until theautumn; (ii) to announce immediately a decision in favour of theBoard&apos;s proposed route; (iii) to approve the Board&apos;s proposals except where the inspectors had suggested alternatives and to investigate the alternatives. To postpone a decision would be likely in the long runto expose the Government to no less criticism than either of the othercourses. To announce a decision in favour of the Board&apos;s proposal would be difficult in the face of the inspectors&apos; report, which wouldhave to be published; but it seemed, on balance, to be the best solution.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Power, said that, whileit had been considered impossible to lay the whole of the section oftransmission line in question underground in view of the additionalCM. 39 (64)(b) At a later stage in the dispute it might be reasonable to offer a three-year agreement, which would provide a somewhat larger increase than 4 per cent in the first year, counterbalanced by an appropriate reduction of the increase in the subsequent two years.(c) Further consideration should be given to the best means ofsecuring a more adequate presentation of the Governments case,which was a strong one, in the national Press.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in the current dispute about postmen&apos;s pay no improvement on the offer already made to the Union of post Office Workers should be conceded for the time being.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Postmaster-General and the Minister without Portfolio(Mr. Deedes), to review the arrangements for the public presentation of the Governments case in the dispute.
cost of  1 million a mile which would be entailed, there might be acase for laying underground some 3 or 4 miles in the area nearMidhurst, which the inspectors had particularly sought to avoid in proposing their alternative route. This would not create an embarrassing precedent, since similar short stretches of line had been laid underground in the Peak District and the Glaslyn Estuary. Ifthis solution were not adopted, it was important that the Board shouldbe authorised to erect the line on the route which they had proposed,since the delay involved in investigating the alternative proposal was now unacceptable for operational reasons. Even a short delay wouldbe embarrassing, since the Board were becoming anxious lest theyshould find themselves unable to discharge their statutory duty toprovide electricity.In discussion it was pointed out that to insist on even a smallsection of the line being laid underground would expose theGovernment to pressure from the residents in other areas with claims to protection and would in any event be unacceptable on financial grounds. Although the Economic Policy Committee would haveoriginally preferred to have the alternative route investigated, it now seemed impossible to adopt this solution without grave risk to supplies; and there was no real alternative to approving the Board&apos;sproposals.The Cabinet Authorised the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Power,to arrange for approval to be given to the erection of the transmission line on the route proposed by the central electricity Generating Board.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th July, 1964.
