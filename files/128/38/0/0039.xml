LandValues(previous reference :CM. (64) 15th.Conclusions,Minute 5)2. The Cabinet discussed the attitude to be adopted by government spokesmen on the subject of land values during theforthcoming Parliamentary debate on the South-East Study.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that, apartfrom fiscal measures, there was no simple or obvious remedy for theincrease in the price of land which would inevitably result from thedevelopment of land adjacent to urban areas. The Government should therefore take their stand on the operation of a free market in landvalues.In discussion it was suggested that the marked rise in landvalues might be moderated to some extent if it were possible to release land for development more freely, particularly in the immediateneighbourhood of expanding towns. On the other hand it would be inadvisable to contemplate unrestricted urban expansion, particularly if this involved piece-meal encroachment on the Green Belt; and itwould be more profitable for the Government to direct criticism tothe impracticable measures proposed by the Opposition for thecontrol of land values than to purport to regulate the increase in theprice of land by any measures other than the normal processes ofsupply and demand.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatGovernment spokesmen during the forthcoming debate should maintain in principle the attitude which the Government had already adopted on this subject in the recent White Paper on the South-EastStudy. Nevertheless, it might be desirable to give further considerationto the possibility of taking administrative steps, including somesimplification and acceleration of planning permission procedures,to justify to public opinion the Governments policy on land values inrelation to development in urban areas.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, to give further considerationto the Governments policy on land values in relation tourban development on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.conclusions minute 5)Foreign 3.   The Minister without Portfolio (Lord Carrington) informedAffairs the  Cabinet  that  an  increasingly unsatisfactory  situation wasCyprus developing in Cyprus, since the United Nations peace-keeping force(Previous appeared to consider that their function was limited to creating the reference: circumstances in which a solution of the Island&apos;s problems could become.

It might be inadvisable that we should be seen to be taking any action which would appear to prejudice the future of the force.Nevertheless, an indication that we might feel obliged to with drawour contingent, in whole or in part, might suffice to induce theSecretary-General of the United Nations to instruct the force to takemore positive action to restrain inter-communal violence in the Island.(b) If it became desirable to withdraw some of our troops, itwould be necessary to ensure that such elements as continued to serve in Cyprus would constitute a realistic military unit and would remainin charge of a United Kingdom headquarters.(c) In their forthcoming discussion with the United Nationsmediator, M. Tuomioja, United Kingdom Ministers should maintain a non-committal attitude and should refrain, at this stage, fromindicating a preference for any of the various political solutions ofthe Island&apos;s problems which were currently being canvassed.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the points made in their discussion.The Minister of Power informed the Cabinet that on 26th march the Egyptian authorities had nationalised the assets of the Shell andBritish Petroleum companies in Egypt. The companies were reluctant to protest publicly for fear of jeopardising the compensation whichthey hoped to obtain. Nevertheless, the Egyptian action, which hadnot extended to United States oil interests in Egypt, had constituted a deliberate act of discrimination against the United Kingdom; and,if it were allowed to pass unchallenged, it might constitute a dangerous precedent in relation to our oil interests in other countries. It was forconsideration, therefore, whether we should address appropriaterepresentations to the Egyptian Government.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to give further consideration at an early meeting tothe implications of the nationalisation of United Kingdomoil interests in Egypt.The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that the referendumon the future Constitution of Malta was due to be held during theforthcoming week-end. If its results were inconclusive, this wouldprovide us with a welcome excuse for deferring a decision on theindependence of the Island. Alternatively, however, the referendummight result in a vote in favour of the Constitution proposed by theGovernment of Malta; and this would confront us with a difficult situation, since that Constitution was in certain respects unacceptable to us.The Cabinet &apos;(3) Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Southern The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Prime MinisterRhodesia of Southern Rhodesia continued to maintain that he had a(Previous right to receive an invitation to attend the forthcoming MeetingReference: 0f Commonwealth Prime Ministers.

Provision forRedundancy(previous reference:CM. (64) 24thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (64) 91) on wage-related benefits and other measuresto deal with redundancy.The Minister of Labour recalled that the Cabinet had invited him, on 21st April, to submit a further memorandum on wage-related benefits in the context of the other measures which had been takento reduce the impact of redundancy on individual workmen. Thepolicy of economic growth demanded the elimination of the wastefuluse of labour, which was by no means confined to those industries in which it had become notorious. This could not be achieved,however, without effective measures to minimise the hardshipresulting from redundancy, the fear of which lay behind restrictive practices and resistance to change. A number of steps had alreadybeen taken to increase the mobility of labour. The capacity ofGovernment Training Centres had been expanded, particularly inScotland, Wales and the North of England; and the allowancespayable to workers attending them had been increased. The industrial training Boards would shortly begin the work of re-training adultsalready in employment. Improvements had been made in lodgingallowances and other forms of financial assistance available toworkmen with dependants who transferred to work away from home or moved their families to new areas. These measures, however,would be incomplete without provision to reduce hardship resultingfrom sudden loss of income. For this purpose it was essential tointroduce wage-related unemployment benefit, together with acomplementary scheme for severance payments to workers who hadbeen in a particular employment for a long time and consequentlysuffered the loss of advantages such as sick pay and pension rightswhen they became redundant. A scheme for wage-related unemployment benefit should exclude those whose unemploymentdid not entail significant loss of income; and payment should belimited to a maximum of three months. Of the 34- million annualclaims for unemployment benefit nearly 2 million would not qualifyunder such a limited scheme, including those of about half a millionwomen whose average earnings were not above  9 a week. Thecost of a scheme on these lines some  19 million a year wouldbe an insignificant proportion of the total wages bill and would belikely to be acceptable to the employers in the light of the more economic deployment of labour which the scheme would promote.In discussion there was some support for the view that theintroduction of wage-related unemployment benefit would encourageemployers to face the problems involved in securing the more efficient use of labour. In particular, it would be difficult to resista demand for such a scheme from the employers themselves; andthe economic importance of increasing the efficiency of industry could be urged as a justification for dealing with this aspect ofnational insurance in isolation. On the other hand, since the economic advantages to be expected from the introduction of wage-related unemployment benefit were debatable, it would be difficult tomaintain, against pressure from those interests which were more concerned with the social aspects of national insurance, a distinctionbetween the unemployed and other recipients of short-term benefitswho suffered hardship as a result of a sudden fall in income: and.in the debates on the legislation which would be necessary tointroduce wage-related benefit it might be impossible to avoid, andwould be embarrassing to resist, amendments designed to extendwage-related benefits to widows and the recipients of sickness,benefit. Moreover, a concession to the more highly paid wouldintensify pressure for a general increase in benefits, which the tradeunions were known to prefer to wage-related benefit; but a general increase could not be introduced before 1966 without exceeding the
The kennedy round(previous reference:CM. (64) 5thConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Industry (CP. (64) 90) about the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations.The Secretary of State for Industry said that in 1963 ministers of the Contracting Parties of the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (GATT) agreed that the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations should open on 4th May, 1964, and instructed officials meanwhile towork out detailed rules for these negotiations. Progress, however, hadbeen slow; and no definite proposals would be ready by 4th May.As regards both agriculture and industry there was a markeddifference of approach between the European Economic Community(E.E.C.) on the one hand and the United States, ourselves and theother main participants on the other hand. Recent discussions in Washington between United Kingdom and United states representatives had revealed that the United States Governmentwould not be ready to undertake effective negotiations until theexpenditure on national insurance which had been forecast in theWhite Paper on Public Expenditure, 1967-68.Since it was clear, however, that legislation, even for the limitedpurpose of introducing wage-related unemployment benefit, couldnot be introduced in the current session in view of the amount ofpreparatory work which remained to be done, it might be desirableto consider publishing a White Paper indicating in some detail thenature of the Governments proposals on wage-related benefit andtheir implications in terms of contributions. It would be necessaryto consider whether the White Paper should deal also with theproposal to pay preferential benefits to the very old and with the timing of the next general increase in benefits; but decisions on these points could conveniently be taken on the basis of a draft white paper, which at the outset, should deal with the proposalscomprehensively.The case for severance payments, in which neither the employersnor the trade unions seemed to be greatly interested, was less strongthan that for wage-related benefits; and, although discussion of thepractical problems involved might usefully continue, the government need not press the employers to accept a scheme of this kind.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet were not yet ready to reach decisions on the problems which had been raised in connection with national insurance,including those which had been remitted in their earlier discussion to the Committee on Pensions and National Insurance, there mightwell be advantage in publishing, later in the summer, a White paper setting out the Governments proposals in some detail. It would be helpful, therefore, if the Minister of Pensions and National Insurancewould consider how quickly a White Paper, dealing comprehensivelywith short-term benefits, preferential benefits for the old and increases in flat-rate benefit, could be prepared. A first draft should be circulated at an early stage in order that the Cabinet might decide which of the various proposals before them could appropriately bedealt with in this way.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance to circulate in due course, after initial consideration by theCommittee on Pensions and National Insurance, the draftof a White Paper on the lines indicated by the Prime minister in his summing up.
Presidential election had taken place and that they would thereforebe unwilling to force the issue with the E.E.C. at the forthcoming conference.Discussions had also been held in the last two days in london with M. Jean Rey, the member of the E.E.C. Commission responsiblefor external affairs. M. Rey had indicated that internal differenceswithin the E.E.C. made it unlikely that the Community wouldrespond to any attempt by the other major parties to the kennedy round to coerce them into agreement on specific issues. He had also made it clear that the E.E.C. would be unlikely to make concessions on tariff levels unless the United States Governmentshowed greater willingness to remove the non-tariff obstacles to trade.The Commission therefore envisaged that negotiations on tariffdisparities would continue until the end of 1964, when electionswould have taken place in both the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates. The outlines of a settlement, however, might become apparent by the spring of 1965; and, if agreement were reached later in the year, the resulting tariff changes could become effective on1st January, 1966. This was also the prospective date for the finalabolition of tariffs within the E.E.C. countries themselves.M. Rey might prove, however, to be unduly optimistic in hisforecasts; and it might become necessary to bring greater pressure to bear upon the E.E.C. to accelerate the pace of the negotiations,even though this could not be done effectively until after the UnitedStates Presidential election. United Kingdom industry had shown itself willing to accept a substantial reduction in tariffs; but thiswillingness would not continue if the number of exceptions claimed by the E.E.C. were so large as to nullify the concept of a broadlinear reduction.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) There was some reason to fear that illiberal forces in theE.E.C. were seeking to use the issue of disparities on industrialtariffs, together with the problems of agricultural protection, as a means of ensuring that the Kennedy Round would be abortive. Ifthese forces were successful, it would be the more difficult thereafterfor the United Kingdom to accede to the E.E.C. It might be desirable,therefore, to adopt a more forceful attitude in the negotiationsopening on 4th May. On the other hand the United StatesGovernment had clearly shown themselves unwilling to force theissue on this occasion; and pressure by ourselves alone would be unlikely to be effective.(b) Moreover, we could not afford to condemn the policies ofthe E.E.C. unreservedly. The general level of their tariffs was lower than that of the tariffs maintained by the United States and ourselves;and they imposed fewer non-tariff obstacles to trade than did theUnited States.(c) Nor would it necessarily be in our interests to purport to ignore the E.E.C. and to confine ourselves to seeking to secure areduction in tariffs between the United States, ourselves and the member countries of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA),with the intention of discriminating against the Community. In 1966we should face no tariff barriers in EFTA, and should retain ourpreferences in the Commonwealth, whether the Kennedy Roundsucceeded or not. Moreover, the United States accounted for only some 8 per cent of our trade and their imports from the UnitedKingdom were rising relatively slowly, whereas the member countries of the E.E.C. accounted for 20 per cent of our trade and this proportion was rising steadily. The value of a reduction in the E.E.C.tariff would therefore be greater than a similar, or even a larger,reduction in the United States tariff.
East-west trade(previous reference:CM. (63) 14thConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Secretary of State for Industry informed the Cabinetthat, as a result of the recent negotiations with the Soviet trade delegation, we had now renewed the Anglo-Soviet Trade agreement on a basis which should ensure a more satisfactory balance ofcommercial exchanges between the two countries than had been achieved hitherto. Similar discussions with Czchoslovakia and hungary had also ended favourably; and we might now expect to enlarge our opportunities for trade with other members of the soviet bloc.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the President ofthe United States had indicated to the Foreign Secretary in washington that the United States Government continued to lookwith disfavour on United Kingdom trade with Cuba. It would be inadvisable, however, that we should appear willing to reconsiderour view that political factors should not normally be allowed to influence ordinary commercial trade or that we should be preparedto participate in economic sanctions imposed on political grounds.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for industry.immigration control(previous reference:CC. (61) 67thConclusions,Minute 5)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (64) 89) about the operation of the immigration control under the Commonwealth Immigrants Act.The Home Secretary said that net immigration from the predominantly coloured parts of the Commonwealth, which had been running at a rate of 100,000 to 150,000 a year before the Act came into force in the middle of 1962, had subsequently been reduced toabout 44,000 a year. Immigration control was operated by means ofvouchers issued by the Ministry of Labour in three categories: those with guarantees of employment in this cO&apos;iintry (A vouchers); those with special skills (B vouchers); and those seeking work (C vouchers).Applications for C vouchers were dealt with in turn; and, in viewof the pressure from India and Pakistan, the number issued to anyone country was now limited to 25 per cent of those available, since otherwise admissions from other countries would have been practicallyeliminated. Under the Act the wives of those admitted under vouchers,together with any children under 16, were also admitted. The present rate of issue of all vouchers was equivalent to an annual rate of immigration of 20,000 a year; and dependants were currently entering the country in approximately the same numbers. The colouredpopulation of the United Kingdom now amounted to about 500,000.So long as full employment was maintained this situation created no economic problem of any significance; but its social implications,particularly as regards housing and education, were more debatable.$-8 secret the Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that for the time being we must continue the patient search for solutions to the problems of agricultural protection and tariff disparities on the lines which we had followed hitherto.It would be desirable, however, that the Cabinet should give furtherconsideration to the issues of policy involved in the light of developments during the early stages of the negotiations which would begin on 4th May.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in CP. (64) 90.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at an early date.
The rate of admission, however, could not be substantially reducedstill further unless C vouchers were virtually eliminated; and thiswould be inconsistent with the Governmenfs statements in Parliamentduring the debates on the Bill.The Act also empowered him, on the recommendation of theCourts, to order the deportation of a Commonwealth immigrant whohad been convicted of a crime punishable by imprisonment. this authority, however, was subject to two limitations. The first arose from the lack of immigration control over travel from Ireland, since there were no means of preventing an individual deported to theIrish Republic from returning to this country. There was no satisfactory remedy for this situation. In addition an individual couldnot be deported if he had remained in the United Kingdom for morethan five years. There would be no advantage in extending this periodunless the present legislation as regards United Kingdom citizenshipand nationality were amended at the same time, since this permittedcitizens of Commonwealth countries to be registered as of right ascitizens of the United Kingdom and Colonies after five years&apos; residenceand in this way they could gain exemption from deportation underthe Act.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the administration of theAct had evoked less criticism from Commonwealth countries than had originally been feared. In so far as the regulation of colouredimmigration had helped to diminish racial friction in this country the Act had in fact improved Commonwealth relations. There wouldbe no objection, therefore, to a further gradual reduction of the rateof issue of vouchers and even to their elimination in category C.In discussion the following main points were made :(a) The present rate of immigration, coupled with the high birthrate among coloured immigrants, still gave rise to serious social problems and it might be desirable on this account to restrict the issueof vouchers still further. A refusal to accept further applications force vouchers might in any event be desirable as regards applicantsfrom India and Pakistan, since the present rate of admission implied that most current applicants stood no chance of acceptance during their life time.(b) The administration of the health control of immigrants wasnot entirely satisfactory, since it did not comprise dependants, who might represent a greater health risk than the voucher-holdersthemselves. In future, therefore, dependants might well be required,as were voucher-holders, to submit to medical examination and to undergo treatment if they were found to be sick. Such a requirement,however, could not be enforced without legislation.(c) Any marked change of policy at the present time would be undesirable on broad political grounds, particularly since the socialimplications of the present rate of immigration had to be weighed against the advantages of an additional supply of labour.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that the rateof immigration was still a matter for concern and the Home secretary might wish to consider, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,the special problems arising from the issue of C vouchers. It wouldbe undesirable, however, to embark on any radical change of policy at the present juncture.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (64) 89.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to consider whether, on theassumption   that   the   present   policy   as   regards
Commonwealth immigrants would be maintained, therewould nevertheless be advantage in some gradual reductionin the rate of issue of category C vouchers.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Minister of Health, toconsider whether the dependants of immigrants should be subjected to the same measures of health control as the immigrants themselves.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th April, 1964.
