SouthernRhodesia(previous reference :CM. (64) 38thConclusions,Minute 2)4957-2CM. 46 (64)The Prime Minister said that his discussions with the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Mr. Ian Smith, on the issue of thegrant of independence to the Territory had developed in anunforeseen manner. At the outset he had expected that Mr. Smithwould adopt an uncompromising attitude, even to the extent ofthreatening that, unless we granted independence to SouthernRhodesia forthwith, his Government would assume it by a unilateralact. In the event, however, Mr. Smith had made it clear that he was seeking to avoid any unilateral declaration of this kind and would greatly prefer to negotiate the Territory&apos;s independence in thenormal manner. Moreover, he had agreed that independence mustbe based on the consent of the population, including the Africaninhabitants, and that the United Kingdom Government were entitledto be satisfied, before granting independence, that the basis on whichit was granted was acceptable to the people of the Territory as awhole. Mr. Smith was confident that the majority of the populationsupported his request for independence on the basis of the present constitution and franchise; and he proposed to verify this assumption partly by conducting a referendum among the predominantly European electorate on the basis of the existingelectoral rolls and partly by ascertaining the views of the ruralAfricans not represented on the electoral rolls by means of some form of consultation conducted by the tribal Chiefs. We had made itclear to him that the latter procedure would probably not be acceptedby world opinion as an adequate test of African opinion and that a referendum, or some equivalent form of enquiry, would be required.But, provided that we remained uncommitted on the manner in whichthe views of the great majority of the African population would be ascertained, it should be possible to publish the result of thediscussions in a communique on the lines of the draft attached tothese conclusions. This draft would be acceptable to Mr. Smith, whowould be prepared, in addition, to make a public statement aboutthe individuals at present held in detention in Southern Rhodesia,indicating that they would be restored to liberty if they would give an undertaking to refrain from unconstitutional behaviour and to pursue their political objectives by lawful means.A communique on the lines suggested would reflect a major change of policy by the Government of Southern Rhodesia; and,in so far as it would bind them not to seek independence otherwise than with the consent of the population and to recognise that wewere entitled to be satisfied on this score before granting independence,it would be seen to incorporate two substantial concessions to ourown point of view. This development was so unexpected that wewere bound to examine it carefully and to enquire what motives had probably prompted Mr. Smith and his colleagues to adopt soconciliatory an attitude. To some extent they had probably become increasingly apprehensive about the consequences of a unilateral declaration of independence and were now seeking for some meansof eliminating this issue from the discussion. In addition they mightcalculate that their party would gain some political advantage at theforthcoming by-elections in Southern Rhodesia if they could claim that the risk of a final breach with the United Kingdom had been removed and that there were now good prospects of securingindependence for the territory by negotiation. It was no less to ourown advantage, however, to have secured the removal, at least for thetime being, of the threat of a unilateral declaration of independence;and on balance, therefore, it would probably be expedient to endorse the terms of the communique which had been provisionallyagreed with Mr. Smith.In discussion it was suggested that the Government might be criticised if it could be alleged that, by failing to insist on the removalof the present restrictions on individual liberty and the freedom of
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th September, 1964.the Press in Southern Rhodesia, they had acquiesced in a procedure which would in effect prevent the expression of African opinion from being free and informed. On the other hand the communique left usentirely at liberty to judge whether the methods by which theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia would propose to ascertainAfrican opinion would be adequate; and, since Mr. Smith had indicated that his detailed proposals for this purpose would not besubmitted to us until after the forthcoming general election in thiscountry, we could reserve our position until they were presented.Moreover, it should be to the Governmenfs advantage that thecontentious issue of their attitude to a hypothetical unilateral declaration of independence would be removed from public discussion during the period of the general election.In further discussion it was suggested that the communiquemight also be open to criticism in so far as it made no mention of thestipulation, which the Government had made repeatedly in the past and had confirmed at the recent Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters, that the existence of sufficiently representative institutionsmust be a condition of the grant of independence to SouthernRhodesia. The African members of the Commonwealth would belikely to attach importance to this omission; and attempts might bemade to interest the United Nations Organisation both in this pointof substance and in the conduct of the proposed referendum amongthe African population. On the other hand it should be possible tomaintain that, if Mr. Smith could substantiate to our satisfaction his claim that the majority of the population supported his request for independence on the basis of the present Constitution and franchise,the population would by implication have indicated that they regarded the existing institutions as sufficiently representative; and the UnitedKingdom Government would then be under no further moral obligation in this connection.Nevertheless, we should seek to avoid any appearance of inconsistency between the draft communique and the communique issued at the end of the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers;and the draft should therefore include an appropriate reference toour earlier stipulation on the subject of representative institutions.Various other drafting amendments were proposed and adopted.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the joint communique to be issued after the discussions between the Prime Minister and thePrime Minister of Southern Rhodesia.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to seek to secure theagreement of the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesiato the amendments to that communique which had beensuggested during their discussion.
DRAFT OF JOINT COMMUNIQUE TO BE ISSUEDFOLLOWING THE TALKS BETWEEN THE PRIMEMINISTER AND Mr. IAN SMITH, PRIME MINISTEROF SOUTHERN RHODESIAThere was a full discussion of all aspects of the problem of independence for Southern Rhodesia. In the course of it the british prime Minister conveyed to the Prime Minister of Southern rhodesia the views expressed at the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime ministers in July as set out in their final communique.The British Prime Minister told the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia that the British Government looked forward to the day when Southern Rhodesia would take her place as an independentSovereign State within the Commonwealth. For their part they were anxious that this should come about as soon as practicable.The British Prime Minister stated that Britain would be preparedto grant independence to Southern Rhodesia on any basis acceptable to the people of the territory as a whole. The Prime Minister ofSouthern Rhodesia accepted that independence must be based on general consent. He stated that he was convinced that the majority ofthe population supported his request for independence on the basisof the present Constitution and franchise. The British Prime Ministertook note of this statement but said that the British Governmentwould require to be satisfied that this was the case. The PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia recognised that the BritishGovernment were entitled to be satisfied about this and said that hewould consider how it could best be demonstrated so that independence could be granted.
