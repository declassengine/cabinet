Land Values(previous reference:CM. (64) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4)*1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of land values. Theyhad before them a memorandum by the Minister of Housing andLocal Government (CP. (64) 159), to which was appended a notesetting out alternative bases for a public statement of theGovernments policy on the subject.The Minister of Housing and Local Government recalled that attheir earlier meeting the Cabinet had invited him to circulatealternative statements, the one indicating an intention to seek some means of securing for the Exchequer a share in betterment realisedon the sale of land, the other designed to defend the existing policy on land values. The best course seemed to be to* make a statement whichwould commit the Government to take some action in this respectbut would not tie them to detailed proposals. It might be indicated,first, that the Government would take steps to encourage localauthorities, particularly in areas of scarcity, to release more land andthat for this purpose it might be useful to appoint a Commission todiscuss the problem with relevant local authorities; second, thatthe Government intended to introduce a tax on betterment, therevenue from which would be used to provide assistance to localauthorities in the task of urban renewal, including the restoration of derelict land and the provision of public open spaces; and, third, thatany such tax would be charged at a differential rate in order to discriminate between areas, such as the south-east, where a high levelof tax could be levied without preventing additional land from being released and others where the demand was less compelling. It shouldbe recognised, however, that the economic implications of the releaseof substantial quantities of land in areas of high demand would notnecessarily be wholly beneficial, since it would tend to increase the flow of population into those areas.In discussion it was suggested that all previous experienceindicated the great difficulty of finding any practicable method oftaxing land values. The problem had been thoroughly examined bythe Committee on Compensation and Betterment under thechairmanship of Mr. Justice Uthwatt in 1942, whose recommendationsfiad in the event proved unworkable. If there had been any othersolution to the problem, the Committee might have been expectedto find it. The Government should therefore avoid committing themselves at this stage to proposals for dealing with this highlycomplex problem which it might in the event prove impossible to implement either at all or in a form which did not inevitably open the way to a capital gains tax.On the other hand it could be argued that previous attempts to tax land values had failed because the rate of taxation had been too high. It should not be impossible to devise a levy on developmentvalues on the lines proposed in the memorandum (CP. (64) 125) bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer, which would apply to all sales ofland and all development. The charge should be regarded less as a tax than as a fee for the exercise of the monopoly created by thegrant of planning permission in respect of one area and its refusal inrespect of another. A levy in this form could be associated with thepolicy of releasing land, as foreshadowed in the South-East Study,and with the growing shortage of land suitable for development.Alternatively, it might be presented in the context of the necessity to broaden the basis of taxation with a view both to securing new sources of revenue to support increased public expenditure and torendering the incidence of taxation more equitable. The latterapproach, however, would increase the logical difficulty ofdistinguishing between a charge on development values and a capital gains tax; and any statement on these lines would have to be draftedwith particular care in order to avoid creating the impression that theGovernment contemplated a general tax on capital.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
Common-wealthImmigration(previous reference:CM. (64) 25thConclusions,Minute 7)2. The Home Secretary said that the commonwealth immigration Committee had considered the controls imposed on commonwealth immigration under the Commonwealth ImmigrationAct during the first two years of their operation and had reached theconclusion that they were inadequate to keep the number of immigrants at an acceptable level. Before the decision to introducecontrols had been taken Commonwealth immigrants were entering the country at the rate of 40,000 a year. During the last 12 months68,000 had been admitted. The Committee considered thatimmigration at this rate could not be allowed to continue but that,In further discussion it was suggested that, while it might ultimately be necessary to introduce some form of levy on development values and, possibly, a general capital gains tax, thedifficulty of indicating any such intention at the present stage implied that it might be preferable for the Government to take their standon the fact that any tax would be liable to increase the price of land and that the only effective solution to the problem was to take steps,on the lines proposed by the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment, to increase the supply of land for development.Attention might also be drawn to the fact that even in Sweden, wherethe economy was organised in accordance with Socialist principles,proposals to tax land values had been repeatedly rejected asimpracticable and it was accepted that land owners should receive theeconomic price for their land. On the other hand this might beregarded by many of the Governmenfs supporters as too negativean approach to a problem which was causing considerable public concern, coupled with an expectation that the Government intendedto put forward positive proposals for its solution. On balance,therefore, the best course appeared to be to seek to answer the criticisms of the high price of land by drawing attention to the government&apos;s proposals for increasing its availability and to dealwith the separate issue of excessive profits in a public statement,possibly by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, discussing in general terms the action which the Government had already taken to providea more equitable system of taxation and the problems of finding a broader base for the increased revenue which would be necessary to finance increases in public expenditure. In this context developmentvalues could be presented as one untapped source of revenue whichthe Government would be prepared to examine.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itmight prove necessary in the future to impose some form of taxation on land values and, possibly, to contemplate a capital gains tax. But.pending further examination of the problem, it would be necessaryto avoid committing the Government to a particular solution, whileindicating that they were aware of public anxiety and retained an open mind on the possibility of finding some method of ensuring thatthe community as a whole would benefit from the increase in landvalues. Emphasis should also be laid on the steps that were beingtaken to secure the release of more land for development as the only effective means of reducing land prices. Further consideration shouldbe given to the terms in which the Governmenfs policy could be described in a public speech during the autumn.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Ministerof Housing and Local Government and the Minister without portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to consider further, in the light oftheir discussion, the terms in which the Governmenfs policy on land values could be discussed in a public speech in due course; and to report their conclusions to the PrimeMinister.
in view of the pledges given to Parliament during the passage of theCommonwealth Immigration Bill, it would be impossible to introducestricter measures in the next Parliament without giving some previousindication of the Governments intention to do so. It would probablybe sufficient for this purpose to let it be known that the Governmentwere examining means of making the controls more effective and of preventing evasion. In the meantime officials had been asked toexamine possible methods of reducing the net coloured immigrationto 25-35,000 a year; and proposals for this purpose would besubmitted to the Cabinet in September.In discussion attention was drawn, on the one hand, to theimportance on social grounds of limiting immigration to the numbersthat could be absorbed and, on the other hand, to the necessity oneconomic grounds of securing an adequate supply of labour forindustries, such as public transport, in which a shortage of labourcould have a serious inflationary effect. From the point of view of relations with other Commonwealth countries firmer restrictionsmight be less damaging than the racial disturbances which excessiveconcentrations of coloured immigrants were liable to provoke. there might be some advantage in encouraging immigration from Europe,particularly from Malta, where the budgetary support which we were obliged to provide might be reduced if we were able to make a largercontribution to the relief of unemployment in the Island by acceptingan increased number of Maltese immigrants.The Cabinet Took note that the Home Secretary would circulatefurther proposals about Commonwealth immigration forconsideration during September.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th July, 1964.
