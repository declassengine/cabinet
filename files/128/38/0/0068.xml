(64) 34th Conclusions, Minute 7Thursday, 2nd July, 1964,  at 10.30 a.m.The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C P. (64) 125) and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment (CP. (64) 127) on land values and planning procedures.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that theCabinet had invited him to arrange for further consideration to begiven to the Government&apos;s policy on land values in relation to urban development.    Public criticism appeared to be focussed on twoaspects of the matter; first, the effect which the high price of land was believed to exert on the cost of housing;  second, the largeprofits which were being derived from the sale and development ofland.    Discussion among the Ministers concerned had pointed tothe conclusion that there was no action open to the Governmentwhich would reduce the price of land in the short-term.    Moreover,since the building industry was working to capacity and houses werereadily purchased despite high prices, a reduction in the price ofland, so far from helping to reduce the price of houses, would belikely merely to inflate the profit accruing to the builder.   ministers had accordingly considered whether there was a case for securingfor the Exchequer a share in the high profits realised by someowners and developers.    The extension over a longer period of the short-term gains tax, which was already levied on gains realisedon land acquired and disposed of within three years was unacceptableon the ground that, as a result, the amount of land coming on to themarket would fall and its price would rise.    Moreover, it wouldbecome necessary to deal with the administrative difficulty ofcharging the tax at a reduced rate in cases where the gain hadaccrued over a considerable period.    A long-term gains tax ongains realised from the sale of land, irrespective of the interval between acquisition and disposal, would be open in varying degree to similar objections and would be difficult to justify in the face ofthe Governments continuing opposition to the extension of a long-term gains tax to transactions in property other than land.    More-over, any capital gains tax could, by its nature, be applied only togains actually realised, whereas a developer who bought land at existing use value might derive considerable profit from developing the land and leasing the buildings erected on it.    It was arguable,however, that, here also, the Exchequer should secure a share inthe increased value which resulted from public expenditure or fromthe grant of an exclusive right to develop.    It might be desirable,therefore, that a tax should be charged on sale and development,which would be based, in the case of sales, on the difference between-1-
the sale price and the existing use value or the purchase price,whichever was the greater, and, in the case of development withoutsale, on the difference between the market value with planning permission and the existing use value or the purchase price,whichever was the greater.    A tax of this nature would not be free from disadvantages, since part of it would be passed on to the purchaser and would therefore increase the price of the land!  and,even if the rate of tax were as low as 25 per cent, it might reducethe progress of urgently needed development and urban renewal.    Anumber of practical difficulties would also arise, not least in the recruitment of an adequate number of experienced valuers.   Never-theless, if any action was to be taken, this seemed to be the only practical possibility.   The new tax could not be introduced beforethe next session of Parliament;  but it should be possible to give some advance indication of the Governments intentions, if this wasjudged appropriate.THE MINISTER OF HOUSING AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTsaid that in the course of the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion it hadbeen suggested that some reduction in the price of land might beeffected if it were possible to release land for development morefreely and to simplify and to accelerate the procedures by which planning permission was obtained.      It was clear that planningprocedures, as such, had no effect on the price of land, althoughdelays attributable to them might inflate costs.    Nevertheless, theywere being reviewed by the Departments concerned, with theassistance of the recently appointed Planning Advisory Group, which included experts drav/n both from local authorities and from private practice.    Substantial changes were being considered in thoseprocedures which gave rise to most delay;  and, while it would notbe possible to announce any proposals before the Recess, anopportunity of discussing them in a speech to one of the relevantprofessional bodies would occur in the autumn.In discussion the following main points were made -(a) Although a tax on the lines proposed could not be expected toreduce the price of land, a case could be made on grounds of equityfor securing for the public a share in fortuitous increases in value which derived largely from public expenditure and from the decisionsof public authorities.    It was doubtful, however, v/hether public criticism of the high profits obtained by landowners and developerswould be assuaged by a tax of the order of 25 per cent, while a taxat a higher rate would be liable to reproduce the stultifying effect on development of the 100 per cent betterment charge which the labour government had introduced and the Conservative Government hadbeen compelled to abolish.(b) Against the background of the failure of previous attempts total land values and of the attitude towards proposals of this kind which the Government had adopted hitherto, a decision to introduce a tax on development values at the end of the life of the present parliament would be likely to be attributed to political motives andmight be misunderstood both by the Government&apos;s supporters and bythe public at large.    On the other hand it was only in recent years-2-
-that-the price of land had-ricon ofamrplyyaud it conict be burgmed-that the price of land had risen sharply;  and it could be argued that a new situation had arisen which justified the re-examinationof the problem.    The ra.pid expansion of public investment had created new opportunities for making profits out of land anddevelopment;  and the corresponding need tc -finance a high levelof public expenditure justified a search for new sources of revenue.(c) It would be desirable to examine the details of any proposalclosely before the Governments intentions were made public,since the application of the general principle would raise a numberof difficult issues.    For example, it might be necessary to exempt from the new tax land sold in order to pay estate duty;  and itmight be suggested that, if the public were to share in profitsaccruing to the individual as a result of public decisions, theyshould equally be obliged to compensate individuals whose propertydepreciated in consequence of such decisions.(d) The timing of any indication of the Governments intentionswould require careful consideration.    It would not be appropriate to introduce, otherwise than in a Finance Bill, a measure which,although its nature was akin to a charge for the grant of a franchise,would be popularly regarded as a tax.    On the other hand proposals could hardly be announced shortly after the conclusion ofParliamentary consideration of the current Finance Bill.    TheGovernment could perhaps give some indication that they mightintroduce a measure in Hie new session of Parliament;  but itwould be necessary to avoid, on the one hand, being drawn intodiscussion of detail and, on the other hand, giving the impression that a satisfactory solution to the problem had not yet been found.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saidthat there was general agreement that it might prove desirable tointroduce a measure on the lines proposed in G. P. (64) 125, if on further examination it proved possible to overcome the practicaldifficulties.    It would be unwise, however, to make any immediate announcement of the Governments intentions;  and further con-sideration should be given by the Ministers immediately concerned to the form in which they might be announced at a rather later stage.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, inconsultation with the Lord Privy Seal, theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andthe Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment, to consider, in the light of their discussion, the form and timing of themost appropriate indication of theGovernments policy in relation to landvalues.Cabinet Office, S. W, 1.2nd July, 1964-3-
