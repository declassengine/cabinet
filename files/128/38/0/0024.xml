Zanzibar 2.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that there were some(Previous indications that we might be asked to withdraw our HighReference: Commissioner from Zanzibar unless we extended recognition toCM. (64) 7th Mr. Karume&apos;s Government. Since it would still be premature to conclusions, recognise Mr. Karume&apos;s authority, he had invoked the good offices of minute 2)       President Nyerere of Tanganyika in urging moderation in Zanzibar.The latest information suggested that, as a result, Mr. Karume mightnot bring the issue to a head in the near future.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.Southern 3.   The Colonial Secretary informed the Cabinet that his recentRhodesia        discussions   with   the  Prime   Minister   of   Southern   Rhodesia,(Previous        Mr. Winston Field, had indicated that the Government of SouthernReference:      Rhodesia would not be prepared at this stage to make any significantCM. (63) 13th  advance towards a further liberalisation of the Constitution. this conclusions,    would make it impossible for us to grant the Colony formalMinute2)       independence; and, unless the Government of Southern Rhodesiacould be persuaded to leave the issue in abeyance for the time being,they might be tempted to assume independence by a unilateral act.If they purported to validate such action by legislation, we shouldbe faced with a very difficult constitutional problem. But, if theyconfined themselves merely to a declaration of independence without seeking to give it any precise legal status, we might be able to ignore it,at least for a time.In discussion it was suggested that, in the light of recent developments in East Africa, the Government of Southern Rhodesiacould hardly be blamed for refusing to acquiesce in any modificationof the Colony&apos;s present Constitution, especially since its normaloperation should in any event yield an African majority in theLegislature within the next 15 years. Nor was it surprising that theyshould seek to achieve independence, having regard to the fact that both Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland were likely to become independent during the present year. On the other hand it would be reasonable to expect them to take account of the grave constitutional difficulties in which they would involve us if they purported to declarethe independence of Southern Rhodesia but also to maintain theirallegiance to the Crown. The latest indications suggested that theywere not likely to force this issue in the immediate future; but it wouldbe prudent to give advance consideration to the possibility.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the action which might berequired if the Government of Southern Rhodesia sought to assert the independence of the Colony by a unilateral act,while maintaining their allegiance to the Crown.CM. 10 (64)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. They also approved the draft of a statement, to be made in Parliament that day by theMinister of Transport, about the Governmenfs attitude towards theChannel tunnel project.
Cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Commonwealth Secretary informed the Cabinet thatArchbishop Makarios, while not rejecting the concept that aninternational peace-keeping force should be established in Cyprus,had indicated that he would acquiesce in the proposal only on certain conditions. We might be able to negotiate a settlement of theseconditions, including the suggestion that the force, if established,should be associated in some way with the United Nations. We couldnot afford to envisage a situation in which the Soviet Union wouldbe able to veto the proposal; but it might be possible to satisfyArchbishop Makarios by arranging that the establishment of the force should be approved by the Security Council.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theCommonwealth Secretary.Statement on defence, 1964(previous reference:C.C.(63) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (64) 32) to which was appended a draft of theStatement on Defence, 1964.In discussion various textual amendments were agreed.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for thepublication of the Statement on Defence, 1964., subject tothe amendments agreed in their discussion and to any further amendments of detail which might be found necessary.Pay of Members      6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theof Boards of     Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman of the Wages Committee(CP. (64) 27), proposing increases in the salaries of Chairmen, deputy chairmen and members of the Boards of Nationalised industries.nationalised industries(previous reference:C.C. (60) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the salaries in question had been last revised in 1957. The Wages Committee had thereforefelt justified in proposing increases amounting to rather less than25 per cent, which, over a period of 6\ years would be equivalent to annual increases of 3-5r per cent. This would be reasonably in line withthe Governments incomes policy.On this basis the following adjustments would be made:Chairmen of National Coal Board,British Railways, Electricity Counciland the Central Electricity Genera-ting Board* ...Deputy Chairmen of National coal board, British Railways, ElectricityCouncilChairmen of other major Boards   ...Deputy  Chairmen  of  other  majorBoardsPresentSalaries 10,0008,000(one at 7,500)8,5007,500(one at 7,000)ProposedNewSalaries 12,50010,00011,0009,500* Pending a change in the present occupancy of the Chairmanship, whenthe salary would be the same as that of the &quot; other major Boards &quot;.
SECRET 5CM. 10 (64)As regards full-time members of the Boards, the wages committee proposed that salaries, which at present varied between 6,000 and  7,500 per annum, should henceforward be determined for individual members within a fixed salary band, extending from 7,000 to  9,000.In addition the committee recommended that the existing practiceas regards publication of salaries should be maintained, on theunderstanding that, in the case of full-time members of Boards, onlythe salary band itself would be announced at the time of the generalannouncement of increased salaries but that individual salaries would subsequently be disclosed to Parliament when they were determinedby Ministers and in all cases where statute so required.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was suggested, however, that the upper limit of the new salaryband for members of Boards should be raised to  9,500, provided that individual salaries continued to be fixed at appropriate points withinthe band and that the salary of  9,500 was confined to selected cases.The public presentation of the increases should link them withthe measures that the Government had taken, within the last year or so, to put the nationalised industries on a sounder commercial basis; and there would also be advantage in emphasising that the increases were justified as much by the need to provide an attractivecareer structure within the industries themselves as by the need to induce first-class individuals from private industry to acceptappointment to nationalised Boards.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (64) 27, on the understandingthat the upper limit of the new salary band for full-time members of the Boards of nationalised industries would beestablished at  9,500, this salary to be paid only inappropriate cases.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (64) 35) about the salaries of the Higher Judiciary.The Lord Chancellor said that the increases in the salaries of theHigher Judiciary which had been introduced in 1954 had been intended to stand for a considerable period of time. But it had alsobeen intended that the existing differentials between the salaries ofthe Higher Judiciary and those of senior civil servants should bemaintained. This intention had not been fulfilled; and the recentaward to senior civil servants had resulted in their being paid morethan judges of the English High Court for the first time in history.The disparity would be aggravated by the increases in the salaries of members of the Boards of nationalised industries, which theCabinet had just approved. Moreover, unless the present salaries were increased, the best lawyers would become increasingly reluctant toaccept appointment to the Bench; the administration of justice would suffer; the standing and reputation of the legal profession v/ould be diminished; and recruitment to the profession would be affected.It would not be easy to introduce fresh legislation so&apos; late in the lifetime of the present Parliament, particularly at a time when the salaries of Members of parliament and Ministers remainedunimproved. But it would be possible to introduce a short Bill,enabling the salaries of the Higher Judiciary to be increased, but notdecreased, by Order in Council. Such a Bill, even if not ultimatelyenacted during the Session, would be a clear statement of intentionon the part of the Government, which should do much to reassureSECRET4251-2 a 3Salaries ofthe higher judiciary
the legal profession. Alternatively, the Lord Chief Justice, the master of the Rolls and the President of the Probate, Divorce and admiralty division could be given a written assurance that the government intended to deal with the matter in the next Session.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Reluctance on the part of leading lawyers to acceptappointment to the Bench was not a wholly recent development.Nevertheless, there was a strong case in principle for further increases in the salaries of the Higher Judiciary.(b) Legislation might expose the Government to the charge thatthey were more concerned to increase the salaries of individuals whowere already highly paid than to improve the position of pensioners and other less fortunate members of the community. This impressionwould be accentuated if the Bill were a merely enabling measure,containing no details of the increases proposed. It would be preferable,therefore, that the Government should confine themselves toannouncing publicly their intention to increase the salaries of theHigher Judiciary early in the next Session of Parliament, preferablyafter ascertaining that the Opposition would be prepared to associate themselves with the terms of such a statement.(c) The precise increases which it might be appropriate to awardwould need further consideration. Even though the salaries of theHigher Judiciary were unrelated to the salaries of Ministers and other classes of public servant, comparisons would inevitably be drawn. Itmight be appropriate, therefore, to establish machinery for advising the Government in future on the level of the increases which mightperiodically be justified, on the lines of the analogous arrangementsalready in force in relation to the salaries of higher civil servants and members of the Boards of nationalised industries.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the salaries of the Higher Judiciaryshould be increased.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to draft a statement announcing the Governments intention to deal with this matter in thenext Session of Parliament and to ascertain whether theOpposition would be prepared to associate themselves with its terms.(3) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationboth to the increases to be granted, in due course, on thepresent occasion and to the proposal that machinery mightbe established to advise the Government on the amountof any further increases to be awarded in future.(4) Invited the Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Chancellorof the Exchequer, to consider the timing of theannouncement of the Governments intentions as regardsthe salaries of the Higher Judiciary and of members of the boards of nationalised industries.British 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ColonialGuiana Secretary (CP. (64) 36) on the import by British Guiana of oil fromOil Imports      Cuban refineries.The Colonial Secretary said that the British Guiana ElectricityCorporation had placed a contract for the supply of oil from Cuba.This oil was Russian crude oil, refined mainly in Cuban refinerieswhich the Cuban Government had expropriated from UnitedKingdom and United States companies in I960. In the light of the refusal of the Cuban authorities to pay compensation for this
9. The Cabinet had before them: (i) a Note by the Secretaryof the Cabinet, to which was appended the report of a committee under the chairmanship of Lord Plowden on the RepresentationalServices Overseas (CP. (64) 33); (ii) a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (64) 34), discussing the committee&apos;s recommendations.The Foreign Secretary said that, apart from certain points of detail which were examined in his memorandum, the recommendationsof the report were acceptable. Subject to the deletion of a few passages,which had been agreed with Lord Plowden, the report should bepublished as soon as possible and the Government should announceat the same time that they endorsed its proposals.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would clearly be right to implement the committee&apos;s main commendation, i.e., that the representational Services overseasshould be amalgamated into a single Service, to be known as her majesty&apos;s Diplomatic Service, and that this Service should staff theForeign Office and Commonwealth Relations Office (which should remain separate Departments in Whitehall), together with all foreign service, Commonwealth Relations Office and Trade Commissionposts overseas.(b) The committee had recommended that the increasedallowances to be payable in respect of the boarding school education of children of members of the new Diplomatic Service should not besubject to tax while an officer was serving in the United Kingdom.Representa-tional ServicesOverseasThe PlowdenReportCM. 10 (64)expropriation and of the general embargo on imports of oil into theUnited Kingdom from the Soviet bloc, it would be appropriate to instruct the Governor of British Guiana to prohibit furtherimportations of oil from Cuba after delivery of the first shipmentwhich was already on its way. This would be consistent with thesimilar action which we had taken when United Kingdomrefineries in Rumania and Iran had been expropriated; and it might also help to allay current United States criticism of our trade withCuba.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the CubanGovernment had recently offered to discuss with the Shell oil company the question of compensation for their expropriatedproperty. The company had not yet replied to this offer, since theyforesaw some risk of embarrassment in embarking on discussionsunless the Cuban Government were prepared to conduct similarnegotiations with the United States oil interests which had beenexpropriated at the same time. Since it was United States policy to isolate the Cuban Government as far as possible, it was perhapsunlikely that any negotiations on the compensation of United Statesoil interests would reach a successful conclusion. Nevertheless, the cuban Governments apparent willingness to discuss compensationwith our own companies weakened our grounds for prohibiting theimport of Cuban oil into British Guiana; and any prohibition of thiskind would now have to be justified solely by reference to the generalembargo on imports of oil from the Soviet bloc. In these circumstances it would be advisable to reconsider the question.The Cabinet-Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, the Secretary of State for Industry andthe Minister of Power, to give further consideration to theproposal to prohibit the importation of Cuban oil by british guiana.
The Law Officers were considering whether it would be permissible,under existing legislation, to grant such exemption. If not, it would benecessary, during an offieefs home posting, to increase the grossvalue of the allowances in order to compensate for the incidence oftaxation.(c) The committee had recommended that the diplomatic service Allowance which, under their proposals, would be paid tocareer members of the Service should not be paid to Board of Tradeofficers serving overseas on secondment. They had justified thisproposal on the ground that the allowance would be specially designedto compensate officers for the disadvantages of a full diplomaticcareer, involving constant postings overseas, and that to apply it toofficers serving one or two tours of duty abroad in the course of a normal Home Civil Service career would undermine the whole basisof the new system of allowances. It could also be argued that thepayment of the allowance to such officers would discourage them fromaccepting permanent transfer to the Diplomatic Service, an optionwhich would be open to them under the committee&apos;s recommendations.On the other hand there were arguments in favour of the paymentof the allowance to seconded officers which the committee did notappear to have sufficiently considered. It was important to improve the quality of our commercial representation overseas; and it was essential, therefore, that promising officers should be prepared to volunteer for oversea tours on secondment. It would not be practicable, however, to assume that all commercial posts overseasshould be filled only by officers who had accepted a permanenttransfer to the Diplomatic Service; nor would it be desirable to forgothe advantages, which the practice of secondment secured, of enlargingthe experience of promising officers by enabling them to include oneor two periods of service overseas in a career spent mainly at home.But, if the committee&apos;s proposals were accepted, two members of anoversea Mission, enjoying equivalent rank and carrying similarresponsibilities, would continue to receive different emoluments; andall experience confirmed that this would not only be a constant source of friction and ill-feeling but would also discourage secondment. Inaddition to the Board of Trade other Departments seconded officers for service in Missions abroad; and similar considerations would apply.(d) In spite of the fact that the duties of the Colonial office would continue to be primarily administrative in character, whereasthose of the other two oversea Departments would be largelyrepresentational, it would be right to merge the Colonial Office withthe Commonwealth Relations Office. In view of the anxiety of thestaff concerned about their future the Governmenfs statement should indicate that it was the intention to effect this amalgamation by 1st July, 1965.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewould be advantage in arranging for an announcement of theGovernment^ policy simultaneously with publication of the report,although publication should be deferred for a period which would suffice to allow the other Commonwealth Governments to be informed and the Staff Associations to be consulted. Apart from the questionof the payment of Diplomatic Service Allowance to seconded officers,to which further consideration would have to be given, the report&apos;srecommendations were clearly acceptable. Particular attention shouldbe paid to the committee&apos;s proposal that policy planning work shouldbe developed and should be closely related to policy-making both inthe oversea Departments and in Whitehall as a whole.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Industry, the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and other Ministers concerned, to arrange for
further consideration to be given to the proposal that the diplomatic Service Allowance should not be paid toseconded officers serving with Missions overseas.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, agreed that therecommendations of the Report of the Committee onRepresentational Services Overseas should be acceptedon the basis proposed in CP. (64) 34.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to give further consideration, in the light oftheir discussion, to the terms of the statement announcing the Governments decisions on the report.(4) Agreed that these decisions should be announcedsimultaneously with the publication of the report, whichshould be deferred until the other commonwealth governments had been informed of the governments intentions and the necessary consultations with staff associations had been completed.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th February, 1964.
