Foreign ^    2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the recent decision of the affairs French   Government   to   recognise   the   Communist   chinese communist Government might prove to be a prelude to the admission ofChina Communist China to the United Nations. There was no present intention, however, that we should change the status of our ownrepresentation in Peking.Cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 7thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary said that discussions with theGovernment of the United States on the creation of an international peace-keeping force in Cyprus were making encouraging progress.The force would be under our command and our own contribution would be of the order of 4,000 troops, as compared with 1,200 fromthe United States and each of the other major members of theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). In practice it might notbe necessary to reinforce British forces now in Cyprus to the full extent of our contribution, since it had been agreed that some accountcould be taken of forces now deployed in the Sovereign Base Areas.The United States Government were disposed to make their acceptance of these arrangements conditional on agreement that theforce should not remain in Cyprus for more than three months(although an extension of this period might be negotiated); that itshould be instituted in the Island only after the Government of Cyprushad made a formal request to that effect; and that a mediator shouldbe appointed in a fresh attempt to promote a political settlement. if agreement could be reached on this basis, it would be necessary, asa matter of urgency, to seek the co-operation of the other NATOcountries involved and to persuade the Government of Cyprus to endorse the proposed arrangements. The United States had undertaken to give us full diplomatic support in these approaches.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If the force were to be required to exercise powers of arrest,trial and punishment of Cypriot citizens, difficult political and legalquestions would arise. It would also be necessary to determine from what source the force would derive its political authority and from whom it would receive its orders. These questions should be studiedurgently.(b) In so far as the United Kingdom contribution to the forcerequired the despatch of additional troops to Cyprus, these couldbe drawn either from Germany or from that element of the strategic reserve in the United Kingdom which had been assigned to NATO.While it would be right to invite the Supreme Allied Commander,Europe, to say which source he would regard as preferable, he shouldbe informed that the Government would themselves see advantage in moving troops from the United Kingdom rather than fromGermany.(c) The arrangements now under discussion with the UnitedStates Government envisaged that, if the international force requiredto be strengthened, reinforcements should be provided by the participating countries in proportion to their original contributions.This could impose a heavy additional liability on the United Kingdom.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary, toCM. 8 (64)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Holy Loch(previous reference:CM. (64) 6thConclusions,Minute 8)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (64) 25) and by the Foreign Secretary and theMinister of Defence (CP. (64) 26) about the Memorandum of understanding under negotiation with the United States Governmenton claims and indemnity for accidents resulting from the stationingof nuclear vessels in the Holy Loch.The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of furtherconsideration of the issues involved in consultation with the other ministers concerned and in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, he remained convinced that, if we were to honour the undertakings given to Parliament by the then Minister of defence in 1961, we must maintain that the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) Status of Forces Agreement was applicable to claims arising from the Holy Loch arrangements, although we might agree to settle through diplomatic channels (on the lines proposedby the United States Government for all claims) such claims as werenot covered by the Status Agreement. It would also be necessary toconsider whether legislation should now be introduced to make it possible for the Government to give effect to an arrangement of thiskind, so far as claims covered by the Status Agreement were concerned, by extending to the operators of nuclear-propelled ships the principle of sole and absolute liability of the operator which hadalready been applied to the operators of nuclear installations on landby the Nuclear Installations (Licensing and Insurance) Act, 1959.In discussion there was general agreement with these views. Thefollowing main points were made:(a) The omission of any reference to the Status of ForcesAgreement in the Holy Loch arrangements would expose theGovernment to serious criticism and charges of breach of faith.Moreover, the general formula now proposed by the United StatesGovernment, whereby all claims would be dealt with &quot; through diplomatic channels in accordance with customary procedures forthe settlement of international claims under generally acceptedprinciples of law and equity &quot;, imposed no legal liability on them,since no principles of law and equity were yet generally accepted inthis context.(b) There could be little doubt that the United StatesGovernment would in practice find it necessary to satisfy any claims arising from the operation of one of their submarines. But it mightbe difficult for them at this stage to revise substantially the wordingwhich they were now suggesting, since it had already been submittedto the anpropriate Committee of Congress. Moreover, to protractnegotiations might lead to continued difficulty in the supply of certainarrange for consideration to be given to the political and legal implications of the establishment of an international force in Cyprus, in terms of the status and authority which such a force would possess.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to take such action as might be appropriate in order to avoid delay in theestablishment of the international force, once it had beenaccepted in principle.(3) Agreed that, if the force were established, it would benecessary to send further United Kingdom troops to cyprus, preferably from the United Kingdom.The Commonwealth Secretary, who joined the Cabinet later intheir discussion, confirmed that we were approaching agreement withthe United States Government on the proposal to establish aninternational force in Cyprus.
MinisterialResponsibilityfor Education(previous reference:CM. (63) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePrime Minister (CP. (64) 28), proposing that, in the light of public reaction to the recommendations of the Robbins Committee on higher Education, it would now be appropriate to establish a secretary of State for Learning, Education and Science. The Secretaryof State would be in charge of a single Department, consisting oftwo administrative units, each of which would be the responsibilityof a Minister of State. One would be concerned with the schools;further education; teacher training colleges (at least initially); and,possibly, international bodies concerned with education. The otherwould deal with civil science and with all institutions of universitystatus, including the Colleges of Advanced Technology.The Secretary of State for Scotland would remain responsiblefor the schools and the lower ranges of further education in Scotland.Scottish universities, however, would continue to be financed throughthe University Grants Commission. They would therefore be theresponsibility of the new Secretary of State; but he would consult the Secretary of State for Scotland on the appointment of membersof the Commission and other university matters of concern to scotland.At the same time the various scientific research agencies operating under the Minister for Science would be reorganised on the lines recommended by the Committee on the Organisation of Civil Science,CM. 8 (64)special materials needed for our own submarine-building programme.There was some reason to believe, however, that the United states authorities might now be prepared to be co-operative in this matter as a result of the successful negotiation of the safety provisions ofthe Holy Loch Agreement.(c) It would be necessary to give further consideration to theneed for early legislation imposing a sole and absolute liability on the operators of nuclear ships. This, in turn, could lead to criticism ofthe Government for the evident lack of any legal protection againstthe effects of accident up to the present time. It might also appearunreasonable to impose on British ship owners, who might at some future date wish to operate nuclear merchant ships, an obligationwhich had not yet been accepted either by the United States or by russia. On the other hand continued delay in bringing the law into conformity with the undertakings already given to Parliament wouldbe liable to expose the Government to increased criticism when thefacts became known.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to reopen negotiations withthe United States authorities on the basis proposed inparagraph 9 (a) and (b) of CP. (64) 26.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to arrange for an examination ofthe need to enact legislation applying the principle of soleand absolute liability to the operators of nuclear ships.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would, if necessary,discuss with the President of the United States, during his forthcoming visit to Washington, the claims andindemnity provisions to be incorporated in theMemorandum of Understanding governing theadministrative and financial arrangements for UnitedStates Polaris submarines in the Holy Loch.
subject to the institution of arrangements for creating close co-operation between the agencies and the relevant GovernmentDepartments. As a result three new bodies would be created aScience Research Council, responsible for research in the universitiesin pure and applied science; a Natural Resources Research Council;and an Industrial Research and Development Authority, which wouldtake over the majority of the research institutions at present managed by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. These newbodies, together with the Medical Research Council and theAgricultural Research Council, would become the responsibility ofthe new Secretary of State. The National Research development corporation, however, should continue to be associated with theBoard of Trade; and further consideration should be given to thefuture of certain individual establishments, e.g., the Road research laboratory and the Building Research Station.The Robbins Committee had recommended that theGovernments responsibility for the Arts should be transferred fromTreasury Ministers to the new Minister responsible for higher education and science. This proposal, however, had encounteredconsiderable criticism; and it would therefore be preferable to make no alteration for the time being.These changes in Ministerial responsibilities, which could bemade without legislation, should be the subject of a brief generalannouncement in the near future and should be completed in timeto enable the new Department to be created by April or May.In discussion there was general agreement in principle with theseproposals. The following points were made:(a) It would be preferable to avoid too specific or detailed atitle for the new Secretary of State, since this might inhibit theGovernment from making further adjustments in the light of experience. From this point of view the title &quot; Secretary of State for education and Science &quot; should suffice.(b) The substitution of a single Secretary of State for the two ministers who had hitherto been responsible for promoting theinterests of education and science in Cabinet discussions might beheld to imply that the Government would henceforward attach less importance to the claims of ordinary education as distinct fromhigher education and research. For this reason the new ministers of State should be given a status commensurate with the importantresponsibilities which they would discharge.(c) The most appropriate division of functions between the two ministers of State would not necessarily coincide with the presentdistribution of responsibilities between the Minister for Science andthe Minister of Education; and it might therefore be expedient that both Ministers of State should be entitled &quot; Minister of State for education and Science &quot;, the allocation of functions between thembeing left to the discretion of the Secretary of State in the light of(d) It might be held to be anomalous that the Atomic energy authority, which was at present in the charge of the Minister for science, should henceforward be combined with the schools as theresponsibility of the new Secretary of State. Any alternativearrangement, however, would be open to objection at this stage;and, although the question might be reconsidered in due course, theAuthority should initially be brought within the sphere, ofresponsibility of the new Secretary of State.(e) It could be argued that the promotion of civil scientific research should be made the responsibility of a separate Minister,who might well be the Minister in charge of one of the departments which were closely concerned with scientific developments. Thebalance of advantage, however, appeared to incline in favour ofcombining responsibility for civil science with responsibility for
ChannelTunnel(previous reference:CM. (64) 6thConclusions,Minute 7)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposedChannel tunnel project. They had before them memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 29) and the Minister ofTransport (CP. (64) 30).The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their previous meeting the Cabinet had invited him to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Transport, the terms in which the governments attitude towards the Channel tunnel might most appropriately be announced. Agreement had been reached on the terms of theannouncement set out in CP. (64) 29 but not on its timing. Ifspeculation was to be avoided, it was essential that the Governmenfstentative decision to proceed with the project, subject to further discussions with the French Government, should be announcedbefore these discussions took place in order to anticipate any premature disclosure of their scope and purpose. But the Minister ofTransport felt himself committed to announcing jointly with theFrench authorities a decision in principle to proceed; and such anannouncement could be made only after the forthcoming discussions.The question whether, and in what form, private capital might havean opportunity of participating in the project would be forconsideration during these discussions. But in making any announcement it would be desirable, in order to avoid speculationin the shares of the companies concerned with the project, to let itbe known that it was likely to offer little, if any, scope for privateequity capital, since this would be incompatible with the nature ofthe tunnel as a link between two publicly owned transport systems and with the degree of control which it would be necessary for thetwo Governments to exercise over the undertaking. Nor could theGovernment contemplate giving the guarantees which the promoters of a private profit-making enterprise would certainly seek.The Minister of Transport said that it would be a breach of faith with the French Minister of Transport if the Government madea unilateral statement implying either a decision of principle in favourof the tunnel or a predisposition for or against any particular methodof finance without giving the French Government an opportunityto comment on the terms of the statement and of any accompanyingguidance. Since the French authorities apparently believed that theundertaking would provide opportunities for private loan capital and, possibly, for some form of equity also, it might be desirable forany guidance on this point to be confined to indicating that it shouldnot be assumed that the project would necessarily proceed on thebasis put forward by the promoters, who envisaged a measure ofprivate equity capital.In discussion it was suggested that, while the Government could now be reasonably satisfied that the project was technically and economically sound, a final decision to proceed should await further discussion of technical and financial details and should also dependon agreement about the timing of the work in relation to other demands on the economy. On the other hand it would be difficultCM. 8 (64)higher education, provided that more intensive efforts were made toestablish closer links between the research agencies and the relevantDepartments and to disseminate scientific knowledge and expertisemore widely through the processes of administration.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the points made in their discussion,the proposals in CP. (64) 28.
869either to resume discussions with the French Government withoutinforming them of a decision in principle to proceed or to make any public announcement which did not in effect commit the Governmentto undertake the project if satisfactory agreements could be reached on matters of detail and timing. In any event it was desirable that adecision in principle should be conveyed privately to the FrenchGovernment before President de Gaulle held his Press conferenceon 31st January; and, in order to avoid premature public disclosure,it would be desirable for the Minister of Transport to discuss withthe French Minister of Transport as soon as possible the terms of apublic announcement which might be issued by the two Governmentssimultaneously.A decision on the question whether, and in what form, private capital should be allowed to participate in the project could be takenonly after discussion with the French authorities, since it would clearly be difficult for the two halves of the enterprise to be financedon radically different bases. In the meantime, while it was desirableto discourage speculation in the shares of the Channel TunnelCompany, it would be wrong to do so in terms so explicit as to renderthose shares virtually worthless. Special consideration might also have to be given to the prevention of speculation in land values inthe vicinity of the English terminal of the tunnel.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle to proceed with the construction of theChannel tunnel, subject to the conclusion of satisfactoryagreements with the French Government on technical andfinancial arrangements and on the timing of theconstruction programme.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofTransport, to prepare, in the light of their discussion, a revised statement announcing the Governments attitudetowards the tunnel.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport to take an early opportunityto inform the French Minister of Transport in confidence of their decision of principle and to seek his agreement to an announcement on the lines of the statement to beprepared under Conclusion (2) above.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Paris to inform the French Governmentthat the Minister of Transport would take an early opportunity of seeking the agreement of the french minister of Transport to a simultaneous announcement by the two Governments on the lines agreed at Conclusion(2) above.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Transport to discuss further with representatives of theFrench Government the arrangements for financing thetunnel project.FutureAgriculturalPolicy:Cereals(previous reference:CM. (64) 7thConclusions,Minute 4)7. The Minister of Agriculture said that, as a result of the cabinets earlier discussion, the Prime Minister had sent personalmessages to the President of the United States and the Prime ministers of Canada. Australia &quot;and the Argentine, emphasising the importance which we attached to a successful outcome of the current negotiations on arrangements for regulating the United Kingdom cereals market.Preliminary indications suggested that the Canadian government might now accept our proposals and that the Australian andArgentine Governments also might be willing to co-operate, providedthat the United States Government would do likewise. The United
Cabinet Office, Whitehall, S.W. 1,30th January, 1964.States authorities, however, had already indicated, before the PrimeMinister&apos;s message had been delivered to the President, that theywould continue to adhere to their position on certain issues ofprinciple on which they knew that we were unwilling to make concessions.In the first place they had proposed that, in place of anundertaking in general terms that a fair and reasonable balance would be maintained between domestic production and imports, thebalance should be defined by reference to the proportions supplied in a three-year average period ending 1st July, 1964. Although thelevel of imports had remained roughly constant in that period, thelevel of domestic production had increased. Acceptance of the UnitedStates proposal would therefore imply worsening the proportion sofar as the domestic producer was concerned. This was clearlyunacceptable. In addition the United States authorities had proposedthat our commitment to take remedial action should relate not onlyto remedying a decline in the volume of imports below the three-yearaverage but also to ensuring that our oversea suppliers received afair and reasonable share in the growth of our market. Although no precise share of that growth would be specified, the intention wouldbe clear and would be published in the agreement. While it might be appropriate to consider a commitment of this kind in the context ofwider negotiations on the regulation of international trade, in which other participating countries would also be accepting commitmentsas regards their production and trading policies, it was clearlyunacceptable to do so in the context of the present agreement. TheUnited States should therefore be informed that their requests forfurther amendments could not be accepted; and they might be reminded that all our other oversea suppliers were prepared to acceptthe agreement in the terms in which it now stood as a result of thefinal amendments put forward by the Prime Minister in his recentmessage to the Heads of Government concerned.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to inform the UnitedStates authorities that the Government could not accept their most recent proposals for further amendments to thedraft agreement on cereals.
