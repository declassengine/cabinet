Cyprus(previous reference:CM. (64) 16thConclusions,Minute 3)Trade unions and the Law(previous reference:CM. (64) 11thConclusions,Minute 9)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (64) 62) about the desirability of instituting an inquiry into trade union law and practice.The Minister of Labour said that it had become clear that, asa result of the Motion on the Order Paper of the House of Commonscalling for the appointment of a Royal Commission on trade unionlaw and practice and of recent comment on the subject in thePress, the trade unions would be unwilling to co-operate before thegeneral election in any measures directed to establishing a RoyalCommission, although, if the Government were returned to power atthe election, moderate trade union opinion might be willing toco-operate in an inquiry thereafter. Since it would be unwise toappoint a Royal Commission without the co-operation of the tradeunions, the courses now open to the Government appeared to be:(i) to make no announcement before the election; or(ii) to   undertake  in   the  Election   Manifesto   that,   if   a conservative Government were returned to power, they,would set up a Royal Commission soon thereafter; or(iii) to make an announcement in the near future, on the linesof the draft statement annexed to CP. (64) 62, to theeffect that, if the Government were returned to power,they would set up a Royal Commission immediately afterthe election but that no action would be taken in themeantime and none of the interests concerned would beexpected to commit themselves about the attitude whichthey would adopt in that situation.It might be difficult to sustain the first course, particularly inthe light of the measures which the Government intended to take inrelation to monopolies and restrictive practices; and the thirdcourse entailed the risk that Left-wing opinion in the trade unions would be given an opportunity, in the interval before the election,to disseminate the view that, if the Government were returnedto power, they would seek to weaken the industrial power of theunions. The wisest course, therefore, might be to defer anannouncement of the Governmenfs intentions until the election manifesto was published, provided that their proposals could bemade known privately to their supporters in the meanwhile.In discussion it was suggested that, since successiveConservative Governments had resisted for a number of years the pressure of their supporters for the appointment of an inquiry into1. The Prime Minister said that the Security Council of theUnited Nations had now adopted, without dissent, a resolution infavour of the establishment of an international peace-keeping forcein Cyprus and the appointment of a mediator who would seek to resolve the political issues which had provoked the current tension in the Island. Agreement on these measures had only been reached as the result of intensive diplomatic efforts, on which the ministers immediately concerned deserved the Cabinefs congratulations. Itwould now be necessary to consider the scale and nature of ourown contribution to the international force.The Minister of Defence said that it was important that decisions should be reached on these issues as rapidly as possible inview of the need to withdraw at least three major units from Cyprusin the near future.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of these statements.
trade union law and practice, a sudden departure from this policy towards the end of the life of a Parliament would be liable to expose the Government to the charge that they were actuated bymerely political motives. On the other hand there was a strong caseon merits for a review of trade union law, which had not beencomprehensively examined for some 60 years. Such a review was desirable not only in order to assess the effect of the judgment inthe recent case of Rookes v. Barnard, which might on analysis befound to be of less significance than had at first been supposed,but also in order to examine a number of other issues affecting,for example, the right to strike, the protection of individual membersof trade unions and the safeguards against abuse of the unions&apos;constitutional procedures. But, although an inquiry into the law relating to trade unions might be desirable, it was open to questionwhether a body appointed for this purpose could make any usefulcontribution to the solution of the problem of restrictive practicesby the unions, which v/as the issue on which public opinion wasprincipally concerned. If this was so, an announcement of theGovernments intention to appoint a Royal Commission to examineboth issues might serve only to invite their supporters to entertainexpectations which would not be fulfilled, while prejudicing theprospects of securing the co-operation of the trade unions in an inquiry after the election.Nevertheless, there was undoubtedly widespread support, evenamong certain of the trade unions themselves, for the view that theinterests of wage earners were better served by agreements resulting in a reduced labour force and higher wages than by the maintenanceof an inflated labour force by means of restrictive practices; andan appropriate form of investigation might prove acceptable to asubstantial body of public opinion. It might therefore be wise toadopt towards restrictive practices in the field of labour andemployment the relatively neutral approach which the Governmenthad now adopted towards monopolies and restrictive agreements in industry, by recognising that such practices did not invariablyoperate to the detriment of the economy and that some machinery was necessary to identify those which could properly be maintained.The nature of this machinery, which would presumably be different from the machinery employed to examine commercial restrictive practices, would require consideration in consultation with both sides of industry; and public opinion would be likely to appreciate thatthe Government should regard it as unrealistic to seek to promotesuch consultation in the months preceding an election but that, ifthey were returned to power, they should initiate it immediately thereafter. In the event it might prove appropriate to refer the examination of restrictive practices in relation to labour andemployment to the National Economic Development Council andto appoint a separate body, which need not necessarily be a RoyalCommission, to consider the range of the problems arising fromthe current state of the law as regards trade unions.In further discussion there was considerable support for thissuggestion. It was agreed, however, that the issues involved requiredcloser examination.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theLord Chancellor, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother Ministers concerned, to prepare a further draft statement about trade union law and practice on thelines which had emerged from their discussion.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this subject at a subsequent meeting, on the basis of the new draft statement to be circulated in accordance with Conclusion(1) above.
Farm price review(previous reference:C.Q (63) 15thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Minister of Agriculture said that at the outset of the farm Price Review the representatives of the National Farmers&apos;Unions had sought an increase of  55 million in the price guarantees and production grants covered by the review. It might be possible,however, to reach agreement with them on the basis of an increasein the neighbourhood of  30 millions, possibly with some additionalincrease outside the review itself; and he would continue negotiations to this end.  26 million of the increase envisaged by the unionswas represented by an increase of 3d. a gallon in the price of milk.This figure was excessive; and he would seek to restrict the increase to not more than 2-JkL per gallon.Rates 3.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Prime Minister(Previous        (CP. (64) 61), to which was appended a draft public statement on reference:      rates prepared by the Home Secretary and the Chief Secretary,CM. (64) 15th Treasury.Conclusions,Minute 7) The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that it would be unwisefor any public statement on this subject to commit the government at this stage to changing the relative burdens borne by the taxpayerand the ratepayer, since there could be no certainty that such achange would be justified until the Government had received thereports of the Allen Committee on the impact of rates on individualratepayers and of the interdepartmental review of the relationship between central and local government finance. Moreover, it couldnot be assumed that a change would necessarily leave unalteredthe combined total of taxation and rates, since the transfer to theExchequer of some part of the expenditure at present borne by therates might result merely in an increase in other forms ofexpenditure by local authorities rather than in a compensatingreduction in the rates.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The very substantial increase in expenditure on educationwould probably make it essential, in any event, that an increasedshare of this expenditure should be borne by the Exchequer.Moreover, the fact that the burden of rates, unlike that of taxation,was not directly related to the ability to pay would be increasinglyfelt to require a change in the ratio between rates and taxes. Forthese reasons the draft statement could safely include a rather more definite indication that the Government intended, subject to theresults of the current enquiries, to make some adjustment in thisratio.(b) It would be undesirable to mention specifically, at thisstage, the possible transfer of responsibility for teacher training colleges from local to central government.Other amendments to the text were discussed and agreed.The Cabinet Approved the draft public statement on rates appended to cp. (64) 61, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion and to the addition of a passage indicating thatsome alteration in the ratio of rates to taxes was likelyto be required, although it was not possible to forecast itsscale or the methods by which it would most appropriately be effected until the Government had received the reportsof the Allen Committee on the impact of rates on individualratepayers and of the interdepartmental review of the relationship between central and local government finance.
In discussion it was suggested that a significant increase in theprice of milk would not be easily reconciled with the Governmentsefforts to promote price stability in industry. On the other hand theprice of milk had remained unchanged for six years; and, in thelight of the increase in production costs during that period, it wasnot unreasonable that the price should now rise to some extent.There should be little risk that this would result in an unacceptableincrease in production.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof Agriculture.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th March, 1964.
