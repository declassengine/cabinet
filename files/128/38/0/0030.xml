2. The Minister of Defence said that, in accordance with a recent decision by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee,Government spokesmen in the debate in the House of Lords on theDefence (Transfer of Functions) Bill had resisted an amendmentdesigned to substitute &quot; Admiralty Board &quot; for &quot; Navy Board &quot; asthe title of the new Board within the integrated Ministry of defence which was to succeed the present Board of Admiralty. Nevertheless,the Government had been defeated; and it was now necessary todecide what course they should adopt during the forthcoming debate in the House of Commons on consideration of amendments made bythe House of Lords. It should be possible to secure the agreementof the House of Commons to the reinstatement of the title &quot; NavyBoard &quot;. On the other hand the House of Lords might thereafterseek to reverse the title yet again; and in that event the Governmentwould either have to acquiesce when the Bill returned to the Houseof Commons a second time or continue to contest the preference ofthe House of Lords and accept the risk that the Bill, being a measureon which the Upper and Lower Houses of Parliament had failed toreach agreement, could not be enacted during the current Session.In discussion it was suggested that, since the Governmentsspokesmen in the House of Lords had resisted the amendment onthe grounds that the issue at stake was one of substance, it wouldbe unfortunate if, by subsequently acquiescing in the change of title, they appeared to regard the question as no longer of any great significance. On the other hand there would be liable to be considerable support for the change in the resumed debate in theHouse of Commons; and it would be unwise to run the risk ofprecipitating an unnecessary conflict between the two Houses ofParliament, as a result of which the Bill might fail to reach theStatute Book. The balance of advantage, therefore, inclined in favourof accepting the amendment.The Cabinet-Agreed that, during the forthcoming debate in the Houseof Commons on the Defence (Transfer of Functions) Bill,Government spokesmen should advise the House to acceptthe amendment to the Bill made by the House of Lords,whereby &quot; Admiralty Board&quot; would be substituted for&quot; Navy Board &quot; as the title of the new Board within theintegrated Ministry of Defence which was to succeed thepresent Board of Admiralty.CentralOrganisationfor Defence(previous reference:C.C.

The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
SouthViet-Nam(previous reference :CM. (63) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that there had been some indications that the United States Government were contemplating a moreaggressive policy against North Viet-Nam. He had therefore made it clear to the United States Secretary of State that our recent publicendorsement of United States policy in relation to South Viet-Namhad been based on an assumption that that policy would remainprimarily defensive in its emphasis.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of these statements by the foreign secretary.4. The Secretary of State for Industry said that, since the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion about the provision of credit cover bythe Export Credits Guarantee Department (E.C.G.D.) for tradewith Cuba, he had been informed that the Cuban Trade Mission inthis country had indicated that the letters of intent which had alreadybeen issued to four firms in respect of contracts amounting to  1-million would be withdrawn if E.C.G.D. cover were not granted inthe very near future. In addition another 17 firms were negotiating with the Trade Mission for contracts, basing themselves on the government&apos;s decision not to seek to discriminate against normal commercial trade with Cuba. If these opportunities were not to be lost, a very early decision about the provision of credit cover was required.The Foreign Secretary said that, despite the importance ofadhering to our decision of principle, he was concerned at the possiblepolitical effect in the United States if we provided credit cover inrespect of trade with Cuba for as large a figure as  4 million a year,as was implied by the proposal of the Secretary of State for Industry.Moreover, if cover was to be given, it would be more appropriatelyprovided under Section 1 of the Export Credits Guarantees Act,which related to normal commercial transactions, than underSection 2, which was concerned primarily with the promotion ofthe national interest.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) Any undue extension of our trade with Cuba might provokecommercial reprisals in the United States in the form of a boycott of United Kingdom goods. Moreover, although the United StatesGovernment themselves might appreciate the distinction betweenSection 1 and Section 2 of the Act, public opinion in the UnitedStates would be unlikely to regard it as of any great significance.For these reasons we should need to consider carefully applicationsfor credit cover in respect of trade with Cuba.(b) Cover under Section 1 of the Act could only be provided on the advice, and with the consent, of the E.C.G.D. AdvisoryCouncil. Although it appeared likely that the Council would agreethat cover should be made available in the cases immediately inquestion, this could not be taken for granted in the light of theprecarious condition of the Cuban economy. Moreover, the decisionon the amount and terms of any credit provided under Section 1of the Act appeared to rest with the Council; and, if this were so,the Government would be unable to exert any political influence onthese issues. Nevertheless, if cover were to be made available, itmight be preferable that it should be authorised under Section 1.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, to give further consideration,in the light of their discussion, to the proposal that theCommercialPolicyExportCredits(previous reference :CM.

Monopolies,Mergers andRestrictivePractices(previous reference :C.M.(64) 15thConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Industry (CP. (64) 60), to which was appendeda revised draft of the White Paper on monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices.The Secretary of State for Industry said that the draft of theWhite Paper had been revised in the light of the Cabinets previous discussion and of further consultations with the Ministers principally concerned.In the course of discussion the following points were made:(a) In paragraph 16 it would be preferable not to give examples of monopoly practices against which the Governments enlargedpowers would be directed; and the words after &quot; expanded &quot; in thelast sentence should therefore be deleted.(b) Paragraph 18, together with paragraphs 27 and 45, was open to the criticism that it indicated the Governments intentionto seek new powers without specifying their nature and scope. Itwould be unwise at this stage, however, to adopt more precisewording since, until the necessary legislation came to be drafted,it was impossible to be certain what powers it would be practicable to exercise. The procedure by way of injunction, v/hich was apparently used successfully in the United States, might not be appropriate in this country.(c) The implication in paragraphs 23 and 27 that action wouldbe taken to investigate and, if necessary, to prohibit a contemplatedmerger before it was completed appeared to conflict with thestatement in paragraph 25 that the Government did not propose totake powers to prevent a merger while it was investigated. It was intended that the Monopolies Commission should be directed to inquire into a merger which would result in a monopoly or would increase the power of an existing monopoly but that the companies concerned would not be prohibited from proceeding with their plans in the meantime. While they might prefer to await the outcome ofthe investigation, they would be under no compulsion to do so; butthe Government would not appear to be inactive in the face of proposals which were bound to create a monopoly. If. however,the merger took place before the Monopolies Commission couldreport, there might be great difficulty in reversing it since, once a company had been merged with another company, it might not bepossible to reconstitute it. It was not proposed, however, to attemptto reverse a merger in this sense; once the merger had beencompleted, the new undertaking, if a monopoly, would be dealtwith as such. If the undertaking was so organised that a parentcompany held the shares of one or more subsidiaries, it would bepossible to compel the company to distribute its shares in thesubsidiaries among its own shareholders; and, unless the latter were, e.g., members of a single family, it would not be necessary to compel the company to sell the subsidiaries. Difficulty would arise,however, where a single company operated a series of factoriesmaking the components of the company&apos;s product (e.g., in the caseof a manufacturer of motor vehicles) or making a single product forsale in different parts of the country (e.g., a chain of breweries). in. 16 (64)Export Credits Guarantee Department should providecredit cover in respect of the goods for which letters of intent had already been signed by the Cuban TradeMission.(2) Agreed to resume at a subsequent meeting their considerationof the desirability of providing credit cover for furthertrade with Cuba.
either of these situations the individual factories, severed from themanagerial and other services provided by the company and lackingestablished outlets of their own, might well not be considered bypotential investors to be economic undertakings. It might thereforeprove impossible in some cases to compel either an establishedmonopoly or a monopoly newly formed as a result of a merger todivest itself of certain of its interests. But this was not a reason forfailing to take powers which could be used where circumstancespermitted. Moreover, the knowledge that such powers were availablewould be likely to cause undertakings contemplating merger to consult the Board of Trade beforehand; and the need to use thepowers would therefore arise very rarely. On the other hand to take power to suspend mergers pending inquiries might have theundesirable effect of inhibiting the initiation of mergers in caseswhere they would be likely to increase efficiency and thus be to theadvantage of the economy. The substance of paragraphs 23 and 27should therefore remain; but any appearance of internal inconsistencyshould be removed and it should be made clear that action wouldbe taken only after investigation. The implied suggestion in thesecond sentence of paragraph 27 that a completed merger wouldipso facto be treated as a monopoly should be eliminated.(d) It was doubtful whether it would be wise to include inparagraph 40 the words in square brackets referring to small farmers&apos;organisations. To do so would invite the question why it was proposedto make special provision for the protection of small farmers whenno such provision had been included in the interests of small retailersin the Resale Prices Bill; and it was in any event undesirable tosuggest that small farmers&apos; organisations, which it was theGovernments policy to encourage, might have to face the expenseof appearing before the Restrictive Practices Court. On both groundsit might be better to omit any reference to these bodies.(e) Further consideration of the passage on services had not wholly resolved the difficulty of defining the term &quot; commercialservices &quot;. It was necessary to refer to the subject since proposals to investigate restrictive practices in commercial services had been mentioned in the statement made by the Secretary of State for industry in the House of Commons on 15th January, 1964. but while it was desirable to make it clear that it was not intendedto investigate the professions, the use of the term &quot; commercialservices &quot; without a definition would raise embarrassing questions about the scope of the new powers which the Government proposedto take. To refer to &quot; commercial services relating to goods &quot; would create uncertainty about the Governments intentions in relationto a wide range of services, including banking and some forms of insurance; but a more limited phrase, such as &quot; services relating tothe repair, maintenance and cleaning of goods &quot;, would invite the criticism that the Government were proposing to investigate only small business while leaving untouched restrictive practices else wherein the commercial field. If any form of words was used which might include shipping, it would be desirable to make it clear that it wouldbe inappropriate to apply the proposed legislation to ShippingConferences. In all the circumstances the best course might be simply to take power to enable the Monopolies Commission to make ageneral investigation of restrictive practices in commercial servicesand to await their report before deciding what further powers shouldbe taken. This in turn might expose the Government to criticismfor failing to initiate an investigation of restrictive practices in thefield of labour and employment; but it would be unwise to mentionat this juncture the consideration which was being given to theappointment of a Royal Commission to examine the law relatingto trade unions.(/) The section on resale price maintenance had been added tothe draft in order to complete the account of the series of relatedmeasures which the Government were taking with the object of stimulating competition and promoting efficiency in industry and

Since the Resale Prices Bill had already been introduced,however, it would be preferable for the Secretary of State for Industryto set the Bill in its context in the course of his speech in the debate on the Second Reading. Paragraphs 48 to 53 should accordingly be omitted.Certain minor amendments in the text of the draft White paper were proposed and accepted.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry to give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Minister ofAgriculture, to the desirability of referring in paragraph40 of the draft White Paper appended to CP. (64) 60 tothe position of farmers&apos; organisations.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Industry, in consultationwith the Ministers principally concerned, to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to thesection of the draft White Paper dealing with servicesand to submit to the Prime Minister, for circulation tothe Cabinet, a revised draft of the relevant paragraphs.(3) Subject to Conclusions (1) and (2) above and to the incorporation of the drafting amendments agreed in their discussion, authorised the Secretary of State for Industryto arrange for the publication of the White Paper on 5th March, 1964.
