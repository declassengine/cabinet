(64)j.4thjConclusions, Minute tuesday, 25th February, 1964 at 11..00 Jb,2BiTHE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia had recently informed us that the speech from the Throne at the opening of the Legislature in salisbury that day would include a statement that they did not recognise the right of anyone to interfere in the affairs of SouthernEhodesia, that they would not tolerate any such interference andthat they would thereafter pursue their own course within the frame-work of the Southern Rhodesia constitution and would act in all respects as a Government in allegiance to the person of her majesty The Queen.     This statement might well have been regarded by public opinion as tantamount to a unilateral declaration of independence;   and we had therefore sought to persuade the PrimeMinister of the Colony, Mr. Winston Field, to arrange for it to be omitted from the Speech from the Throne.    He had accepted this advice on the understanding that he would himself make a statement to this effect in his own speech during the Debate on the Address.In these circumstances the issue of independence for SouthernRhodesia might come to a head in the near future.This issue confronted us with a grave dilemma.    We did notourselves believe that it would be in the ultimate interests ofSouthern Rhodesia to accelerate a process of normal constitutional development which might be expected to result in Africans securing a majority in the Legislature within about 15 years.      On the otherhand it would be contrary to all our previous practice to concedeindependence to a Colony otherwise than on the basis of majority rule;  and, if we did so, we should alienate, perhaps beyond recall,the sympathy of most of the other members of the Commonwealth.We must therefore seek to devise some compromise which mightaccelerate the pace of constitutional advance in Southern Rhodesiabut, at the same time, keep the situation under political control.For example, we might offer the Government of the Colonyadditional financial assistance, on the understanding that this wouldbe devoted to improvements in African secondary education whichshould hasten the day when a larger number of Africans would be eligible to vote on the &apos;A&apos; roll.    We must also endeavour to allaypublic anxiety that the Government of Southern Rhodesia, onattaining independence, would set aside the constitution, to the disadvantage of the African members of the population; and forThe circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................................TOP  SECRET 18Copy No.............
this purpose we might be able to arrange that the Government of theColony would pledge themselves to accept the ruling of the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council on any change in the constitution which they might propose after independence, on the understandingthat the United Kingdom Parliament, although withdrawing even further than at present from intervention in the affairs of the Colony,would retain the power to legislate in the last resort if theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia endeavoured to proceed with some change in the constitution against the decision of the JudicialCommittee.THE COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had represented very forcibly to Mr. Winston Field the constitutionalobjections to any unilateral declaration of independence and the dangers to which the Government of Southern Rhodesia would exposethemselves if, despite our warning, they made any declaration ofthis kind.    At our suggestion the Governments of Canada, Australiaand New Zealand had also sent messages to Mr, Field, endorsing our attitude and emphasising that, if his Government embarked on a coursiof action which the rest of the Commonwealth could not approve, theycould have no hope of retaining, as they wished, the link betweenSouthern Rhodesia and the Crown.    In addition certain of theGovernments supporters in the House of Commons had agreed to visit Southern Rhodesia, in order to make the Governments attitudeknown in authoritative circles in the Colony.    These steps might yetsuffice to restrain Mr. Field&apos;s Government from precipitate action.Nevertheless, local pressures might compel Mr. Field to make somegesture of independences  and in that event we must concentrate our efforts on persuading him to do so in the manner which would be leastoffensive to constitutional propriety.    If he agreed to make any declaration of independence outside the Legislature, we might be ableto ignore it, at least for a time.    Even if he introduced a resolution in the Legislature, we need not regard him as having committed hisGovernment irretrievably.    But, if he introduced legislation in anattempt to establish the Colony&apos;s independence, the Governor wouldbe required to signify the Royal Assent to the Bill;  and any action ofthis kind would constitute a direct challenge to the Crown in the parliament at Westminster.   The Governor was appointed by theGrown on the advice of the United Kingdom Government and heldoffice at pleasure;  and, in the circumstances in question, it wouldbe necessary to consider whether the Crown should be advised torequire him to demit his office.This situation would raise such grave constitutional issuesthat we must seek, by all the means at our disposal, to reach some compromise settlement.    Mr. Field&apos;s latest proposals for enlarge-ment of the African franchise offered little prospect of a solution ofthis kind; but we must continue to work for agreement on some time-table of constitutional advance which would include both a fixed date for the attainment of an African majority in the Legislature and a fixed date for the independence of the Colony,THE LORD CHANCELLOR doubted whether it would bepossible to defer action against the Government of Southern Rhodesiafor as long as the Commonwealth Secretary suggested.   TheGovernment of the Colony, no less than its Governor, held office atpleasure;  and, if Ministers in Salisbury embarked on any unconstitu-tional course of action, it would be for consideration whether they-2-
should be dismissed by the Crown, either on the advice of the UnitedKingdom Government, or, more doubtfully, in the person of theGovernor.    If they purported to defy such dismissal and to remainin office, they could no longer claim that they were maintaining their loyalty to The Queen;  and, from a constitutional point of view,they would be in revolt against the Crown.    The Governor would be bound to invite the Leader of the Opposition, Sir Edgar Whitehead, toattempt to form a Government;  the latter would undoubtedly seek a dissolution;  and, during the interval of four months between the dissolution and a General Election more moderate counsels mightprevail.    Even if Mr. Field&apos;s Party won the election, we should bebetter placed than at present to acquiesce in the Colony&apos;s independencsince we should be able to claim that we had taken all possible action,short of force, to keep the constitution in being and that the electionitself had given the population of the Colony ample opportunity to reflect on the issues involved before committing themselves to apolicy of unilateral independence.In discussion it was suggested that it would be to our advantage to avoid bringing the issue to a head for as long as possible.    SoutherRhodesia was advancing relatively rapidly in the direction of a non-racial community;  and we should avoid any action which might be interpreted as implying that we regarded the policies of the Colony&apos;sGovernment as differing little from those of the Government of SouthAfrica.    We should therefore hesitate to take such radical action a-sthe dismissal of the members of the Government - a step for whichthere was only doubtful precedent; and we should be prepared toendure a considerable degree of provocative action on the part of theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia before ourselves taking actionwhich we should be unable to reverse.    It was difficult for theGovernment of Southern Rhodesia to accept that they, alone of allthe Commonwealth countries in Africa, had no hope of achievingindependence for another fifteen years;  and we must therefore seek to devise some special form of relationship between the Colony andthe other members of the Commonwealth which, while denying itformal independence for the time being, would nevertheless do justice to its unique status and would demonstrate our determination to accelerate its constitutional advance to final independence as rapidly as possible.    We must also seek to restrain the Government ofNorthern Rhodesia from any intemperate reaction to statements in southern Rhodesia which might be thought to constitute a unilateral declaration of independence;  and we must do all that we could tomaintain the economic links between Northern and Southern Rhodesiawhich had been established when the Federation of Rhodesia and nyasaland was dissolved.The Cabinet -Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for further consideration to begiven to the constitutional issues whichmight shortly arise in relation to SouthernRhodesia.Cabinet Office, S.

If the &quot;freeze&quot; of nuclear deliveryvehicles which the United States Government had proposed were implemented, the Soviet Government, althoughpermanently inferior to the We stern Alliance as a whole interms of nuclear capability, would enjoy permanent superiorityover the European nations alone;   and in these circumstances it would be even more essential that we should be seen toretain an independent capacity to inflict an unacceptable degreeof nuclear damage upon an enemy.   If we could deploy only four Polaris submarines in all, we should run the risk that,during certain periods when only one submarine would be on patrol, an accident might put it out of action;  and, if the credibility of the United Kingdom deterrent was to be main-tained, it might be wise to anticipate this risk by ordering a fifth submarine.   It might also be significant that the FrenchGovernment had apparently decided that their seaborne deter-rent should consist of not less than five submarines.   On theother hand the financial implications of enlarging the Polarisprogramme were formidable;  and a fifth submarine, if ordered,would impose an additional burden on the defence budget whichwould have to be offset by economies in other categories ofmilitary expenditure.THE MINISTER. OF DEFENCE said that the United states authorities had recently established that the period forrefitting a Polaris submarine would be longer than they had originally expected;  and their experience in this respect had caused the Chiefs of Staff to conclude that a fifth submarine was necessary if our deterrent was to remain credible.   Itshould be possible to offset the cost by certain economies inthe forward programmes for other weapons;  and a decision should be reached as a matter of urgency, since UnitedStates production of the weapons system for the Polarissubmarine   would shortly cease and, if we were to construct a fifth submarine, the additional weapons system must be ordered forthwith.-1-
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said thata fifth Polaris submarine would constitute an addition to expenditure in the late 1960s which would be particularly-unwelcome since it would coincide with other heavy demands on our resources at that juncture.   Moreover, certain of themeasures which were apparently contemplated as offsettingeconomies would themselves involve bringing forward to thesame date expenditure which otherwise might not have arisenuntil the 1970s.   There were very considerable financialobjections, therefore, to incurring an additional commitment which, in terms of strategic requirement, had been proposed at a very late stage in the formulation of the programme ofnew weapons construction which was to be announced in theParliamentary debate on defence that week.In discussion there was general agreement that itwould be desirable on operational grounds to order a fifthPolaris submarine, provided that adequate offsettingeconomies could be secured elsewhere in the forward defence programme.The Cabinet -(1)  Invited the Minister of Defence, inconsultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer, to consider, as a matterof urgency, the means by which economiesmight be secured in the forward defence programme on a scale sufficient to offset the cost of ordering a fifth Polarissubmarine.(2) Agreed in principle that, subject to asatisfactory outcome of the enquiry to be undertaken under Conclusion (1)above, a fifth Polaris submarine shouldbe ordered.Cabinet Office, S.
