Copy No... lb....CABINETPOSTMEN&apos;SPAY(previous reference:CM. (64) 40t3iConclusions,Minute 3)CONFIDENTIAL, annex cm. (64) 41st Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday, 23rd July, 1964 at 10. 00 a.m.1.       The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the questionof Postmen&apos;s pay.   They had before them the draft of astatement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he proposed to make a fresh approach to the Secretary of the Unionof Post Office. Workers, Mr, Smith, on the basis of the draft statement.   This indicated that the Government could notnegotiate with the Union while the threat of a strike existed;that, if this threat was withdrawn, the Government would beprepared to negotiate on the basis of advancing some part ofthe 3% per cent wage increase which was due on 1st January,1965, under their existing offer; that the proposed payinvestigation would be completed by 1st January, 1965; and thaton that date the postmen would receive the balance of the 3-1 percent, together with any additional amount recommended by the pay investigation.   This proposal would fully implement theReport of the Committee on the Pay of Postmen (the ArmitageReport) and would be in accordance with the acceptedprocedures for negotiation and settlement of Civil Service wages.Moreover, it left open the period to which the pay investigationwould be related.   It could be based on outside rates of pay inthe earlier period and its outcome consequently be backdated to 1st January 1964; or, alternatively, it could be based on current rates of outside pay and its outcome take effect from 1st January,1965.   Since it appeared that the later pay investigations might bebased on comparisons more advantageous to the postmen, the netoutcome might be more acceptable to them.In discussion the Cabinet first considered the position which might arise if the maximum offer which the Governmentcould contemplate in the course of negotiations provedunacceptable to the Union.   If the Union then carried out thestrike which they had called, only an improvised postal service,based on voluntary labour, could be maintained.   This would belikely to be wholly inadequate to the needs of business andindustry.   If the Forces were used to maintain a service,the National Union of Railwaymen might call a sympatheticstrike; and this would necessitate the declaration of a State ofEmergency, which would require Parliament to remain sitting.-1-The circulation of this paper has been strictly limited.It is issued for the personal use of................................P  SECRET
Some difference of view was expressed about the rateof increase for 1964 which the Government could contemplateunder the terms of the new proposal.   On the one hand it wassuggested, that, in view of the demand by the Union for anincrease of 10-j? per cent in the face of the Governmentsexisting offer of 4 per cent, it was improbable that anythingless than the median of these two extremes would be acceptable to the Union.   Since this would absorb the whole of the l\ percent available for the first two years under the government proposal, there would be strong pressure for a further increase from 1st January, 1965;   It also seemed improbable that anylesser rate would then be acceptable to the Union as the outcome of negotiations on the basis of the pay investigation.   On the otherhand it could be maintained that an increase of this order was quite unjustified on the merits of the case, would be unacceptable to a considerable body of opinion both in Parliament and outside and would have widespread repercussions.   The precise figurecould be determined only in the course of negotiations withthe Union,   Moreover, there were further variations whichmight lead to a more generally acceptable offer on the basisof an initial increase of more than 4 per cent back-dated to 1st January, 1964, coupled with a further increase within the range of 7^ per cent, dated from the conclusion of the negotia-tions.   This possibility, too, could be explored in the furtherexchanges with the Union.In further discussion the following additional points weremade:(a) The statement to be made to the Union should not beopen to misunderstanding as accepting the Union&apos;s case on thetime likely to be taken for the completion of the pay investigation.This could in fact be completed within a short period if theUnion gave their co-operation;  and it v/ould be preferablemerely to say that on any view the investigation would becompleted by 1st January, 1965.(b) The reference nee in the draft statement to a withdrawalof the threat to strike by the Union as a condition of theGovernments willingness to renew negotiations might be omitted from any published statement, although the Chancellor of theExchequer would no doubt make the point to the Union in discussion.(c) It would also be preferable to omit the reference to thefact that the new proposal was in accordance with the acceptedprocedures for negotiation and settlement of Civil Service wagesand to confine the statement given to Mr. Smith to a factualindication of the basis on which the Government were preparedto negotiate.
(d) There might be advantage in publishing the statementimmediately the Chancellor of the Exchequer had seen Mr. Smithin order to forestall-any misrepresentation by the Press of thecourse of the discussion.   On the other hand this might be disadvantageous in so far as it might be preferable to allow theUnion an opportunity to consider the offer before it becamepublic.   This was an issue vhich could best be decided in thelight of the course of the initial discussion between theChancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Smith.(e) It would be preferable that the discussion which hadbeen arranged between the Prime Minister and the Leader ofthe Opposition should approximately coincide with any discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Mr. Smith.The Cabinet -(1)     Invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to be guided, inhis forthcoming interview withthe Secretary of the Union of post Office &quot;Workers, by thepoints made in their discussion,(2)    Agreed to resume their considerationof the subject of Postmen&apos;s pay ata subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S. W. 123rd July, 1964-3-
