Economic 2.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ChancellorProspects Qf tf,e Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP. (64) 3 and 8)for 1964 on j-jjg economic prospects for 1964 and the level of public expenditurerespectively.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the most recent reports on the state of the economy confirmed that a vigorous expansion was now in progress and that demand was likely to rise steadily during theyear. So far the slack in the economy had accommodated this process;but the current rate of expansion could not be sustained indefinitelyand it would become increasingly important to moderate the advance to a pace which we could hope to maintain steadily in the longer term.The rise in imports would cause the balance of payments to turndownwards to some extent during the year; and some fall in the reserves would probably be inevitable. This need not give rise to concern, provided that the economy as a whole was seen to remainsound. The policies which should be adopted for this purpose were three-fold:(i) We should not add further to existing commitments in thefield of public expenditure, which were already very large.(ii) We should take all possible steps to make more rapid growthpossible, particularly by promoting greater mobility of labour and byaccelerating the release of labour from declining industries.(iii) We should put the maximum of emphasis on the maintenanceof a competitive price structure and the development of a positiveincomes policy.The most recent discussion on incomes policy in the national economic Development Council (N.E.D.C) had been moderatelyencouraging; and the Government might hope to secure from bothsides of industry a reasonable measure of recognition of theimportance of maintaining price stability.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, as regards public expenditure, the Estimates for 1964-65 were likely to show anincrease of some 6 - 2 per cent over the Estimates for the current year.This represented a lower rate of increase than had originally beenforeseen. On the other hand the exceptional circumstances which hadjustified the very high rates of increase in earlier years no longerexisted; in 1963-64 the economy had required a stimulus, whereas in 1964-65 it would be necessary, for the reasons explained by theChancellor of the Exchequer, to keep public expenditure under firmcontrol. For this purpose:(i) We should seek to secure, if possible, further economies in theEstimates for 1964-65.(ii) We should avoid embarking on new projects which would increase the demand on resources in the period immediately after thatyear. In particular, we should reduce the 1965-66 public service investment programme by about 3 per cent, holding this amount in reserve against a more detailed scrutiny of the programme later in theyear; and we should decide that expenditure on major defence works in the United Kingdom in 1965-66 should not be more than about per cent greater than in 1964-65.(iii) We should also avoid taking decisions on major new projects of a long-term character, involving expenditure beyond 1967-68, until we could examine them in their totality and could judge whether theycould be accommodated within a reasonable programme of total public expenditureSECRET4148-3 a 2CM. 3 (64)Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The following main points were made:(a) In view of the prevalent assumption that the economy wason the verge of a new round of inflationary pressure which might indue course require drastic correction, it would be advisable toemphasise in public the difference between the present situation andthe circumstances in which earlier economic crises had developed. the economy was now more soundly based than on former occasions; thebalance of payments was now better placed to take the strain ofeconomic expansion; and there was greater awareness, particularly as the result of the work of N.E.D.C. of the importance of combiningeconomic growth with stability of prices. It would be unrealistic to suppose that, in the months immediately ahead, the trade unions would endorse unreservedly an incomes policy of the kind which theGovernment would favour. Nevertheless, their spokesmen on theCouncil were not unaware of the contribution which such a policy might make to the growth of the economy; and they would probablybe willing to continue to co-operate with the Government in thisrespect, provided that the emphasis of the Councils discussions was placed on the stability of prices rather than on the restraint of incomes.(b) Earlier economic crises had tended to be precipitated byspeculative pressure on sterling; and this had itself derived from the doubts entertained by holders of sterling about the ability of theUnited Kingdom economy to sustain a marked expansion of private investment. Once again it appeared likely that, in the months ahead,private investment would rise more sharply than had been expectedat an earlier stage. It would be necessary, however, to avoid suddenor drastic measures to restrain its expansion, since these would be liable to undermine the confidence of industry and to precipitate acontraction of investment which it would be difficult to reverse.(c) One of the most fruitful measures which might be taken inthis context would be an expansion of the constructional industries,which were probably the weakest element in the economy. It wouldbe necessary to maintain constant pressure on these industries, andon the professions which determined the standards and specificationsto which they worked, to adopt more economic methods of operation and to increase productivity. The new National Building agency should make a significant contribution to these purposes. Butmeasures of this kind could not be expected to bear fruit for several years; and in the interim it would be desirable to avoid any drasticcurtailment of programmes of public investment which mightundermine the confidence of the constructional industries. Moreover,it might be inexpedient to prescribe any fixed limit on the growth ofsuch programmes, since they had necessarily to be adjusted from timeto time in the light of new circumstances.(d) The expansion of the economy was being reflected withvarying intensity in different industries and in different parts of thecountry. It would be important to resist local pressures for enlargement of the growth areas which had been created in the North-East and elsewhere; but it would be equally important to adopt adiscriminating approach to the problems of sustaining economic growth, particularly as regards the distribution of labour. It might become desirable to reconsider the existing distribution of industrypolicy in this connection.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals in CP. (64) 3.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Deedes), to consider how public opinion might be informed in greater detailabout the justification of the policies which theGovernment were adopting in the light of the economic prospects for 1964.
Resale price maintenance(previous reference:C.C. (62) 45thConclusions,Minute 5)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (64) 13) on resale price maintenance,together with a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Industry(CP. (64) 11) on monopolies, restrictive practices and resale price maintenance.The Secretary of State for Industry said that it would be desirableto declare the Governmenfs policy on resale price maintenance beforethe debate on 17th January on a Private Member&apos;s Bill proposing itsabolition. It would be important to present the decision in the context of proposals for further action to deal with monopolies, mergers and restrictive practices in the field of goods and services.In the last three or four years the public attitude to resale price maintenance had changed. Both the Labour and Liberal Parties had declared in favour of its abolition; the Consumer Council had reportedagainst it; and the report of the Monopolies Commission condemningresale price maintenance as applied to electrical accessories for cars,which would shortly be followed by a similar report on wallpaper,would give further support to the view that resale price maintenancewas contrary to the national interest. The Government had committed themselves to a policy of modernising Britain and promoting a more efficient use of resources. This policy would fail to carry convictionif they were to tolerate the continuance of a practice so manifestlyat variance with it.He had considered whether it would be possible to achieve theabolition of resale price maintenance while allowing the interests affected in individual cases to&apos; present the arguments for its retentionbefore an independent tribunal, e.g., the Monopolies Commission.But the Commission would require fresh statutory authority to operateexplicitly in the field of resale price maintenance; and there would be considerable difficulty in defining the criteria which it should observefor this purpose. Moreover, some 40 or 50 groups of trades and industries would be entitled to take advantage of the opportunity to appear before the Commission, and it might take up to 10 years to dispose of them completely. Recourse to the Restrictive PracticesCourt would be equally unsatisfactory. It would be necessary not onlyto define a new justifiable issue, which would inevitably prove to be amatter of prolonged controversy, but also to introduce a fresh formof pleading, since in many cases resale price maintenance dependednot on a written agreement but on unilateral action by the manufacturers which could not easily be made the subject of a formalprosecution. Here, again, complex legislation would be required and valuable time would be lost. For these reasons the right course wouldbe to enact in the present Session a short and simple Bill making resale price maintenance by individual manufacturers illegal, subject to exceptions in favour of certain retailers, e.g., booksellers and, possibly,pharmaceutical chemists.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) The economic case for the total abolition of resale price maintenance had been exhaustively argued over a period of several years; and informed opinion was now virtually unanimous in. 3 (64)(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as chairman of theEconomic Policy Committee, to arrange for the Committeeto consider the means by which the expansion and modernisation of the constructional industries might most effectively be promoted.(4) Agreed to defer a decision on the proposals in CP. (64) 8until the report of the inquiry to be conducted under conclusion (3) was available.
condemnation of the practice. Even though the economic benefit ofabolition would not be realised immediately, The Government would at least be seen to be showing determination in modernising the economy and encouraging price stability. But, if the Governmentfailed to abolish resale price maintenance, this would be widelyregarded as a victory for the sectional interests of the largemanufacturers.(b) On the other hand a decision to abolish resale price maintenance would be liable to encounter strong opposition; and thearguments in its favour would be pressed particularly by smallretailers, who would feel, rightly or wrongly, that their livelihood was at stake. Moreover, if the abolition of resale price maintenancepreceded the additional action against monopolies and restrictive practices proposed in CP. (64) 11, the Government would appear tobe more concerned to penalise the individual retailer than to curb the powerful industrial company.(c) It was unfortunate that in two cases, tobacco and books, ithad been judged, after full examination, that resale price maintenancewas not contrary to the national interest. If the Government now decided, without further enquiry, that resale price maintenance was inall other cases contrary to the national interest, they would be accused of proceeding unjustly and it would be argued that trades in whichthe practice might have as much to commend it as had been foundto be the case with tobacco and books had been condemned unheard.(d) On the other hand the general case against resale price maintenance had already been accepted by public opinion. A specialexemption for the book trade could be justified on cultural grounds,while the judgment in the case of the tobacco industry had beengiven in a context of monopoly conditions which no longer existed.To admit the possibility of further exceptions to the general rule would not only argue a lack of conviction in the strength of theeconomic case but would also entail substantial delay. It could bemaintained that no question of justice was involved, since the factthat resale price maintenance represented an uneconomic use of resources was not in dispute and it was on those grounds alone thatthe Government would be required to defend their decision.(e) Nevertheless, it might be desirable to take powers to abolish resale price maintenance but to vest in the Secretary of Statefor Industry a discretion to vary, in the case of particular trades orindustries, the date at which abolition would take effect and to provide that, within that period, individual interests affected should have theopportunity of presenting to a tribunal, appointed for the purpose,their arguments in favour of continuing resale price maintenance intheir particular case. Such a procedure might make it possible forthe Government to demonstrate their conviction that resale price maintenance was against the national interest unless the contrary wereproved which would in itself represent a considerable advance onall previous declarations of policy while avoiding the appearance ofinjustice which would attach to immediate action to make the practiceillegal.(/) The legal implications of abolishing the practice and ofestablishing machinery to consider its retention in individual cases would need further study. So far as individual cases were concerned,it could be argued that the decision should in each case be reserved to the Government. But this would involve a series of debates inParliament and would import political controversy into matters whichshould preferably be decided on objective grounds. For these reasons it might be preferable to entrust the decisions to some form of independent tribunal. This procedure had been adopted in the caseof restrictive practices and had worked satisfactorily.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that astatement of the Governments policy on resale price maintenancewould have to be made on Wednesday, 15th January. The statement
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th January, 1964.would need to be consistent with the Governments declared policy for the modernisation of the country&apos;s economy but should also haveregard to the other considerations raised in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.The statement should therefore endorse in general terms the view thatresale price maintenance represented an uneconomic use of resources and was contrary to the national interest but should indicate that, inorder to avoid injustice, individuals who believed that in their particular circumstances it could be defended would have anopportunity to argue their case. It would be essential, however, tomake it clear that, on the main issue of proscribing resale price maintenance, the Government intended to act with speed and decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Industry and the Minister ofDefence to prepare, as a matter of urgency, a draft statement of Government policy on resale price maintenance on the lines indicated by the Prime minister in his summing up.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting on thefollowing day.
