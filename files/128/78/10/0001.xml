The United States Administration was determined to ^^^F^p the Straits of Hormuz open for commercial traffic, by military^ EjKis if need be, and was already deploying substantia] forces in the s area.    They wanted, however, to see a greater state of readinesslri case of emergency, and they had asked Her Majesty&apos;s Government to consider reinforcing British contingency arrangements in three Aspects -bringing a Mine Counter Measures (MCM) force to the editerranean, or better still to the Arabian Sea;loying extra Royal Navy ships in the Armillac.      by taMR^art in joint military exercises with the Gulf state&quot;sTJlftkAt a meeting of MdiKe% earlier in the morning there had been _ general agreement tha^^fore the Government entered into any firm commitment to increasfa British activity in the Gulf area m support of United States forces, there needed to be clear political understanding with the United States Administration as to the objectives of any intervention and the nature of the militaryoperations concerned.

No doubt the United Kingdom^A^ould have in the end to become involved,  if the United States became ^^^bliged to take military action in the Gulf area.
