In the discussion on the base figure his ^urltlon had been that the United Kingdom had already moved a long way to        tbe European Council and that it was not for the United Kingdom &lt;yy\^   ma^e further moves.

In the meantime theon might come forward with some figures.

His understanding was that these arguments HJh U^ be reinforced by a legal obligation if the refund were not paid \^ X^31 December.   At least in negotiation, the United Kingdom shouldrline the breach of undertakings and might argue that the payment terest would be equitable.

Apparently in frustration at this ack of success some pickets had resorted to blocking major highways. s&gt; ^e P0lice had successfully countered this action, which had tended to ^/V^ienate public opinion, and prosecutions were being considered. He ^)j^mself was seeing the Nottinghamshire County Council later that day about financial consequences of their additional expenditure on policing use of the coal industry dispute and picketing by the NUM.    It would become known that the Government did not intend to penalise the or other local authorities in a similar position, through the nt and holdback system for additional expenditure on policing the dispute.n dis^ !s^on,  the following main points were made -a.   \^he position in the steel industry varied from plant to plant.    At some the trade unions were being more co-operative in securing supplies of coal and coke than their public statements suggested. Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (TGWU) hadinstructed mfsjmembers not to unload a ship carrying coke for the tks.    It wa.s likely that the courts would be injunction against the union, requiring them &apos;action.

CONFIDENTIAL,     pRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,  said that particularly uring the next few days Ministers should avoid any public comment  n tne coal industry dispute, except for law and order aspects. Theuture of the coal industry dispute might be significantly affected by ^e number of miners returning to work on Monday 2 April.    The management  ^ the coal industry was handling the dispute well; and it must continue carry the prime responsibility.    Although the response of the steel gustry to the consequences of the dispute was essentially a matterthe management of that industry, the Secretary of State for Trade and try should keep in close touch with the Chairman of the Britishorporation.    In the light of the potential attitude of the railway s&gt;&gt;\officials of the Department of Transport should be involved in  ^uvar meetings held by the Secretary of State for Energy to review Pr ^ess of the coal industry dispute.et -Cabinet Office 30 March 1984CONFIDENTIAL
