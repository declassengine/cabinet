CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the long-term prospects for progress in the Lebanon remained poor. The reconciliation process and the Security Plan were both bogged down. But the arguments against premature withdrawal of the Multinational Force (MNF) were as strong as ever.    Efforts continued, in onsultation with the Governments of the other countries contributing the MNF, to produce conditions in which a withdrawal would be ible.   Meanwhile, indications had been received a week earlier the Lebanese Government was preparing for military action by the e army to close the so-called Shuweifat Gap in order to prevent cotit&lt;rni&gt;ed infiltration of hostile forces into Beirut.    Although the Leba^^e^Government&apos; s motives were understandable, the ability of the Lebane^^jmy to achieve success was doubtful.   The proposed action would Sa^^y case lead to the complete breakdown of the ceasefire and, at xfaysaxne time, increase the degree of American military involvement.    Because of its isolated position and proximity to the likely scerre of operations, the British contingent to the MNF would he put at particularly grave risk.

There was no doubt that, if the.Lebanese army took action to close the Shuweifat Gap, British troops would be atcial and unacceptable risk because of their location and ation.    They might expect some gunfire support from United s forces but ground support was unlikely.    It wasre for consideration whether the contingent should be awn at once, unless assurances could be obtained fromleans and from the Lebanese Government that there be no attack without advance consultation and without sufficient time for the British contingent to be moved before the fighting began.b.

CONFIDENTIALat this stage on a withdrawal.    But the risks remained very real, and the attitude of the United States Administration was still in some doubt.    Urgent action should therefore be taken in Washington, in the capitals of the other countries contributing to the MNF, and in Beirut to reinforce earlier representations.    The wording of the communication to the United States Government would require careful v      consideration; but it should be made clear that in the British (^&gt;v\Government&apos; s view an attack by the Lebanese army of the kind under x^yy  scussi n would in effect destroy the mandate under which the MNF \ &quot;CPJK a peace-keeping force was operating, and would put the British&quot;&quot;ingent in direct and particular danger, and that for these reasons &apos; an attack, or information establishing a clear intention to such an attack, would be likely to lead to the withdrawal of \ish contingent.binet -the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary to take actiism on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in her summing up.THE FOREIGN AND&gt; 9M^d?JWEALTH SECRETARY said that, as agreed in separate Ministerial discusl^WL^ction had been taken through the Swiss, as Protecting power for/C^^nited Kingdom in Argentina, to notify theArgentine Government bilateral talks with normalisation of relations should not be secret and be on the agenda.

CONFIDENTIALthe European Community and the United Kingdom was arguing in the context of discussions of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) for a freeze on milk prices.

Liquid milk prices had ^increased at a faster rate in other member states of the Community than the United Kingdom, and the average returns to our producers from Lk sales were lower   than in most other member states. Moreover, ^ish milk producers faced serious difficulties.
