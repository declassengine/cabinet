The Commission was exploring whether xt could now put forward a proposal on the budget imbalance.    He would be consulting some of his colleagues later that day.    In discussion it was stated that at the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Finance) on \  April there had been no detailed discussion of the question of correcting y6 budget imbalances but that the Finance Ministers expected to have sensibility for carrying on the further work on budgetary discipline.JHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that the CouncilMinisters (Agriculture) on 30-31 March had reached agreement on _8ricultural pricey and related measures.

It would be most advantageous, however, if any uncertainty about the detailed operation of the milk quota/superlevy scheme were removed as soon as possible.    It was also pointed out that, where the United Kingdom was opposed to a particular proposal such as the treatment of the Republic of Ireland under the quota/superlevy scheme, there could be W advantage in being able to register this opposition in a vote, even the proposal was likely to be carried on a majority vote.
