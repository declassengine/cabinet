Against the administrative and cial advantages had to be set the concern felt in all parties about the treatment of the unemployed.    Recently this had focused most on the long-term unemployed; this change would affect only those newly unemployed.

Mr Heathfield, and Mr McGahey oPtb^?Scottish NUM, had taken no part in these interviews; it was possi^^^at they were trying to distance themseives from Mr Scargill.    Alterr^tWly, it was possible that the, three NUM leaders had concerted tacrv^sin which each would play a &apos; different role; but some of the personalities involved were volatile, and it was hard to reach a confident judgment.41 pits were working normally; 2 were on an were producing some coal - 3 at nearly norm ^ power stations amounted to 18 million tonnes; only 250,000 tonnes the previous week.

There were some signs of a movement back to work among coalminers, though in most parts of the country it was only at a trickle.&apos;   3 pits in Lancashire had originally been on strike but now had attendance at 65 per cent of normal.    It was likely that many miners on strike had been reluctant to return to work while talks between the NCB and NUM were in progress and there seemed to be some prospect of an early settlement to the dispute.   Now that the talks had collapsed they  ht change their attitude.    The next few days would be significant, particular, there was a meeting of the National Executive of the &gt;hat morning, at which it was possible that moderate opinion would seg^jpto express itself.    NCB management would increase its already si h&gt; gE)tial efforts to persuade miners on strike to return to work; let^ypi Jtp this effect would shortly be sent to the homes of all strikingminers.    Government spokesmen should continue to emphasise the damage that was being done by the strike to the coal industry&apos;s prospects and to the physical condition of its pits, and the excellent conditions available to miners if they returned to work.THE HOME SECffiETA^Y said that the police were reporting clear signs of a weakening or^^^ve among pickets.
