The British contingent to the MNF was in a better position to assist in the evacuation from their present position aboard the RFA Reliant than if they had still sheen deployed in Beirut.    It was a tribute to the way in which the ^ntingent had operated in conditions of great danger that they had at any time been targeted by artillery over the past year. }osals for gallantry awards were under consideration.ssion, the point was made that the United Kingdom could come ssure to evacuate the nationals of Commonwealth countries British residents from Beirut.   Great care would have to ensure that those concerned would be accepted by their igin if there were any question of evacuating them to ign Base Areas in Cyprus.    It would be important to keep uch with the Americans over such an evacuation.

The time had come for the Uy^&lt;\ Government to contribute to public debate on these matters.   &gt;fefeo^r, the Treasury and Civil Service Committee were about to call for&lt;^pa^erCONFIDENTIAL50
on the issues; and the Government would have to comply.   The right course would be to publish an early Green Paper.    Previous discussions within Government of the issues had revealed problems.    In particular, forecasts of individual programmes were at once misrepresented as Government commitments or Treasury aims.    He proposed a different approach.    The Green Paper should give historic figures,  showing past expenditure trends; it should also draw attention to likely pressures or further increases in expenditure.    But the main argument of the per would be based on projections of aggregate levels of public enditure and taxation over the period to 1993-94.    The projections assume that the gross domestic product (GDP) would increase at a 2 I. per cent a year, and that public expenditure would be held  s&apos;ta^rj: in real terms, up to 1988-89.    For the rest of the period, projections would be made.   The main case would assume per cent a year in GDP, with public expenditure held real terms.   Alternative projections, with GDP growing at of li per cent a year, and public expenditure growing in real per cent a year, would also be shown.    It would be assumed that the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) would be equal to 1 per cent of QBfsby the end of the period.    The projections would showthe higher rate and public expenditure was held den (other than revenues from the North Sea) in d 32 per cent of GDP, just below the level of way above the-early 1960s.    On the other hand, rate and public expenditure was allowed to the non-North Sea burden would stay above was widely held to be excessive, for almostinet agreed in principle that such a K/^e thought that it would be advantageous Budget.    Since several other documents fpe published at that time, .it wouldthat, if GDP constant, the 1993-94 would bet 1973-74 but Blrf.ll1 if GDP grew at the rise at 1 per cent the level of 1978-79 the whole period.

It was undoubtedly desirabT^^^promote public debate and understanding of the issues.    The&lt;n were evident difficulties about publishing detailed-forecast* for individual programmes so far into the future.    It was, however, open to question whether debate and understanding would be effectively promoted if theGovernment&apos;s contribution was confined aggregate figures.    The document propos regarded as of great political and socialeffect, a statement of the Government s viof the development of British society. It bring out that there were strong demographic a making for continued growth in public expenditu continuation of existing policies in all public e programmes would make it difficult or impossible t growth.    Only in this way could public opinion be the hard choices that would have to be faced.production of6 would be ficance and, in important aspects necessary to er factors that the ture ent such re ofb.     It would be important to bring out more clearly that^ptt^v proposed Green Paper was illustrative and non-committal.

CONFIDENTIALthan suggested in C(84) 6.    This applied particularly to the level of the PSBR in 1993-94, which was central to the calculations.c. Publication of a Green Paper about longer-term prospects for public expenditure would immediately raise questions about the Government&apos;s views on the longer-term prospects for unemployment. Ministers would need to be ready to deal with such questions.d. Some members of the Cabinet suggested that a decision to publish a document on the lines suggested in C(84) 6 would be-^-vpremature.    It would be better to prepare more detailed material, ^.^rocluding material on individual programmes, for consideration by v^M^jxisters collectively and then to decide whether to publish. &lt;^&amp;a-j&gt;pst this, it was argued that previous experience showed that it ifficult to prepare detailed material on individual pi^p^ammes without leaks and subsequent misrepresentation in the meala.    The approach suggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was the only practicable possibility; and the time was ripe for the Government to contribute to the public debate on expenditure and taxati^rnrsin the longer term.e.     A Gr overall bur structure of it was arguabT economic ground entail some shift&quot; Secondly, it was n capital allowancesdiscussing the longer-term prospects for the taxation should also include a discussion of the ax system.    This had two main aspects. First, it would be right on both social and ise tax thresholds dramatically.    This would burden of taxation towards companies, y to bring &quot;tax expenditures&quot;, such as anies and tax relief for life assurancepremiums, into account^.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing u^^f^riiscussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that a Green Paper or ot#ef Ji\scussion document, broadly on the lines indicated in C(84) 5, shou]&lt;c^^published at the time of the 1984 Budget.    It should concentrate on a^gfegates and avoid detailed figures for individual programmes.    Its texC^Wuld, however, include a _ discussion of the factors generating &gt;^2ures for increased public expenditure, such as demography and, i^Tsome programmes, techology, so as to bring out the need for reductions^ expenditure in areas not affected by these factors.    The presentation should emphasise the illustrative and non-committal nature of the dement.    In particular, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should give Possibility of using a wider range of assumpt C(84) 6; but the Cabinet recognised that, if tocj assumptions were used, the conclusions to be drc would be undesirably blurred.     The Chancellor ofalso consider what could usefully be said in the doc*J  rt^about &quot;tax expenditures&quot; and the structure of the tax system, on^CfteMines suggested in discussion.    Those members of the Cabinet&lt;$fo&gt;^ished to be consulted about the drafting of the document or particu^^irts of it should inform the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   No specia^J^uncement of the forthcoming publication of the document would be ma^gb^: the Chancellor of the Exchequer was free to make it known in re^WeAto inquiries that it was expected to appear in due course.eration to the an suggested in and varied m the document chequer shouldCONFIDENTIAL

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C(84) 7) on capital and current expenditure.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that successive Public Expenditure \White Papers had shown a decline in the proportion of capitaltfenditure within the public expenditure planning totals.   A table 1) on the usual lines in the forthcoming 1984 White Paper would ^est a fall of nearly 40 per cent in cost terms during the period to 1984-85.   This traditional presentation had three defects: ,of capital formation were shown net of asset sales and thus \easure new work; all defence expenditure was classified as rher than capital; and external financing limits rather il expenditure were scored for the nationalised industriesA&gt;r public corporations.   The 1984 White Paper would lave a new table (1.13) with adjustments to deal with these defeats in presentation.    It would show virtually no change in cost terms over the period 1978-79 to 1984-85.    Although there would continue to be civicism that the level of public sector caoital spending was in^Te$)ate, it should be borne in mind that some types(for example on industrial training) might be as capital spending; that in many areas, lesirable to encourage a shift to private r&amp; the need for capital investment in some areas might decline fc^jS^graphic or other reasons.    Capital _ investment was thereforYlWns to an end rather than an end in itself, and the right prc^J&amp;Shns of current and capital expenditure could not be determined in\&lt; j#egate.   The case for such expenditure could only be considered prdl^tNby project in the&apos; light of expected returns, and it was for indivsMu\ )spending Ministers to judge _ Priorities within their own pr^fes.    In the forthcoming Public Expenditure Survey he would disci^^Xth spending Ministers any Proposals for increased capital spe^d^g on their merits within the aggregate totals for public expenditpg^approved by the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRON^P^said that there was widespread concern that constraints on &lt;*fital expenditure in successive years might be leading to a deiay in the public sector built infrastructure which would eventually lead to rushed and wasteful expenditure in the future.    In a letter^f 3 February 1984 to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, copies of vfori^ he had sent to members of the Cabinet, he had suggested that k^i^rdepartmental group should be established to examine the state fof t)l)e publicly owned civil capital stock of housing and roads, w&amp;  hospitals and education buildings, the Government c the capital stock of universities; to evaluate such readily available of its present and likely future co _ fitness for its purposes and its needs for maintenance, replacement; to consider means of assessing the position it under review as a basis for cost-effective decisions &lt; expenditure and investment; and to make recommendations.d sewerage, state and as was and andCONFIDENTIAL54
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet took note of the new presentation of capital spending in table 1.13 of the forthcoming 198A Public Expenditure White Paper.    It was agreed that there was no way of determining in aggregate_the right Proportions of current and capital expenditure.    The Cabinet on lance considered that a wide-ranging interdepartmental review of kind suggested by the Secretary of State for the Environment was her necessary nor desirable.    It was for individual spending ers, who were best placed to assess the capital stock m the_ at&gt;aV&amp;qr which they were responsible, to examine the case for capital expe^l)%re project by project in the light of their judgment of the Priori^lyu within their programmes and within the framework of the agreed^irall totals for public expenditure.9binet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up cJ-sfheir discussion.Cabinet Office 9 February 1984CONFIDENTIAL
