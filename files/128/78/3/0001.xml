CONFIDENTIAL1- The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of Commons during the following week.IE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he was due to make statement to the House that afternoon about the Report by Sir James lessy on the escape made from the Maze prison on 25 September 1983. Report was highly critical of the management of the prison over a of years and identified many deficiencies in physical security procedures.    It was also critical of many of the personnel on day.    The Governor of the prison had resigned and an Assistant \d Principal Officer had already been moved. Disciplinary light be brought against a number of officers, but these await the outcome of separate inquiries.    The Report made ^ions, all of which he had accepted and some of which had put into effect.   His statement would not be defensive, but lg out the special features of the Maze prison, which were emphasised in the Report itself.    It held the largest concentration of terrorists in Weston Europe, in the midst of a very troubled community.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECSgTXfcr* said that he would be circulating for the information of colleaWie^&gt;a background note on the Government&apos;s decision, announced the pre\rf^5us day, to except the employees of the Government CommunicationsvHeadquarters (GCHQ) at Cheltenham from the application of the Employment Protection Acts and to withdraw their right to belong to national tradesunions.    This decision had been under consideration for some time.    IndysT*nLal action by the Civil Service unions at GCHQ in 1981 and 1982 hi^iir5 ilved heavy work loss.    In the course of the industrial action in th^TipWil Service in 1981 the unions had selected GCHQ as an area for dx^up^Uon, and had caused serious interruptions to an operation which of/Ws&apos;jnature had to be continuous.    Similar exceptions had been made by pr^x^&amp;X (Labour) Governments in respect of other intelligence and securiyy^ewices, but it had not been possible to do the same for GCHQ while it&gt;*J#^s.ot Publicly acknowledged by the Government as an intelligence&lt;9TR^nis; It was because this acknowledgment had been made following conviction of a GCHQ employee for espionage that the action   GCHQ had now been taken.

The longer a revaluay^ox was delayed, the greater the eventual upheaval would be.In discus*s^^^ he following main points were made -a. TQe political considerations were nicely balanced.   Although a revaluation would no doubt provoke resentment in such areas as the South East, which on average would tend to lose, delay would provoke resentment Lr ^?he areas which stood to gain.b. EstimateS=/^l~y|hanges in relative rateable values and of the effects of chal*]g ^/itt the rating system on the burden of rates were always unreliable^&lt;emd not too much weight could be put on them.

A decision in favour of 1S&amp;3 jrtjuld carry the risk that the Government would be regarded as deferred the revaluation for narrow political reasons.   Agains^r^fc^rat- it was suggested that there were good administrative arguments vf^f/such a decision.   The wider use of computers in the Inland Revemre- would yield.staff savings in 1986-87 and 1987-88, which could well give rise to redundancies. There were management arguments for an effective date of 1989 for the revaluation, since this would enable thepiwmpower required for the revluation to be offset at least to soifaf extent by the staff savings from computerisation.d. It was argued that it was undesirable to Ye^oylt an additional 700 staff to carry out the revaluation.   The pos^YM^Kty  f contracting out work on the revaluation to the pr:ry k ^6ector should be further examined, even though it had previously be^jv^stimated that that would entail additional costs,e.     In Scotland a general revaluation of domestic and rates was to take place in April 1985.    It was arguable England and Wales also the non-domestic revaluation shoul to coincide with the domestic revaluation, and that this wo disarm criticism of the delay in the non-domestic revaluation the other hand the domestic revaluation in England and Wales ra,esticCONFIDENTIAL
