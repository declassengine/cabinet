The Indian Prime Minister, Mrs Gandhi, had addressed a r^er to the Prime Minister about the background to the attack on th^&gt;Golden Temple in Amritsar.

CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE drew the Cabinet&apos;s attention to the amendment recently tabled in the United States Congress which represented an attempt to limit and eventually reduce the deployment of United States troops in Europe unless the Western European allies increased the level of their budgetary contributions to therth Atlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;s Alliance.    The amendment had not, ^the event, been carried.    The likelihood of Congressional pressure f/khis kind had been apparent in very difficult discussions on the &lt; rf 4^6tructure programme which had taken place in the Eurogroup of Dej^efiok Ministers in Brussels in mid-May, and in which the United Stat^rvecretary for Defence, Mr Weinberger, had spoken very sharply about^he reluctance of the Europeans to increase sufficiently the relev^frt^BJfldgetary contributions.    This political pressure had now surf acea/Oj ?Capitol Hill in the form of the Congressional amendment to which^frehad referred; but the Administration had succeeded, at any rate r^r the time being, in resisting it.The Cabinet -Took note.3.

In discussion it was pointloxW^that it was also important not to reduce the links between the Eu^fan Democratic Group in Strasbourg and the Government and Conservative Party in the United Kingdom.    There was no question, however, of any integration between the European Democratic Group and the_Christian Democratic Party, only of some closer working relationship^^,THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important ^VP^f nt the results of the European Parliamentary election in the Uni^ejd^ngdom as effectively as possible.

CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that, at the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 18-19 June, it had been agreed that budget discipline should continue to be dealt with by the Council of Ministers (Finance).    The 198A budget overrun would now also be examined in detail by the Council of Ministers (Budget) n July.    It was possible, therefore, that these points would present s difficulty in the European Council.    On the correction of the t inequity and United Kingdom refunds there was no clear tion of the French President&apos;s views.    There had been a wide rar^e^sf bilateral discussions in Brussels on 18-19 June, in which he had/mjade clear that the United Kingdom would be prepared to make if it would clinch a settlement.    The French appeared go in this direction, but other member states continued lit.    In discussion it was pointed out that the prospects e~ar very good and that it would be unwise to expect too e European Council.    If there was no agreement, there would be serious consequences for public expenditure.    Even if there were a settlement, the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution to the Community would require substantial public expenditure, from which it could be argued that the(yniied Kingdom gained no benefit.a f&amp;aVfci dispo to be fe^ did not much fromTHE MINISTER OF AGRIclrfABjfe.

This could have some effect on the revenues of British airlines but it was an important step towards a more liberal structure.

About 30 miners had reported for duty at the Bilston Glen colliery in Scotland and coal production had started for the first tim^i^ce the beginning of the strike.   It had not been possible to contiWJiModuction because the local National Union of Mineworkers (NUM)h^O)thdrawn safety cover; but the NUM had withdrawn safety cover at the\^^&lt;5h several previous occasions only to restore it later.    Nationally&lt;^lWuSh miners continued to return to work, they were doing so only in s^^numbers.   It would be helpful if one or more Pits in areas outside No^fi^jgyunshire could resume operations.

Nevertheless, some 700,000 tonnes of coal wer to be moved by rail and other means.    Some drivers at the Shir^ depot in Nottinghamshire continued to refuse to work coal train, there was also similar trouble at the Coalville depot.   The britiCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALRailways Board expected the troubles to become less severe as time passed.    They were particularly anxious to avoid any provocative action now:    the Annual Conference of the National Union of Railwaymen would take place the following week; it would be important to give &apos;-the militants there no excuse for promoting extreme resolutions.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that theSnsion of deliveries of coal and coke by rail at Ravenscraig and Llanwern Seated some problems.    Ravenscraig required the equivalent of^&quot;rain loads of coal every day.    It was easier to arrange_deliveries V3r five days a week than seven days a week; this required that an deliveries took place they should be equivalent to about 3ads.   The management at Llanwern had made arrangements for and coke supplies on to lorries at Port Talbot, but * putting them into effect until after a meeting of the Lon of Blastfurnacemen which was entitled under an agreement with the Brftish Steel Corporation (BSC) to be consulted about loading arrangements.    The BSC had the previous week produced 267,000 tonnes of.8-fce.el  only 12,000 tonnes less that the level planned for that week bef/areHhe strike.    It had been made clear to the leaders of the Iron and Stt&amp;K&amp;ades Confederation (ISTC) that the management would not accept anyTaarJeement between them and the NUM or other trades unions involv^ttt^a/cut in steel production.    The ISTC had ^ continued to resist re^u^^for such an agreement, and had publicly stated that interferenc&amp;^S^normal supplies of coal and coke had been responsible for the breal&amp;oViy&apos;kf a furnace at the Scunthorpe steek works.In discussion, the followin;joints were made -a. If production was re^u^e^ and maintained at Bilston Glen colliery it would have psycWfc^al significance out of all proportion to the amount of c^ltooduced:    it would be the first pit in the notoriously mi^m Scottish coalfield to return to work.    There were good prospec^^for this happening: indeed, at the outset of the strike the m^Jv the pit had voted in favour of working.   It was likely.t$ /Shere would be serious intimidation of those who showed the^elves willing to return to work.   The Chief Constable of the areV was fully aware of the need to take every precaution against this.b. Three pits were nearly at the point a, to be closed because of deterioration resul The NCB would not announce that a pit in this I closed until the need for closure was beyond qV announcement could be expected to have considers  mining communities, who were already aware, in ge the risk of deterioration of pits.ch they would have pm the strike, tion would be Such an act in the erms ofCONFIDENTIAL
