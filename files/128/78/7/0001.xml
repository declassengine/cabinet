He had expressed the ngdom Government&apos;s concern about the Israeli action to the Isra^TVSbre ign Minister, Mr Shamir, in Brussels earlier that week. Saudi&lt;Apatehan efforts to promote a peaceful settlement continued, and there y^&amp;yJudications that Syria wanted to avoid the situation in the Lebanon &quot;tfcrariorating into total civil war.   At the United Nations discussions continued with a view to replacing the MNF with a United Nations force.    The prospect was for a disorderly situation continuing in the Lebanon for the foreseeable future with some Possibility of a/^er role for the United Nations International Force xn Lebanon as a (reseat of sustained diplomatic effort.

The scale of the attack, ittrfrf expected for a long time, was difficult to determine claims of the two sides, but the pattern appeared to be  ne of initial Iranian gains of territory followed by StiS  Pposition.    The efforts at mediation undertaken by the Sec of the United Nations had been stopped in their tracks by tt offensive, and there was no prospect of early action at the to promote a settlement.

Press speculation about warship movements in the Gulf by both the United States and United Kingdom was inaccurate as were reports about the supply of British arms to Iran.    The Government continued to maintain a policy of strict neutrality as between Iran and Iraq, supplying no lethal arms to either side.   Decisions had, ever, been taken to release to Iran certain items of non-lethal pment for which contracts had been concluded before the war broke including MV Kharg and two other Yarrow ships.    There was,^ no truth in press reports that British engines were being I, for Iranian military aircraft.THE S  R T RY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that one Royal Navy ship of the ArSja^atrol was heading for Diego Garcia and another for the Gulf, b&amp;K/on normal routine patrols.

ariceCONFIDENTIALenCeTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that some 500 British lorry drivers were marooned with their vehicles in France as a result of the blockading of roads by French lorry drivers as part of^their industrial action against the French Government.   Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Paris and the British Consulate-General at Lyons were giving as much practical assistance as was possible to the stranded British drivers. He had summoned the French Ambassador the previous day to express the Government&apos;s concern at the situation.    The question of compensation had also been raised.    Similar representations were being made that day in Paris by the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, (Mr Whitney).   Reports of harassment of British &quot;rivers by French police were being investigated.PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said it was important the Government and Her Majesty&apos;s Embassy at Paris should be ly seen to be taking action to help the stranded drivers, to keep tn^&gt;C  pplied with food and clothing, and where necessary to make loans available to cover their immediate financial needs.    There was an evident risk that the French lorry drivers&apos; technique of blockading the roads might be imitated in the course of future industrial or other disputes in the United Kingdom;    and it would be helpful if the Civil Conti^rfe^icies Unit (CCU) could examine the implications, and consider wvArc Vn^which the risk might be averted, and measures which might be take^rTcV) limit the use and effectiveness of such techniques in the UnitedV&amp;irp dpm.The Cabinet2.
