It did not need tc^n &lt; ecided now.^ere were three strong reasons for inciting provision for direct cu Ctloris in the abolition Paving Bill t$&gt;&apos;be presented later in the a j^6111&quot; Session.   First, such action would carry more conviction than Cag re announcement of intent.    It would strengthen the Government&apos;s e that the GLC had few functions.    Secondly/ &quot;cumbere Pav&quot;        ,e transitional arrangements.

Thirdly, direct elect! May 1985 would substantially ease the problems of transitionnner London boroughs. There was already c nce  a fb ough load on the boroughs in 1985-86; amoving the need for borough aPPointees to run the ILEA would make a big difference.1
CONFIDENTIALTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that to include provision for direct elections to the ILEA in the Paving Bill would entail hurried drafting.    This was always dangerous.    It would also extend the scope  * the Bill and could thus increase the time required for its passage ^through Parliament.    There were contingent Bills which might, in &lt;rtain circumstances, have to be added to the existing legislative gramme at short notice.   The upshot could be serious delay to other &gt;rtant legislation and a large overspill at the end of the current in.    In his view, the advantages of making provision for direct to the proposed new body in the Paving Bill did not justify it would entail for the legislative programme.    It would the Government to criticism on the grounds that it was Ln the Paving Bill matters which prejudged substantial Lts abolition proposals.*n discussion,, the following main points were made -a&apos;     The information contained in C(8A)  12 suggested that, despite it/s/^tmractions, there might be serious drawbacks to the crea^H.cjrre.f a directly-elected authority to runeducation in to making it members of the even on the basi recommended by th would not be suffic that the creation of it harder to change London at a later stageLondon.    It was clear that the objections g authority were overwhelming; and some J considered that a precepting authority, ibed in paragraph 8 of C(84) 12 and tary of State for the Environment, accountable.    It was also possible ctly-elected authority might make isation of education in inner t should seem desirable.Ministers needed more tii advantageich to assess the balance ofb      On the other hand, it waS would be pressed very strongly directly-elected body: this might condition of securing the agreeme the abolition Paving Bill. .

On the other hand, there were arguments for limit ing/tQe^cope and long title of the Paving Bill so as to minimise^^v range of amendments which could be proposed.
CONFIDENTIALthe Prime minister, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that the abolition Paving Bill to be presented later in the Current Session should not include provision for the creation of a 1rectly-elected authority to run education in inner London or for J lections to it.    The Cabinet had reached no view on whether it jjS^ld be desirable to create such a body.    This should be further isidered, initially by the Ministerial Group on the Abolition of &apos;Greater London Council and the Metropolitan County Councils\95).    The Group&apos;s consideration should be based on the premise new body would be a precepting, not a rating, authority.fe^Gabinet -To&lt;5X/ dte, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office 16 March 1984CONFIDENTIAL
