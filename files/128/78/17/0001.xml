1.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House  r Commons during the following week.SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he expected a v**fficult progress for the Local Government (Interim Provisions) Bill v^yying its Committee Stage on the Floor of the House on Wednesday and -w ^3ay 9 and 10 May.    Some 50 Conservative Members were known to have about various aspects of the Bill, although there was no single * which they coalesced.   Wednesday&apos;s debate might   run well into morning and it would be necessary for the Government to muster jpport.   He thought, however, that the Government were &apos;to win the argument on the main issue about the cancellation ^jns.    There was some danger that the Greater London Council leadership might attempt to use The Queen&apos;s opening of the Thames Flood Barrier on Tuesday 8 May for propaganda purposes;   but any such attempt could wejrl. rebound on those concerned.KE SECRETARY  OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that The Queen&apos;s visit tcLiverpool the previ^^ Festival and the new Following the local gc&amp;e Liverpool with the fixin  n 15 May when the annua he held.&quot;to open.the Liverpool International Garden Court building had been a great success, t elections that day the difficulties in legal rate were likely to reach a head Ing of the newly elected council&apos; was toTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing u&amp;   /rief discussion, said that the success  f the Liverpool Internationalize*.

On the Liverpool rate, Mincers appearing on the media should react cautiously to the results b  the local elections being held that day.

CONFIDENTIALI &quot;te ^THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the campaign an independent inquiry into the events leading up to the shooting 1 incident at the Libyan People&apos;s Bureau on 17 April 1954 remained strong. Libya continued to detain three British citizens:    one had been serving a 12-year sentence for financial offences from November 1982 and another had been detained before the shooting for financial Nj-Ttegularities     The third, Mr Ledingham, British Caledonian Manager A\&gt;JjJ^ Tripoli, had been detained after the shooting for no known reason. ^;?e Italian Ambassador had followed up representations made before A^^reak in diplomatic relations, demanding information and consular ^fcc^^s. to &gt;ir Ledingham, and it was hoped that a report of the outcome w&lt;5kid/p&gt;e available that day.    Meanwhile, all possible steps were beHfe^Jtaken to increase the chances of securing Mr Ledingham&apos;s*i$i?s&amp;y There were no other signs of retaliation against British -&apos;&apos;^ere/p&apos;s/so far.    Colonel Oadhafi&apos;s reaction had been relatively restrained, but he had rerewed threats to resume support for the Irish Republican Army.    When the full impact of measures taken by the United Kingdom was appreciated, his reaction might become more severe. There was a continuing risk of terrorist attack, and all overseas posts had been varned^of) this.    The Libyans had thoroughly searched the British Embassjibhjrf3$ing in Tripoli.

CONFIDENTIALdifficult case since Marconi was acting as a sub-contractor to a Yugoslavian concern, and withdrawal by Marconi would lead to a collapse of the Yugoslavian bid with obvious international repercussions.    There was little doubt that a foreign competitor would step in and supply the order if the United Kingdom withdrew. He proposed that the current examination of all the defence export rders concerned should continue in consultation with the Foreign and mmonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry; ^e there was disagreement, cases could be the subject of wider npsterial consultation where necessary.TARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY emphasised the importance ining a consistent approach towards the sanctity of existingThis had been an important element in the United Kingdom&apos;s towards arms exports to Iran and towards the Federal Republic  f Germany&apos;s arms exports to Argentina.   He believed that very strong grounds were necessary for breaking existing contracts.    The United Kingdom&apos;s totaL_Qf exports to Libya amounted to  274 million in 1983 and there was/a^gppd deal of new business in prospect.    In addition the air transjs^t^^oute to and from Tripoli was of considerable importance to Br/vtTsJn Caledonian, which had already been adversely affected by the \ tty6f routes to Buenos Aires.    There were therefore important commerci&lt;^/Vp uments for maintaining our trading relations   with Libya so far as( &gt;r v\R0ssible.THE PRIME MINISTER, su case-by-case review of e continue in the way prop No arms exports should be value to terrorist activiti^ Where this restriction did no existing contracts and licenceThe Cabinet -2.

CONFIDENTIALdiscussions had also identified real differences of view about arrangements in Hong Kong up to 1997.   While the Chinese were very concerned about the risk of capital .outflow during this period, they did not seem to grasp that the confidence needed to prevent this could be built only on detailed assurances from them about future autonomy.   During his visit to Hong Kong between 18 and 20 April there &quot;ts evidence of great concern on the issues of nationality and the ^it of settlement in the United Kingdom as an insurance against \lure to reach agreement with the Chinese.    There were signs that ^vy elements of the business community in Hong Kong were intent )g to establish their right to live elsewhere;    if they were sxCdo that as an insurance policy, they might well be ready to do business in Hong Kong in the meantime.    A significant British passports, and Parliamentary attention was already fo focus on the question of access to the United Kingdom for thos&quot;e\yishing to leave Hong Kong.

As regards the United Kingdom&apos;s efforts to deny chemical weapons to Iran or Iraq, the Political Committee of the Ten had agreed to extend controls to five of the eight chemicals proposed by the United Kingdom. This &quot;estriction would be applied to exports to all non-Community ^stinations.The Cabinet -Took note.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that, despite the eleven mdhths&apos; work undertaken by the four political parties within the New Ireland Forum, the Report published on 2 May was a shallow document with (predictably) a strong nationalist bias.    The Report&apos;s - positive fts&apos;pe^ts were its strong condemnation of violence andits recognitio Unionists in Nor assumption that a  concentrated on di achieved.    There was an amendment of Artiestrong sense of British identity in the Ireland.

It was right for the United Kingdom to go on challenging the Commission&apos;s forecast of the shortfall and questioning the proposal.   There was no question of going in the Ndirection proposed by the Commission until the major problems of ^forming the Community&apos;s finances and the United Kingdom&apos;s budget *fund were settled in a manner satisfactory to the United Kingdom, &quot;&apos;scussion it was pointed out that the Federal German Chancellor, &quot;sphl, in his discussion with the Prime Minister on 2 May at the Al?^o^e rman Summit had shown some inclination to move towards a Set^ ni *it of the reform of the Community&apos;s finances, but it was too ear15^^draw conclusions.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that there had been furthe&gt;-~discussion in Brussels of the administrative&quot; e quota/superlevy   scheme for milk.

This had been achieved despite heavy :e, which had reduced two pits from full to partial colliery in Nottinghamshire.    There was little ()1^ by rail.    The President of the National Union icargill, had appealed to leaders of trade unions  Xo stop coal and coke movements, and to lers of unions in thk^i^tricity supply industry to prevent the use other fuels in substitutrptp&gt; for coal.

CONFIDENTIALHe faced a considerable dilemma:    if the coal strike continued to have no perceptible effect on other industries, striking miners would begin to lose heart:    if it led to lay-offs or redundancies in other industries e would generate resentment among the workers and unions affected. It as likely that Mr Scargill would seek to manufacture some issue which^_^uld be used as a pretext for escalating the dispute.   Ministers should remely cautious in all public statements in order to avoid giving e material for this.asHod\by c had in but ha ahead, lt the NCB ham area had voted by only a narrow majority in favour of striking, pinion in the area was strong.    It could be further strengthened ommercial developments.   First, Imperial Chemical Industries to convert a chemical plant in the area to coal-burning, ed a decision because of the strike.    If conversion went Id require about 450,000 tonnes of coal a year. Secondly, ecured an order from the United States for 170,000 tonnesof coke, equivalent to about 400,000 tonnes of coal.    If the NCB carried  ut this order satisfactorily, there were good prospects for follow-on 0rders for higher/^m^unts.
