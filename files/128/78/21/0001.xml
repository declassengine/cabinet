CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had attended the _ Ministerial meeting of the North Atlantic Council in Washington on 29-31 May.    The main result had been to confirm that the general direction of the Alliance&apos;s East-West strategy was correct and that the Alliance was in good shape despite problems over cruise missile policy in Denmark and the Netherlands, and the continuingrrel between Greece and Turkey.    The President of the United States ch to the Irish Parliament in Dublin on A June had struck exactly ight note on East-West relations; and the recent decision by Netherlands Government on cruise missile deployment, although &gt;V&gt;okust than was desirable, was not unsatisfactory.

On British initiative, agreement had been reached on a resolution to set up an ad hoc body to promote co-operation against terrorism.    Against initial French resistance it had been agreed to include a reference to the abuse of diplomatic vileges and immunities and to consider a British proposal that &quot;\omats declared persona non grata in one country should not be t ed to others.    This proposal might usefully be pursued in the ^ e&quot;xt of the discussion of international terrorism which was due t0 ^P^%^ace at the forthcoming Economic Summit.THE PRIM^MTNISTER said that the major economic issues at the meeting of the lexers of the seven major industrial countries in London on 7-9 June would be how to sustain economic recovery; how to handle the international debt problems; how to avoid increased protectionism; and how to deal/^Rh certain environmental needs.    It was important not to raise puWUexpectations too much.

The Cabinet would wish to record^its^ deep appreciation of the sacrifice of those who had given their lives for the freedom of Europe and thereby made possible 40 years of peace.    The ceremonies which had been held the previous day in France mark the anniversary, and which had been attended by Heads ofor Government of the United Kingdom, the United States, France, lum, Norway, the Netherlands, Canada and Luxembourg, had beenndly moving, as had been the universal respect and admiration rayed to Her Majesty the Queen.Cabinet -Tod^^^te.CONFIDENTIALr% r  i *

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the Post Office   Board had made a new pay offer to the Union of Communications Workers (UCW).    The National Executive of the union had not accepted thxs offer; but they would recommend their membership to accept it in a ballot tyhich they were about to conduct.   The offer was complicated: it  luded increases in basic rates, consolidation of bonuses, and changes Overtime rates.    It was therefore difficult to be certain about its &quot;11 financial effect; but the Post Office estimated that it would &gt;baut A.9 per cent.   While the ballot of the UCW&apos;s membership was in&lt;jpro r*ss, there would be no further official industrial action, alth^fh&gt;there might be sporadic unofficial disruption.    It seemed likely that t^Jowernment&apos;s threat to suspend the Post Office&apos;s monopoly of letter&lt;^*s3/had had a salutary effect on union attitudes.TheTooknote,  ^ORts5fr\,  The Cabinet co (C(8&lt;&gt;  15) about tnsred a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet  ^mmendations of the Pay Review Bodies.the Prime minister sai ^commendations of the ro related to increasesa&lt;     The Armed Forces Pi increases that would add&apos; estimated pay bill for 19!was necessary to reach decisions on the Review Bodies.

CONFIDENTIALMinisters directly concerned had met under her chairmanship to consider the Review Bodies&apos; recommendations.    Their proposals to the Cabinet were as follows.   The recommendations of the NRB should be implemented in full from 1 April 1984.    It would be exceptionally difficult to reject \the recommendations for the particular groups concerned, who commanded &quot;Wide measure of public sympathy, in the first year of a new Review Ny set up in the aftermath of the 1982 National Health Service (NHS) ite.    It should, however, be made clear to the staff concerned that :ommendations were accepted on the basis that they would co-operate &quot;nagement in securing improved productivity.   Acceptance in full ^commendations of the other Review Bodies would have unacceptable &quot;^Lons on other public sector pay negotiations and unacceptable &apos; for public expenditure, but outright rejection would be &gt;justify and could call into question the continuation of Ddy arrangements.   It was therefore proposed that the pay . groups concerned should be increased by 3 per cent from 1 April 1984, with the full recommended rates coming into payment from 1 November 1984.    This would reduce the effective increase over the^elve months f: 4.92 per cent fc groups. Pension! accordance with thi 1J April 1984.April 1984 to 4.63 per cent for doctors and dentists, armed forces, and 4.46 per cent for the top salary be based on the salaries actually in payment in iple set out in her Written Answer ofproposals, she would announce the Government&apos; ^ns of a Written Answer.

In discussion, the following main points were made -2a.     There was little alternative to accepting the proposals in C(8A)  15.   Nevertheless, the pay of large numbers of public servants was now the subject of recommendations of pay review bodies, who seemed to give excessive weight to considerations of comparability rather than market factors.    The pay of other significant groups of public servants, notably the police, was also settled largely by comparisons.    It would not be sustainable /^yV the long run if the pay of large groups of public servants X$&amp;k&gt; determined on the basis of comparability while that of others ^^a^netermined quite differently.b^&quot;^^(pr&gt;illustration of this was that the Government had justified its^feproach to the pay of school teachers by reference to the factX^hat there was no general difficulty in recruiting and retaining them.    The same was true of nurses, who stood to receive substantially larger pay increases.    It would be necessary to stress that specia/K^p&amp;y arrangements for nurses were justified in large measure byUhejj^act that they did not take industrial action.c.     The GoverWejp-smight find difficulty in reconciling modification or^H^AFPRB recommendations with the continued operation of the Eajrfijgd-Davies formula for determining police pay. However, this was &lt;JiiTsreivreview; and nothing could usefully be decided in advance of^he\outcome of that review.THE PRIME MINISTER, summingv approved the proposals set o to members of the armed forces X should be staged as proposed by the understanding that he expenditure provisions.    lw\   * f-the relevant NHS groups should be W of State ^or Social Services: tne given that afternoon would 1discussion, said that the Cabinet (84) 15.

progress within that framework.    Public opinion would expect no less.    It would be wrong to take a defensive or apologetic attitude in public comment.b.     It was intended that, once the accumulated stocks of coke at Orgreave had been moved, further movements should cease until stocks had built up again to a worthwhile level. There was a risk that this might be misrepresented by &apos;r Scargill as a victory for the pickets, and that movements ^Jkthe accumulated stocks should be phased over a longer R^p^od so that no interruption would occur.   Against this, &gt;tx yafe pointed out that careful preparation had been made to hat the media were aware of the facts, so that by Mr Scargill to misrepresent them should not succeed; it would be unfair to impose unnecessary burdens on the police or the staff at the plant, who had shown great loyalty and courage in maintaining production.c.
