The latter rflrS^dy reacted severely on being warned by Her Majesty&apos;s ^bas^ga^MK at Peking that the statement was being made, and that neith&amp;\^fae ^British nor the Hong Kong Governments carried any respons&amp;^ity for it.    The concerns expressed in the statement were understandable and needed careful consideration, but it was unfortunare that the Members of the Executive Council who had been working closely with the Government on the conduct of the negotiations with the Chinese^were also parties to it.    It could, however, behinese that over-reactiort on their part to an this kind would cast doubt on the sincerity a continued right of free speech in Hong Kong and understandable, concern of the people nationality arrangements after 1997 which right to travel freely to and from r protection in third countries (on s seeking to reach agreement with the ight of abode other than in Hong Kong.said that several people had ken place in Tripoli on ation  of Libya (NFSL) based aimed responsibility for d blamed a group of The Foreign andPointed out to unofficial stat of their commitme after 1997 .

He was in close touch with the Chairman of British Caledonian who was proposing to write a personal letter to the Libyan President, Colonel Qadhafi, seeking Mr Ledingham&apos;s release.

CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been no new developments in the Iran/Iraq war.    The continued delay in the expected Iranian offensive was puzzling.    There was no indication of any significant opposition to it within Iran: flooding of strategic areas by Iraq was a more probable explanation. Other European Community countries had joined the United Kingdom in taking *^ion to prevent the export to Iran and Iraq of chemicals which ^d be used in the manufacture of chemical weapons.AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that negotiations rith the French Government to maintain arrangements for  ^excursions&quot; from the United Kingdom to France, and the sjvernment had offered the French a number of concessions. ..^concern, although they had not admitted it, appeared to be with illegal immigration; and they were insisting on a travel document which would authenticate the nationality of the holder.

She believed that he would like to see the outstanding question on the reform of the Community&apos;s financing settled before the end of June when the French Presidency of the Council of Ministers   ended.   For the present, however, he was taking &quot;O immediate initiative.

There were genuine problems in the milk sector, but grain producers and other farmers were also now becoming worried, partly as a result of certain statements by the Commission.   During this period it was important that other actions which might potentially have an Jverse effect on the rural areas should be closely scrutinised and also the banks should be encouraged not to take a short-term view of ospects for agricultural enterprises.

CONFIDENTIALTHE HOME SECRETARY said that, with the agreement of his colleagues, he had already made it known that the Government would consider sympathetically and generously what additional help might be given by central Government to local authorities towards meeting the costs of extra policing during the current financial year due to the coal ^-dustry dispute.   He had, however, said that the Government could not decide on the extent of that help.   This inevitably left some rtainty, which was worrying to both Chief Constables and to police &apos; ities (some of whom were seeking to embarrass the Government Sally over the issues).    It was essential to remove the un^t* nty without delay by announcing the extent of Government help. Othe^Sj^n there would be cuts in police budgets in the areas most affecfeMwhich would result in wholly unacceptable reductions in the standartL^Ppolicing.   He had circulated full details of his proposals to the M^Aisters concerned.   Additional expenditure up to the product  f a penny rate would qualify for police grant of 50 per cent in the usual way.
