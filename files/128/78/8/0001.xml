3-     THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in her discussion with the German Chancellor, Herr Kohl, on 28 February she had made quite clear that the United Kingdom would not agree to a change in the level of the Community&apos;s own resources, which would be permanent, unless there &apos;ere an equally permanent change in the system to correct the budget quity.    On the size of an increase in the Community&apos;s own urces, the German Chancellor remained in favour of a maximum of Value Added Tax not higher than 1.4 per cent, which the &quot;&quot;ingdom could accept if its other conditions were met.

A-     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the February unemployment figures, to be published later that morning, showed a fall of 13,000 in the unadjusted total but an increase of 29,000 in the seasonally adjusted figure.    These figures were disappointing ter the levelling out in adult unemployment during the second half V983 and he proposed to issue a statement saying so.   He would ^sise the difficulty of drawing any firm conclusions at present any change in the trend of unemployment particularly as the L continued to improve: output was up, consumers expenditure ^tment had been growing, business optimism was higher than i^fny/^ears and the latest employment figures available showed an ^crea^^i^the numbers in work.In discujthe following main points were made -a. While the net change in unemployment was only 13,000, over 340,000 people had left unemployment during the month,This rate of, United Kingdom in work thai the same prop&lt; proportion as nover was encouraging.

There was very imperfect understanding of the longer-term implications for employment of such factors as the development of new technologies.

CONFIDENTIALd.     It might be wrong, however, to conclude that jobs in the future would necessarily require higher levels of skill The evidence from the United States was of substantial growth in semi-skilled jobs in service industries though this was against a background of falling real wages and a tradition of enterprise.    To foster similar developments here, it was important to get over the need to restrain firmly the rise in real wages and to take further steps to ^remove obstacles to free markets in the service sector. ^P^ther action should also be taken on obstacles to ^&quot;empj^yment such as taxation.THE PR&amp;t ^INJ.STER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed w&amp;w^xhe lines of the statement the Secretary of State for mploymenr^proposed to issue that day on the February unemployment igures.    The figures were disappointing when set against those for ne last months of 1983 and other economic indicators.

FIDENTIALinclude both local government and privatisation legislation but QL foresaw substantial problems during the Session from these and other major pieces of legislation which were not only complex in themselves, but were also attacking established institutions.   The response to ^ese attacks would undoubtedly be fierce and sustained.    It was \refore particularly necessary to ensure that Bills of this kind * ready for introduction at the beginning of the Session.ugh it was possible to make the legislative system go faster and &lt;\th more material, the price that had to be paid was poor &amp;on, vulnerable to criticism, which had to be amended subs^uA^iy.    in order to ease some of the problems involved with large &lt;gS s ntentious Bills he suggested to colleagues that they should&lt;t^killv give a place now to certain Bills in the 1985-Bb l gi8latw2?rogranme.

Any lengthy spill-over in this Session would damage \^^M^nces of an early Queen&apos;s Speech and a good start to the nexT^SaTsNkion
d.     It was necessary to have a further privatisation measure in the programme.    QL had suggested either Gas or Public Transport, but there were strong arguments for including both, even at the cost of dropping another less important Bill. Insolvency, Prosecutions, Pollution (Protection of Food and the Marine Environment), Trustee Savings Bank and Nationalised Industries were examples of Bills that might be dropped.There were strong arguments for including Insolvency in programme for 1984-85.    The state of the law was defective, the&gt;)&gt;eport of the Cork Committee had been published for some t^i^md the effect of the proposals on creditors would be berTe^c^al to small firms.    Similarly, there were strong reas^jtf^tor including Pollution (Protection of Food and the MarinX Environment).    There had already been two incidents this year (at Sellafield and the loss of chemicals from .a Danish ship in the North Sea) which could have resulted in circumstancee^r5pr which the powers in this Bill would be necessary.

The small Civil Aviation Bill which was in the essential category could possibly be combined with the Public Transport The contingent Bill on Doorstep Selling could probablybe replaced by secondary legislation.PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet agreed that the programme needed a higher content of Bills to forward the Government&apos;s major policy objectives.

The overall size of _ r&quot;og&gt;amme should not, however, be significantly increased.
