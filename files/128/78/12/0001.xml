This would probably not be for some weeks yet. The postages were believed to be in reasonably good health, and contact with * :ITA was being maintained through the United States and South African i^rnments as well as through the International Committee of the Red s-   Although it was the British Government&apos;s policy not to deal with e-takers, it was important to make Dr Savimbi aware of the harm NITA&apos;s action was doing to its standing in the United Kingdom and ^^^ed to win back sympathy by speedy and unconditional release of h  e &lt;^5%sed Britons.

CONFIDENTIAL       THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported on the position whichad been reached in the European Council on 19-20 March.    Decisions had n t been taken on the milk quota/superlevy proposal.    The Irish Republic ad requested an extra quantity and had argued that they must be allowed to increase milk production.    This had not been acceptable to other member Nstates.    The document which had been presented to the European Council by &apos;Presidency, however, did contain a firm agreement that Community ^cultural expenditure should grow less rapidly than the Community&apos;s own \urces base.    This would be guaranteed in the implementing texts and meet the United Kingdom&apos;s objective.    The Council of Ministers jlture) would take up all the outstanding agricultural questions 26-27 March.    Because of the link with the discussions in the kmncil it would be helpful if there were a meeting of the United trusters most concerned before the next meeting of the Council of Agriculture) .^n the ma&lt;s^/ inancial issues the Presidency&apos;s text had also been Satisfactory.    The Presidency had proposed a text which provided that the filing on value added tax contributed to the Community&apos;s own resources  uld be 1.4 per_cent but held out the prospect of an increase to 1.6C*nt ^ter. m  * member states   Possibility otax thiceiling to 1s was acceptable0n the fair sharing of *the French to include in tcontaining most of the ele-.Proposed.

In the last resort this system proposed in the :ijait on the BritishTjn-   e end the discussion had concentrated on the amount of rebate for the pr    .

The French svst     nt  Monsieur Mitterrand, had suggested bo^ff^that there should be a l9R^eni-and rhat within the system the rebate fowthJe United Kingdcfigures should be 1,100 million ecu (about1983 alscj^Q^nited Kingdom would seek a rebate of about 1,3 r.,~. million).

CONFIDENTIALFoilowing the meeting of the European Council, there had been a brieffeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) at which Italy andance had maintained their blocking reservations on the regulations necessary to implement the United Kingdom&apos;s 1983 refund of 750 million ecu net (about  440 million).    He had made clear the serious consequences of thls step.it ion had just been received that the French Presidency was calling feting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 27 March to forward the negotiations on the basis of the text distributed in the \n.

An approach had also been received from the Commission, slear also that Monsieur Mitterrand, in a broadcast the previous lad been careful to play down the points of disagreement, and to &apos;i^jPthat this was not a matter of an Anglo-French dispute.JSTER said that Monsieur Mitterrand had been very helpful and :erffo^Kthe Presidency text strongly in the European Council.

CONFIDENTIALP Wt was entered in the Council minutes of 27 October 1980. This ^ vision was honoured in respect of United Kingdom refunds covering 1980,and 1982.    The extent to which it was an accepted provision of the pa Und agreements was borne out by the Resolution adopted by the Europeanlament at its session on 15 December 1983 which expressed the view  at a final decision on the question of 1983 refunds &quot;must be made before March 1984 to avoid discrimination against any of the member states&quot;, the circumstances, however, the Cabinet did not need at this point to the questions of whether and if so how to safeguard the United corn&apos;s financial position if the 1983 refunds were not received byA.ion of agriculture it was said that there would probably be an ettle the price-fixing package in the Council of Ministers ) on 26-27 March.

The matter had been considered at a lng of Ministers held earlier that week under the chairmanship of the President of the Council.    In practice central Government already met two-thirds of the cost through the 50 per cent police specific grant ugh block grant.
