0THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had seen the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Moran, in Luxembourg on 10 April. This had been the latest in a series of bilateral talks which had taken place in the margins of multilateral meetings in recent months.   With the agreement of the Chief Minister of Gibraltar, _ ^r Joshua Hassan, he had proposed reciprocal advance implementation ^between Spain and Gibraltar of those European Community rights &gt;ch would apply to Spaniards and Gibraltarians from the date of &gt; **&apos;s accession to the European Community, in return for the lifting \ish restrictions on the frontier.   He had made it clear that te^r$^i advance implementation would not affect the transitional &quot;rait&amp;ts (expected to be seven years) limiting the freedom of movem^f^f labour between Spain and Gibraltar.    If agreement were reached(%i^ Spain on the basis proposed, it would be m the context of the L&lt; bon Agreement of 1981 whereby Spain would then be free to raise the^question of sovereignty while the United Kingdom stood by the wishes of the people of Gibraltar.    Senor Moran had made it clear ^ the Spanish Parliament that Spain would not wish to receive Gibraltar agairffrfhe wishes of the people.    In the British Government&apos;s vlfejfevinost promising way forward would be to concentrate on dev^W ways of promoting practical co-operation&quot;tar, for example in the field of civil ^British disappointment at the Spanish Government&apos;s decision(^\o buy Rapier, Senor Moran had said that the decision had been Vak^T&amp;pn technical and financial grounds: he Personally had advised in^&amp;ur of Rapier and wanted to explore  ther areas for bilateral&lt;&lt;^&gt;boration with the United Kingdc over defence procurement.The Cabinet -fit*ss3Took note.3-     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECF&amp;tf&amp;CY reported that the Council  * Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 9-10 %il had dealt satisfactorily with a number of current issues.
