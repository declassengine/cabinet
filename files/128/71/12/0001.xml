THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary was in New York for the United Nations GeneralAssembly.    His many contacts there had included a meeting with theSoviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko, which had been held in a satis-factory atmosphere.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary hadmade clear that the principal obstacle to improved Anglo-Sovietrelations was the present Soviet military occupation of Afghanistan,Mr Gromyko&apos;s main concern at the time had been the prospect of hisfirst meeting with the United States Secretary of State, Mr Haig.Uncertainty about how this would go had characteristically led theRussians to adopt a tough stance on East-West issues.    In the event themeeting between Mr Gromyko and Mr Haig appeared to have beenreasonably successful, thanks partly to the skilfully conciliatorymessage which President Reagan had just sent President Brezhnev.The two Foreign Ministers had discussed arms control in the context oflong-range theatre nuclear forces and were due to meet again on28 September.andnousprence:81) 31st[elusions,lite 1THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the situation in Poland remainedtense.    The letter earlier in the month to the Polish Government andPolitburo from the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party hadbeen very toughly worded, and the Soviet Union might well seek to applystrong pressure on Poland by economic means.    But there appeared tobe no signs of Soviet military preparations.    Within Poland, moderatecounsels had gained some ground within the Solidarity trades unionmovement, particularly in relation to the issue of the workers&apos; controlof management.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that after several years of negotiations,in which the Prime Minister had been involved among many others, theBritish-led consortium under Davy McKee Ltd had won a  1 billioncontract for the construction of a major steel plant in India.    Over halfthe value of the contract was likely to accrue to the United Kingdom.CONFIDENTIAL

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment (C(81) 48) on local authority current expenditure in1982-83.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that, toconform with present public expenditure plans, the English localauthorities would have to cut their current expenditure in 1982-83 by atleast 7 per cent from the likely outturn for 1981-82:  3j per cent toeliminate likely volume overspend in 1981-82;   3 per cent because theirpay and price increases in 1981-82 were higher than the cash limitfactors for that year;  and j per cent to achieve further reductionsassumed in the 1981 Public Expenditure White Paper.    There was generalCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALagreement that it would be unrealistic to expect reductions of 7 per cent.The maximum year-on-year reductions ever achieved by English localauthorities overall was 3 per cent;  7 per cent was an average figure,and some local authorities would have to save substantially more;  70 percent of local authority current costs were for manpower, and a 7 per centcut would imply a manpower reduction of about 150, 000 in a yearcompared with the present annual rate of reduction of 40,000. Beforereaching a final decision on this, however, he wished to continue hisdiscussions with the local authority leaders about the prospects forfurther reductions in current expenditure in 1982-83.    He would do so onthe basis of the present target of 7 per cent but, by suggesting that theremight be some scope for adjusting this target to a more realistic level,he would seek to secure their collective endorsement of an alternativeaggregate figure.    He hoped that under this procedure the moremoderate councils, which were in the majority, would bring pressure tobear on the minority of high spenders to agree to new targets forreductions.    In the meantime, and for internal purposes, the furtherwork in preparation for the 1982-83 Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlementshould be based on three alternative assumptions of reductions of 7, 4and 3 per vent.    Officials should be instructed to advise urgently on howany increase in the cash provision for 1982-83 should be apportionedbetween programmes.    Decisions on this apportionment should be takenby mid-October to enable the RSG settlement to be made beforeChristmas.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he supported theSecretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposals on the grounds thatthey recognised the reality of the situation.    It would, however, beimportant to establish, in presenting the outcome of the Secretary ofState&apos;s discussions, that an increase in the present cash provision forthe local authorities would not represent a substantive decision toincrease public expenditure, and it would not provide any grounds forincreases in other programmes.    The final decision on the increasescould be taken in the light of the further discussions with the localauthorities, and as part of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey as a whole;  the aim should be to decide on the totalin time for the RSG settlement to be made before Christmas and with theimplications for other programmes in mind.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinetagreed with the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposals for thenext steps in dealing with local authority current expenditure in 1982-83.A final decision on the total additional cash provision would be taken whenthey considered the 1981 Public Expenditure Survey.    In the meantime,separate consideration should be given to the methods of making similaradjustments for the Scottish and Welsh local authorities and to theNorthern Ireland programme.    It was essential that, when the decisionson local authority current expenditure were announced in due course,3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthey should be explained in terms of a general additional cash provisionwith no reference to &quot;validation&quot; of excessive pay increases in 1981-82;otherwise future pay negotiations would be prejudiced, particularly thoseof the National Health Service groups who had accepted lower settle-ments this year than had local authority workers.    The increasedprovision should also be presented in the context of the legislation whichthe Government was introducing to deter high spending local authoritiesfrom imposing high rate increases.    It was important that further workon local authority expenditure, and decisions on it, should be completedin time for an RSG settlement before Christmas;  the settlement would bethe basis for the thresholds to be set under the new legislative measureson the rates which would at that stage still be passing through Parliament.The Cabinet -1. Approved the recommendations in paragraph 22of the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;smemorandum C(81) 48.2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury:i. To arrange for officials of theDepartments concerned to examine how anyincrease in cash provision for local authoritycurrent expenditure might be apportioned betweenprogrammes.ii. To agree with the Secretaries of State forScotland, for Wales and for Northern Irelandhow similar adjustments should be calculatedfor the programmes for which they wereresponsible.QUEEN&apos;SECHESTHEROGATIONOPENINGPARLIAMENTviouserence-fl) 30thfusions,ute 55. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department (C(81) 47), to which were atteched drafts ofThe Queen&apos;s Speeches on the prorogation of the 1980-81 Session ofParliament and the opening of the 1981-82 Session.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft Speeches attached toC(81) 47 had been prepared by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL) on the basis of suggestions made byDepartments.    The draft Opening Speech reflected the legislativeprogramme for the 1981-82 Session approved by the Cabinet in July, buttook no account of any adjustments to the programme which might have tobe made in the light of the decision to accelerate the passage of the LocalGovernment Finance Bill.    Prorogation Speeches generally attractedCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlittle Parliamentary or public attention, and the draft which he hadcirculated had been shortened by more than a third compared with theprevious Session&apos;s Speech.    The reference in the draft Opening Speechto the close relationship with the Republic of Ireland had been suggestedby the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to meet QL&apos;s concern about thereference in earlier drafts to a &quot;unique&quot; relationship.    The new textmight be helpful in the context of the Anglo-Irish Summit due to be heldon 6 November, but there was a danger that once the reference had beenincluded it would be difficult to omit it from future Speeches. Thereference to unemployment in the economic affairs section of the Speechhad been added by the Treasury at QL&apos;s request.    The revised passageon Northern Ireland provided by the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland included a reference to the proposed Advisory Council;  this mightbe better omitted because of the unenthusiastic response which theproposals had received.    Subject to these points, and to any furtherchanges which might be needed in the light of later developments or ofalterations to the legislative programme, he invited the Cabinet toapprove the two draft Speeches attached to C(81) 47.In discussion of the draft Opening Speech, the following main points weremade -a. The reference to the close relationship with the Republic ofIreland was intended to reflect an important change in policytowards the Republic.    It would, however, be found provocativeby certain sectors of political opinion, including some of theGovernment&apos;s own supporters, and it would be safer to omit it.b. The specific reference to the proposed representativeNorthern Ireland Advisory Council should be deleted. Thecorresponding sentence in the draft Prorogation Speech (the lastsentence of the paragraph on Northern Ireland) should also bedeleted.    The word &quot;humanitarian&quot; in relation to the solutionbeing sought to the prisons protests should be omitted.c. The reference to the White Paper on Efficiency in the CivilService should be deleted.d. In the economic affairs section of the draft Opening Speech,it would be preferable to replace the reference to the adaptabilityof the economy by a reference to its efficiency, and to add areference to the need to strengthen industry.e. A specific reference to legislation to patriate the CanadianConstitution might need to be added at a later stage if a formalrequest was received from Canada before the Speech wasdelivered.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the reference to the proposed NorthernIreland Advisory Council in both draft Speeches, and to relations with theRepublic of Ireland and efficiency in the Civil Service in the draftOpening Speech should be deleted as proposed in discussion. Theyaccepted the further amendments which had been suggested on NorthernIreland and economic affairs, and noted the possible need for the additionof a reference to the Canadian Constitution at a later stage.    The text ofany further drafting changes which Ministers wished to propose should besent to the Home Secretary immediately.slative THE HOME SECRETARY said that, since QL had prepared the draftramme Speeches attached to C(81) 47, the Ministerial Committee on Economic82 Strategy had agreed that the proposed legislation to make localauthorities more accountable for the level of their rates should be giveni us priority over the rest of the legislative programme for the 1981-82rence: Session, with the aim of securing Royal Assent by February or early1) 30th March 1982.    He had discussed the implications of this decision for theelusions, legislative programme with the business managers and FirstParliamentary Counsel.    He reminded the Cabinet that a reference to aspecific measure in The Queen&apos;s Speech virtually committed theGovernment to introducing that measure;  the omission of such areference did not preclude the introduction of the measure, if timepermitted, but avoided a commitment.    It would be very unwise in thenew situation to enter into a firm commitment to carry the whole of thelegislative programme approved by Cabinet.    He had already agreedthat there should be no reference to possible legislation on public orderin the draft Opening Speech, and he now recommended that references toat least two other main programme Bills should be omitted, on theunderstanding that this would not necessarily prevent the relevantlegislation being brought forward later if the Parliamentary situationnext Session proved less difficult than was at present feared.    The maincandidates for deletion appeared to be the Social Security Bill, theHousing and Building Control Bill, and the proposed legislation on theretailing of gas appliances by the British Gas Corporation (BGC).    It wasalso possible that there would be some delay in introducing the MentalHealth Act (Amendment) Bill, but this was unlikely to be sufficientlyserious to prejudice the Bill&apos;s chances of securing Royal Assent nextSession.    There were clear political and economic objections todropping any of next Session&apos;s Bills, but this now appeared to beinevitable if the remainder of the programme were to be carried in anorderly fashion.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had alwaysconsidered that the proposed legislative programme was too heavy andtoo controversial and would put the Government and its own supporters6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALin both Houses of Parliament under unacceptable strain throughout theSession.    Since it had been drawn up, it had been suggested that afurther Bill on banking mergers should be added.    Time would almostcertainly have to be found for legislation on the Canadian Constitution,and the addition of rating proposals to the Local Government (Scotland)Bill would probably mean that Second Reading would have to be taken onthe Floor of the House rather than in Scottish Grand Committee. TheOpposition were in any case likely to adopt disruptive tactics nextSession in protest against the continuing rise in unemployment, and theattempt to force through highly controversial legislation on rates to avery tight timetable would encourage them to withdraw the co-operationwhich they were normally prepared to give to enable the Government tosecure their business.    It would be disastrous in the present politicalclimate if the Government were to be seen to be unable to carry thelegislative programme announced in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    It would beprudent to delete the references to three of the existing mainprogramme Bills from the draft Speech.    Even if the pressures on theprogramme were to be eased in this way,   he could not guarantee that theBills which had been identified as requiring early Royal Assent could bedelivered on time.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that in theabsence of any guillotine procedure in the House of Lords the rapidpassage of Government legislation could be secured only throughnegotiation with the Opposition.    The Lords would need at least as muchtime as the Commons to deal with the Local Government Finance Bill,and would need to have Second Reading before the Christmas Recess inorder for there to be any chance of the Bill being passed by February1982.     The Lords had already sat for five weeks in the current Sessionwhen the Commons had not, and the two-and-a-half-week ChristmasRecess now proposed would be one of the shortest ever. Someacknowledgment of the pressures on the Upper House seemed essential,and she hoped to be able to give some indication that the Governmentwould use their best endeavours to avoid an extended spillover period inthe autumn of 1982.    Although it was unlikely that the Lords would voteagainst the principle of the rating legislation at Second Reading, manyPeers had strong constitutional objections, which in the past had seemedto be supported by the Government, against the use of referenda, and thepossibility of Government defeats on this aspect of the proposals could notbe ruled out.    She agreed that The Queen&apos;s Speech should leave theGovernment free to drop two or more of the main programme Bills towhich the existing draft referred.The following points were made in discussion -at.       Agreement had now been reached between the Departmentsconcerned on the unified housing benefit (UHB) provisions to beincluded in the Housing and Building Control Bill. The7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALConfederation of British Industry had accepted the Government&apos;slatest proposals for legislation in the Social Security Bill on theintroduction of an employers&apos; statutory sick pay (ESSP) scheme,and it now seemed that this proposal was likely to be much lesscontroversial, at least among the Government&apos;s own supporters,than originally feared.    These two provisions taken togetherwould enable the Department of Health and Social Security to savesome 7, 500 staff.    A further 1, 350 staff in the Department ofEmployment group would be saved by the voluntary registrationproposals in the Social Security Bill.    If these proposals werenot proceeded with, there would be no prospect of the Governmentbeing able to honour its commitment to reduce the size of theCivil Service to 630, 000 by 1984.    One possibility would be tocombine the UHB, ESSP and voluntary registration proposals ina single Bill;  to drop the remaining provisions which had beenput forward for inclusion in the Housing and Building ControlBill;  and to review the other provisions which had been proposedfor the Social Security Bill with a view to omitting them. Thiswould mean postponing the politically desirable proposals forextending the right to buy to the 70, 000 people occupying lease-hold council houses, for the introduction of shared ownership andequity mortgage schemes designed to benefit people on lowincomes who wished to own their own homes, and for thedevelopment of a more coherent system of building control.b.       The Government was publicly committed to legislating nextSession on the disposal of the gas appliance retailing interests ofthe BGC.    The BGC and the trades unions concerned hadmounted a massive campaign against these proposals, andfailure to proceed with the legislation would be widely seen as ahumiliating defeat for the Government, and one which couldfundamentally affect their future relations with the nationalisedindustries.    On the other hand there were signs that a number ofGovernment supporters were beginning to have misgivings aboutthe proposals for disposal of the gas appliance retailing interestsof the BGC, and their Parliamentary handling could well prove tobe more difficult than had earlier been expected.    A possiblesolution would be to introduce legislation enabling the Governmentto direct the BGC to dispose of particular interests, and to breakits monopsony in the purchase of North Sea gas.    This Billwould be of great political importance.    Such legislation wouldenable the Government to compel the BGC to sell its oilinterests, and would in principle give the Government adequatepowers to direct the BGC to dispose of its gas appliance retailinginterests, though the exercise of this power for that purposewould have to be deferred until time could be taken for passingfurther legislation on improved safety requirements.    It might be8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpossible to amalgamate these provisions with those in thePetroleum and Continental Shelf Bill postponed from the currentSession, though the drafting of the new provisions might delay theintroduction of a combined Bill.C       The proposed legislation on the &quot;privatisation&quot; of part of theassets of British Shipbuilders might be postponed (at the expenseof possible criticism by some of the Government&apos;s ownsupporters), though a short and uncontroversial Bill to increasethe borrowing limits of British Shipbuilders would still berequired.d.       It might be possible to amalgamate the two Transport Billsat present included in the programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the aim should be for the Local Government FinanceBill to receive Royal Assent by about the end of February 1982, thoughthey noted that in the light of the latest advice from the Law Officers andthe Lord Chancellor some extension of this timetable would beacceptable.     The Secretary of State for the Environment should discus^the timetable further with the Lord President of the Council and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.    The Cabinet accepted that thelegislative programme agreed in July could not be carried in its originalform.    The proposed UHB, ESSP, and voluntary registration provisionsshould now be combined in a single Bill.    No reference would be made inThe Queen&apos;s Speech to the remaining provisions put forward for inclusionin the Housing and Building Control Bills, though this would notnecessarily prevent at least some of them being introduced in a separatemeasure later if the Parliamentary timetable permitted. Shipbuildinglegislation would be confined to a short Bill to increase the borrowinglimits of British Shipbuilders.    The reference to the retailing of gasappliances would be deleted from The Queen&apos;s Speech, but legislationwould be brought forward to break the monopsony powers of the BGC,and to enable the Government to direct the Corporation to make disposalsof assets.    Consideration should be given to combining these provisionswith the Petroleum and Continental Shelf Bill.    Consideration shouldalso be given to the possibility of combining the two Transport Bills.The Home Secretary should arrange for the draft Opening Speech to berevised as necessary in the light of these decisions, and she would thensubmit it to The Queen for approval.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment,in consultation with the Lord President of the Counciland the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, toconsider further the timing of the Local GovernmentFinance Bill.2. Agreed that the proposed Social Security andHousing and Building Control Bills should be replacedby a single Bill dealing with unified housing benefit,the employers&apos; statutory sick pay scheme, andvoluntary registration of the unemployed, and invitedthe Secretary of State for Social Services, in consul-tation with the Secretaries of State for the Environmentand for Employment, to arrange the drafting of thenecessary legislation accordingly.3. Agreed that powers should be taken to direct theBritish Gas Corporation to dispose of specified interestsand to abolish the Corporation&apos;s gas purchase monopsony,and invited the Secretary of State for Energy, inconsultation with the Lord President of the Council,to consider whether the relevant legislation could beadded to the Petroleum and Continental Shelf Bill.4.
