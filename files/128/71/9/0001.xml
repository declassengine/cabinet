CONFIDENTIALLlAMENTARY   1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDAIRS PAYMASTER GENERAL informed the Cabinet of the business to bettken in the House of Commons during the following week. Monday27 July had now to be set aside for the Opposition motion of censure, andthe House would not sit on the day of the Royal Wedding, Wednesday29 July.    The House would be asked to extend the normal sitting onFriday 31 July to provide time for debates on the adjournment motions.If this were done, it should still be posiible to deal with the considerableamount of outstanding Government business in time for the House to risefor the Summer Recess on that day.    Some oral statements had to bemade, and he proposed that the Secretary of State for Industry shouldmake his intended statement on the telecommunications networkimmediately before the censure debate on 27 July, and the appropriateDepartment of the Environment Minister should make one on the proposedAudit Commission the following day.    The Home Secretary had agreedthat he would, if necessary, make a statement cn the inquiry into com-plaints about the recent police raids in Brixton on Friday 31 July. Hehoped it would not be necessary for the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to make a statement after the forthcoming FisheriesCouncil, though Opposition pressure might make such a statementunavoidable.    The Commons consideration of the Lords amendments tothe Transport Bill on Tuesday 28 July would be governed by a timetablemotion which would give an adequate opportunity for debate on theamendments on seat belts made in the Lords, on which there would be afree vote.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that Lord Bethell&apos;samendment to the British Nationality Bill to give the people ofGibraltar the right to British citizenship had been carried in the House ofLords the previous evening by 150 votes to 112 against the strong advicegiven in speeches by himself and the Lord Chancellor.    The majorityhad included about 30 Conservative Peers.    The Government might wellsuffer a further defeat in the House of Lords in the debate arranged forThursday j0 July on a motion calling upon the Government to reconsiderthe instructions given to the British Broadcasting Corporation to cutcertain external broadcasting services.THE FRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that therewas a danger that there would now be increased pressure for the rightsgranted to citizens of Gibraltar by Lord Bethell&apos;s amendment to beextended to Hong Kong and other colonies.    The Home Secretary wouldconsider whether tc attempt to reverse the Lords decision in the Houseof Commons, though the Cabinet noted that over 20 Governmentsupporters in the House of Commons had earlier voted for an amendmentsimilar to Lord Bethell&apos;s which had been defeated by three votes onlybecause of the fortuitous absence of some members of the minorityparties.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -Took note.EIGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that inAIRS the margins of the Ottawa Economic Summit Conference it had beenpossible to hold a useful meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the Five-ibia nation Western Contact Group on Namibia.    This had agreed on aprocedural framework for holding the position until the United Nationsvious General Assembly session opened in September, when the Contact Grouperence: would meet again at Ministerial level.    It was clear that the United81) 18th States Government had not in fact managed to make much progress inelusions, their contacts with the South Africans, and pressure from Black Africanute 2 Governments for faster movement on Namibia seemed certain to grow.1/Lebanon THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that currenthostilities in Southern Lebanon were a cause for serious concern. Aceasefire was being urgently sought, both by Mr Habib, the Americanspecial envoy in the area, and by the United Nations Secretary General,Dr Waldheim, who had been instructed by a Security Council resolutionof 21 July to report back not later than 24 July.     The leader of thePalestine Liberation Organisation (PLO), Mr Arafat, had indicated thathe would accept a ceasefire if Israel did;  but the Israeli position was thatthis was a matter for the Lebanere Government, not for the PLO. Hehimself had just seen the Israeli Ambassador, as well as a representativegroup of Arab Ambassadors.     The Israelis argued that a pre-emptivestrike had been necessary because of the build-up of arms held by thePLO inside Lebanon, and said that their action would continue so long asthose arms remained.    It was true that a build-up had occurred, butthis had been a gradual process over several months and nothing hadhappened in recent weeks to justify Israel&apos;s action;  indeed the PLO hadbeen responding well to Dr Waldheim&apos;s appeal to them to refrain fromattacks on Israeli territory.    The crisis represented a severe setbackto the progress which had been being made towards restoring peace inthe area and the Lebanese Government&apos;s control of their own nationalterritory.    The United States Government were clearly unhappy aboutIsrael&apos;s attitude, as was clear from a recent attack on the Israeli PrimeMinister, Mr Begin, by the American Defense Secretary,Mr Weinberger.      But President Reagan and his advisers still appearedto feel committed to the support of Israel and to be afraid that too muchpressure on Mr Begin would merely provoke him into military occupationof the whole of Southern Lebanon.    It was likely that the SecurityCouncil would soon be faced with a skilfully woided Lebanese draftresolution calling for international sanctions under Chapter 7 of the2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALUnited Nations Charter in view of the threat to peace.    This would bevetoed by the United States, but it would present a difficult dilemma forthe United Kingdom.    Sanctions could not be supported;  but the threatto peace was genuine, and British relations with the Arabs would sufferif the Government appeared to be obstructing United Nations action.r/Spain THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he muchregretted the Spanish announcement that the King and Queen of Spainwould not after all be attending the wedding of His Royal Highness thePrince of Wales because of the decision that the Prince and Princess ofWales should pass briefly through Gibraltar during their honeymoon inorder to embark on the Royal Yacht.    It had been hoped that the Spanishauthorities would refrain from reacting with such hostility to what wasnot even an official visit to the Colony.    There would certainly havebeen a major outcry in Britain if the Government had advised His RoyalHighness to avoid Gibraltar (as there had been when it was learnt thatHer Majesty The Queen had been advised against passing through theColony at the time of her State Visit to Morocco in 1980);  and this inturn would have hsd even more unfortunate repercussions than hadactually occurred as regards Parliamentary and public attitudes to theposition of the Gibraltarians under the Government&apos;s proposedNationality Bill.orrucitrenceTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the seven-power Economic Summit inOttawa on 19-21 July had been markedly more successful than earlierconferences in the same series.    For five of the eight main participantsit had been their first Economic Summit;  the opportunity for an exchangeof views and a wide-ranging discussion of world political and economicissues had therefore been very valuable.    The arrangements made bythe Canadian Government had been good, as had the quality of thediscussions.    No one issue had overshadowed the meeting, as hadhappened with oil policy at Tokyo in 1979 (wnen the chairmanship hadalso been inadequate) and with the Afghanistan question at Venice in 1980.There had been a full discussion of all major economic issues, withparticular emphasis on the need to combat the problems of inflation andunemployment which were a dominant preoccupation in all participatingcountries except Japan.    A satisfactory statement on the Middle Easthad also been agreed, despite some difficulties with the Americans,whose commitment to Israel did not seem to be balanced by adequatepublic understanding of the Arab case.    A particularly valuable featureof the Summit had been the robust approach shown byPresident Mitterrand of France towards the Soviet threat and the needfor strong Western defence policies;  he had been notably firm in hiscommitment to the French nuclear deterrent, as well as to the3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdevelopment of c-vil nuclear energy.    The Summit&apos;s wide agreementboth on economic issues and on East-West relations had been a strikingcommentary on the position both of the Socialist President of France andthe Social Democratic Chancellor of Germany, and could only make itharder for the Opposition in Britain to criticise the Government&apos;seconomic and foreign policies.    A clear reference in the Summitcommunique to the problem of Japanese exports had not been practicable,because of Japanese opposition,  but the French, and even to someextent the Germans and the Americans, had lent support to British dis-quiet on this subject, and the Japanese well understood the message whichlay behind the communqiue&apos;s reference to keeping under close review therole played by all seven countries in the smooth functioning of the multi-lateral trading system.The Cabinet -Took note.MUNITYAIRS&quot;chermenttoicultureviouserence;|81) 28thelusions,ute 13. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, at the meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) onZ0-Z1 July, the Commission representative had catalogued the largenumber of national agricultural aids given by the French Government andhad expressed concern at the failure of the French Government to res-pond to the Commission&apos;s representations, but there was very little signof the Commission taking effective ^.ction in pursuit of their powers underthe Treaty of Rome.    He would shortly be putting a paper to hiscolleagues on the particular problem of competition from subsidisedimports of French turkeys.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
