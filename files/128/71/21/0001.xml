CONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet wers informed of th e businea* to be takon in theHouse of Commons duriug the following week.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that in ajudgment delivered that morning the five Law Lords who had beenhearing the cage of Bromley Co incil v. the Greater London Council(GLC) on the payment of subsidies to London Traneport hadunanimously upheld the decision of the Court of Appeal.    He hadyet to see the full text of the judgment.    If the ruling was that thepayment of any subsidies by the GLC to London Transport wasunlawful, early legislation warild probably be necessary to permitthe payment of reasonable subsidies and to prevent fares beingincreased to a wholly unacceptable level.    If (as seemed morelikuly) the decision was that subsidies were not in themselvesunlawful hut. that the (&apos;, I/; had gone further than wan reasonable, noimmediate   legislation would be needed, though an urgent reviewcf London Transport&apos;s financial position would have to be put in hand,and sharp faro increases would still be inevitable.    The position onthe supplementary rate levied by the GLC would have to beclarified, since part of the yield had already been used to subsidisefares, with a further proportion being earmarked for futuresubsidies.    The effect of the judgment On the payment of subsidiesby other local authorities to passenger transport executives woulddepend on the detailed ground;; lor the Law Lord:;&apos; de&lt; i ;.ion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that the judgment was a major vindication of(iuvi rnroini policy.    In their first public response to it, theSecretary of State for Transport and other Ministers concerned.should avoid being drawn into technicalities, and should concentrateon getting across the essential point that in an important area theCourts had demonstrated that they were prepared to protect rate-payer-it against irresponsible and unlawful expenditure by localauthorities.    The Secretary of State for Transport should make theGovei Ciment&apos;s position clear in his reply to the Private NoticeQuestion which had been tabled by Mr Nigel Spearing MP foranswer that afternoon.     He .should also, in consultation with theSecretary of State for the Environment and the Attorney General,urgently prepare an analysis for the information of the Cabinet ofthe implications of the judgment.The Cabinet -1.

CONFIDENTIALii,     in consultation with the Secretary oi Statefor the .Environment and the Attorney General, tocirculate urgently ior the information of the Cabineta note on the implications of the House of Lort3sjudgment.Control of LocalAuthorityExpenditurepreviousReference:CC(01) 36thConclusions,Minute 5THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT saidthat the level of the rate support grant for 1982-83 reflected theagreement reached in Cabinet on the total expenditure of localauthorities.    In a number of crucial areas the expenditure incurredby local authorities was influenced or determined by Ministersresponsible for functional programmes.      Although Ministers incharge of the major spending Departments had made it clear thatthey would resist any attempt to exceed the agreed targets, ithad been alleged by a number of local authorities and local authorityassociationc that officials had in some cases put them underpressure to maintain existing expenditure on particular programmes,,Local authorities could be expected to attempt to play oneDepartment off against another, and it was extremely importantthat all Ministers should impress on their officials the need toensure that in their dealings with local authorities they said anddid nothing which could be regarded or prayed in aid by localauthorities as an excuse for failure to stay within their overallexpenditure targets.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that theCabinet recognised that the breakdown of local authority expenditureas published in successive Public Expenditure White Papers wasindicative rather than prescriptive, and that individual authoritieshad discretion to determine their own priorities within the globaltotal.     Ministers and officials should, however, do their utmostto ensure that the total was not exceeded, and should heed theguidance given by the Secretary of State for the Environment inwhat he had said.    Local authorities should be asked to justify indetail any proposed expenditure on individual items which wentbeyond the indicative targets, and tc explain what compensatingadjustments would be made to other programmes.The Cabinet -2.       Invited all Ministers concerned to ensure that,in their discussions with local authorities, officialsdid nothing which might appear to encourage or condonefailure by the authorities to observe the expendituretargets agreed by the Cabinet,2CONFIDENTIAL

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that lack of information made itimpossible to be clear what was happening in Poland, following themilitary clamp-down on 13 December.   The whereabouts of the leaderof the Solidarity trades union movement, Mr Walesa, v ere not known;it seemed likely that he was not folly at liberty, and that he wasresisting pressure from the Polish authorities to co-operate with themeg by appearing on television.    Workers holding sit-in protests intheir factories had been evicted by the Army and the police, but therewere no confirmed reports of casualties.    Soviet troops in Polandwere confined to their barracks;  and there was no sign of externalmilitary intervention.     But it was improbable that the Polish peoplewould simply accept the present situation;   and there was a clear riskof further strikes and disturbances taking place that day, whicb wasthe anniversary of the 1970 riots in Gdansk.     The Polish Armyconsisted largely of conscripts, many of whom would have family tieswith members of Solidarity, and could not be expected to be able tomaintain control if there were widespread unrest.     In such circum-stances the Polish Government would be extremely reluctant to resumenegotiations with Solidarity and might therefore feel obliged to call forSoviet military help.     There were some 600 British subjects in Poland,,who had been advised to keep their heads down.     Local communicationswere heavil/ restricted.     The Foreign Ministers of the membercountries of the European Community had agreed that economicassistance to Poland already in the pipeline should not be stopped butthat no decisions could yet be made about 1982.    Current deliveriesof British food aid were largely complete.     There was no presentintention to re-open the multilateral agreement on re-schedulingPoland&apos;t! official 1981 debts to the Wet&gt;t, which had been signed somemonths earlier, bu.t the equivalent agreement for 1982 would not besigned for the time being.    As regards Poland&apos;s non-official debts toover 400 Western banks, interest payments under agreed re-scheduling arrangements were due on 28 December,    It was not clearwhether these payments would be made;  nor whether Poland would bedeclared to have defaulted if they were not.    Public default mightprecipitate Soviet intervention.In the coarse of a brief discussion it was noted that there were argu-ments both for and against the continuation of food aid and other formeof assistance.     The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary wouldshortly be sending his colleagues a minute on the implications of thepresent situation for Departments&apos; economic dealings with Poland; andthe Secretary of the Cabinet would arrange for any interdepartmentalco-ordination needed in that context.3
CONFIDENTIALab/IsraelpreviousReference:CC(81) 40thConclusions,minute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Israelis had taken advantage ofinternational preoccupations with Poland to extend their law to theGolan Heights area of Syria which they had occupied since 1967.This move was tantamount, to annexation and was contrary both tointernational law and to the United Nations&apos; Resolution 242      It hadattracted the condemnation of most other Governments, including theUnited States.    The matter was currently being considered by theUnited Nations Security Council, &lt;~n the basis of an acceptable Syriandraft resolution which did not demand the imposition of sanctions.This draft called on the Israelis to rescind their decision andenvisaged a further meeting of the Council in a week&apos;s time at whichthe Secretary General would report on their response.    The IsraeliForeign Minister, Mr Shamir, had sought to justify his Government&apos;sbehaviour in a letter to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, towhich no reply had yet been sent.    Meanwhile the Syrians wereadopting a threatening attitude but had net attempted to take militaryaction and were probably incapable of doing so effectively.East/WestRelationsPreviousReference:CC(81) 38thConclusions,Minute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that little progress had been made atthe review meeting in Madrid of the Conference on Security andCo-operation in Europe,    It had been in danger of coming to anunsatisfactory end before Christmas, but the neutral and non-alignedgovernments involved had now put forward a proposal for the meetingto be reconvened in February 1982.    If this were adopted, as seemedpossible, the Western Alliance would continue to be able to use theConference as a means of exposing th~ inadequate human rightsrecord of the Soviet Union and other Communist states.United NationsTHE LORD PRIVY SEAL welcomed the appointment of the Peruviancandidate, Senor Cuellar,  as Secretary General of the United Nations.He already had considerable experience of United Nations work. Thecandidacy of the Commonwealth Secretary General, Mr ShridathRrmphal, had attracted little support.The CabinetTook note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIMMUNITYUFFAjlRS(0 May Mandate^roviousReference:;C(81) 40thConclusions,minute 33. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said the meeting of ForeignMinisters on 14 aad 15 December had not been able to solve thefour outstanding points on the Mandate of 30 May 1980 which hadbeen referred to them by the European Council.    There were sigw?,.that agreement could have been reached on Mediterranean agricul-ture and the control of agricultural expenditure within the Communitybudget but differences still existed on milk and on the budgetproblem itself.    At a restricted session of Foreign Ministers alone,the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had gained the firmimpression that there was now more understanding of the Britishposition on the budget issue and some chance of movement afterChristmas.    The President of the Commission had been invited toprepare revised suggestions, and the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary would be seeing him in Strasbourg that day in order toensure that he was aware of the British Government&apos;s minimumrequirements.In a brief discussion it was noted that the Prime Minister hadreported to the European Parliament in Strasbourg on the outcomeof the recent meeting of the European Council.    At the Council ofMinisters (ECOF.TN) on 14 December some minor issues had beenagreed, but no agreement had been reached on the Directiveproviding for freedom to supply insurance services.    It would nowbe necessary to consider whether, in spite of the wishes of theBritish insurance industry, the Government should modify itsposition on notification procedures or abandon the efforts to securean agreed Directive.    The ECOFIN Council had instructed itssubsidiary bodies to examine the further development of the EuropeanMonetary System in preparation for discussion at the next meetingof the European Council.    Collective discussion of possible Britishmembership of the exchange rate mechanism would be necessarybefore then.    A further meeting of the Council of Ministers (Budget)before Christmas would probably be necessary in the light of thevoting in the European Parliament on the 1982 Community Budget.The meeting of the Council of Ministers (Transport) on 15 Decemberhad achieved very little.    The meeting of the Council of Ministers^Agriculture) on 1 5 December had been notable for the widespreadcriticism, including that of the Federal Republic of Germany, of therecent decision by the French Government to give substantial furtherfinancial aid to the French farming industry.    The Council ofMinisters (Social Affairs) on 8 December had reached agreement ona regulation extending reciprocal social security rights to the self-employed.    This was an important step forward which should begiven publicity.    There was also a prospect that agreement could bereached on the Directive to control the exposure to lead of workersin the lead industry.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office17 December l?8lCONFIDENTIAL
