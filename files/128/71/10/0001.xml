CONFIDENTIALPARLIAMENTARYh-FAlRS1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTERAND PAYMASTER GENERAL informed the Cabinet of the businessto be taken in the House of Commons during the first *reek after thesummer Recess.    He said that he would be informing the House ofCommons that it was proposed to open the new Session ofParliament on 4 November 1981.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the report on the raids whichhad been undertaken by the police in Brixton a fortnight ago wasnot likely to be ready until later in the day.    It would be morecomplex than had been expected, with clear indications that atleast some of the property reported as damaged in the raids hadbeen planted in advance.    The report would have to go to theDirector of Public Prosecutions in the first instance, and he wouldnot be able to make mere than a holding statement in the House ofCommons before the Recess.    He would do this by WrittenAnswer.    The Opposition spokesman on home affairs was likely toaccept that no mere than a holding statement should be made, butmight press him for a statement on the events in Liverpool twonights previously, when a man had been killed, apparently by apolice van.    He had sent his Chief Inspector of Constabulary toMersayside, and police tactics had already been changed theresince the events in question.    Nonetheless, though it might bedifficult to refuse a statement if it was demanded, it would bepreferable not to have to make one, for fear of further exacerbat-ing the already tense feelings on Merseyside about the police.This feeling centred on the Chief Constable.    The statutoryposition was that a police authority had the power,   subject to theSecretary of State&apos;s approval, to call upon a Chief Constable toretire in the interests of efficiency.     The Secretary of State had astatutory right to call on the police authority to exercise that power,but only after an inquiry had been held.     The majority of theMerseyside police authority were keen to exercise their power,but hi* approval would not be forthcoming:  it was important thatthe Chief Constable&apos;s authority should be upheld at this time, evenof the eonduct of the police migh*- not have been beyond criticism.The tactics adopted by the police could give rise to awkwardquestions of law as well as to political problems.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL confirmed that it waslikely that the Government would be uefeated in the House of Lordsin the debate later in the day on a motion calling upon theOovernment to reconsider the instructions given to the BritishBroadcasting Corporation to cut certain external broadcastingservices.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that themeeting of the Council of Ministers (Budget) on 23-24 July, whichhad been preceded by a bridge-building meeting with a delegationfrom the European Parliament the day before, had reachedagreement on die draft amending Budget for 1981, so opening theway to a political settlement of the dispute with the Parliament overthe 1981 Budget.    The Council had also established the draft Budgetof tiie Community for 1982.    This Budget included full provision forthe refunds due to the United Kingdom under the 30 May 1980agreement in respect of our 19S1 contribution.    The UnitedKingdom had also secured an entry in the minutes acknowledging theneed for further budgetary acion if it proved necessary to extendthe refund arrangements to cover 1982.    The increases agreed bythe Council for the Regional and Social Funds, were reasonablysatisfactory, and the fact that the Budget Council, for the first time,had subjected the estimates for agricultural guarantee expenditureto a detailed examination was a welcome development. But,despite pressure from the United Kingdom and Germany for a cut ofsome  230 million in the Commission&apos;s proposals foi this section,in accordance with our desire to keep the growth in agriculturalspending markedly below the rate of growth in own resources, themost we could achieve after long discussion was agreement on. acompromise arrangement under which these sums were transferredto the reserve chapter of the Budget.    Provision for the UnitedKingdom butter subsidy was made in the same reserve chapter,from which funds could in future be drawn by a qualified majorityvote in the Council.7 JulY THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidries that the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 27 July had been unableouncil to reach agreement on Commission proposals for Total AllowableCatches (TACs) and quotas for the reopening of herring fishing,revious The Commission had nevertheless asserted that their proposals noweference: had legal force and that they therefore had the right to monitorC(81) 28th catches and order fishing to cease if the limits in their proposalsdelusions, were exceeded.    They had based this assertion on a recent judgmentnute 3 in which the European Court of Justice had ruled against UnitedKingdom fisheries conservation measures introduced by the previous2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAdministration.    As Chairman of the Council, he had sought theadvice of the Council&apos;s legal services.    They had agreed that theCommission&apos;s claim to impose their proposals in the absence ofCouncil agreement was ill-founded:  while it might have some basisso far as conservation measures were concerned, it could not applyto quotas, which were a matter ior political decision.    In view ofthe serious implicationj of this development for the rights andpowers of the member states vis-a-vis those of the Commission,he would shortly write to the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryseeking his advice, and that cf Foreign and Commonwealth Officelawyers, on whether the position taken by the Commission at theFisheries Council should be challenged and if so how. Meanwhile,Dutch, German and Scottish fishing boats had already set sail for theherring fisheries;  he had arranged for increased surveillance, witha view to closing the fishery as soon as the TACs had been caught.In a brief discussion, it was reported that this issue had been raisedinformally with M Thorn, President of the Commission, during hisvisit to London for the Royal Wedding.    He had himself expresseddoubts about whether the Commission had the powers claimed byCommissioner Contogecrgis in the Fisheries Council.    There wasgeneral agreement on the need for an urgent examination of the scopefor United Kingdom action to challenge the Commission&apos;s claim tohare   powers to act when the Council of Ministers had failed to agree.If the Commission were in future able to insist that their proposalscame into force in the absence of Council agreement, our own fishingindustry would lose confidence in the Government&apos;s ability to protecttheir interests in the run-up to tne resumed Common FisheriesPolicy negotiations in September.    More generally, the Oppositionwould naiflo on this development as a further example of the loss ofnational sovereignty to the bureaucracy in Brussels.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY reported that azecent announcement in the Pres&quot; and on the television that theCommission had approved only  190 million of the total financeagreed by the Government for the British S&apos;.eel Corporation for1981-82 told only part of the story, and was unhelpful in terms ofpublic opinion.    In fact the Commission had agreed the payment of 190 million to cover the period to tho end of October; negotiationswere continuing on an application in respect of the remaining 360   million, on which a decision was not expected until the turnof the year:  it seemed likely that the decision, when it came, wouldbe in the United Kingdom&apos;s favour.The Cabinet -Took note.3CONFIDENTIALFinance for thefritish SteelCorporation
CONFIDENTIALROPOSALS FORO&apos;JSINGEGISLATION -ENTEREGULATION4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C(8l) 42) by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Industry,the Secretary of State for the Environment and the Secretary ofState for Wales about proposals for selective deregulation ofprivate sector rents by area.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER and THE MINISTERFOR LOCAL GOVEPJNMENT AND ENVIRONMENTAL SERVICESsaid that the Secretaries of State for the Environment and for Waleshad made proposals for the selective deregulation of private sectorrents by area for new lettings only.    The proposed reduction inexpenditure on public housing, which meant that in many areas theonly new dwellings that wculd be built for public 1 siting would bethose for the old and other particular groups, made it the moreimportant to reverse the decline in the private rented sector. Ithad been estimated that up to 6C, 000 dwellings a year were atpresent empty because of the existence of rent control and themeasures proposed might bring some 10,000 a year on to the rentedmarket..    They might also give landlords sufficient return toimprove the condition of rented dwellings, which was often very poor.The proposed power disapplying the present fair rent regime wouldbe capable of use in respect of dwellings in any area or for aparticular class of dwelling.    The power could, if the Cabinet sodecided, be expressed as not applying to London, and would in a.nyevent be used initially only in non-metropolitan areas.    New tenantsin deregulated areas would still have security of tenure for onegeneration and the right to apply to the Rent Officer for a marketrent to be fixed.    These safeguards, and the fact tnat no existingtenants would be affected, distinguished the proposals from those inthe 1957 Rent Act and, while the Opposition in Parliament would nodoubt mount a scare campaign against the proposals, the case forthem could be demonstrated.    The present system of rent controlimpeded the mobility of labour and even the proposed relativelymodest step towards removing the rigidities of that system wouldassist those changing jobs or moving with their employment. TheSecretaries of State hoped to include the necessary provisions in theHousing Bill to be introduced next Session.    The Home and SocialAffairs Committee (H) had not, however, been able to agree on thecase for early legislation, and the matter had therefore beenremitted to the Cabinet for decision.In discussion it was pointed out that the only rented accommodationavailable in some rural areas was used for holiday lettings. Ayoung married couple could not find such accommodation.    At leastin these areas the political effect of the proposed change might bebeneficial.    It was argued, on the other hand, that the Oppositionwould undoubtedly unite in opposing the proposals, and any threat bythem to repeal the provisions if they were returned to office wouldmake prospective landlords reluctant to provide new lettings,especially since prospective tenants would have  security of tenure.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe housing gain would in any event be neither large nor immediateand did not outweigh the political disadvantages of legislating at thisstage of a Parliament.    It would be better to contemplate legisla-tion in the first Session of the next Parliament, although that raidedthe   question of what should be said on the subject in any electionmanife sto.In  further discussion the following points were made:-a. Since tenants would retain entitlement to rentallowances or help with housing costs throughsupplementary benefit, there would be seme additionalpublic expenditure through increased rents, Theamount would, however, be small and had to be setagainst the economic arguments for improving theeffectiveness of the housing market.b. The case for adding this controversial proposal tothe Housing Bill had to be judged against the otherprovisions that might find a place in that Bill and in thecontext of the legislative programme as a whole.c. Even if the proposals were introduced in Englandand Wales there was no present intention of followingsuit in Scotland or Northern Ireland.d. The proposals differed from the existing provisionsfor shorthold tenancies in that the deregulation of certainprivate sector rents would be carried out within the generalcompass of the Rent Acts.    H Committee had alreadyagreed in principle to lift the initial compulsoryregistration of fair rents for shorthold tenancies inEngland and Wales outside Greater London. Parliamentarytime had not been found to debate the necessary affirmativeorders before the Recess.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the strong case for removing the restrictions onthe level of rents in the private rented sector, and some memberswould have welcomed proposals that went rather further than thosein C(8l) 42.    Other members of the Cabinet had stressed thepolitical difficulties.    This difference of view would no doubt bemirrored on the Government&apos;s backbenches.    There was notsufficient agreement to justify including the provisione, which wouldundoubtedly prove very controversial, and might be politicallydamaging, in legislation next Session.    Some, at least, of theadvantages of deregulation of rents could be obtained by greater useof the system of shorthold tenancies.    The Cabinet agreed that theproposed orders removing the requirement that a fair rent mustinitially be registered with the Rent Officer for a letting to beshorthold should be considered by Parliament as soon as possible,5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpreferably during the spillover or, if that did not prove possiblebecause the orderj had yet to be considered by the SelectCommittee on Statutory Instruments, as early as possible in thenew Session.The Cabinet -1. Agreed not to proceed with legislation for theselective deregulation of private sector rents by area.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General and the Lord President of theCouncil, in consultation with the Secretary of State forWales and the Minister for Local Government andEnvironmental Services, to arrange for early debateson the orders relating to shortnold under Section 52(4)of the Housing Act 1980, as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Legislativeprogramme1981-82&apos;reviousReference::C(81) 22ndConclusionsiMinute 45. The Committee considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C(81) 41) about the legislative programme for the1981-82 Session of Parliament.THE HOME SECRETARY recalled that at their meeting on 11 Junethe Cabinet had approved the legislative programme for the 1981-82Session of Parliament recommended by The Queen&apos;s Speeches andFuture Legislation Committee (QL) subject to the addition of a Billdealing with trade union immunities, and to further consideration ofthe length of the proposed Housing Bill, the timing of the Gas(Industrial and Commercial Supplies) Bill, and the need for anInsolvency Bill.    Since then, the Ministerial Committee on EconomicStrategy (E) had invited QL to consider the legislative implicationsof their decision, now announced, to require the British GasCorporation (BGC) to dispose of their domestic appliance retailinginterests over a five year period.    The programme provisionallyapproved by the Cabinet would be a difficult one to handle because ofits controversiality, the timing of some of the major Bills, and thelikely Parliamentary atmosphere.    A Canada Bill would almostcertainly have to be introduced early in the Session, and otherlegislation not at present in the proposed main programme mighthave to be added later.    The Secretary of State for Transport hadrecently written to him proposing that he should take additionalpowers in his Transport (Financial Provisions) Bill to control thepayment of subsidies by lecal authorities to passenger transportundertakings.    On the particular questions remitted to QL by theCabinet, it had been agreed that the scope of the Housing Bill shouldbe reviewed by Legislation Committee when the outstanding policyiasues had been settled, and a complete draft of the Bill was available.The Secretary of State for Trade had agreed to withdraw his bid foran Insolvency Bill next Session, and the Secretary of State for theEnvironment now accepted that it was extremely unlikely that timewould unexpectedly become available for his Water Bill,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwhich was not in the programme provisionallyapproved by fhe Cabinet.    QL had been told by the Secretary ofState for Energy that the preparation of the proposed legislation onthe BGC&apos;s gas supply and purchase monopoly could be advanced tomake introduction in January rather than February 1982 possible;but there seemed little prospect of having the gas appliance retailingprovisions, which would have to deal with the consequential changesin the safety legislation, being ready before February.    In thesecircumstances, QL had decided to xecommend that there should be nolegislation next Session on the position of the BGC.    Since C(81) 41had been circulated, the Secretary of State for Energy hadindicated in a letter to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterthat, instead of legislating next Session on the BGC&apos;s monopsony onNortn Sea gas, he would be prepared to substitute a White Papercontaining proposals which would form a oasis for legislation in the1982-83 Session, but that he still considered legislation on gasappliance retailing essential in view of the firm public commitmentgiven by the Government.    Finally, in the light of furtherrepresentations made by the Prince of Wales and the Duchy ofCornwall authorities, QL had accepted the case for adding a Bill tothe programme to enable improvements to be made to the manage-ment of the Duchy, on condition that the legislation was introducedin the House of Commons, and that its reference to a Second ReadingCommittee was not blocked.    Since QL&apos;s discussion the Secretary ofState for Transport had come forward with proposals for urgentlegislation in the finance and control of public transport undertakings.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DLCHY OF LANCASTER. ANDPAYMASTER  GENERAL said that the Government&apos;s ownsupporters still expected them to honour their repeated undertakingsto seek to lighten the burden of legislation.    The proposedprogramme for 1981-82 v/ae already a heavy one, and proposals forfurther additions had been made even since the Home Secretary&apos;3memorandum was circulated.    He remained concerned about thelack of co-ordination between policy formation and the planning ofthe legislative programme.    This might to some extent be unavoid-able in view of the unsettled social and economic situation withwhich the Government had to deal, but it w? 6 particularly importantthat priorities should be carefully chosen, and that the net burden ofproposed legislation should not be increased.    This in turn impliedthat, if major additions were to be rm.de to the programme, it mightbe necessary to defer other measures of comparable importancewhose inclusion in the programme had already been approved.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL! In discussion, it was agreed that the Gas (Industrial and Commercialrelation Supplies) Bill should be dropped from next Session&apos;s programme,on the understanding that the Government&apos;s proposals would be setout in a White Paper as a basis for legislation in the 1982-83 Session.It was noted that the proposals on gas appliance retailing stemmedfrom one of the first reports by *he Monopolies and MergersCommission (MMC) to report adversely on a nationalised industry.It was important that the Government should demonstrate theirdetermination to control monopolies in the public sector as well asin the private sector and follow up their positive response to theMMC report by taking the necessary legislative powers as quickly aspossible.    It was clear that the BGC would not voluntarily complywith the Government&apos;s wishes in this area, and it was evident froma recent meeting between the Trades Union Congress and TreasuryMinisters that they regarded the issue as a test case on privatisation.Although there was concern among some Government supportersabout the Government&apos;s approach, a failure to take effective actionwould certainly be seen as a major climb-down by the Government.The provisions to compel the BGC to dispose of their retailinginterests would be straightforward and could be drafted quickly, butthe accompanying safety provisions were much more complicated,and might not be ready until February.    It was for considerationwhether, in order to expedite the introduction of legislation, theprovision on safety in the primary legislation should take the formof enabling powers under which detailed regulations could beeffected by subordinate legislation.    It was highly desirable that theBill should be introduced before the Christmas Recess, and every-thing possible should be done to expedite its preparation.ransport THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT aaid that theGreater London Council (GLC) had announced their intention to cutLondon Transport fares by 25 per cent.    Some metropolitancounties controlling passenger transport executives planned similaraction.    This would entail an increase in subsidies over thoseallowed for in current public expenditure plans of  265 million in thecurrent year, and  450 million in the following year.    This was adirect challenge to the Government&apos;s control of public expenditure,and he would be proposing to E the following day that he should seekpowers at the beginning of next Session which would, in effect,impose external financing limits on London Transport and the otherPassenger Transport Executives concerned and also contain othernecessary controls.    He had suggested to the Chancellor of theDuchy of Lancaster in his letter of 27 July that between 12 and 15clauses should be added to his proposed Transport (FinancialProvisions) Bill for this purpose.    The Bill could be ready forintroduction atthe beginning of the Session if the ports provisionswere transferred to the second Transport Bill, which would then beintroduced rather later.    The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhad suggested that the necessary powers might be taken in theLocal Government Finance Bill planned for later in the Session, butthis Bill would not bepaacel in time to enable him to restrainsubsidies in the financial year 1982-83.In discussion, the case for early action to restrain the payment ofsubsidies by the GLC and other local authorities, and thus the burdenon the ratepayers, was accepted.    The approach suggested by theSecretary of State for Transport would mean that excessiveexpenditure on public transport was dealt with in a different wayfrom that likely to be proposed for local authority expendituregenerally in the Local Government Finance Bill.    This couldinvolve some presentational difficulties, though there could also beadvantages in making it clear that, in taking drastic powers affectingcertain local authorities&apos; ability to manage transport undertakings,the Government were not seeking to alter in other respects theoverall balance between local and central Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Insolvency Bill and the Gas (Industrial andCommercial Supplies) Bill should be deleted from the programme for1981-82 which they had earlier provisionally approved. Theyaccepted that the necessary powers should be taken in a separateBill to enable the Government to honour their commitment to compelthe BGC to dispose of their gas appliance retailing interests. Theywere disturbed to learn that such a measure might not be ready forintroduction before February 1982.    The Secretary of State forEnergy should use his best endeavours to improve on this timetable,perhaps by confining the safety provisions to a broad enabling powerunder which subordinate regulations could be made, with the objectof having the Bill ready for introduction, if at all possible, beforethe Christmas Recess.    The Cabinet agreed that the attitude of theGLC and certain metropolitan ccna tie   towards passenger trans-port subsidies was a direct threat to the authority of the Government.E Com.nittee would consider the proposals by the Secretary of Statefor Transport and any necessary legislation would have to be givenpriority.    They noted that it might be pcssible to add provisions tothe Transport (Financial Provisions) Bill for introduction at thebeginning of the 1981-82 Session, and that this and other additionalpressures on the programme might mean that it would not be possibleto proceed with some other proposal already approved for inclusionin the programme.    They approved the addition of the Duchy ofCornwall Management Bill to the list of Bills for Second ReadingCommittee procedure next Session.    They noted that LegislationCommittee would review the scope of the proposed Housing Bill whenall the provisions which had received policy approval in principlehad been drafted.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1. Agreed that the Insolvency and Gas (Industrialand Commercial Supplies) Bills should be deleted fromthe programme provisionally approved for the 1931-82Session.2*        Approved the addition to the programme of aBill to compel the British Gas Corporation to disposeof their gas appli-uice retailing interests, and invitedthe Secretary of State for Energy to use his bestendeavours to ensure that such a Bill could be readyfor introduction before the Christmas Recess.3. Subject to policy approval by the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy, agreed thatprovisions to control the payment of subsidies by localauthorities to passenger transport undertakings and todeal with other matters related thereto should be addedto the programme.4. Approved the addition of the Duchy of CornwallManagement Bill to the programme, on condition thatits reference to a Second Reading Committee was notblocked in the House of Commons.5.
