GENERAL informed the Cabinet of thebusiness to be taken in the House of Commons during thefollowing week.    He would tell the House that afternoon that hewould use his best endeavours to enable the House to rise for thesummer recess on 31 July, but he could not yet guarantee this.French TurkeysPreviousReference:CC(81) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe debate on a European Community document on fresh poultrymeat on 20 July would provide an opportunity for members tocomplain about the effect on the British poultry industry of theimport of French turkeys and other poultry at prices madepossible only by the large subsidies given by the FrenchGovernment to their industry.    The Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, who was due to discuss the problem with theEuropean Commission on 20 July, would take a very firm lineagainst any unfair French competition.The Cabinet -1.Took note.2.       Invited the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheriesand Food, in consultation with the Lord Frivy Seal,to report to the Cabinet the outcome of his meetingwith the European Commission on subsidies to theFrench poultry industry.FOREIGNAFFAIRSCambodia2. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary was attending the United NationsConference on Cambodia in New York, where he had spoken inhis Presidency capacity on behalf of the ten member countriesof the European Community.    The Conference was not expectedto produce concrete results, but there were obvious similaritiesbetween the situations in Cambodia and in Afghanistan, and it wasdesirable to support the efforts being made over Cambodia by theAssociation of South East Asian Nations, in order to ensure theirsupport for the initiative on Afghanistan put forward by Britain onbehalf of the Ten.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALPolandpreviousReference:CC(8l) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2THE LO&amp;D PRIVY SEAL said that the current Congress of thePolish Communist Party peemed likely to support the moderatepolicies advocated by Poland&apos;s present leaders, notably Mr Kaniaand General Jaruzelski.    The Soviet Union still appeared to besuspending judgment.    But Mr Kania had not yet secured re-electionas First Secretary of the Party and remained under threat bothfrom extreme hard-liners and extreme reformists.    He had alsohad to stress the seriousness of Poland&apos;s economic situation, whichhad forced the authorities to propose price rises of over 100 percent for bread and other food items.BelizePreviousReference:CC(81) 26thConclusions,Minute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that negotiations with theGuatemalans in New York the previous week had shown that itwould not after all be possible to conclude an Anglo-GuatemalanTreaty relating to Belize, but the situation was less unsatisfactorythan might appear.    Mr Price, the Premier of Belize, would haveinsisted that any Treaty be submitted to a referendum there, atwhich it might well have been rejected.    The atmosphere of theNew York negotiations had been good and the attitude of theGuatemalans remained friendly.    While formally reserving theirposition, they seemed to have accepted that Belize would nowproceed to early independence.    The arrangements forindependence would be worked out with Mr Price, who would becoming to Lnndon the following week.The CabinetTook note.COMMUNITYAFFAIRSFirst Meetingsunder the BritishPresidency3. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL  said that the first meeting of dieCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) under the BritishPresidency on 13 July had got off to a&apos;prompt start, and had madequick but useful progress on a number of issues.    There had alsobeen a meeting on accession with the Spanish Foreign Ministerbut, due to obstruction by the French, little had been achieved.SbeepmeatPreviousReference:CC(81) 27thConclusions,Minute 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND f*90d saidthat the Commission had eventually made a proposal for reducingthe clawback premium on sheepmeat exports but, after consultationwith the abbatoir owners and the National Farmers Union, he haddeclined to agree to it.    He had, however, lifted the UnitedKingdom&apos;s reserve on other agricultural regulations. TheCommissioner responsible, M Dalsager, recognised that the UnitedKingdom had been let down.    Other opportunities to pursue thequestion would soon arise.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALHerringfishingTHE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODreported that two German trawlers had been arrested off Stornowayand charged with illegally catching herring.    Their defence wasthat they had been authorised by the German Government which tookthe view that such fishing was legal since the Commission had madea proposal to the Council of Ministers for allowing limited fishingfor herring in that are?.    The Scottish Court had dealt with thematter sensibly by confiscating the herring catch and admonishingthe skippers.    In his view, the German Government had actedimproperly in telling German fishermen that they were entitled tofish without any prior consultation with the British Government.The legal argument that, once a Commission proposal had beenmade, it could be enforced even before the Council had taken adecision would certainly be rejected by a British Court, althoughthe attitude of the European Court was more doubtful.    To condonewhat the German Government had done would create a dangerousprecedent.    There had been discussions with the German fisheriesauthorities since the incident, and these would need to be pursued.The Commission&apos;s proposal   was due to come before a meeting ofthe Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 27 July.    At that meetingwe would support the introduction of limited fishing for herring,but the allocation between member states would need to be agreed.The Cabinet -Took note.NORTHERNIRELANDpFFAIRSPreviousReference:|CC(81) 27thConclusions,Minute 54. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that in the Maz  Prison the protesting republican prisoneiswere replacing each hunger striker who died and thus keeping thenumber on strike constant at eight.    One man had died unexpectedl/early, on 1.3 July.     His death, following the Army&apos;s action againstthe detachment of the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)which had fired a ceremonial volley at the funeral of the previousstriker to die, had been expected to lead to serious rioting but hadnot in fact done so.    Indeed, the security situation in the Provinceremained comparatively calm, and it seemed possible that publicopinion was losing interest in the strike.    But the next striker likelyto die, on about 20 July, was a member of the Dail.    The prospectof his death was causing great anxiety to the Government of theRepublic of Ireland, who had sent the Acting Foreign Minister andthe Foreign Minister designate to talk to the Lcrd Privy Seal andhimself on 10 July.    Among their fears was the possibility that theby-election following this death would be won by Fianna Fail andthat the Government coalition&apos;s narrow Parliamentary majority,already very tenuous, would then be even more at risk. Meanwhile,anti-British opinion in the United States, and particularly amongmembers of the Congress, appeared to be hardening, as theMinister of State, Northern Ireland Office (Mr Alison) had foundCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALduring a recent visit.    The strikers&apos; apparent abandonment of theirclaim for differential treatment had now made it possible for theGovernment to take up an outstanding offer from the InternationalCommittee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to visit Northern Ireland in order toinspect prisons and if appropriate make recommendations about prisonconditions.    The ICRC were empowered under their own regulations toconcern themselves witn ordinary criminal prisoners, as well as withprisoners of war,    They had been previously involved in NorthernIreland between 1971 and 1974, when they had inspected the conditions ofinternees and detainees.    They acted only in response to an invitationfrom the Government concerned, but they had made clear to the presentGovernment in December 1980, and again more formally in May 1981,that they were available if required.    Their representatives would bearriving in Belfast later that morning.    The prisoners had beeninformed.    The Government were not committed to implementing anyrecommendations they might make, although there would no doubt bestrong pressure to dc so.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that the situation in tbeUnited States had deteriorated still further since the Minister of State&apos;svisit.     Criticism was now coming even from the Friends of Ireland, anewly-formed Congressional group of moderate men who had initiallymade a satisfactory statement to the effect that a change in the status ofNorthern Ireland could come about only with the consent of a majority ofits inhabitants.    The situation was also deteriorating sharply in theRepublic of Ireland, where the authorities believed that PIRA recruit-ment had been significantly boosted.    For technical reasons the pros-pective by-election in the Republic could not take place until the autumn;and the effect of a long-drawn out campaign seemed certain to bedestabilising.The Cabinet -Took note.[BLIC DERevious27thpcluflute 4sionsj5. THE HOME J ECRETARY said that the further outbreaks ofviolence and looting in urban areas in the past week had been on a muchdiminished scale, and had in most cases been attributable to straight-forward criminal motives.    The Chief Constables expected somedisturbances to continue over the next few weeks, spreading to the sea-side resorts during the holiday period as part of the normal pattern ofhooliganism in recent years.     The tension created by the disturbancesthat had occurred appeared, however, to have increased in Parliamentand the media as actual violence on the streets diminished.    There hadbeen a serious setback the previous evening, when the MetropolitanPolice had entered private premises in Brixton in search of bomb-CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmaking equipment, drugs, and illicit drinking.     Ugly scenes haddeveloped, and there had been much publicised allegations ofunnecessary damage caused by the police in the course of the raids, inwhich no bomb-making equipment had been found.     The failure of theoperation had provided grist to the mills of the critics of the police, andit would be important for him to defend the actions of the MetropolitanPolice in the course of the debate on the riots that afternoon.Lord Scarman had visited Brixton the previous afternoon, on his owninitiative and accompanied only by his wife, and had done a great deal todefuse the situation.    He had himself the previous evening sent aconciliatory message to the local Member of Parliament, Mr Fraser,who had on the whole been helpful, and had that morning sent an officialto Brixton to assess the situation and to report to him personally. Themorale of the police was at present high, and the Chairman of the PoliceFederation proposed to make public the letters of appreciation forGovernment support which he had sent to him and to the Prime Minister;but morale could easily be dented by unfair criticism.    The new helmetsand fire-proof clothing being made available to the police had so farbeen a great success, while the speed with which chief officers and theirmen had developed new tactics of riot management in totally unfamiliarsituations had been impressive.    New helments, fire-proofed clothing,protected vehicles, and possibly armoured cars, were likely to becomepart of the normal equipment of police forces.    He had announced in theHouse of Commons the previous day that water cannon, CS gas andrubber bullets would be made available to be used on the authority ofChief Constables or their immediate deputies when all other methods hadfailed, and there was a serious risk to life or of widespread damage toproperty.     It had been suggested that these weapons should only be usedin individual incidents with his consent.    He believed that this wasunrealistic, and that it was right to leave Chief Constables to form theirown judgments in the light of the prevailing circumstances and ofgeneral principles to be laid down in a code of conduct which would bemade available to Parliament.    Chief Constables were anxious topreserve as much as possible of the traditional methods of Britishpolicing, and fully shared his reluctance to see these weapons usedexcept as a last resort;   some had said to him privately that they wouldnot in any circumstances deploy them,   though they had agreed net to sayso publicly.    The Army would not be used in training the police in theuse of new weapons.    He was grateful to the Secretary of State forDefence for agreeing to make an Army camp available to hold prisoners.It might have been necessary in any event to use such camps because ofthe extreme pressures on the prison system, but he had thought it goodtactics to make the decision known in the context of the riots, althoughthere was no intention of using a camp solely for those convicted oftaking part in them.     There had been some criticism of the fact that hehad made the announcements to a Conservative backbench committee onhome affairs on 13 July, and not to the House of Commons. Similartactics had been employed by all Governments in the past, and he5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALbelieved that on this occasion it had been necessary, and had paid off, interms of rallying the general support of Government backbenchers. Hisstatement in the House the previous day had had a generally favourablereception.    In his speech opening the debate later that day, he wouldseek to establish a generally constructive tone, and, in addition todealing with the immediate measures taken to meet the situation, wouldrefer to the need for improvements in race relations, for better policesensitivity to the feelings of particular groups, and also, though briefly,to underlying soeial and economic factors in the disturbances.    He hadseen the heads of the British Broadcasting Corporation and theIndependent Broadcasting Authority and impressed on them the greatimportance which the Government attached to the responsible reportingof civil disturbances.    He had also drawn their attention to theinflammatory effect which the showing of violent entertainment filmscould have during a period of heightened tension.    They had promised tobear his points in mind, and there had in fact been a marked improvementin news reporting in the last few days.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet gave their full support to the measures which had been taken bythe Home Secretary and the police to bring the recent spate ofdisturbances under control.    There would inevitably be a good deal ofpublic apprehension about the possible effects of any misjudgment in theuse of new police equipment and, in particular, of rubber bullets. TheCabinet agreed that it was unnecessary and undesirable for ChiefConstables to have to seek the Home Secretary&apos;s approval before usingthe new weapons, but it was important that the circumstances in whichthey might do so should be clearly laid down in an agreed code of conduct.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that Chief Constables and their immediatedeputies should have discretion to use new policeweapons in accordance with a clearly defined code ofconduct.2. Took note, with approval, of the HomeSecretary&apos;s : eport.THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had further considered thesuggestion made during the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion that aMinister or Ministers with special responsibility for dealing with theneeds of deprived areas should be appointed.    From her own consul-tations, it had become evident that, although a great deal of public moneyhad been made available in recent years to Liverpool and other similarareas, and new initiatives taken (for example the Urban DevelopmentCorporation, and the Enterprise Zone), there had been a serious lack ofco-ordination which had meant that resources had not been used toCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALanything like the best advantage.    She had now decided to invite theSecretary of State for the Environment, accompanied by Mr Raison,Minister of State, Home Office, to visit Merseyside for a fortnight witha brief to make a full assessment of the needs of the area, to discusscurrent problems with all interested groups, including the ethnicminorities, and to report cn what could be done to achieve betterco-ordinated deployment of the resources already available. Lessonslearnt could be applied in other parts of the country.    The exercisewould be announced by the Home Secretary in the course of that day&apos;sdebate, which the Secretary of State for the Environment would wind up.It would be made clear that this was an extension of the Secretary ofState for the Environment&apos;s normal duties, and not a special appointment,that it was a pilot scheme, and that he and the Minister of State, HomeOffice, would be looking at the area as a whole, and not just at the areasaffected by the recent disturba*-ices in Toxteth.    The regional offices ofall Departments in the Merseyside area should be instructed to give theSecretary of State for the Environment their fullest co-operation both inthe initial assessment and in any follow-up action which resulted from it.The Cabinet -3. Took note.4. Invited all Ministers in charge of Departmentswith offices in Merseyside to instruct their officialsto give every assistance to the Secretary of State forthe Environment and the Minister of State, HomeOffice, in their forthcoming visit to the area.THE HOME SECRETARY said that, as he had indicated in his minute of14 July to the Prime Minister, of which members of the Cabinet hadcopies, there had been a good deal of support among Members on theGovernment side for a modernised version of the Riot Act, but most ofthem had agreed that it would be a mistake to rush into emergencylegislation.     Lord Scarman had told him that he would feel bound tooppose the immediate introduction of such legislation, though he concededthat there might be a case for changes in the law at a later stage. Hehimself intended to carry out an urgent study of the principles on which anew Act might be based, with the intention of bringing proposals beforethe Cabinet later in the summer.    Examination might be given at thesame time to the working of the Riot Damages Act in the light of thedifficulties which were being experienced in achieving an early settlementof the claims by those who had suffered damage to property as a result ofthe recent riots.    The aim might be to bring forward legislation nextSession soon after Lord Scarman had reported, and the Home Officeinquiry into racial attacks had been completed.     The results of theGovernment&apos;s review of the Public Order Act cculd be announced at thesame time.    In the meantime, the police appeared to be experiencing noundue difficulties in pressing charges under existing legislation.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion the following main points were made -a. A number of major policy issues would need to be settledbefore an assessment could be made of the need for an updatedRiot Act, including the definition of a riot, and on whoseauthority an order to disperse was to be given.b. The Riot Damages Act provided no compensation for damageto vehicl s or for loss of earnings, and imposed a short timelimit on claims.    Within these constraints, police authoritiescould use it effectively to pay compensation, though in somecases claims were taking an unnecessarily long time to settle.c. Reform of the Public Order Act would have to deal with thecontrol of marches and possibly with demonstrations outsidecourts, though the latter already technically constituted acontempt.    Such legislation would be extensive and highlycomrover sial.d. The magistrates&apos; courts were dealing expeditiously withsummary charges arising from the recent riots. Arrangementshad been made for hearing cases to be tried on indictment assoon as the prosecution and defence were ready;  the first caseswould probably be heard in September.    General delays in thehigher courts, though still serious, were being reduced. Remandcases were taking about 15 weekj on average in the London area,and twice that period where bail had been allowed.    Cases in theprovinces took about half that time.    The Director of PublicProsecutions was not involved in most of the charges arisingfrom the latest riots, and any delay in bringing cases before thecourts was probably due to the time taken by the police toassemble and present their case.e. The penalties imposed in the cases arising from the firstBrixton riots had arguably been too lenient, but the magistrates&apos;courts dealing with the more recent riots had awarded moresevere penalties.    London magistrates&apos; courts appeared to takea more lenient view than those in the provinces.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Government&apos;s supporters expected them to fulfil their electionpledges on law and order, and if further study confirmed that earlylegislation was desirable to assist the police in dealing with rioters, itshould be sufficiently comprehensive to remedy the existing defects inlegislation dealing with public order, including the Riot Damages Act.They agreed that it would be a mistake to introduce emergencylegislation to revive the Riot Act before the Recess, but the HomeSecretary should arrange for a further report to be made to the Cabinet8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALas soor. as possible about legislation which might be required nextSession.    In the meantime, all possible action should be taken toexpedite the settling of claims for riot damage, if necessary by findingsome way of making payments on account.The Cabinet -5. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Attorney General and the Lord Advocate, to bringproposals on possible changes in the law before theCabinet as soon as possible, as indicated in the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.6. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for the Environment, to consider further whatmeasures could be taken to expedite the payment ofclaims for riot damage and to report to the Cabinet.7. Invited the Attorney General to confirm that theOffice of the Director of Public Prosecutions was notresponsible for delays in bringing riot cases beforethe courts, and to report to the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office16 July 19819CONFIDENTIAL
