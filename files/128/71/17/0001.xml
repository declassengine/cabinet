The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.REIGNFAIRSderal RepublicGermanyeviousference:(81) 19thnclusions,nute 32. THE PRIME MINISTER said the successful Anglo-GermanSummit Meeting the previous day had been the tenth in that series.The German authorities had gone to considerable trouble to makearrangements designed to draw public attention to the occasion.In discussion it was noted that the Germans were currently in anintroverted mood as regards defence policy and the Western Alliance.In some cases, eg over the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;sinfrastructure programme, they seemed ready to disrupt importantareas of the Alliance&apos;s work for the sake of comparatively small sumsof money.    They also faced, demographic difficulties over maintainingtheir troop strength on the Central Front.    Failure to live up to theircommitments to the Alliance in such respects could cause seriousdifficulties, particularly in their relations with the United States.ms Controleviouslference:(81) 32ndnclusions,nute 2THE PRIME MINISTER said that President Reagan&apos;s speech theprevious day had been skilfully designed to enable the United States,to seize the initiative from the Sovie, Union.    She and the FederalChancellor had welcomed the President&apos;s proposals for reductionsas well as limitations across a wide military spectrum includingstrategic nuclear, theatre nuclear and conventional forces; and inparticular his support for the &quot;zero option&quot; under which the NorthAtlantic Treaty Organisation&apos;s plan to rtrengthen its theatre nuclearforces would be abandoned if the Russians dismantled theircorresponding weapons including the 5S20, SS4 and SS5 missiles. Itwas now up to the Soviet Union to respond appropriately;  even if theinitial response was not totally negative, tough negotiations thereafterwould be inevitable;  and reliable verification would be an essentialelement in the outcome.In discussion it was generally recognised that the Americans&apos; proposalsand the comments of their allies had been well calculated to underminethe position both of the Soviet Union and of the protagonists of unilateralnuclear disarmament in Britain and other Western countries. Thezero option was not likely to prove attainable, and this coulu give riseto later problems with Western public opinion.    The key task in theimmediate future, therefore, would be to make clear how badly theRussians would be putting themselves in the wrong if, as seemed likely,they failed to respond positively to the present offer.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL ib/Israelevious^rence:;(81) 36thmclusions,inute 3THE PRIME MINISTER said that intense diplomatic efforts werebeing made to overcome the problems which had arisen on thestatements which would be associated with the announcement of theagreed participation by Britain and three other members of theEuropean Community in the proposed Sinai multinational force andobservers.    It would be important for these statement to be issuedin good time before the Arab Summit meeting in Fez the followingweek.    They would need to reflect the even-handed approach, asbetween Arab and Israeli interests, which had been embodied in theEuropean Community&apos;s Venice Declaration of June 1980. Agreementhad been reached between eight membeis of the Community, includingBritain, but difficulties persisted between the Prime Minister ofGreece, Mr Papandreou, whose close relations with the PalestineLiberation Organisation prejudiced him against the VeniceDeclaration, and President Mitterand of France, who despite hisearlier suspicions of the Declaration was now insisting that it mustbe favourably mentioned.The CabinetTook note.3MM UNITYIFFAIRSttdgetestructuringMandatereviouseference:C(81) 36thinclusions,linute 43. THE PRIME MINISTER saia that it was clear that theEuropean Council on 26 and 27 November was not going to get far onthe 30 May 1980 Mandate.    It would be necessary to damp down publicand Press expectations accordingly.    Little progress had been madein the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) and the Council of Ministers(Foreign Affairs) on 16 and 17 November.    There were still majordisagreements on the chapter dealing with reform of the CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP), relating principally to the proportion ofthe Community Budget which should be spent on the CAP, the co-responsibility levy in the milk sector, and the regime to be appliedto Mediterranean agriculture.    Even less progress had been madetowards agreeing guidelines on the chapter concerned with budgetrestructuring.    In the Anglo-German summit talks on this subject,the Federal Chancellor had reiterated the German determination tosee a limit put on their net contribution, but he had so far come to noconclusion on a formula or scheme for putting this objective intopractice.    In these circumstances it was likely that the Mandatenegotiations would not come to a point of decision until the nextEuropean Council in the spring of 1982, when they would get caught upwith the agricultural price fixing negotiations.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discussion, it was suggested that continued efforts shouldbe made to win German support for acceptable guidelines to be agreedat the November European Council as a basis for further negotiationsleading up to the March 1982 Council.    Herr Matthoeffer, theGerman Finance Minister, had acknowledged this need in the Anglo-German talks, and had urged that as much progress as possibleshould be made while M Delors, the French Finance Minister, was inoffice, since he was more likely than most of his colleagues to showunderstanding on this score.    More generally, it was clear that theGermans were worried about their economic and budgetary problems,and that this was putting a strain on the coalition.    Their bankruptcyrate was higher than that of the United Kingdom and their industrialproduction was falling, whereas British output had risen faster thanthat of any other member state during the last quarter.    On steel,it was noted that the bilateral talks had confirmed that Germany andthe United Kingdom saw eye to eye on the need to ensure that themeasures to control steel aids agreed in the Council of Ministers(Steel) in June were effectively applied by the other member statesand the Commission.Novemberuncil ofnistersconomic andnance)eviousference:;(81) 33rdinclusions,nute 41 HE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Council ofMinisters (Economic and Finance) had met on 17 November to discussthe draft nor-life insurance services Directive.    Although difficultiesstill lay ahead, and it was clear that the Directive would not beadopted during the United Kingdom Presidency, a number of memberstates had shown a disposition to move towards a compromiseagreement.utiles&apos;eviousTerence:-(81) 2 5thdelusions,&apos;nute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR;TRADE ssfid that thoiGouncil ofMinisters (Foreign Affairs) on 17 November had succeeded, except inone important area, in agreeing a negotiating Mandate for theCommission in the current negotiations on the renewal of the Multi-Fibre Arrangement (MFA) in Geneva.    The exception related to thetransitional arrangements under which suppliers might use up theunexpired portions of existing textile quotas during the currency of thenew agreement.    The United Kingdom, had argued for a more preciseand automatic means than that proposed by the Commission for slowingdown the rate at which these unused quotas could be taken up, but wasnow isolated.    He was accordingly reviewing the position urgently.The French had also urged, with United Kingdom and Italian support,that no final decision should be taken by the Community on participation3CONFIDENTIAL

Thisglobal ceiling would be considered at the December Council meeting.He intended to make a statement to the House on these matters nextweek; he would consult the Lord President of the Council on itstiming.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat it might be necessary to postpone the Council of Ministers(Fisheries) scheduled for 30 November/1 December until after theDanish General Election on 8 December.The Cabinet -Took note.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrTHERN 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND[AND said that the security forces in Northern Ireland had been aware forsome time that the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA)evious terrorists h?d regrouped during the hunger strike at the Maze Frisonerence: earlier in the year and were preparing for a renewed campaign of(81) 28th violence.    Though the security forces had had several successeselusions, (which could not be publicised), there had been an increasing numberate 4 of attacks in border areas on part-time members of the UlsterDefence Regiment in particular;  and the murder on 14 November ofthe Member of Parliament for Belfast South, Mr Robert Bradford,had precipitated a crisis of confidence among the Frotestant community,who felt that recent events demonstrated that despite many years ofstruggle there was no sign of victory in the battle against terrorism.A sympton of this had been the hostile reception which he himself hadencountered when he had attended Mr Bradford&apos;s funeral in accordancewith his own wishes and those of the bereaved family.   The police hadbeen well aware of his movements on that occasion, and the family hadsubsequently thanked him for coming and apologised for what happened.Protestant leaders had no very clear ideas on what extra measuresshould be taken against terrorism, although there were suggestionsthat suspects should be interned en masse and that the security forcesshould shoot on sight;  but their followers were increasingly in a moodto take the law into their own hands if not enough was done to allaytheir anxieties.    Initially, on the advice of the Chief Constable andthe General Officer Commanding (GOC) in the Province, he hadsought to play matters down after Mr Bradford&apos;s death. Subsequently,as a demonstration of firmness and reassurance, he had arranged forall police leave to be cancelled and for military reinforcements to beprovided.    It was necessary not only to strengthen the Army presencein the border areas but also to free police resources to deal with thethreat of disorder and intimidation posed by Dr Paisley&apos;s call for a&quot;day of action&quot; on 23 November involving a general strike that afternoonand protest marches which would culminate in a large rally atNewtownards.    It seemed that the Strike was likely to be wellsupported, and the day would certainly be a difficult and dangerousone, although it was perhaps encouraging that the rally was beingstaged in Newtownards rather than in the middle of Belfast.Contingency plans were being made with a view to ensuring that powerstations could be kept in operation despite the strike.    Dr Paisleywas nuw denying that he intended to make Northern Ireland ungovernableHis future tactics would depend on how matters went on 23 November.The leaders of the Official Unionist Party were in serious disarray.He had himself made clear to them in private that they must stand upmore resolutely against Dr Paisley in defence of their own non-violentprinciples;  and that he would understand if in this process they feltobliged to adopt a tougb stance towards the Government. ButMr Molyneaux, whom he had seen the previous day, had had almostnothing to say.    Mr McCusker, who accompanied him, was clearlyunder great strain and his health was uncertain.    Mr McCartney, whowas also present and had done most of the talking, held no position in5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Party but was seen in some quarters as its future leader;  as aQueen&apos;s Counsel he had been particularly concerned over certainlegal matters, which he might wish to pursue with the AttorneyGeneral.    Although there was no real link between the present crisisin Northern Ireland and the Prime Minister&apos;s recent meeting with theTaoiseach, the confused state of public opinion meant that thatmeeting had inevitably come to be thought of as a contributory factor.No-one, however, had followed Mr Powell in suggesting that the &quot;twomajor traditions in Ireland&quot;, to whose need for reconciliation theSummit communique had referred, were the Unionists and Republicansrather than the Protestants and Catholics.    Meanwhile the Catholiccommunity had remained quiet and even some of its most anti-British members had strongly denounced PIRA violence- Moralein the security forces remained high, and co-operation betweenpolice and Army leaders was excellent.    He had the highest confidencein both the Chief Constable and the GOC.    It was not yet clear whetheradditional military reinforcements would be needed to deal with thepresent crisis, nor whether in the longer term there should be afurther increase in the size of the Royal Ulster Constabulary.In discussion there was strong support for the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland in the very difficult situation he currently faced.Deep sympathy was also expressed both for his own ordeal whenattending Mr Bradford&apos;s funeral and for the Attorney General and hiswife who had fortunately not been injured by the potentially lethal bombattack on their London home.    The police were investigating how thislatter outrage had been possible despite the security precautions whichhad been in force;  but it had to be recognised that total protection wasnot attainable.   The Treasury would investigate whether adequateinsurance or compensation arrangements existed for the victims ofsuch attacks. Ministers needed to be extremely vigilant in the faceof this kind of threat;  if they encountered any problems over theprovision of surveillance by the police or of protective equipment bythe Property Services Agency, they should at once inform the HomeSecretary or the Secretary of State for the Environment as appropriate.In further discussion it was noted that this was not the first such crisisto have erupted in Northern Ireland over the past twelve years.Public emotion and political passion there could die down as suddenlyas they arose.    It was esso- rial not to show weakness in the face ofextremism, as the previous Administration had done at the time of thecollapse of the Sunningdale process in 1974.    But the task of surmount-ing the present crisis might be made more difficult by the criticalattitude being adopted by some of the Government&apos;s own supporters inParliament.    Talk of martial law, in particular, was irrelevant andunhelpful.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office19 November 1981 6CONFIDENTIAL
