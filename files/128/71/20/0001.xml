CONFIDENTIAL aLlAMENTARYIf airs1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following v/eek.nadiannstitutioneviousference:;(81) 39thnclusions,nute 1THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the request of theCanadian Parliament for the passage of United Kingdom legislation topatriate the Canadian Constitution had now been brought to London, andhad been submitted to The Queen.    The present intention was for theCanada Bill to be introduced in the House of Commons in the weekbeginning 21 December, and for Second Reading to take place in theweek beginning 18 January.    He was confident that in its present formthe Bill could be carried, but he thought it essential that there shouldbe adequate time for discussion in both Houses, and that no deadlineshould be set for Royal Assent,,    He had seen the Canadian Ministerof Justice (Mr Chretien) the previous day.    He had impressed on himthe importance of not appearing to put pressure on either House to passthe Bill by, for example, the date of the Royal Visit to Canada whichhad been tentatively proposed for mid~February, and had said that itwould be unwise to plan on the assumption that Royal Assent could beobtained before March or April.    Mr Chretien had appeared to acceptthis.    He would be in a better position to assess the likely timetablefor the passage of the Bill after Second Reading in the Commons.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no timetable should be set for the passage of theCanada BilL    They noted that the Canadians hoped that The Queenwould be able to bring the Constitution Act into force in Canada by apersonal Proclamation during a Royal Visit.The Cabinet -1.Took note.ical Governmentnance Bill&apos;eviousTerence:&apos;(81) 36thdelusions,inute 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that asagreed by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy he and theChief Whip had consulted the Government&apos;s supporters in the House ofCommons about the possibility of substituting a prohibition on thelevying of supplementary rates for the referendum procedure proposedin the current Local Government Finance BilL    Although someConservative Members had reservations about the new proposal, andmight well abstain if legislation on these lines were introduced, it nowseemed that a revised Bill could be carried without serious difficulty.Subject to the views of the business managers, and to anything whichemerged from the meeting of the relevant Conservative BackbenchCommittee that evening, he recommended that the present LocalGovernment Finance Bill should be withdrawn, and a No 2 Bill1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALintroduced the following week, with Second Reading being takenimmediately after the Christmas adjournment.    The ir.treduction ofthe revised Bill might be timed so as to coincide with the publicationof the Green Paper on the rating system;,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that it now seemedpossible that the judgment of the House of Lords in the LondonTransport fares case would not be delivered before Christmas. Thiswould make it impossible for any necessary legislation to restrain thepayment of subsidies by local authorities to passenger transport under-takings to be included in the Local Government Finance (No 2) Bill,even if that had been thought desirable.    If the judgment becameavailable before the end of the Christmas adjournment, it might just bepossible for any necessary legislation to be passed in time for it totake effect in the financial year 1982-83, but he considered it extremelyimportant that the Government should not become involved in anydiscussions about possible legislation until the judgment had beendelivered.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discusoion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Lord President of the Council, at his meetingwith the Lobby that afternoon, should take the line tha.t the process ofconsultation on the question of what interim measures should be takenon local government finance was expected to be concluded early in thefollowing week, and the Government would then decide what action totake.    A final decision on the handling of the proposed LocalGovernment Finance (No 2) Bill would be reached either in corres-pondence or at a meeting of the Ministers directly concerned. TheSecretary of State for the Environment should in the meantime seek asa matter of urgency to resolve with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, theoutstanding points on the provisions of the draft Bill dealing withtemporary borrowing powers.The Cabinet -2. Took note that a final decision on whether theproposed Local Government Finance (No 2) Bill shouldbe substituted for the existing Lo;al Government FinanceBill would be taken in correspondence or at a meetingbetween the Secretary of State for the Environment andether Ministers concerned.3.

THE LORE PRIVY SEAL said that the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary was that day attending the Ministerial meetingof the North Atlantic Council.    It was hoped chat this meeting wouldinclude formal signature of che protocol on Spanish accession to theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), although there was somedanger of this being obstructed by the Greeks, who had been pressingunsuccessfully for what amounted to ai undertaking that NATO woulddefend Greece against a fellow member, Turkey,THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that NATO&apos;s under-lying health was deteriorating.    For the moment, the cohesion ofEuropean members of the Alliance was helped by their unity of outlookon the current arms limitation talks in Geneva; but this was unlikely tolast.    Before the end of 1982 it might well be necessary to devise newways of breathing life into the Alliance, eg at a Summit meeting.Meanwhile serious dislocation was being caueed to the vital NATOInfrastructure Programme by the German Government&apos;s refusal toagree to the latest expenditure tranche.    The programme was notlarge, and only some  60 million was involved in the present dispute;but American ability to reinforce Europe militarily- in a crisis wouldbe endangered if agreement could not be reached.    Essentially thedispute lay between the Germans and the Americans.    Britain had sofar been only marginally involved, but British influence might now needto be brought to bear.viet Unioneviousference::(81) 11thinclusions,inute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Soviet authorities had nowintimated to Miss Alexeyeva, the wife of Dr Andrei Sakharov&apos;s stepson,that she would be granted an exit visa to enable her to join her husbandin the United States,    Because of this, Dr Sakharov had abandoned hishunger strike.

It should be possible, however, to devise a form of wordsin reply which would not leave the Israelis in a position to claim thatmembers of the EC had now abandoned the principles set out in theirVenice Declaration of June 1980 and had instead aligned themselvesCONFIDENTIAL

The diplomaticsituation had been further complicated by the French Foreign Minister,Monsieur Cheysson, who had apparently spoken disparagingly about theVenice Declaration during a recent visit to Israel but was now claimingthat his remarks represented no new departure.    Monsieur Cheyssonhad undertaken to clarify the position in a press conference that evening,following a talk with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary theprevious day0In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that this Frenchgaffe might be exploited to Britain&apos;s advantage both diplomatically andcommercially.    France&apos;s policy seemed to be highly changeable bothon the Sinai force, in which she had insisted in participating afterinitially refusing to do so, and on the Venice Declaration.President Giscard had been one of the Declaration&apos;s main sponsors;President Mitterrand had then criticised it at the first EuropeanCouncil he attended after his election; but his Government had sub-sequently insisted that it be favourably referred to in the agreedstatement by European Governments on participation in the Sinai force.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said the Council of Ministers (ForeignAffairs) had held two parallel sessions on 7 and 8 December.    He hadchaired a meeting which had gi^en the Commission further guidancefor the conduct of negotiations in Geneva on the renewal of the Multi-fibre Arrangement (MFA) and for negotiations with the Community&apos;spreferential suppliers whose current agreements expired at the end ofthe year.    Any agreement in Geneva would be provisional so far asthe Community was concerned, because the Council would have to con-sider whether the resulting overall ceilings on textile imports weresatisfactory,,    At the meeting chaired by the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary a number of issues had been dealt with, butit had not been possible to reach agreement on several of them. Thefinancing of social measures in the steel sector had been referred tothe informal meeting of Ministers of Industry due to take place that day.No agreement had been reached on recommendations for the tele-communications industry nor over negotiations with the African,Caribbean and Pacific countries on sugar.    The present tradearrangements with Cyprus had been extended for six months in theabsence of agreement on any improvement.    The Council had agreedon a list of trade requests to be put to the Japanese Government whichincluded all the items of concern to the United Kingdom,CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the Commission&apos;snegotiations with the Community&apos;s preferential textile suppliers wasimportant, since thay accounted for 20 per cant of imports of textilesinto the United Kingdom.    The Community would find itself in adifficult position in the MFA negotiations.    The United States had amore liberal stance, closer to that of the supplying countries. TheCommunity cculd also be criticised for its inability to negotiate until avery late stage.    Nevertheless the United Kingdom, together withFrance and Italy, had to insist on a tough position.In a brief discussion it was noted that the British textile industry waslikely to criticise the Government&apos;s approach, however tough a line wastaken, because they could not unite on any other basis. Neverthelessit was politically important that the Government was seen to bedefending their interests vigorously,    Portugal hoped that as a resultof her accession to the Community she would be able to increase hertextile exports, but Britain already took half the Portuguese exports tothe Community and could not enter into commitments to take more.teelreviouseference:C(81) 39thonclusions,inute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that, in view of theweather conditions, the informal meeting of Industry Ministers due totake place that day might have to be rescheduled.    This was unfortunate,since it was necessary to settle the arrangements for financing themeasures of social assistance in the steel industry, and to ensure thatthe Commission would rigorously enforce the agreement on the use ofstate aids for steel.    The prospects for Community steel exports tothe United States market would be an important item on the agenda forthe meeting between senior American Ministers and the Commissionon 11 December,    It was clear that the United States Government wasanxious to avoid a trade war with the Community, and CommissionerDavignon, with whom he had discussed the matter, believed that itwould be possible to give assurances about the voluntary restraint onCommunity steel exports which would persuade the American steelcompanies not to press their case for anti-dumping and countervailingduties.    If such duties were imposed there would be serious con-sequences for Community steel producers including the British SteelCorporation. mm unityget&apos;reviousTerence;|C(8l) 39thdelusions,&apos;inute 3THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he had informedthe Prime Minister of the continuing difficulties over the payment ofrefunds to the United Kingdom in respect cf net contributions to theCommunity budget for 1980 and 1981.    The French and Germans werecontinuing to argue that the United Kingdom had been overpaid under theagreement reached on 30 May 1980, and there were several proceduralstages at which they could make difficulties.

He intended to raise this questionwith the Ministers who would be attending the Council of Ministers(ECOFIN) on 14 December.    Since this meeting was on the same day asthe Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting to follow up the outstanding issues fromthe European Council, he would do so informally.    He believed thatour interpretation of the 30 May Agreement was legally correct butcontinuing difficulties had to be foreseen.(Decembereeting ofImmunitynister ssponsible forblic SecurityTHE HOME SECRETARY reported that, in spite of some practicalcontretemps, a successful meeting of Ministers responsible for publicsecurity had been held on 8 December.The Cabinet -Took note.DEX-LINKEDINSIONS;)LLOW-UP TOffi SCOTTi EPORT4, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(81) 58) and a minute dated 8 December 1901 from theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to the Prime Minister onpossible changes in public sector pension schemesThe Cabinet&apos;s discussion and conclusions are recorded separately.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALAOPEANJR.T OF|{AN RIGHTS:^IPENSATION(CLOSEDP VICTIMS5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Employment (C(81) 59) on compensation for closed shop victims.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theEuropean Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg had found that the dis-missal of three railmen in 1976 without compensation in a closed shopunder the previous Government&apos;s legislation, since repealed by theEmployment Act 1980, was in breach of the European Convention onHuma:. Rights.    The Government was endeavouring to reach a friendlysettlement on compensation for the three railmen and also for sixformer employees of Hull City Corporation dismissed in similarcircumstances, whose case was before the European Commission ofHuman Rights.    There remained the question of whether the Governmentshould compensate other closed shop victims in the 1974-80 period and,if so, how to avoid setting undesirable precedents for compensation inother human rights cases.    The risk of setting a precedent could belessened by making it clear that the Government had been consideringcompensation in such cases on their merits but had not been able to takeaction until the proceedings before the European Court had been com-pleted.    He therefore proposed that powers should be taken in hisforthcoming Bill on industrial relations to set up a compensation schemeon the lines indicated in Annex A of C(81) 59.    The cost could beaccommodated within the existing financial provisions for hisDepartment for 1982-83 and 1983-84.In discussion it was generally agreed that there was a strong case forcompensating those who were victims of the closed shop by virtue oflegislation passed between 1974 and 1979.    There was concern about theimplications of this for a large number of other cases which had beenbrought before the Commission and Court in Strasbourg, for examplethose concerned with homosexuality in Northern Ireland, airport noise,leasehold reform, and the immigration rules.    In many of these casesit could be shown that the circumstances were not comparable withthose in the closed shop cases.    Nevertheless the Government shouldavoid appearing to support the general proposition that, whenever theEuropean Court ruled in favour of a complaint, the Government snouldbe under an obligation to legislate to provide financial compensation toall those in similar circumstances.    It was also undesirable to place toomuch weight on the argument that the closed shop victims had sufferedunder earlier legislation, simply on the grounds that this was legislaticnwhich the present Government had opposed and repealed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatlegislation should be introduced to provide compensation for those whowere victims of the closed shop by virtue of legislation passed between1974 and 1979.    Care should however be taken to draft the legislation soas to avoid any reference to the recent judgment of the European Court.Similarly, in justifying the scheme, it was necessary to avoid anyCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALimplication that the Government was generally in favour of financialcompensation by the Government for people either because they hadgrievances comparable with those found to constitute a breach of theEuropean Convention on Human Rights, or because they had dufferedunder legislation which the Government had repealed.    The justificationshould rest on the moral case for compensating the closed shop victimsconcerned, although it could be explained that the Government had notbeen able to proceed with a compensation scheme until the proceedingsbefore the European Court had been concluded.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that legislation to provide compensationfor closed shop victims in 1974-80, as proposed bythe Secretary of State for Employment in C(81) 59,should be included in the forthcoming Bill onindustrial relations.2. . Invited the Secretary of State for Employment,in consultation with the Attorney General and the LordAdvocate, to be guided both in the preparation of thelegislation and in its presentation by the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.Cabinet Office10 December 19818CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETpEX-LINKEDNSIONS:1LLOW-UP TOE SCOTTPORTUS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO38CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(81t) 40th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday, 10 December 1981 at 9. 30 am.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(81) 58) and a minute of 8 December from theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to the Prime Minister onpossible changes in public sector pension schemes.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, followingdiscussion by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, aninterdepartmental group of officials had examined the options forchanges in the arrangements for contributions and benefits is. publicsector index-linked pension schemes, with a view to meeting thecriticisms of inflation proofing for pensions in the public sector;their report was annexed to his memorandum.    In his view, thesystem of contributions should be amended so that it could be publiclydefended as being demonstrably linked to the cost of pensionsincreases and so that it was applicable on broadly similar lines to allthe public services.    He recommended that this could best beachieved by leaving the existing levels of contribution for basicbenefits unchanged and levying a special charge of about 2j per cent,which would be based on the extent to which the cost of public servicepensions increases was in excess of the private sector average(option B in the report by officials).    On current estimates thiswould mean that most public servants would pay a total pensioncontribution of 8j per cent.    The uniformed services - the ArmedForces, the police, the fire services and prison officers - enjoyedbetter basic pension benefits, and their position would need to beconsidered further.    A change in the system of contributions onthese lines could produce public expenditure savings in the range of 300 million to  600 million a year, depending on what was assumedabout the effect of the change on pay negotiations;  in his view theGovernment&apos;s stance should be that there should be no offset to thenew charge through higher pay.    Because of the widespread publicmisunderstanding of the pensions of civil servants, there was a casefor making the Civil Service scheme formally contributory; butfurther consideration would need to be given to the implications ofthe higher pensions which would result from higher gross salaries.He did not recommend attempting to legislate to impose new arrange-ments for contributions by nationalised industry employees; theSECRET
SECRETGovernment could, however, invite the nationalised industries t take account of any changes in the arrangements for contributionsin public service schemes.    While changes in the arrangementsfor contributions would be welcomed, they would not be seen asdealing with the deep-seat3d resentment at the disparity between theguarantee of index-linking in public sector pension schemes and itsvirtual absence in private sector schemes.    He thsrefore invitedthe Cabinet to consider the case for allowing for full inflationproofing of benefits up to 7 per cent with a discretionary power tom .ke any further increases.     For such a provision to have anysignificant effect on public expenditure, it would have to be appliedto benefits for past as well as for future service.    He recognisedthat in statements made before the 1979 Election, members of theGovernment had indicated the possibility of changes in contributions,but not in benefits, and also that the report in February 1981 of theinquiry, chaired by Sir Bernard Scott, into the value of pensionsdid not point to changes in benefits.    There was, nevertheless, apolitical case for looking at this question afresh.    If action were tobe taken on benefits ixi the pension schemes of the public services, itwould be for consideration whether to restrict tax relief by withdraw- :ing Inland Revenue approval from nationalised industry and privatesector schemes which permitted pension increases to exceed whatwas provided by public service schemes.    He proposed that, in thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on contributions and benefits, aconsultative document should be published early in 1982 with a viewto legislation as soon as practicable.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that sheagreed that the system of contributions should be revised to ensurethat public servants paid in contributions for the benefit of index-linked pensions.    It was, however, essential to make the necessaiychanges to all the public service groups in a consistent way and notto discriminate against civil servants.    Male civil servants alreadypaid effectively about 8-| per cent as contribution to their pension;the new arrangements for contributions and for pay should recognisethat.    Further work was necessary on the details of the new schemeand on how it should apply to the various groups.    She was opposedto the proposed changes in benefits which, if implemented, would bedeeply resented by about 10 million present and future beneficiariesof public sector pension schemes.    There would be great objectionsto limiting benefits for past service, and it would be very difficultto secure approval of the necessary legislative changes at this stagein the life of the present Parliament.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that there was no legal rightrecognised in the United Kingdom courts which need restrain theGovernment from proposing legislation to limit index-linking ofbenefits for civil servants.    Special consideration should, however,be given to the moral claim of those civil servants who had purchasedadded years at a price which included an element for index-linking ofbenefits and those who had transferred previous pension entitlements2SECRET
SECRETinto the scheme on a basis which reflected index-linking. Ifbenefits were to be limited, he judged that the Government cov.idprobably successfully rebut any case brought against it under theEuropean Convention on Human Rights;  but he could not guaranteesuccess, particularly in the case of those people who had purchasedadded years or transferred previous entitlements.    He had notconsidered the position of public sector employees other than civilservants, but he was aware that some of the nationalised industrypension schemes conferred a legal right to benefit which could not betaV.en away without adequate compensation.In discussion the following were the main points made:a. It was generally agreed that, for the reasons putforward by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andby the Attorney General, there should be no action to limitbenefits in public sector pension schemes.    Any such changewould no doubt be welcomed by the private sector when it wasannounced, but would provoke bitter and lasting resentmentamong the existing and potential beneficiaries of public sectorschemes.    As inflation came down, objections to index-linkingin public sector schemes would diminish.    If, contrary tothe Government&apos;s objectives, inflation were to risesubstantially it might be necessary to look at the questionagain.b. There was general support in principle for action oncontributions on the lines of Option B.    No consultativedocument could be issued, however, until the implicationsfor each of the services, and for each of the uniformedservices in particular, had been fully considered. Anyattempt to propose changes in general terms would run intoserious difficulties if there was uncertainty over what wasintended for particular groups.    It should be recognised that,if contributions were to be amended to take account of indexedbenefits, there could then be legal objections to any attemptin the future to limit benefits without adequate compensation.c. Further thought should be given to the timing of anyconsultation on contributions in relation to negotiations onpublic sector pay claims in 1982.    It was questionablewhether the proposed changes would really bring savings ofthe order of  300 million to  600 million.    In practice itcould be difficult tc secure an outcome whereby the contribu-tions were not offset by pay increases.    For example, inaddition to the Civil Service, some National Health Servicegroups would claim that their pay already took account ofcontributions related to index-linked pensions.3SECRET
SECRETd.       There was pressure in Parliament for a debate onthe Scott report on public sector pensions*   this mightmost suitably take place in late February or early March 1982.It would give an opportunity to explain the complexity of thesubject and to bring home the fact that, contrary to popularopinion, civil servants already made a substantial contributionto their pensions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no steps should be taken to limit benefits in publicsector pension schemes;  the objections to such benefits woulddiminish as the rate of inflation was reduced.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should arrange for further work by officials on theimplications of increases in contributions to reflect index-linkedbenefits.    This further work should look at each of the public servicegroups and in particular at those, such as the uniformed services,where it was not yet clear how the proposed arrangements mightapply.    In the light of this further report, the Cabinet would decideon the line to be taken in the proposed Parliamentary Debate on theScott report, and on whether and when there should be a consultativedocument on the possibility of changes in the arrangements forcontributions in public service pension schemes.    There was noprospect of legislation to implement such changes in the presentSession and it could well be impracticable to implement them in thelife of the present Parliament.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that there should be no change in the benefitsconferred by public sector pension schemes.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer:-i.        to arrange for a further report by officialsof the Departments concerned dealing fully withthe implications for each public service group ofchanges in the present system of contributions;andii.       to report progress in February 1982.3.
