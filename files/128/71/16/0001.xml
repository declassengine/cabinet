CONFIDENTIALIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thejg  House of Commons during the following week.rnmenteTHE CHIEF WHIP said that, although the Secretary of State for theEnvironment had earlier in the week explained the Government&apos;s positionon the Local Government Finance Bill in great detail to meetings ofConservative Members of Parliament, a considerable number of theGovernment&apos;s supporters remained firmly opposed, in particular to thereferendum proposals in the Bill.    The latest available information wasthat 38 Government backbenchers intended to vote against the Bill onSecond Reading, and 16 to abstain, with a further 34 expressing seriousreservations about the proposals.    It would thus be impossible to securea majority for the Bill at Second Reading.    There would be a debate inthe House of Commons that afternoon on an Opposition motion onencroachments on local government autonomy.    The Whips had pointedout that the motion in effect opposed any attempt to control overspendingby local authorities, but it was still possible that up to 19 Governmentsupporters would abstain from voting against it.    There was, however,complete support on the Government side for the Government amendmentcalling for the continuation of efforts to restrain the activities of over-spending authorities and to protect ratepayers.    The erosion of theGovernment&apos;s majority would be considerably diminished if it wereannounced at the beginning of the debate that the Bill would be withdrawnfor further consideration, and as a matter of Parliamentary tactics thatwas the course he would recommend to the Cabinet.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatopposition to the Bill among Government supporters centred on thereferendum proposal, which was seen as a dangerous precedent whichcould be abused by future Administrations.    Although the referendumprocedure had never been his own preferred option, there was at presentno clearly worked out alternative.    To withdraw either the referendumproposal or the whole Bill at this stage would leave a vacuum, whichwould cast doubt on the Government&apos;s determination to control over-spending, and would be seen as a surrender to Opposition pressure. Hetherefore recommended that he should in the course of that afternoon&apos;sdebate attempt to keep the position as open as possible.    He recognised,and was prepared to acknowledge, that it would not be possible toproceed with the referendum proposals if the House of Commons was notprepared to accept them;  but he would not wish to preclude thepossibility that at least some opponents of the referendum proceduremight be brought to accept it, once they had appreciated the fullimplications of other methods of achieving the Government&apos;s objectives.He would make it clear that the Government were prepared to engage infurther wide consultations on the possible alternatives with a view toamending the Bill during its passage if a more generally acceptablesolution could be found.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion some Ministers said that the Government should acknow-ledge straightaway that there was no possibility of passing the Bill in itsexisting form, rhould announce that afternoon that they intended to with-draw the Bill, without waiting to be forced to do so by an alliancebetween the Opposition and a large number of their own supporters, andshould indicate that they would bring forward a revised Bill after furtherconsultation.Other Ministers argued that withdrawal of the Bill that day would bewidely seen as a humiliating defeat for the Government.    The presentlevel of rates imposed an intolerable burden on industry in certain areas,and those concerned would not readily forgive the Government if theygave in to pressure from the local authority interests.    A campaign bythe Confederation of British Industry and other employers&apos; organisationscould usefully be exploited to strengthen support for the Bill on theGovernment side, but it would be unfortunate if this were to be stimulatedby the withdrawal of the present proposals.    Abandoning the referendumproposal without bringing forward anything to put in its place would createdoubt and confusion, and encourage resistance to the Bill as a whole tobuild up.    The Government amendment to the Opposition motiondemanded further action to curb the activities of overspendingauthorities, and did not leave open the option of doing nothing.    If thereferendum proposal were not pursued, it was important that a defensiblesubstitute should be brought forward as quickly as possible.THE  PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should not withdraw the LocalGovernment Finance Bill that afternoon, nor give any firm commitmentto withdraw the referendum provisions, unless it proved to be necessaryto do so in order to avoid a defeat on the Opposition motion. TheSecretary of State for the Environment should, however, give an under-taking that the Government would not proceed with the Bill until furtherconsultations had been carried out on possible alternative methods ofcontrolling local authority expenditure, and should make it clear that theGovernment would not attempt to force through the referendum proposalsagainst the will of the House.    He should consult the Chief Whip on thetext of his speech, and the Chief Whip should do everything practicable toensure that the Government opponents of the Bill voted against theOpposition motion in return for an assurance that the Government wouldadopt a flexible attitude towards the issues in dispute.    The situationmight develop during the day, and she would keep in touch with theSecretary of State for the Environment and the Chief Whip on any last-minute change of tactics which might be necessary.    In the meantime,the Cabinet noted that the Secretary of State for the Environment wouldbring proposals on the control of overspending by Order as an alternativeto the referendum procedure before the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy the following week.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet -1.     Agreed that the debate on the Opposition motion onencroachments on local government autonomy shouldbe handled in the way indicated in the Prime Minister&apos;ssumming up of their discussion.litioneServiceartmentTHE PRIME MINISTER said that she would make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon announcing the abolition of the CivilService Department, with the transfer of its manpower and resourcecontrol and its pay functions to the Treasury, and its other responsibili-ties to a Management and Personnel Office working alongside theCabinet Office.    This change would facilitate an integrated approach topublic expenditure and manpower planning, and would enable thepromotion of efficiency in central Government to be linked more closelywith the policy making process.    The present Permanent Secretary andSecond Permanent Secretary at the Civil Service Department wouldretire that week, and the Secretary of the Cabinet and the PermanentSecretary of the Treasury would become Joint Heads of the Home CivilService.    The Secretary of the Cabinet would be the Secretary of the newManagement and Personnel Office, which would be responsible to her asMinister for the Civil Service and under the day-to-day charge of theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster.    The Minister of State, CivilService Department, would become a Minister of State, Treasury, andwould assume responsibility for manpower and pay questions within theTreasury, reporting to the Chief Secretary, Treasury, on manpowerand to the Chancellor of the Exchequer on pay.    The efficiency unitwould be in the new office, but its head would continue to have the rightof direct access to her.    To obtain maximum benefits from the changeit would be necessary to locate the staff concerned as near as possible tothe staff with whom they would be working closely;  this could involvemoves affecting other Departments, and she hoped that the Ministersconcerned would be willing to accept the need for such moves.    She hadtold the Chairman of the Select Committee on the Treasury and the CivilService in confidence of the proposed changes the previous evening, andhad made it clear that the Government looked forward to the expectedreport by the Treasury and Civil Service Committee on efficiency andeffectiveness in central Government.    The Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster was making arrangements to explain the reasons for the changeto the staff of the Civil Service Department, and she would herself beready to see the Rational Staff Side.    Members of the existing staff of theCivil Service Department would have a year in which to expresspreferences as between transfer to the Treasury or to the Cabinet Office.She had been concerned by the reports which she had received of agrowing disillusionment among many civil servants, and she hoped thatall Ministers would take an active part in seeking to strengthen morale intheir own Departments in the light of the changes which she had announceCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe Cabinet2.    Tock note.TANKERyERStingencysures2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said thatdevelopments which had taken place since the circulation of his paperC(81) 56 now meant that, though there might be some sporadic andunofficial strike action as early as 16 November, there would no longerbe an immediate need for the declaration of a State of Emergency or theimplementation of the military contingency plan.    In the light of theconfusion surrounding the outcome of the first ballot by driversemployed by British Petroleum (BP) and the inept tactic^ adopted by theacting General Secretary of the Transport and General Workers Union,Mr Kitson, shop stewards representing Shell&apos;s drivers had decided understrong pressure from their rank and file that time would be needed toorganise a proper vote on the companies&apos; 8.1 per cent pay offer. Theresults of this would not be known until 18 November.     Even if the voterejected the offer, as the union was recommending, the shop stewards&apos;next move would be to resume negotiations with the management, andperhaps also to approach the Advisory, Conciliation and ArbitrationService, before any strike was called.    Esso shop stewards wereexpected to take a similar decision later that day.    The result of thesecond BP ballot would be known on 14 November and was not expected tofavour strike action although the possibility could not be excluded. Inthese circumstances the Home Secretary and he had decided, inconsultation with the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for theArmed Forces, that Service instructors involved in the militarycontingency plan need not, as intended, begin their training that day.The position would be reviewed by officials of the Civil ContingenciesUnit the following day.The CabinetTock note.EIGNAIRSb/Israelviouserence-&quot;I) 35thfusions,3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatduring his recent visit to Saudi Arabia the Saudi Government had for thefirst time made clear in public that they contemplated a negotiatedsolution to the Arab/Israel conflict.    This lead had since been followedby other Governments in the Gulf.    The Saudis had also made publiclyclear for the first time that Israel was included in the seventh of theeight principles they had put forward as the basis for a settlement, whichreferred to the right of the states in the area to live in peace. Thesesigns of movement among the moderate Arabs were encouraging.    It wasdifficult to understand suggestions that the United States Government hadCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnot  welcomed the positive attitude he had taken towards the Saudis&apos;eight principles, given that President Reagan had taken a similarattitude himseli.    But the Americans were no doubt very conscious ofthe sense of insecurity currently being felt in Israel, following the deathof President Sadat of Egypt, the sale of United States early warningaircraft to Saudi Arabia and American support for the eight principles.Meanwhile it seemed likely that a reasonable basis could be found forsettling the difficulties which had arisen over establishing a multi-national force for Sinai, with the participation of four members of theEuropean Community including Britain;  but working out an agreedstatement on the subject among all ten members of the Community wasinevitably a time-consuming process.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that during a recent visitto Egypt the Secretary of State for Trade had found President Mubarakunworried about the arrangements for the proposed Sinai force andready tc contemplate a rapprochement with other Arab Governments oncethe Israelis&apos; withdrawal from Sinai was complete.    Such a rapproche-ment would encourage Arab investment in Egypt and thereby economicdevelopment.    But the prospect no doubt also contributed to Israel&apos;spresent apprehensiveness.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Libya wasnow withdrawing her forces from Chad.    This was welcome but would0us leave a dangerous vacuum and the threat of renewed civil war. Theence; Organisation of African Unity were preparing a peace-keeping force) 8th but were not showing great speed or efficiency.     The Nigerians hadusions, tentatively inquired earlier in the year whether Britain could providee2 some logistic support for such a force and had been told that any requestwould be sympathetically considered.    It now seemed likely that Britain,along with other European states, would need to make a smallcontribution in this way.    If so, he would discuss the financial andpractical  implications with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for Defence.r THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that later that day,under arrangements made some time ago, a British nuclear test would becarried out in Nevada.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL elandI,eViou s.ference:1(81) 34thjnclusions ]jute 2THE PRIME MINISTER said that members of the Cabinet would beaware of the communique issued after her meeting on 6 November withthe Prime Minister of the Republic of Ireland, Dr Garret FitzGerald,and of her statement in Parliament on 10 November. AlthoughDr FitzGerald would no doubt have preferred her to have been somewhatmore forthcoming, she and the Secretary of State for Northern Irelandhad not considered that justifiable.    Some criticism in Northern Irelandhad been inevitable, but it was an important interest of the UnitedKingdom that close co-operation with the Republic should continue, and ithad been made quite clear that the meeting had in no way weakened theBritish guarantee of Northern Ireland&apos;s constitutional position, whichremained enshrined in lav/.    No special stir had been caused by thepublication on 12 November of the Anglo-Irish joint studies which she andDr FitzGerald&apos;s predecessor had commissioned at their meeting inDecember 1980.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that riskshad inevitably been involved in the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting withDr FitzGerald, but they had clearly been justified by the outcome. Theeffect on opinion in Northern Ireland had been salutary.    The prospectsfor keeping the Catholic minority in play had been enhanced. Moderateelements among the Protestant majority had been encouraged torecognise that the intransigence of the past was no longer a possiblebasis for policy.    It was probable that more extreme Protestantleaders, such as Dr Paisley, regarded violence as preferable tocompromise, but there was at present no sign of widespread support forthis view among the Protestant working class.The Cabinet -Took note.immunity&apos;fairs4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that discussions on the Mandate forrestructuring the Community budget were proceeding extremely slowly.Progress had to be made at the same time on reforming the CommonAgricultural Policy (CAP), developing other Community policies andfinding a way to deal with the budgetary problem.    In spite of Britishefforts in the Presidency, other member states were reluctant to makeany move.    The German Government complained about its ownbudgetary position, but seemed reluctant to join with the BritishGovernment in putting forward possible solutions.    The lack of progresswould not make the handling and presentation of the forthcoming meetingof the European Council in London on 26-27 November easy.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn a brief discussion it was suggested that holding the Presidency was aconsiderable handicap in defending British interests.    It was importantto continue to press upon Community partners the n^ed. for a good resultat the European Council.    It had to be accepted, however, that theFrench Government might well not make any move until they werefurther convinced that the United Kingdom and the Federal Republic ofGermany were unwilling to continue as the sole net contributors to theCommunity budget or until they felt that the British Government mightonce again block agreement on agricultural prices until a budgetarysolution had been found.    There were signs that the French andGermans were in collusion with the Commission over way   of modifyingthe CAP.    The terms of the settlement reached on 30 May 1980 weresuch that the net British contribution to the Community budget for 1981would not be  400 million as had been expected but only about 55 million.     This unexpected outcome was not helpful to the Britishnegotiating position.    Given the current need for restraint in publicexpenditure it would be necessary to maintain a firm position innegotiating a satisfactory level of contribution to the Community budget.The Cabinet -Took note.jIPPORTIRANT&quot;pTLEMENT|82-83reviouseference:C(81) 32ndinclusions,linute 45. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C(81) 54) on the Rate Support Grant (RSG) settlement for 1982-83 and anote by the Secretary of State for the Environment (C(81) 55) coveringtables illustrating the possible effects on individual local authoritiesof different assumptions on public expenditure and RSG percentages.THE HOME SECRETARY said that to enable his Ministerial Group(MISC 21) to make firm recommendations on the RSG settlement for1982-83 he had to ask the Cabinet to give guidance on three mainquestions:  the total of local authority current expenditure in 1982-83;current and capital housing expenditure (including a figure for localauthority rent increases);  and the RSG percentage.On 24 September th  Cabinet had accepted that realism pointed to avolume reduction in local authority current expenditure from 1981-82 to1982-83 of 3 rather than 7 per cent, as had been previously assumed.No firm decision was taker, on this, DUt the Chief Secretary, Treasury,in his memorandum on public expenditure (C(81) 51), had assumed thatthe cash total for local authority current expenditure in England wouldbe increased to  17,800 million, in line with a 3 per cent volume cut;in addition he had allowed for the possibility of a further overspend of 500 million for Great Britain as a whole though not with the intentionof revealing this figure to the local authorities.    In the light of furtherCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALevidence on the outturn of local authority expenditure, and of an assess-ment of the authorities&apos; reaction to the cash limit practice proposed  ythe Government, the Secretary of State for the Environment had nowadvised that  17,800 million would prove inadequate;  he recommendedthat  350 million should be switched from the reserve to give an Englishtotal of  18,150 million.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentjudged that such a total would enable him to set tough but realistictargets for individual authorities, backed by severe penalties, in termsof holdback of grant, for overspending.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury,feared that in practice this transfer would lead to a net increase inpublic expenditure because the pressure on the local authorities to con-trol their budgets would have been relaxed.    Essentially the question forCabinet was which was the more realistic approach and the more likelyto deter local authorities from overspending and rating high.The second question on which MISC 21 sought guidance was on the totalprovision for housing expenditure and on the assumptions within thattotal for increases in council house rents and for housing capital andmaintenance.    The last Public Expenditure White Paper provided fortotal housing expenditure in 1982-83 of  3,869 million; no distributionof this total between subsidies and capital investment had been publishedor agreed.    If this total were to stand, and if the 1981-82 volume ofhousing capital and maintenance expenditure were to be maintained,council house rents would have to go up by about  4 a week on top of thepresent average council house rent in England of about  11. 50. TheChief Secretary, Treasury, had proposed savings of  93 million on thistotal, and had suggested that these might be achieved by a combinationof rent increases of  4. 30 a week and a 2 per cent reduction in capitalexpenditure.     The Secretary of State for the Environment wished thetotal to be increased by  442 million in order to maintain the volume ofcapital expenditure at the 198l_82 level, to hold rent increases down toabout  1. 50 and to allow for additional provision of  67 million formanagement and maintenance.    There was, therefore, a gap betweenthese two proposals of  535 million.     Unless public expenditure in totalwere to be increased, the Cabinet had to choose between current andcapital expenditure:  for every lOp that rents were held down below  4,capital expenditure would need to be cut by  15 million.Thirdly, MISC 21 sought guidance on what should be the RSG percentage.This decision required a judgment on the likely effects on spending andon rating.    The Secretary of State for the Environment had circulatedestimates of the effects of 56, 54 and 50 per cent grants applied to thetwo main expenditure assumptions under discussion.    While theseexemplifications were helpful it should be understood that theyrepresented, at best, informed guesses as to how local authorities mightbehave.8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn the light of the Cabinet&apos;s guidance on these three questions MISC 21could sort out the remaining details of the RSG settlement and theimplications for Scotland and for Wales.    It was essential to reachdecisions on the settlement quickly if it were to be announced beforeChristmas and in order to take account of the outcome in the debates onthe Local Government Finance Bill &amp;nd in the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on the1981 Public Expenditure Survey.In discussion the following main points were made -a. Central Government could seek to influence the total of localauthority current expenditure but could not control it, Thefurther information which had emerged since Cabinet&apos;s dis-cussion on 24 September pointed to some increase in theannounced provision if the local authorities were to regard thetargets set them as realistic.    The Secretary of State forEducation and Science had agreed, since MISC 21&apos;s discussions,to forgo  100 million of the education services&apos; share of theproposed increase;   some Ministers doubted whether the localeducation authorities would take notice of this in their budgeting.This reduced the proposed total to be switched from the reserveto  2 50 million and it was agreed that this might be reduced by afurther  50 million shared among the services other thaneducation.    Corresponding increases would be made in theScottish and Welsh programmes.b. If council house rents were to be increased by as much as 4, that would add 1 per cent to the Retail Price Index, would behighly unpopular among council house tenants, and could have anadverse effect on wage settlements in 1982.    In some authoritiesthe increases would be much higher than average; theGovernment would be criticised for those increases, and given nocredit for those below average.    Many tenants would be eligiblefor rent rebates but some people, particularly pensioners, wouldresent being pushed into a position of having to claim rebate.On the other hand housing costs, as a proportion of earnings, forpeople buying their houses were higher than those for localauthority tenants, even allowing for a  4 a week increase. Theaverage rent in 1981-82 had increased by  3.29 a week. Onbalance, the arguments pointed to an increase in 1982-83 of under 3.c. Even increases of  1. 50 in council rents would lead tosurpluses on the housing revenue accounts of many authorities,and there was already strong criticism of this possibility which,under present arrangements, appeared to lead to a situation inwhich council house tenants subsidised ratepayers in theprovision of local services.    The Secretary of State for the9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALEnvironment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, were incorrespondence on how this problem might be solved at leastcost to public expenditure.    It was important that this should besettled quickly.d. Since the present provision for expenditure on housingcombined, in a single line, subsidies and capital expenditure, itfollowed that to the extent that council rents were held down, andsubsidies were increased, capital expenditure had to be cutunless total public expenditure were to be increased. Thedifficulty of this course was that the Government had alreadysubstantially reduced housing capital investment since 1979-80and further cuts would be at the expense of employment byprivate sector construction firms.    Decisions or. the totalprovision for housing capital, though linked with those on councilhouse rents, ought to be taken in the context of decisions onpublic expenditure programmes generally.e. It was suggested that the Department of the Environment&apos;sestimates, attached to C(81) 55, of possible rate increases in1982-83 were too high.    Some of the assumptions allowed forvery wide margins for overspending;  insufficient account wastaken of the effect on expenditure of lowering the grant percen-tage, of the possible effects of grant penalties, and of thedeterrent of the provision for referenda under the LocalGovernment Finance Bill.    The rate increases quoted were onan April 1981 base and would be 6-7 per cent less if the basisincluded supplementary rate increases during 1981-82.     On theother hand, while the estimates were obviously open to question,the Department of the Environment had a good record inestimating rate increases.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had agreed on a number of provisional assumptions which wouldbe the basis for further work on the RSG settlement for 1982-83. Thetotal of local authority current expenditure in England should beincreased for realism from  17, 800 million to  18, 000 million; the 200 million increase represented the  350 million proposed by theSecretary of State for the Environment, less  100 million specificallyattributable to the education services, less a further  50 million to befound from other local authority services.     Corresponding increaseswould be made in the Scottish and Welsh programmes.    The Cabinetagreed on balance that the arguments on council house rents pointed toan average increase of  2. 50 a week;  they noted that the Secretary ofState for the Environment might also wish to make proposals for aminimum level of increase.    The Cabinet recognised that there was adifficult problem over the treatment of surpluses on housing revenueaccounts and that if this were not resolved satisfactorily it could lead to10CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALserious criticism of the Government.    The Secretary of State for theEnvironment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should discuss thisfurther with a view to reaching agreement as quickl-r as possible.    If thetotal provision for expenditure on housing were not to be increased, rentincreases averaging  2. 50 would require offsetting savings of about 22 5 million on housing capital expenditure.    The Cabinet would need toconsider this further in the context of their discussion of publicexpenditure programmes as a whole.     Until they had seen exemplifica-tion of these assumptions the Cabinet could not decide on the appropriateRSG percentage, but they agreed that the options to be examined shouldbe 54 per cent, 56 per cent, and 57 per cent.The Cabinet -1.     Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment -i. To prepare further exemplifications of theeffects on the English local authorities ofprovisional assumptions of total local authoritycurrent expenditure, other than housing, of 18, 000 million, of increases averaging  2. 50 aweek on council house rents, and of Rate SupportGrant percentages of 54, 56 and 57;  and toreport the results to Cabinet urgently, and if atall possible for their meeting the following week.ii. To consider urgently with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, the treatment of surpluses on housingrevenue accounts.2.    Agreed that the public expenditure provision forhousing capital and maintenance expenditure should beconsidered further in the light of their final decisionon council house rents and in the context of theirfurther discussions of the 1981 Public ExpenditureSurvey.Cabinet Office13 November 198111CONFIDENTIAL
