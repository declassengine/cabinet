CONFIDENTIAL&apos;ARLIAMENTAR Y1FFAIRSFOREIGNAFFAIRSFranceFrevious|teference:CC(81) 20thConclusions,Minute 21  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYsaid that on 28 May, he had had an informal discussion with thenew French Foreign Minister   Monsieur Chevsson, who waswell disposed towards Britain, had made two points of interest.First, the very  close relations between France and Germanywere not seen as exclusive by the new French Government, whowanted a privileged relationship with Britain also. Second,there would be broad continuity in French foreign policy,particularly as regards solidarity with the Western Allianceand resistance to the Soviet Union.    Indeed, since PresidentMitterrand&apos;s Government were less open to being outflanked byleft-wing opinion than their predecessors they might well besomewhat firmer on East-West issues.    On the Middle EastMonsieur Cheysson had reaffirmed support for the VeniceDeclaration and discounted reports chat Prance would adopt apro-Israeli stance because of the close personal links betweenPresident Mitterrand and some Israeli leaders.    On Africa,on the other hand, Monsieur Cheysson had indicated that Frenchpolicy would be modified;  that there would be less sympathy forSouth Africa;  and that France would not in future be willing tojoin in vetoing United Nations resolutions on South Africansanctions.    In the last few days, moreover, there had beenreports that France might withdraw from the Western ContactGroup on Namibia;   this would be unwelcome, but its likelihoodcould not yet be assessed.    All told, he had found his talk withMnnsieur Cheysson reasonably encouraging.    France would ofcourse continue to puraue her national interests.    But it mightwell prove easier for Britain to establish a good working relation-ship with the new French Government than with their predecessorsHe would be consulting the Prime Minister further on the subject.Meanwhile it would clearly be preferable not to prejudice thepossibilities by allowing major Anglo-French disagreements tobreak out at this early stage of the new relationship.Belize THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECR.ETARY said thatthe current negotiations between Britain and Guatemala, at which&apos;revious Belize was represented, were likely to be completed later in thereference: month.    There was a better than even chance that the outcomepC(81) 15th would be a satisfactory Treaty which would implement the Headsconclusions, of Agreement reached in March and thud terminate Guatemala&apos;s^linute 2 claim to Belize.    Unfortunately, the F remier of Belize,Mr Price, had committed himself to holding a referendum thereon the acceptability of the Treaty.    There was a clear dangerCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthat the Belizeans would not cast their votes on the merits ofthe Treaty buc on the basis of their attitude to Mr Frice. Inthese circumstances tome difficult decisions for the BritishGovernment might lie ahead.    Thought was being given to howthe question put to referendum might best be formulated; andto how pressure might be brought to bear on Belizean publicopinion.olandpreviousReference:]C(81) 15thConclusions,iinute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe situation in Poland appeared to be deteriorating.    But itwas impossible to judge the likelihood of the Russians interveningeFrom their point of view the arguments against doing so were ifanything stronger than in the past.    But in certain circumstancesthey might feel they had no choice.    On balance they seemedlikely at least to await the outcome of the elections for thePolish Communist Party Congress in July.panadaPreviousReference:CC(81) 20thConclusions,Minute 1THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Canadian Supreme Court had not yet pronounced on theCanadian Government&apos;s proposals for patriating the CanadianConstitution.    The judgment could come at any time but mightbe delayed until the autumn.The Cabinet -Took note.IMMUNITYAFFAIRS3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES ANDFOOD said he had met the new French Minister of Agriculture,Madame Edith C res son, at a receipt informal meeting ofCommunity Ministers of Agriculture.    She held radical left-wing views and saw the need to change the Common AgriculturePolicy (CAP) so that it would be much more a vehicle for theredistribution of wealth than a policy for agriculture. Itseemed likely that, in defence of the small French farmers whohad voted for him, President Mitterrand would resist changes:in the CAP of the kind favoured  by the Federal GermanGovernment.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn discussion, the following points were made:-a. The new French Minister for the Sea hadindicated his willingness to have an early meetingof the Council of Ministers (Fisheries).    It seemedlikely that he would have used such an occasion tolay down a tough French position on the CommonFioLieries Policy (CFP) in advance of the forthcominglegislative elections.    On the other hand bothPresident Mitterrand and Monsieur Cheysson hadgiven indications that they were anxious for an earlysettlement, and the latter had suggested preparatorybilateral talks.    The Dutch Presidenc/ had wiselydecided that there had been insufficient preparationfor a meeting of the Fisheries Council in June.Instead they planned to hold an informal meeting afterthe elections.b. Monsieur Cheysson had put his Communitycolleagues on notice that the French would wish topostpone all discussion on budget restructuring untilat least September.    It would be necessary to usethe British Presidency to keep up the pressure forprogress.c. Contrary to newspaper reports, there was nodisagreement between the Treasury and the Foreignand Commonwealth Office over budget restructuring.The speech by the Chancellor of the Exchequer to thejoint meeting of the Dutch Foreign Affairs Instituteand the European Movement in The Hague on 3 Junerepresented agreed Government policy although itspresentation would be new to some of our Communitypartners.d. The Joint Council of Finance, Economic andEmployment Ministers was still likely to be heldduring the Dutch Presidency but one of the two datesnow suggested would coincide with the forthcomingmeeting of the European Council.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALISQUALIFI CATIONF PRISONERSROM ELECTION1 PARLIAMENTeviousef erence:C(81) 19thonclusions,&quot;inute 14. The Cabinet considered a memorandum bv the Home Secretary(C(S1) 25) about proposed legislation disqualifying prisoners fromelection to Parliament.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Home and Social Affairs (H)Committee had agreed that urgent legislation should be introducedto prevent a repeat o.r the last by-ejection in Fermanagh and SouthTyrone, in which a convicted terrorist serving a long term ofimprisonment had been elected as a Member of Parliament. TheCommittee had. concluded that all persons serving a prison sentenceof more than 12 months in the United Kingdom or the Republic ofIreland, including those released from prison but subject to recall,should be disqualified from election to the House of Commons, andthat acting returning officers should have power to invalidate thenominations of such persons, thereby preventing them from standingas candidates.    It had been agreed that if a writ for Fermanagh andSouth Tyrone were to be moved before the legislation could beintroduced, the Government would seek to have the debate adjourned;but once the Summer Recess had begun, the Recess Elections Act 1975required the Speaker to issue his warrant for a writ if any twoMembers certified that the previous Member was dead.    It was there-fore essential that the legislation should be introduced as soon aspossible and passed by the end of July.    Preparatory work hadrevealed that a Bill which fulfilled all the objectives of H Committeecould not meet this timetable.    He therefore proposed that dis-qualification should be limited to convicted persons detained inprison in the United Kingdom put suant to a sentence of more than12 months, and should not extend to prisoners in the Republic ofIreland, or to those released subject to executive recall.    He pro-posed to retain the proposed power to invalidate nominations, butthere were signs that the Opposition would object to this, and it mightbe necessary in order to obtain a wide measure of agreement simplyto restore substantially the position which had existed before 1967,under which convicted prisoners serving sentences of more than12 months were disqualified from sitting or voting as Members of theHouse of Commons, but not from standing as candidates inParliamentary elections.    He expected that legislation in the formproposed in C(81) 25 could be ready for introduction in about afortnight.In discussion, it was noted that arrangements were believed to be inhand for putting up another convicted prisoner as a candidate inFermanagh and South Tyrone.    Disqualifying legislation should bepassed as quickly as possible, even if this meant that the power toinvalidate nominations had to be dropped.    A Bill in the form nowproposed would inevitably leave a number of xoopholes which mightwell be exploited, particularly since attention had been focused onthe possibility of cross-Border candidature by the decision of theprisoners in the H block to put themselves forward for election tothe Dail.    These problems could not be dealt with in the immediate4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALfuture, but would lequire further consideration in tbe context of thegeneral review of electoral law currently being conducted by theHome Office.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that a comprehensive Bill on the disqualificationof prisoners could not be passed by the end of July and agreed thatthe legislation should be confined to the points recommended inC(81) 25.    The Home Secretary and the Chancellor of the Duchy ofLancaster and Paymaster General should now consult other partiesin the House of Commons on this basis, and report back to theCabinet if it seemed desirable to modify the proposed power toinvalidate nominations in order to secure a wide measure of supportfor the Bill.The Cabinet -1.Approved the recommendations in C(S1) 25.2. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster andPaymaster General, to discuss these proposalswith other parties in the House of Commons, andreport any difficulties to the Cabinet, as indicatedin the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of theirdiscussion.SIVIL SERVICEFAYreviousReference:CC(81) 20thConclusions,/iinute 45.
