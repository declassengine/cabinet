CONFIDENTIAL&apos;ARLIAMENTARYlFFAIRSJarliamentaryJustness1. THE CHANCELLOR. OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL informed the Cabinet of the business to betaken in the House of Commons during the following week.    He had beencoming under increasing pressure from the Leader of the Opposition toprovide Government time for a debate on unemployment.    This matterwas almost certain to be raised again that afternoon following hisbusiness statement, and if so he intended to announce that theGovernment hoped to be able to provide time for a debate in the fairlynear future.The Cabinet -1.Took note.)i squalif ic ati on&gt;f Prisonersrom Electiono ParliamentPreviousReference:;C(81) 21stconclusions,Minute 4THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Cabinet had agreed at theirmeeting on 4 June to the preparation of a Representation of the PeopleBill limited to disqualifying from election to Parliament convictedpersons detained in prison in the United Kingdom pursuant to a sentenceof more than 12 months, with a power to invalidate the nomination ofpersona disqualified under the Bill.    The Cabinet had recognised thatthe propoeal on the invalidation of nominations might cause difficultieswith the Opposition, and had invited him, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, to consult other parties in theHouse of Commons and report back to the Cabinet if necessary. TheShadow Cabinet had decided at their meeting the previous day to opposethe introduction of any Bill dealing with disqualification of prisoners.Their objection to the proposed Bill was one of principle, and theirattitude was unlikely to be significantly affected by whether or not theinvalidation provisions were included.In discussion it was agreed that the situation in Northern Ireland made itessential to pass legislation on the disqualification of prisoners beforethe Summer Recess, in spite of the Labour Party&apos;s opposition, and theresultant strains on the Parliamentary timetable.    There was bound tobe a new by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone in a matter ofweeks.    As matters stood at present, this seemed likely to be arepetition of the last by-election in that constituency, with a straightfight between an Official Unionist candidate and an imprisoned hungerstriker; the Social Democratic and Labour Party did not apparentlyintend to put up a candidate.    The nomination and election of a furtherhunger striker would anger Protestant opinion in the Province, and wouldgive the extremists on both sides an excuse for stepping up acts ofterrorism, particularly in the sensitive period following the opening ofthe marching season on 12 July.    Many moderate Roman Catholicswould be reluctant to vote for a hunger striker, and had done so in theprevious by-election in Fermanagh and South Tyrone only to exclude the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALOfficial Unionist, and might well welcome a change in the law whichwould give them political arguments either for abstaining or for votingfor some third candidate.In further discussion it was noted that including a provision forinvalidating nominations in the proposed legislation would be widelyregarded as a major change in electoral law of a kind which had normallybeen made in the past only after a Speaker&apos;s Conference and very wideconsultation.    Such a Bill was bound to be more controversial than onewhich was simply aimed at substantially restoring the pre-1967 position,and its consideration would take longer in the House of Commons. TheProvisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) would take advantage of thedebates to stir up international opinion against the Government,particularly if they could point to the fact that the change was opposed bya large section of Parliamentary opinion.    It was argued, on the otherhand, that there was widespread public indignation that convictedterrorists serving long prison sentences should be eligible for electionto a democratic Parliament.    If the Bill did no more than restore thepre-1967 position, the PIRA would again be able to score a propagandavictory of the kind they had claimed in the election of Mr Sands; theymight, indeed, put forward as a candidate in the Fermanagh and SouthTyrone by-election a prisoner who had only a few weeks left to serve sothat he could, after release, claim to be the democratically electedrepresentative of the constituency, even though legally disqualified.Consultations with the Government&apos;s own supporters in the Hou^e ofCommons suggested that they would regard such limited legislation asillogical and as an inadequate resprnse to the current problem. Somewould undoubtedly seek to strengthen the Bill during its passage throughParliament.    The attitude of the Labour Party made it even moreimportant that the Government side should preserve a united front.This made it desirable that the Bill as introduced should provide for theinvalidation of nominations either by the acting returning officer or bysome other person on his initiative.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, althoughthe Cabinet recognised the need to pass a Bill on the disqualification ofprisoners from election to Parliament as quickly as possible, theyconsidered that, on balance, the political arguments were in favour ofincluding a provision to permit the invalidation of the nomination ofprisoners serving sentences of more than 12 months.    The precisewording of -he relevant clause should be settled by the Home Secretaryin consultation with the Attorney General.    Notice of introduction of theBill should be given that afternoon, with the Bill being published thefollowing day.    Second Reading could then be set down for Monday22 June, with remaining stages later in the same week.    The Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster should announce the Government&apos;s intentionsin his business statement that afternoon.    The Cabinet noted that thismight precipitate a motion for the issue of a writ for the Fermanagh and2CONFIDENTIAL

The Chief Whip should takeany necessary steps to ensure that the Government could carry theadjournment of the debate on any such motion until after the Bill hadreceived Royal Assent.The Cabinet -2.

Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Chief Whip, to arrange for the introduction of theBill in the House of Commons the following day.4. Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterand Paymaster General to indicate the Government&apos;sintentions during his business statement that afternoon.5. Invited the Chief Whip to take any necessarysteps to ensure the adjournment of any debate on amotion for a writ for the Fermanagh and SouthTyrone by-election.Northern[r elandPreviousReference:CC(81) 20thConclusions,Minute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that hewould be making a statement in the House of Commons that afternoonabout the escape from the Crumlin Road gaol in Belfast of eightsuspected  PIRA terrorists wbo were being held on remand.    They hadsomehow obtained arms, and had overcome the unarmed prison officerswho were guarding them.    Several prison officers had been injured.There had been a gun battle outside the prison and the escaped prisonershad got away in circumstances of considerable confusion.    The policehad subsequently arrested three solicitors.    He would consult the HomeSecretary about setting up an official internal inquiry into the incidentunder the direction of a senior member of the United Kingdom PrisonService.The Cabinet6.Took not 3CONFIDENTIAL

The Soviet Union appeared to be deeply concernedabout what might emerge from the Polish Communist Party Congress tobe held in July and had sent a warning letter to the Polish CentralCommittee.    Pressure from the Soviet Union seemed to be the cause oxthe recent unsuccessful attempt to displace Mr Kania, the Polish PartySecretary.    It was not clear what the next move by the Soviet Union wouldbe.    It was significant that refugees from Poland had begun to arrive inDenmark, but no unusual military movement had been detected.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he would shortly have to take adecision on whether the remains of General Sikorski, the Polish wartimeleader, should be removed back to Warsaw in response to a Polishrequest.    He would be consulting the Foreign and CommonwealthSecretary and the Prime Minister before he reached his decision.eviouseference:[6(81) 14thinclusions,ifeute 2raelr eviousTerence:1(81) 4th nclusions,|linute 2THE E.ORD PRIVY SEAL said that the decision by Ayatollah Khomeini tostrip the President of Iran, Mr Bani Sadr, of his powers as Commander.in-Chief of the Iranian Armed Forces seemed to suggest that theIslamic Republican Party in Iran had asserted its supremacy overMr Bani Sadr&apos;s more moderate supporters.    The timing of the decisionmight relate to the fact that the Iranian forces had been achieving somesuccess against Iraq which might have redounded to the credit of theirCommander-in-Chief.    A particularly worrying feature about thesituation in Iran was the increasing infiltration of the Islamic fundamen-talists by Communists from the Tudeh party.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that, whatever the international results ofthe Israeli air attack on the Iraqi nuclear establishment near Baghdadmight be, it had undoubtedly substantially improved the position ofMr Begin, the Israeli Prime Minister, in the forthcoming election inIsrael.The CabinetTook note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said he had visited Copenhagen theprevious day for talks with the Danish Government mainly aboutCommunity matters.    The Danes were understandably worried about thebudget restructuring exercise which was likely to result in somereduction in the financial benefits which they currently enjoyed from theCommunity.enchrkeyseviousference:(81) 20thnclusions,mute 2In a reply to a question, THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,FISHERIES AND FOOD said the prospect of large quantities of Frenchturkeys being sold on our market at below the cost of productionconstituted a serious problem.    It was claimed that the a?.ds received bythe French industry were of an industrial and regional kind permittedunder the Treaty of Rome.     Even if the British Government took thematter tc the European Court, the damage would have been done beforea ruling could be expected.    No doubt, in similar circumstances, theFrench would find covert ways of preventing the imports taking place,but if the British Government were to do the same it would risk beingexposed to challenge in a British court by an aggrieved importer.Unless something could be done, anti-Community feeling in this country-would be fostered.;el THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said there was likely tobe effective action to control Community steel production with aeviouc resulting improvement in prices.    The mandatory production quotasference: expiring cn 30 June would be extended for one year for steel coils but;(81) 14th probably replaced by voluntary arrangements in respect of othernclusions, products.

CONFIDENTIALLEGISLATIVEPROGRAMME1981-82[PreviousReference:CC[81) 19thConclusions,Minute 64. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C(81) 27) about the legislative programme for the 1981-82 Session ofFarliament.THE HOME SECRETARY said that The Queen&apos;s; Speeches and FutureLegislation Committee (QL) had reconsidered their recommendationsfor the legislative programme for the 1981-82 Session of Parliament inthe light of the Cabinet&apos;s views that more emphasis should be placed onBills furthering the Government&apos;s main strategic aims. TheCommittee now recommended, witn the agreement of the Ministersconcerned, that six of the Bills which they had originally suggested forthe main programme should be deferred.    Most of these proposed Billswere in an advanced state of preparation, and would have been unlikelyto be very controversial;  their deferment did not, therefore, give verywide scope for the addition of other major measures to the programme.The Cabinet had already agreed that the Gas (Industrial and CommercialSupplies) Bill should be added to the programme.    This Bill wasunlikely to be ready for introduction before February 1982, and if sowould not be passed before the Summer Recess in 1982.    It would there-fore create a need for a spillover period in the House of Lords in theautumn of that year.    QL had had grave misgivings about this timetable,and had also been concerned about the demands which would be placedupon the Department of Energy by the need to handle four major BilJs ina single Session.    QL had accepted the case put forward by the Secretaryof State for the Environment for a Housing Bill, subject to furtherconsideration of its scope by the Home and Social Affairs Committee,and for a strictly limited Bill on rates, to include provisions on theestablishment of an Accounts Commission for local government; butthey had not been able to accommodate his bid for a third Bill on thewater industry.    QL had recognised that the Secretary of State forDefence&apos;s new proposal for a Bill on the privatisation of the RoyalOrdnance Factories was very much in line with the approach to nextSession&apos;s programme favoured by the Cabinet, but considered that thelikely timetable for policy consideration and the preparation of such aBill ruled it out as a practical proposition for the 1981-82 Session. Ithad been suggested during the Cabinet&apos;s last discussion of the proposedprogramme that the Mental Health (Amendment) Bill might be deferred,but QL concluded that the balance of the programme called for theinclusion of this major piece of social legislation.    It had to be acceptedthat a need might arise at a later stage for Bills other than those nowrecommended by QL.    Time might still have to be found next Sessionfor a Bill on the Canadian Constitution, while the Secretary of State forEmployment had indicated that it would probably be necessary to pass aBill dealing with trade union immunities.     Even if it proved possible tofind room for these Bills without dropping any of the measures nowproposed by QL, it was obviously important to avoid further overloadingof what was already a highly controversial programme.    He invited theCabinet to approve the revised draft programme set out in Annexes A-Dof C(81) 27, and to endorse the other conclusions of his memorandum.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL said that the programme of controversial Billsnow envisaged would impose considerable demands on theGovernment&apos;s supporters in Parliament, and it was important to be ableto demonstrate to them that the programme was being competentlymanaged.    Bills should be ready for introduction not later than the timesnow promised by the Departments concerned, and further provisionsshould not be added or amendments made to them after they had beenintroduced.    Much would depend on the present Session ending on timeand on the 1981-82 Session not being disrupted at the outset by, forexample, the need to find time for a delayed Canada Bill.    No decisionabout the timing of that Bill could be taken until the Canadian SupremeCourt had given its judgment.In discussion the following main points were made -i. Two of the proposed Department of Energy measures (coal;-.nd nuclear energy) would be short money Bills.    The Petroleumand Continental Shelf Bill, which was now ready, would be handledby a separate official team and by a separate Minister in theHouse of Commons from those handling the Gas (Industrial andCommercial Supplies) Bill.    It was unlikely that the latter Billcould be ready for introduction before February.    This meantthat it and the Petroleum and Continental Shelf Bill would not bebefore the House of Lords at the same time.    Such a late date forintroduction would, however, pose very serious problems in bothHouses and, despite the polrcy arguments for the Bill, its place inthe programme would be in jeopardy unless the timetable for itspreparation could be significantly improved.ii. The Government&apos;s own supporters favoured early legislationto deal with the organisation of the water industry.    It was highlydesirable that the present system of central pay negotiationsbetween the unions and the National Water Council should bechanged at the earliest possible opportunity.    Most of the changesproposed in the Water Bill for England could be implemented inWales by means of subordinate legislation.iii. The inclusion of unified housing benefit in the Housing Billmeant that it would require Royal Assent in April or May 1982, soas tc meet the timetable for the 1982 benefit uprating.    This aaaduit particularly important to keep the remaining provisions of theBill within a reasonable compass;  it might be necessary forexample to make a choice between the building regulation and rentderegulation proposals.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALiv. Thm Insolvency Bill had been suggested as a possiblecandidate for deferment if it became necessary to find room foran additional major Bill in the programme.    The changes inbankruptcy procedures proposed for inclusion in the Bill werehighly desirable in their own right, and the consequent saving of570 staff was the only way in which the Department of Trade couldmeet its manpower targets.     The Bill did not, however, fulfil amajor strategic objective, and the Lord Chancellor was stillmaintaining a reservation on its underlying policy.    The savingsfor the Department of Trade would be partly offset by increasedburdens on the county courts and the revenue departments. fv. The proposed legislation on the Royal Ordnanoe Factorieswould enable the Government to bring private sector firms intopartnership with the factories as a prelude to ultimate privatisa-tion and the reduction of some 20, 000 in the size of the CivilService.    It would be helpful if, once the policy had been agreed,-he relevant announcement could make clear that the Governmentwere considering the preparation of the necessary legislation.Such an announcement would not carry any commitment tolegislation next Session, and its terms would need to be agreedwith the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the ChiefSecretary, Treasury.vi. If room were available in tha programme for additional Bills,those which had been deferred, including, for example, theHealth and Social Services (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, had aclaim for consideration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the changes suggested by QL brought the programmemore into line with the criteria previously agreed by the Cabinet andwould, if a Bill on trade union immunities were added, be in line with thepolitical priorities of the Government.    They were, however, seriouslyconcerned about the timing suggested for the Gas (Industrial andCommercial Supplies) Bill.    Its place in the programme would have to belooked at again unless it could be ready for introduction considerablyearlier than was now envisaged.    The Cabinet had some doubts about thenecessity for an Insolvency Bill next Session in view of the otherpressures on the programme, and would need to consider the matterfurther in the light of any additional points which the Secretary of Statefor Trade might wish to make.    Work should proceed on the preparationof all these Bills and of the proposed Water Bill so that considerationcould be given at a later stage either to adding that Bill to the mainprogramme or to offering it to a Private Member.    Time would need tobe made available next Session for any necessary legislation on tradeunion immunities.    A Bill on the privatisation of the Royal OrdnanceFactories should not be added to the programme but, so far as legislation8CONFIDENTIAL

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor the Environment (C(81) 28), recommending that local authorityassociations should not be consulted in the review of options forreductions in local authority expenditure in 1982-83 and later years to beundertaken in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on public expenditureguidelines on 7 May 1981.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that whenthe Cabinet had discussed the guidelines for the 1981 Public ExpenditureSurvey on 7 May it had been decided that the provisional workingassumption about inflation should be given to the local authorityexpenditure groups.     There was the further question whether the localauthorities&apos; views should be sought on the consequences of the 3 per centand 5 per cent options for reductions in 1982-83 and 5 per cent and l\ percent for later years which Ministers were being asked to identify.    In hisview it would be wrong to do so.    It was unrealistic to expect them tomake further cuts of that order in their expenditure, and the process ofconsultation would expose the Government to intense opposition andspecial pleading:  the result would be that the Government would get agreat deal of political odium and few if any benefits by way of reducedexpenditure.    The fear of further cuts on this scale would also prejudicethe Government&apos;s efforts to reduce local authority expenditure in 1981-82.In discussion it was argued that details of the options which Ministershave been asked to identify had already appeared in the Press;  it wasnormal for the local authority expenditure groups to discuss options forreductions;  and authorities might criticise the Government if they werenot consulted.     On the other hand there was no operational need forconsultation, since Departments were already aware of the sort of actionwhich would need to be taken in order to secure cuts of 3, 5 or 7| percent in planned expenditure on particular programmes. Identifyingoptions was intended to do no more than provide the Cabinet with a com-prehensive analysis on which it could draw later in the year when itcame to its substantive discussions of public expenditure;  but theGovernment&apos;s opponents would misrepresent consultations about optionsCONFIDENTIALfublicIxpenditur elirveyjptions
CONFIDENTIALas evidence that the Government had already decided to demand furthersubstantial cuts in local authority expenditure, and the Government wouldattract considerable and unnecessary criticism.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short dianussion, said that it wasnot in dispute that Ministers should identify options for reductions inlocal authority expenditure, on the lines which Cabinet had alreadyagreed.    Nor was there any question of withhoJding from localauthorities the agreed inflation assumptions for future years.    The onlyissue was whether the local authorities should be consulted about thepossible options for reductions in expenditure in 1982-83 and later yearsor whether this work should be done within Government Departments.The balance of view in the Cabinet was that there should on thisoccasion be no consultation about the option cuts with local authorityr epr e s entati v e s.The Cabinet -Agreed that the local authority associations should notat this stage be involved in the examination of optionreductions for 1982-83 and later years.Cabinet Office11 June 198110CONFIDENTIAL
