CONFIDENTIALHJAMENTARYfAlRS1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER ANDPAYMASTER GENERAL informed the Cabinet of the business to betaken in the House of Commons during the following week.    It waslikely that the Opposition would use the debate on 16 July on outbreaksOf civil violence to attack the economic policies of the Government,which they would allege had been a prime cause of the disturbances.There was great pressure on the time of both Houses during theremainder of July; time might, nevertheless, have to be found for adebate in Government time on the Brandt Report and also, if theOpposition did not choose the subject for a Supply Day, for one onthe British Broadcasting Corporation external services.The Cabinet -Took note.IEIGNTFAIRSjat-Westlationsnouseferences: 81) 26thiclusions,tiute 2 and|(81) 22ndiclusions,hute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he hadvisited Moscow on 5 and 6 July.   The Soviet Government had reacted withpredictable hostility to his initiative on Afghanistan.    The inferencemust be that they were not yet in deep enough trouble there to want away out.    His aim now would be to keep up the international pressure.On Poland, he had found the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Gromyko,surprisingly relaxed and communicative.    Having just returned froma visit to Warsaw, Mr Gromyko was clear that the economic prospectsfor Poland were extremely serious, but he gave the impression that hedid not regard the political situation as too critical and that theforthcoming Congress of the Polish Communist Party was unlikely tolead to produce circumstances in which the Soviet Union would feelcompelled to intervene.    By contrast, Mr Gromyko and his colleagueshad shown considerable uncertainty and hostility about United Statespolicy vis-a-vis the Soviet Union.    The central i,ssue involyed wasarms control.    Mr Gromyko had argued uncompromisingly that progressin this area would be impossible unless the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation agreed to the Soviet proposal for a moratorium on thedeployment of long-range theatre nuclear weapons.The Cabinet -Took note.IMMUNITYFFAIRS^munity)ectivesfing thehahNddency3.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that in the course of the previousfortnight there had been serious outbreaks of rioting in Southall, theToxteth area of Liverpool, the Moss Side area of Manchester and, toa lesser extent, Wood Green in North London.    Earlier that week, hehad visited Liverpool and discussed the situation with civic and churchleaders, and with representatives of the ethnic minorities.    In spite ofthe considerable degree of financial assistance which the area hadreceived from the Government, they still regarded Liverpool as aneglected area;  they ascribed the root cause of the present unrest toa feeling of alienation among the young, and to the high level ofunemployment, although they acknowledged that many rioters werebelow working age.    There had been some complaints of policeharassment, but racial conflict did not appear to have played a verylarge part in the disturbances in Liverpool.    The police had beensubject to extreme pressure, but their morale was very high, andthey greatly appreciated the high level of continuing support which theyhad received from the Government.    The Moss Side riots seemed to belargely in imitation of those in Liverpool, though social conditions inthe area were very bad.    There had been major damage to propertyin the area, but, unlike Liverpool, no police officers had beenseriously injured.    There was no doubt that the most recent Southallriot had been provoked by racially motivated wh;.te youths from outsidethe area.   The Wood Green incident had taken place in a relativelyprosperous area and seemed to be isolated in its causes.    There wereother cities in which disturbances could well occur during the summer.In the debate arranged for the following week, the Opposition wouldalmost certainly seek to blame high unemployment for the unrest, and todemand major changes in the Government&apos;s economic policies; theattitude of some of the Government&apos;s own supporters would be to suggesta response concentrated on law and order issues.    He recommendedthat the Government should attempt to steer a middle course betweenthese two extremes.    They must continue to give the police theirfullest support, and to be ready to advise Chief Constables asnecessaay on the handling of the difficult and unfamiliar situation whichhad arisen.    The particular problems of the deprived inner city areasshould be kept in mind in the Government&apos;s further consideration ofthe allocation of scarce resources, and the Home Office would pressahead with its current study of racialist attacks, and with the reviewCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALof the Public Order Act, though the outcome of the latter would haveto await the conclusion of Lord Scarman&apos;s current inquiry, and wasin any case unlikely to be immediately relevant to the presentsituation.In discussion, it was agreed that the Government needed to reactquickly and effectively tc help shopkeepers and others who hadsuffered serious damage and loss in the disturbances. Compensationwas payable by police authorities und^r the Riot Damage Act inrespect of damage to buildings and their contents, and leaflets hadalready been distributed in Liverpool explaining the procedure forlodging claims.    The payment of claims could, however, take sometime and it was  desirable that the process should be expedited.While it was clearly important to minimise the risk of abuse, thoseconcerned should be given wide delegated authority to make advancepayments where necessary, and perhaps to pay compensation fordamage to vehicles and other property not covered by the RiotDamage Act.   It might be useful to enlist outside help - for example,from a panel of professional loss adjusters - to ensure that claimswere dealt with quickly and fairly, and that fraudulent claims weredetected.In discussion of the implications for law enforcement, it was notedthat the existing law was prima facie adequate to deal with the variousoffences, including assault, and causing an affray, which had beencommitted in the course of the riots.    Looters could be charged withtheft or handling stolen goods.    Nevertheless, the police facedformidable difficulties in arresting the main trouble-makers amidthe confusion of a riot;  and, having done so, in obtaining convictionsin circumstances where identification was often doubtful.Reintroducing the Riot Act in a modernised form might be presenta-tionally helpful, and would have the additional advantage that anyonefound on the streets once the statutory time from the reading of theproclamation had expired, including Press and radio and televisionreporters, would be guilty of an absolute offence.    Difficulties ofidentification might be diminished if the wearing of masks were ofitself to be made a criminal offence.    It was essential that those whohad been charged in connection with the current disturbances shouldbe brought speedily to trial.    The experience at Bristol suggested itwas often best to charge individuals with summary offences, andspecial sittings of Magistrates&apos; courts t, ould be held.    Where offenderswere more appropriately tried on indictment special arrangementsneeded to be made to ensure an early trial.In discussion of the underlying causes of the disturbances attentionwas drawn to the number of young people, many West Indians, whofelt no loyalty to society and resorted to crime.    High unemploymentin inner city areas was increasing the numbers of such frustratedyoung people with no outlet for their energies.    Much responsibilityalso lay with parents who failed to exercise adequate control over their3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALchildren.    The Criminal Justice Bill planned for next Session wouldincrease the powers, of the courts in dealing with parents of offenders.Headmasters in Liverpool consulted by die Department of Educationand Science had reported an atmosphere of mounting tension in theschools in the period immediately preceding the riots, and there wassome evidence that the disturbances had not been spontaneous,More generally, the riots and their aftermath had revealed analarmingly widespread lack of moral sense;  much of the large-scale looting in Toxteth, for example, had been carried out bymiddle-aged white residents who had had no part in the riots them-selves.    Though it was often claimed that it coujd not be demonstratedthat television had a deleterious effect on standards of moral andsocial behaviour, the fact was that the generation of young peoplenow growing up were habituated to watching television for manyhours every day, and there was good reason to fear that televisionhad undermined the traditional disciplines of family life, and hadgiven prominence to violence in both news and entertainmentprogrammes.In further discussion, it was noted that the moderate Labourleadership of the Merseyside County Council and of the Labour groupon the Liverpool City Council were coming under great pressurefrom the extreme Left, who missed no opportunity to weaken theadministration of both authorities.   There was evidence also thatextremists had penetrated voluntary community organisations withthe deliberate intention of provoking and exploiting disturbancesaimed in particular at the police.    In Manchester the policeauthority was now under left-wing control.    In many cities theLeft would try to make capital out of any supplementary rate increasesmade necessary by the measures being taken to limit excess localauthority expenditure, and out of any future increases in councilhouse rents.    Some left-wing members of the legal professionsought to persuade young people who came before the courts thattheir convictions were the result of calculated social injustice.In discussion of the economy of the areas concerned, it was arguedon the one hand that money should be made available for thecreation of jobs and environmental improvement in areas of greatestdeprivation;  but oa the other, that it would be better to look morewidely at &quot;travel-to-work&quot; areas and to spend such resources ascould be made available on points of potential growth, which wouldnot necessarily be in exactly the places these disturbances hadoccurred.    The impression must not be given that more law-abidingareas were being penalised or that well-organised rioting producedquick results.    Moreover, experience suggested that value for moneywould not be obtained if resources were channelled through localauthorities and other agencies without clear direction.    For thesereasons, and to reassure the public, there might be advantage inappointing a Minister or Ministers who would be publicly identifiedwith the Government&apos;s concern for improving social conditions, who4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALwould analyse the needs of particular areas on an objective basis andwho would be responsible for encouraging private sector investmentas well as for ensuring that such additional public money as mightbe made available was used to the best advantage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that there might be further outbreaks of civildisturbances.    What Lad already happened was a matter of greatconcern and might prove a watershed in British political life. TheGovernment si ould continue to give full support to the police and mustbe seen to respond quickly and effectively to the present situation.The Ministers concerned should consider urgently whether changesin the criminal law were needed and should make any arrangementsnecessary to ensure that those charged with offences in connectionwith the disturbances were brought to trial without delay.Destruction of shops and other property would further weaken theeconomy of the areas affected and urgent consideration should begiven to the best way of ensuring that those who had suffered seriousloss during the riots received very early compensation, if necessaryon an interim basis.    The Home Secretary should consider what morecould be done to encourage the broadcasting authorities to pay greaterattention to the possible effects of the way in which they collected andbroadcast news items about violent incidents.    The Cabinet had alsohad a useful discussion on possible ways of improving the effective-ness of expenditure ininner city areas, where considerable sumshad been spent in the past, sometimes on the wrong objectives; andshe would herself consider further the points made and, in particular,the need for better leadership and co-ordination of programmes ofexpenditure in these areas.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Lord Chancellor, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Attorney General and the Lord Advocate, to considerwhether   any changes to the criminal law were desirablein order to enable the courts and the police to deal moreeffectively with offences committed in the course of riotsand to report to the Cabinet.2. Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation withthe Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Attorney General and the Lord Advocate, to makeany necessary arrangements to ensure that personscharged with offences in connection with the riots werebrought to trial at the earliest opportunity.5CONFIDENTIAL

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that the Irish Commission for Justice and Peace, which was anon-official Catholic body involving both laymen and clerics fromboth Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic, had sought to play ahelpful role in relation to the hunger strike by prisoners in the Mazeprison but had been unable to bring the strike to an end.    They hadseen the protesting prisoners on three occasions;  and they had beenin contact with the strikers&apos; families and probably also with theProvisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA),    It had been made clearto them in advance by the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office(Mr Alison) that there could be no negotiations between theGovernment and the prisoners, and that the strike was in any casenot really about prison conditions.    Meanwhile the prisoners hadput out a statement which was conciliatory in tone but not insubstance;  their five demands were unchanged, although they werecontent for concessions to apply equally to all prisoners and were nolonger demanding a differentiated status for themselves. Inresponse the Government had repeated its earlier procedure by whichhe himself had sec out in a public statement the conditions andprivileges which were applicable to all conforming prisoners, andthis statement was then communicated to each protesting prisoner.It had thus been made clear, both inside and outside the prison, thatthe continuation of the strike was not due, as so often alleged, toinflexibility on the Government&apos;s side.    A fifth hunger striker,McDonnell, had died early on 8 July.    His place had been taken byanother prisoner, so that a total of eight remained on strike. Thepolice had been well able to cope with the public disorder immediatelyfollowing his death, in which no-one had been seriously injured.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALFurther trouble was expected at the time of the funeral;  but it washoped that this would be over before the start of the Protestantmarches commemorating the Battle of the Boyne, which on thisoccasion would not take place until 13 July because 12 July fell ona Sunday.    If the hunger strike persisted the next striker was likelyto die soon after 20 July.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office9 July 19817CONFIDENTIAL
