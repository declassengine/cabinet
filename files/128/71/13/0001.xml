CONFIDENTIAL!AMENTARYIRS1, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE HOME SECRETARY said that it was unlikely that the Governmentwould succefld in any attempt to delete in the House of Commons the newclause on Gibraltar inserted in the British Nationality Bill by the Houseof Lords.    Even if the Commons were to disagree the new clause, itwas likely that it would subsequently be reinstated by the House of Lords.After discussing the matter with the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip,he had come to the conclusion that the Government should not seek toreverse the Lords&apos; decision.    The consequent difference in treatmentbetween Gibraltar and Hong Kong would cause some resentment in HongKong, but should not create undue difficulties.The Cabinet -Took note.STRIAL 2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that at theAIRS end of the previous week the British Leyland workforce had voted by alarge majority in favour of strike action from 1 November in pursuit ofsh Leyland their pay claim, and the situation was extremely delicate. TheChairman of the company, Sir Michael Edwardes, had made it cleari us that, if the strike went ahead, the Board would not be able to continuerence: with the strategy contained in its corporate plan, and that immediate0) 16th steps would have to be taken to dispose of at least some, and possiblylusions, all, of the company&apos;s assets; letters would be sent on 3 November tote 4 those on strike, saying that they had in effect dismissed themselvesand were no longer employed by the company.    He would appear ontelevision in the course of the following week to explain the consequencesof the proposed strike for British Leyland and its suppliers, and tomake it clear that he remained open to further approaches from theunions concerned at any time.    The unions had so far made no attemptto renegotiate the existing productivity agreements which had beenheavily criticised by some sections of the workforce.    There was roomfor some flexibility by the company in this area.    The handling of thenegotiations, as he himself had repeatedly made clear, was entirely amatter for the company.    He would remain in contact withSir Michael Edwardes, and would consider circulating a memorandumto the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy setting out thelikely economic and industrial consequences if British Leyland wereeffectively to be liquidated.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat although there was no objection to the Secretary of State forIndustry remaining in informal contact with Sir Michael Edwardes,there could be no question of the Government interfering in theindustrial relations of the company, and the Chairman had theGovernment&apos;s full support in the line which he was pursuing.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmploymentTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the latestunemployment statistics would be published later that day.    The figures,which were still distorted by the effects of the Civil Service industrialaction, were more than usually difficult to interpret.    The crudefigures showed a fall in unemployment of some 10, 000 but the seasonallyadjusted figures, though still below 3 million, suggested someacceleration of the rate of increase.    On the positive side, vacancieshad increased by 2,000, with overtime up and short-time working down.The CabinetTook note.EIGNAIRSadavious:rence;81) 31stdusions,ute 13. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Canadian Prime Minister, Mr Trudeau, was now talking of a sub-stantial compromise between the Federal Government and the eightdissident Provincial Governments over the proposed legislation topatriate the Canadian Constitution, but the possibility of such a com-promise remained uncertain and there was- a real danger of theCanadian Government&apos;s proposals reaching Westminster in substantiallytheir present form.    This would not now happen before early November.Meanwhile the British Government&apos;s proposed reply to the report onthe subject by the Foreign Affairs Committee of the House of Commonshad been revised to take account of the judgment which the CanadianSupreme Court had delivered in September; but this reply would not bepublished until after proceedings in the Canadian Parliament had beenconcluded.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that the CanadianSupreme Court&apos;s judgment had increased the likelihood of the BritishParliament rejecting the Canadian proposals, on the grounds that, ifOttawa had overridden one constitutional convention, Westminstercould not reasonably be regarded as bound by another.    If thishappened, Britain would be accused of interfering in Canadian affairsand Anglo-Canadian relations could be severely damaged. Furtherthought would need to be given to what course the British Governmentshould follow if the Canadian Bill were defeated at Westminster.Simple patriation of the Constitution, with the amending formula butwithout the Bill of Rights proposed by the Canadian Government, mightthen be the best course; but this would be open to the objection that itwould breach the convention that Britain was not entitled to legislateon Canadian affairs except in accordance with a Canadian request.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thevictory of Mr Andreas Papandreou&apos;s Socialist Party in the Greek generalelection was a disturbing development, although some of its inter-national effects might prove less serious than had oeen feared. Hisplan to hold a referendum on Greece&apos;s membership of the EuropeanCommunity required the agreement of the President, Mr Karamanlis,which was unlikely to be forthcoming.    He could, however, beexpected to seek a renegotiation of the terms of Greek membership,and while this was in progress there would be a danger of Greeceproving an obstructive and unhelpful partner in the Community.    It wasunlikely that Mr Papandreou would seek to take Greece out of the NorthAtlantic Alliance.    But he might well leave the military structure ofthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thechange of leadership in Poland was probably for the better, and mightlead to a Government which was more dynamic and better able to takedecisions.    The new Party leader, General Jaruzelski was essentiallya moderate.    The leader of the Solidarity trades union movement,Mr Walesa, had welcomed his appointment.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theplanned Marylebone Cricket Club tour of India was now unlikely to takeplace, since the Indians were refusing on political grounds to accepttwo members of the British team who were said to have had sporting&apos;links with South Africa.    It had been suggested that their presencemight have led to public disorder at cricket matches in which they tookpart.    In view of Britain&apos;s many interests at stake in India, and notleast the steel contract on which the Lord Privy Seal had reported tothe Cabinet on 24 September, it would be important for members of theGovernment to avoid public comment on the issue as far as possible.Where comment was unavoidable, the essential point to make was thatBritain stood by and complied with the Commonwealth&apos;s GleneaglesAgreement on sporting contacts with South Africa; if necessary it couldbe added that the Government were not prepared to put pressure onindividual sportsmen.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,although no decision had yet been taken, it now seemed probable thatsmall-scale British participation in the proposed Sinai MultinationalForce would be essential in order to avoid the danger of Israel refusingto hand back the rest of the Sinai to Egypt on the due date in the springof 1982.    From Britain&apos;s point of view a balance of disadvantages wasinvolved.    If participation could not be avoided, every effort would3CONFIDENTIAL

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe French Government had now published a memorandum containingtheir proposals for the &quot;relance&quot; of the Community.    It was somethingof a damp squib, consisting largely of a collation of relatively minorindividual proposals for the practical development of Communitypolicies.    Many aspects of the memorandum accorded well withUnited Kingdom views, though (eg the proposal for a 35-hour workingweek) were not acceptable.    In general the memorandum should notcause the United Kingdom any embarrassment, provided that it couldbe handled separately from the mandate negotiations.Ictober CouncilIconomic andlace Ministersicm8rences:V) 31stFusions,pte 2f) 24thfusions,te 3THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the orientationdebate on the mandate which had taken place at the meeting of theCouncil of Ministers (Economic and Finance) on 19 October had shownsome signs of advance towards United Kingdom objectives. Theatmosphere had been less hostile than at the start of the budgetrestructuring negotiations.     The Dutch had spoken in terms whichechoed his own Hague speech, and the Germans had made clear theirinability to accept any longer a situation in which two member statesbore the whole burden of net contributions to the Community budget.It would be crucial to British aims to keep the Germans pressing fora general solution rather than pursuing relief for themselves alone.The discussion on the non-life insurance services Directive had beendisappointing, in that a number of member states who had earlier givengeneral assurances of support had retreated from these positions. Itwould be necessary to push even harder if there were to be anyprogress on this Directive during the United Kingdom Presidency.CONFIDENTIAL

SECRETDOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINETCOPY NO35LIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(8l) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 5Tuesday 20 October 1981 at 10.00 amNOMIC POLICYPUBLICENDITUREviousrence:81) 32ndelusions,ute 4The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C(81) 50) on economic policy and public expenditureand a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, (C(81) 51)making specific proposals for individual public expenditureprogrammes.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that hismemorandum set out the factors relevant to decisions aboutpublic expenditure in 1982-83 and later years and to decisionswhich he would take at the time of his next Budget on taxation andthe Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR).    The immediateeconomic prospects were for a slower improvement than had beenhoped, with inflation coming down more slowly than expected, andunemployment remaining disturbingly high.    There were, however,encouraging signs on output and the longer term prospects gaveground for guarded optimism.    It was a delusion to think that anyalternative economic strategy would, within the lifetime of thepresent Parliament, lead to any substantially better outturn.There was no easy solution by way of financing more expenditure byeither more borrowing or more taxation.    The Treasury hadestimated that additional spending on Government purchases thatraised the PSBR by  1 billion in 1982-83 could reduce unemploy-ment by 50, 000 by the end of 1983 but would be likely to lead toincreases in interest rates and a worsening in the prospect forinflation;  and the gains to output and employment would be elimina rted by the end of 1985.    Against this background, he recommendedthat the Government should plan for a PSBR for 1982-83 not greaterthan the  9 billion foreseen at the time of the 1981 Budget. Thiswas not a precise figure, nor did it represent the outcome of theapplication of any particular economic theory:  it represented apractical judgment of what it might be possible to borrow in thefinancial markets at reasonable levels of interest rates. Anythinghigher than this could lead to increases in interest rates and add tothe problems, already evident, of funding the PSBR.    As it was,debt service costs this year would be in the order of  15 billion:higher than most public expenditure programmes.    He furtherrecommended against any increases in the real burden of taxation,which was already too high.    His present forecast already assumedSECRET
SECRETthat, in the 1982 Budget, income tax thresholds would be raised inline with inflation (under the Rooker-Wise provisions), as wouldexcise duties;  and that National Insurance Contributions wouldrise to balance the National Insurance Fund.    He and the ChiefSecretary, Treasury, recognised that the pressures onDepartmental Ministers for additional expenditure were such thatit would not realistically be possible to hold public expenditure totalsto the provision in the last Public Expenditure White Paper(Cmnd 8175) of  109.9 billion in 1982-83 and  113.9 billion in1983-84;  they were recommending that the planning totals forpublic expenditure should be  113. 5 billion in 1982-83 and 118.1 billion in 1983-84.    These totals were the maximum whichcould be afforded if there were not to be real increases in taxes inthe 1982 Budget on top of the revalorisation already in prospect.Even if these totals were achieved, it would be impossible for himt  make any reductions in the National Insurance Surcharge or anyreal increases in tax thresholds in his next Budget.    The implica-tions for tax changes in 1983 and 1984 were necessarily less certainbut, while he could not yet count on it, his aim would be to take riscfiscal action in those years to assist further in the reduction ofinflation and the improvement of efficiency and competitiveness inBritish industry.In discussion the following were the main points made:-a. Most Ministers agreed that it was right to aim for aPSBR of the order of  9 billion in 1982-83, provided thatthe figure was not regarded as sacrosanct. Somecommentators were expecting a higher figure and this,together with the great uncertainty inherent in forecastingthe PSBR, suggested that it might be reasonable to acceptsomething higher if further discussion of the publicexpenditure and taxation options pointed to that.     n theother hand, there would be risks in planning now foranything higher than  9 billion;  the forecast alreadyincorporated a number of assumptions which could wellprove to be optimistic.b. It was essential that the expenditure and taxationdecisions should give a psychological lift to the moraleof private industry.    This had been low since the measurestaken in the 1981 Budget;  industry felt that, apart from themeasures taken to help small businesses, the Governmenthad not done enough to meet its objectives cf stimulatingwealth creation.    In particular the National InsuranceSurcharge was seen as a tax on employment and as a majordisincentive imposed by the Government on the privatesector.2SECRET
SECRETc. In discussions earlier in the year of publicexpenditure the Cabinet had agreed that it would bedesirable to increase the proportion of capital expenditurein the total.    It was, therefore, particularly disappointingthat the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, paper showed that,if his proposals were to be accepted, central and localGovernment capital expenditure would fall in 1982-83 to9. 5 per cent of total expenditure, excluding the nationalisedindustries, compared with 10. 2 per cent in the last PublicExpenditure White Paper.    Such cuts would have damagingrepercussions on employment and activity by private sectorfirms.    In some cases amall cuts in capital grants couldlead to the collapse of firms producing machinery andequipment;  in others the projects which might be cut werelikely to give a sound economic return.    On the other hand,as the Chief Secretary, Treasury, pointed out, only about5 per cent of the additional expenditure bids put forward byDepartments were for capital expenditure.    In practice,any substantial increases in capital expenditure within thepresent proposed totals could be financed only by furthercuts in the Social Security programme.    The Cabinet hadnot been persuaded, in earlier discussions, that it would berealistic to call for a general limitation o  pay increases to avery low figure, coupled with abatement in the indexationof benefits, in return for increased capital expenditure oninvestment which would promote the revival of the economyand a reduction of unemployment.d. There should be greater readiness to encourageprivate sector financing of public sector capital projects.Provided that the private sector genuinely bore the risks,borrowing for such investment should not count against thePSBR;  this should be practicable for such profitablenationalised industries as British Telecommunications.On the other hand, it had been disappointing that most ofthe proposals so far made were for private sectorborrowing backed by Government guarantee.    Such borrow-ing left the risks with the Government and cost more thanborrowing through the National Loans Fund.e. There would be considerable difficulties inimplementing some of the proposals by the ChiefSecretary, Treasury for cutting some public expenditureand reducing, or rejecting, additional bids whichDepartmental Ministers had thought necessary to putforward.    In further discussion of these proposals it wouldbe essential to recognise pledges which the Government hadalready made.    Proposals for changes should be sociallydefensible, maintaining the reputation of the ConservativeParty as a caring Party and avoiding any charge ofimplementing socially divisive policies bearing more 3SECRET
SECRET?harshly   on the poorer members of the community;this was relevant, for example, to the proposals relating tohealth and social benefits and to council house rents. Theimplementation of some proposals woulJ requireParliamentary approval and it would be important to avoidproposing measures which might be rejected by Parliament.f. Some Ministers thought that taxation should beincreased above the levels assumed by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his memorandum if that were necessary tofinance additional public expenditure at the margin. Itwould certainly be very difficult to defend the avoidanceof real tax increases for the better-off if at the same timesome Social Security benefits were not to be fully indexed.On the other hand, it could well prove very difficult to secureParliamentary acceptance of the revalorisation of indirecttaxes and of the increases in the National Insurancecontribution,  which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasalready planning.    It would be particularly difficult to secureParliamentary approval yet again to less than full indexationof income tax thresholds.    Any real increases in income taxpaid by managers would be severely criticised. Increasesin capital taxation c uld not be expected to yield largeamounts of revenue.g. Some Ministers were sceptical of the assessment,in Annex B of C(81) 50, of the implications for publicfinances of additional public expenditure on manpower.The analysis suggested a cost per job of  20, 000 and thisseemed implausibly high.    There were other measureswhich could be introduced at a much lower cost per job:for example, certain special employment measures and theuse of small amounts of public ftuad6, or guarantees, tostimulate significant private sector investment andemployment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the dangers of planning for increases in thePSBR which would then lead to problems of funding and t  increasesin interact rates which would themselves be damaging to industry.While some members of Cbinet would not rule out the possibilityof real increases in taxation, there was already a likelihood ofvery considerable difficulties in winning Parliamentary acceptanceof the revalorisation of indirect taxes and the increases in theNational Insurance Contributions, which the Chancellor of theExchequer was assuming in his planning.    This pointed to looking,in further discussion of individual public expenditure programmes,for overall planning totals as near as possible to those proposed bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.In this further discussion it would be necessary to have regard :4SECRET
SECRETto the political impact of the changes proposed and to the likelihoodof their acceptability in Parliament.    Some programmes might bediscussed further bilaterally between the Chief Secretary, Treasuryand the Minister concerned.    Flans had already been made for theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy to discuss proposalson employment and training measures and on regional developmentgrants.    She would arrange for other programmes to be examined,prior to further discussion by the Cabinet, by a small group ofMinisters under the chairmanship of the Home Secretary.    In themeantime it was essential to preserve the confidentiality of theCabinet&apos;s discussions, and to avoid any misleading and prematurepublicity which could be damaging to confidence in the financialmarkets.    She would if necessary indicate in Parliament that theCabinet had held one of a series of meetings on public expenditurewhich were aimed not at cuts but at holding increases within limitswhich the country could afford.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that their aim, in further discussions ofpublic expenditure programmes, should be to arrive atpublic expenditure planning totals as near as possible tothose of  113. 5 billion in 1982-83 and of  118. 1 billionin 1983-84 proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Chief Secretary, Treasury in C(81) 50 and 51.2. Agreed that, where appropriate, there should befurther bilateral discussion between the Chief Secretary,Treasury and the Minister concerned.3.
