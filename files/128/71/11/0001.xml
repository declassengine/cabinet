THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Five-nation Contact Group had sent a message to the South AfricanGovernment to ask whether they had correctly understood the SouthAfrican position as a result of their talks with the United StatesGovernment.    The South African tactics would probably be to play fortime, but the  Y/estern countries would be in difficulties in the UnitedNations if they were unable to produce some ideas for a settlement.The United States Government would probably be willing to put pressure |on the South Africans in order to avoid this risk.    The debates in theUnited Nations General Assembly on the previous day had gonesurprisingly well, with 25 countries abstaining on a motion urgingsanctions against South Africa.    This result had been helped by Soviettactics in opposing the language of the original resolution sponsoredby the Africans.    A further meeting of the Contact Group would beheld in New York during the following week.PolandPreviousleference:X(81) 28thConclusions,inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at itsrecent congress Solidarity appeared to have gone considerably furtherthan previously.    The fact that factory meetings had been organised inthe Soviet Union to attack Soliuarity was significant: it was not to beassumed to be a prelude to Soviet military intervention, but it indicatedthat the Soviet Government was mounting a powerful campaign toensure that the Polish Government resisted Solidarity&apos;s demands andput the blame on Solidarity   for the economic problems and foodshortages.    The Polish Government had asked for further food aid,and decisions might be needed shortly on further credits.3elizePreviousleference:-C(81) 28thConclusions,inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Belizewould become independent on 21 September.    The Leader of theOpposition in Belize had declared himself against independence, butthis represented no more than personal animosity towards the Premier,Mr Price.    There were indications that Guatemala might be contem-plating some form of military incursion short of a full invasion attempt,and the Secretary of State for Defence and himself had taken certainprecautions to deal with thfl threat. &apos;anadianinstitutiondeviousleference:;C(81) 21st-delusions,inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thejudgement of the Supreme Court of Canada on the Federal Government&apos;proposals to bring home the constitution from Britain withoutProvincial consent was not now expected until the end of September.The delay suggested that the verdict would be by a narrow majority.While some delay could be helpful in Parliamentary terms, a narrowmajority for the judgement would not.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnglo-Frenchonsultations.11 SeptemberTHE PRIME MINISTER said that the visit of the President of theFrench Republic and six of his Ministers on 10 and 11 September hadbeen a considerable Buccess.    Monsieur Mitterrand had Expressedhis willingness to concentrate on trying to resolve the big problemsfacing the Community: budget restructuring, the Common AgriculturalPolicy and the Common Fisheries Policy.    She had taken the opportunitto enlarge his understanding of the situation in Northern Ireland.They had discussed Third World problems and the forthcoming Summitmeeting at Cancun.    Monsieur Mitterrand had admitted that Frenchaid totals were somewhat exaggerated through the inclusion of the costsof administering French overseas territories, and had praised theUnited Kingdom&apos;s performance, particularly ir the share of aid to thepoorest countries.    He had shown interest in bilateral collaborationin fields of technology and scientific research in which the UnitedKingdom was ahead of France.    The two Ministers of Transport hadset up a joint working party of officials tc look at eight schemes for aChannel link.    A working party had also been set up to considerConcorde, and the French appeared keen to encourage contacts betweenRolls Royce and the French aero engine manufacturers SNECMA.In discussion it was noted that the new French Government weretalking in terms of a &quot;relance&quot; of the Community.    French Ministerswere also taking a more positive attitude than their predecessors tobilateral co-operation in the field of nuclear power, including fastreactors.    The French attitude towards the Multi-Fibre Arrangementwas also close to the British.    While they had expressed readiness tosupport a Community policy on trade with Japan, they would not inpractice lightly abandon their effective national restraints on importsof sensitive goods from Japan.The Cabinet -Took note.2CONFIDENTIAL
SECRETOMMUNITYSeptemberoreignffairsouncileviouseference:C(81) 30thonclusions,&apos;nute 32. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat , following a successful procedural discussion at the informalmeeting of Foreign Ministers on 5-6 September at Brocket Hall, theCouncil of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 14 September had had apreliminary discussion of the budget restructuring mandate, atwhich all member states had 6et out their general approach tc thenegotiations.    There had been no surprises.    While most memberstates had shown themselvej willing to have all three sections of theCommission&apos;s mandate report discussed in parallel, the French hadargued, with support frcm the Danes and the Irish, that the budgetaryaspects should only be considered after conclusions had been reachedon the development of new Community policies and the reform of theCommon Agricultural Policy.    He had nevertheless concluded fromthe chair, with German support, that although the size of anycompensation could only be settled at the end, it was clear that thethree main aspects of the Commission&apos;s report must b  carriedforward together.   This divergence of views on priorities was likelyto make the detailed negotiations still more difficult;    it was all themore essential that the United Kingdom and Germany should standfirm and work closely together throughout.estraints onoultry Meatmportsreviouseference:C(81) 29thonclusions,inute 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat the restrictions introduced during August against poultry meatimports, including French turkeys, on animal health grounds hadled to French threats of retaliation.    Since the balance of agricul-tural trade was heavily in their favour, they had had second thoughtsand had taken the issue to the Commission.   The Commission hadnow taken the first steps towards opening infraction proceedingsagainst the United Kingdom, giving the Government 15 days to submitits observations on their letter of complaint.    If the matter went inthe end to the European Court of Justice, he considered that theCommission were likely to lose; but even if th^y won, the timing ofthe judgment was likely to be too late to upset this year&apos;s Christmasmarket for British turkey producers.    Most recently the Commissionhad asked whether French turkeys would be allowed into the UnitedKingdom again if the French adapted., their health regime to complywith the new requirements.    His officials had leplied that theywould, once his Ministry&apos;s veterinary advisers were satisfied as totheir compliance.ommonisheries Policyreviouseference:C(81) 21stonclusions,nute 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat, after a series of postponements and cancellations, the Frenchhad now agreed to bilateral talks on the Common Fisheries Policy atboth Ministerial and official level immediately before the29 September Fisheries Council.    It was nonetheless clear that theydid not expect much progress towards a settlement of outstandingproblems at this Council.    The evidence suggested that the FrenchSECRET

CONFIDENTIALc0n0mic3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the BankpfklRS  * England had acted on 14 September to increase short-term interestrates on the London money market.    This could lead to increases inthe banks&apos; base lending rates.    It had been necessary to take thisaction because of the effects on sterling of the strengthening of thedollar and, more recently, of the Deutschemark, of the realisation ofthe continuing over-supply in the oil markets, of the wideningdifferential between interest rates in the United Kingdom and in theUnited States of America, and because of the uncertainty over themonetary aggregates following the recent industrial action by theCivil Service.    He recognised that the continuation of high interestrates in the United States of America could lead to pressure for furtherincreases in interest rates in the United Kingdom.    He would take theopportunity of the meeting of the International Monetary Fund later inthe month to renew, on behalf of the United Kingdom and of theEuropean Community, warnings of the risks that the United StatesAdministration&apos;s economic policy created for the world economy ingeneral, and for the European economies in particular.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.2. Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wasreviewing in the light of recent developments the case for theUnited Kingdom joining the European Monetary System, andthat he would, if appropriate, make proposals at a later date.3. Invited the Secretary of State for Energy to review,in the light of recent changes, the costs of energy toindustrial users in the United Kingdom by comparison withthe energy costs borne by their overseas competitors.5CONFIDENTIAL-1
CONFIDENTIAL[CASH FACTORSjf R THE 1981buBLlC{expenditurehuRVEY(Previous Reference:tC(8l) 29th/Conclusions,IMinute 44. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C(8i) 45) on the factors for pay and prices to beused in the 1981 Public Expenditure Survey and a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services (C(81) 44) on pay and cashplanning in the National Health Service (NHS) in 1982-83.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he recommendedthat, for the purpose of putting the public expenditure programmesfor 1982-83 on to a cash basis, as previously agreed by the Cabinet,the working assumption oi 7 per cent inflation between 1981-82 and1982-83 for all costs should now be replaced by two factors:4 per cent for pay generally, applied to settlement dates, and9 per cent for prices generally, applied year on year. Theprovisional factors for costs of 6 and 5 per cent in the two followingyears should remain unaltered.    It was necessary to adopt separatefactors for 1982-83 in order to avoid distortions betweenprogrammes as a result of the wide disparity between the outlookfor prices and what was appropriate for increases in earnings.The Treasury&apos;s internal forecasts pointed at present to increases inthe Retail Price Increase (RPI) over the year to the fourth quarterof 1982 of about 10 per cent;  the average price increases forGovernment spending in. particular was put at 9-| per cent and herecommended that this should be rounded down to 9 per cent. The4 per cent for earnings was at the bottom end of tne range of4-8 per cent which the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) hopedmight be the outcome for earnings in private industry generally,with some settlements below that.    The increase in total earningswould be less than 4 per cent where reductions in numbers hadalready been built in to the plans.   It would be emphasised to thepublic that the figure was a cash expenditure planning assumptionand not a pay norm.    It was desirable to announce the decisionimmediately to avoid misleading leaks, to influence public sector paysettlements and particularly those for the local authority manuals,to provide for the basis for the Rate Support Grant settlement, andto allow for the calculation of the base-line for the public expendituredecisions which the Cabinet would be taking at their meetings startingon 20 October.    In the meantime, he recommended that considera-tion should be deferred until October of any cash increases orreductions in particular programmes where there were stronggrounds for allowing exceptionally for pay and price movementsdiffering significantly from the general factors.THE SECRETAP.Y OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,while he agreed with the two general factors proposed, he would wishto make recommendations, for discussion in October, for providingsome additional money for the pay of certain crucial NHS staffgroups directly concerned with patient care - the nurses, doctorsand dentists, and some of the smaller staff groups.    This wouldtake account of the fact that, in contrast to most other public sectorgroups, there was no scope for financing higher pay settlements forNHS staff by cuts in services and numbers.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that,for the reasons set out in his letter of 11th September to theChancellor of the Exchequer, he considered it necessary to decidenow whether the cash provision for local authority current expendi-ture in 1982-83 should allow for (&apos;validate&apos;) the excess movement ofpay and prices totalling 3 per cent in 1981-82 above the cash limitsset for that year.    The pay excess in particular was 2-|per cent abovethe planning level and, without allowance fort it, local authorityunions and employers would argue that a factor of 4 per cent forearnings would give them only 1-| per cent.    In his view, unless theexcess in 1981-82 was validated, the targets set for local authoritiesfor 1982-83 would be both unrealistic and indefensible.    He wouldalso wish to argue for a more realistic target for the volumereductions expected of the local authorities.In discussion the following were the main points made:-a. There could be attractions in adopting an approach,on the lines suggested in earlier discussions by the Secretaryof State for the Environment, whereby a substantial sum ofmoney would be committed to programmes for increasedinvestment and employment in return for lower pay settle-ments or, failing that, an abatement in the indexation of taxthresholds or benefits.    Such an approach, calling forsacrifice now in return for a revival in the economy, mightbe more effective than the approach proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer in capturing public imaginationand support.    The difficulty was that, in;re?.lity, neither theCBI nor the Trades Union Congress could guarantee thatindividual unions would accept negligible pay increases, andexperience showed that those in work were not generallyready to make sacrifices for those out of work.    The resultwould be that the enhanced investment would have to befinanced either by higher taxation or by penalising thosegroups in receipt of benefits.b. As it was, the approach proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer itself called for a choice between consump-tion now and more investment and services, but with the payassumption pitched at a tough but realistic level.    The Pressnotice should be re-drafted to bring out much more clearlythis crucial link between the level of pay and the possibilitiesfor increased capital investment and more jobs.    It wasessential to get this message across if the publip, and thepublic sector unions in particular, were to accept theprospect of the real fall in the standard of living which wasimplied by the factors&apos; proposed.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALc. There were some disadvantages in splitting thepresent general factor of 7 per cent into two separate factors.4 per cent would be seen as low for pay, and its publicationnow could provoke all the public sector unions icto unitingbehind the local authority manual workers in looking formore.    On the other hand, it was essential to avoid anynotion that 7 per cent was the figure for pay;  the realitywas that for l982-83f though not necessarily for later years,there was a wide disparity between the factors appropriatefor pay and for prices.    It should be made clear that the4 per cent pay factor was for earnings and not settlementsand that the cash limit, into which it would be incorporated,applied to payrolls.d. It was important to settle as soon as possible thequestion of how far the 1982-83 cash provision xor localauthority current expenditure should allow for excessesover the 1981-82 provision.    The announcement of a4 per cent pay factor would be meaningless for localauthorities until this question was resolved and would notmeet the objective of influencing, early in the negotiations,the local authority manual settlement.    On the other hand,care had to be taken to avoid any impression that excessiveexpenditure in one year would be automatically forgiven bycompensating increases in the following year;  the cashplanning system assumed that in general the squeeze in oneyear would be carried forward to the next.    The right coursewas not to take a general decision on this question but tolook at each case individually, recognising that the circum-stances and merits varied.e. There was no economic logic in a system wherebystaff in a service to which the Government attached highpriority should have their pay treated significantly lessfavourably than staff working in services of lower prioritywhere staff cuts were possible.    This feature of the cashlimit system was acceptable only on an interim basis, andreinforced the case for making some special provision forthe NHS pay groups.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, for the purposes of putting public expenditureprogrammes for 1982-83 on to a cash basis, the factors forinflation between 1981-82 and 1982-83 should be 4 per cent for paygenerally and 9 per cent for prices, and that this decision should beannounced in a Press notice to be issued later in the day. TheChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for ,iEmployment should revise the draft press notice annexed toC(8l) 45: the emphasis on the nature of the decision, and on themargin for flexibility which it provided, should be retained, but much8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALmore should be made of the crucial link between lower pay settle-ments and more investment and jobs;  it should be made clear thatthe pay factor represented a view of what the Government thoughtcould be afforded to finance labour costs in the public services.The revised wording should (like the existing wording) be consistentwith the Government&apos;s assurances to the Civil Service unions thatnegotiations on the 1982 non-industrial settlement would beconducted without a pre-determined limit on the cost.    The Cabinetwould consider further the case for cash additions to local authorityprogrammes sufficient to make good in 1982-83 the squeeze whichhad occurred in 1981-82 because pay and price increases in thoseprogrammes had exceeded the cash limit factors.    In doing so, theywould wish to take account of any differences in performancebetween the English local authorities and others;  they would alsowish to have information, on the achievement of the local authoritiesin tlie past year in reducing their manpower.    In the meantime itshould be made clear, in reply to any questions, that decisions onsuch cash increases, either for the local authorities or for otherprogrammes, would be considered on their merits and case by case.The Cabinet would consider, in the course of their discussions ofpublic expenditure beginning on 20 October, any other particularproposals for cash increases in respect of pay and prices; in themeantime they noted that such cases would be put for certainNational Health Service pay groups and for university teachers.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that, to aliow for inflation between 1981-82and 1982-83, public expenditure programmes should berevalued by factors of 4 per cent for pay generally, appliedto settlement dates, and of 9 per cent for prices generally,applied year on year, and that the factors of 6 and 5 percentfor all costs in the two following years should remainunaltered.2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consulta-tion with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster and the Secretary of State forEmployment, to revise the Press notice annexed to C(81) 45,talcing account of the points made in their discussion, and toissue it later that day.3. Invited the Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the Secretaries of State for NorthernIreland, Scotland and Wales, and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to circulate a memorandum, in time for discussionat their meeting on 24 September and taking account of thepoints made by the Prime Minister in her summing up, onthe case for cash additions to local authority currentexpenditure in 1982-83 to compensate for pay and priceincreases in 1981-82 in excess of the cash limit set for thatyear.9CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL4. Agreed to defer, until their discussions on the 1981Public Expenditure Survey starting on 20 October,consideration of any further proposals tor cash increases orreductions in programmes where there were strong groundsfor allowing exceptionally for pay and price movementsdiffering significantly from the general factors.Cabinet Office15 September 198110CONFIDENTIAL
