CONFIDENTIALARLIAMENTARYFFAIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.eavy LorriesTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Government should put down a neutralamendment to the Opposition motion on heavy lorries for debateon Wednesday 9 December, suggesting that it would be moreappropriate for the House to consider the propssed increase in theweight limit to 40 tonnes when reactions to the White Paper hadbeen studied and consultations on the draft amending regulationsrecently issued by the Secretary of State for Transport had beencompleted.    Although the Officers of the 1922 Committeeconsidered that opposition among the Government&apos;s own supportersto this proposal might increase if there was any undue delay inbringing forward an Order, the Cabinet noted the advice of the ChiefWhip that any attempt to force a decision in the immediate future wasunlikely to be successful.    It would be helpful if the Confederation ofBritish Industry and the National Farmers&apos; Union, both of wham wereunderstood to be in favour of an increase in the weight limits, couldbe persuaded publicly to support the Government&apos;s proposal.The Cabinet -1.      Invited the Secretary of State for Transport toarrange for the tabling of a Government amendment to theOpposition motion on heavy lorries, and to seek the publicsupport of the Confederation of British Industry and theNational Farmers&apos; Union for the Government&apos;s proposals.anadianonstitutionreviousTerence:C(81) 35thocclusions,inute 2THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Canadian House of Commonshad the previous day approved by 246 votes to 24 the JointResolution for an Address to The Queen requesting legislation in theUnited Kingdom Parliament to patriate the Canadian Constitution.The Senate was expected to approve the Resolution later that weekand, if all went according to plan, the Governor General&apos;s PrivateSecretary would deliver the Address to The Queen&apos;s PrivateSecretary on Monday 7 December.    He had circulated a draft replyto the two reports of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs on theCanadian Constitution to members of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee and, subject to their approval, intended to publish ittowards the end of the following week.    He hoped that it would bepossible for the Canada Bill to be introduced at Westminster beforeChristmas.    The official Opposition were adopting a relaxed attitudetowards the Bill, although some backbench members on both sides ofthe House were expected to raise some objections of principle.Quebec, the only one of the ten Provinces not to support the FederalGovernment&apos;s proposals, intended to seek a declaration from the1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALSupreme Court of Canada that they had a right of veto, while a groupof Alberta Indians were seeking leave to commence proceedings inthe High Court in London for an injunction requiring the BritishGovernment to honour what was claimed to be their residual duty toprotect the rights of the aboriginal people of Canada.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that there would beno difficulty about introducing the Bill before Christmas. Theremaining stages of the Bill would be given priority.    He hoped thatSecond Reading could take place in the week beginning either 18 or2 5 January,, though no commitment to any particular timetable shouldbe given to the Canadians at this stage.    He considered that theGovernment&apos;s tactics should be to treat the Bill in the normal way,and to give both Houses adequate time for consideration;  it might bedesirable frOm this point of view to allow two days for Second Readingin the House of Commons.    It should be made clear to the Canadiansthat the Government could not commit themselves to a particular datefor Royal Assent, and that any public statements suggesting that agiven deadline, such as the date for The Queen&apos;s proposed visit toCanada, had to be met would be counter-productive.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the proposed legislation on the CanadianConstitution should be handled in the way recommended by theLord President of the Council.    They noted that the early day motionin the name of Sir Bernard Braine against the Federal Government&apos;sproposals was attracting some suppoit, and that there was still adanger that the Labour Party might be tempted to use the Bill toobstruct other Government business.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.Special THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said thatStanding Mr Christopher Price, MP, had put down a Question for writtenCommittees answer on Friday 4 December asking whether he intended to makeprovision for the continuation of the Special Standing Committeeprocedure in the current Session.    The subject was also likely to beraised during Questions on the business statement that afternoon.He intended to say that it was not his present intention to reintroducethe Standing Order relating to Special Standing Committees,mainly because none of the Bills in the Government&apos;s legislativeprogramme was really suitable for this procedure, but that he wouldbe ready to consider doing so if appropriate Bills could be identifiedat any time in the future.The Cabinet -3.       Endorsed the line  n the future of SpecialStanding Committees proposed by the Lord presidentof the Council.2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALoreignjamreviouaeference:C(8l) 29th(inclusions,;inute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Ministerial Meeting of the North Atlantic Council thefollowing week would be asked to approve Spain&apos;s accession to theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.    This would be very welcome tomost members of the Alliance, including Britain, but it remainedpossible that difficulties might be made by the new Greek Governmentunder Mr Papandreou, who was clearly not going to be an easy partnerin this or other fields.    Meanwhile the Spanish Government appearedto be making the necessary physical preparations for the reopeningof their frontier with Gibraltar and might well wish to make anannouncement on the subject before the Spanish Prime Minister&apos;splanned visit toi Britain in January 1982,    This was satisfactory,although the Gibraltarians themselves might in practice have mixedfeelings when the frontier did reopen.rab/Israelreviouseference:C(81) 38th(inclusions,!in te 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theUnited States and Israeli Governments were on the point of issuing ajoint statement about the basis for the establishment and compositionof the proposed multinational force and observers in Sinai. Britainand the three other European Community members who had agreed toparticipate would so far as possible refrain from comment. Inretrospect it was perhaps fortunate that the recent Arab Summit atFez had collapsed, since it would otherwise have been likely to passa resolution condemning those who participated in the Sinai force.JigolaTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theSouth African Government were b lieved to be respanaibie fortharecent sabotaging of the Angolan oil refinery in Luanda, althoughcredit for the attack had been claimed by the Angolan guerilla move-ment Unita.    At a time when progress had been being made towardssecuring the withdrawal of Cuban forces from Angola it was foolishof the South Africans to have taken a step which was bound to renewthe Angolan regime&apos;s sense of dependence on the support of the SovietUnion and its allies.    The Angolan Government&apos;s suspicions wouldhave been increased by the current visits to Washington ofPresident Mobutu of Zaire, whom they regarded as an enemy, andthe Unita leader Mr Savimbi, who was expected to be received by asenior official in the American State Department.he Seychelles&apos;reviousReference:;C(81) 38thinclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theunsuccessful coup d&apos;etat recently attempted in the Seychelles hadprovoked strong international criticism of South Africa and to alesser extent the United States.    There was a danger, which Britishinfluence would seek to counter, that the Seychelles Governmentwould now move towards even closer relations with the Soviet Union.One of the mercenaries captured in the Seychelles was a BritishCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALnational;  consular access was being sought but had not yet beenobtained.    It was unlikely that the South African authorities hadinspired the coup, which had actually been mounted from Swaziland,but they must have known about it.    A difficult situation had sincebeen caused by their action1 over the mercenaries who had escapedfrom the Seychelles to South Africa in a hijacked airliner and hadsurrendered to the South African police.    All but five of these hadbeen set at liberty, and even the five had been granted bail. TheBonn Declaration by the Heads of Government of the seven leadingWestern nations at their Economic Summit meeting in 1978 requiredthe seven to take retaliatory action against any state which failed toextradite or prosecute hijackers.    They would now have to considerjointly what attitude to adopt in the present case;  Britain would nottake the lead in these consultations and would seek to dissuade herpartners from precipitate action.iporting Linksnth South Africa3reviousleference:X(81) 11thonclusions,minute 2COMMUNITYUTFAIRS16-27 NovemberEuropeanCouncilreviousReference:-C(81) 38thConclusions,Minute 3THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that the WelshRugby Union had met the previous day to decide whether to acceptan invitation to tour South Africa.    It had been made clear to themin advance that the Government hoped they would refuse. Theirconclusion was not yet known.The Cabinet -Took note.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the European Council on26-27 November had not succeeded in reaching agreement on theissues covered by the Mandate of 30 May 1980.    When that Mandatehad been agreed it had seemed likely that, by now, the Communitywould be under pressure to agree to a fundamental restructuring ofthe budget because the Community&apos;s existing resources within the1 per cent VAT ceiling would have been exhausted.    Because of therise in world agricultural prices, this had not happened, althoughthe need for budget restructuring on grounds of equity remained.The changes in the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) now beingsought were likely to add substantially to the cost of agriculture tothe Community Budget,    The Greeks, Italians and French wantedincreased support for Mediterranean products.    This pressurewould increase with the accession of Spain to the Community.    At thesame time, the French were seeking changes in the CAP which wouldfavour small producers at the expense of efficient farming. Theseagricultural issues had been the subject of detailed discussion at theEuropean Council but agreement had not been reached.    She hadinsisted that parallel progress must be made on all three aspects of4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthe Mandate.    It had been d ecided to ask the Foreign Ministers tomeet again to consider the main outstanding issues.    It seemed\uilikely that any progress could be made on the budget issue untilthe Community was approaching a crisis and needed agreement onagricultural prices.    It would be desirable to try to avoid horsetrading on a package but this might not be possible.    The budgetaryarrangements for the United Kingdom for 1982 had still to be agreed.It would be most undesirable to have the dispute running into 1983.The European Council had also referred to Foreign Ministers forfurther study the proposals by the German and Italian Governmentsfor a European Act which would set up further Councils of Ministersresponsible for Justi.de and for cultural affairs}  involve morediscussion within the Community on security matters; and increaseconsultation with the European Parliament!Special Meetingif Foreign Affairsministers on10 May 1980MandateTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theGovernment were committed to call a special meeting of the ForeignMinisters on the Mandate before the end of the British Presidency.He  as discussing with the Prime Minister and other colleaguesimmediately involved how best to handle such a meeting.    A crisisover the budget issue might be unavoidable, but it would inevitablylead to further damage to the public conception of the Community inBritain and everything possible should be done to prevent it.In a brief discussion, it was noted that some member states werechallenging the outcome of the 30 May 1980 arrangement which wouldin practice result in the United Kingdom&apos;s net contribution beingsubstantially lower than had been foreseen at the time.    This resultwas entirely the fault of the rest of the Community, who had insistedthat there should not be an absolute limit on our net contribution.The outcome was nevertheless not helpful to the United Kingdom ingetting a satisfactory arrangement for the future.    Moreover, thecircumstances which had produced this unexpected result wereunlikely to continue.JO December formal MeetingI* IndustryiMinistersTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that there wouldbe an informal meeting of Community Ministers responsible forindustrial matters on 10 December.    His aim would be to ensurethat the Commission rigorously implemented the agreement onlimitation of state aids in the steel sector; but this would be difficultgiven the political situation in Belgium.THE HOME SECRETARY reported that Ministers in the Communityresponsible for public security would be meeting on 8 December.The Cabinet -Took note.CONFIDENTIAL

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDsaid that the situation in the Province was now a good deal calmer,after a very difficult period in November.    The Chief Constableintended to respond firmly but with minimum publicity to thechallenge posed by Dr Paisley&apos;s so-called &quot;third force&quot; of Protestantvolunteers, who appeared to be less numerous than their frequentmarches might suggest and were beginning to be regarded by thepublic as something of a joke.    Meanwhile operations against theProvisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA) had been much assistedby recent acquisitions of intelligence.    Arms caches had beenuncovered both in Northern Ireland and in the Irish Republic, andarrests in a number of murder cases had been facilitated. Theactivites of the PIRA had been considerably diminished in consequence,These successes were not the result of the temporary increase insecurity force deployments to deal with the recent period of specialtension; but public opinion in the Protestant community would not beeasily convinced of that.The CabinetTook note.Cabinet Office3 December 1981CONFIDENTIAL
