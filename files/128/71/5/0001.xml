This mightencourage a backbench Member to move for a writ for Fermanagh andSouth Tyrone as well.    If that happened, he would himself move aGovernment amendment to the Fermanagh motion proposing that thedebate should be adjourned for a month so as to allow time for theRepresentation of the People Bill to complete its passage through bothHouses and receive Royal Assent.    The Chief Whip was makingappropriate arrangements to ensure if necessary that an amendmentin this sense could be carried.The Cabinet -Took note.oreignffairsraneer eviou seference:tC(81) 21stConclusions,&quot;inute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatPresident Mitterrand&apos;s decision to appoint four Communists asMinisters in the new French Government was a subtle move in relationto French domestic politics, but was causing some concern to theUnited States Government.    It could also encourage the aspirationsof the Italian Communists.    From a British point of view theappointment of French Communist Ministers might create someproblems, but our public line was that the British Government wouldcontinue to co-operate with the French Government as before, althoughsome practical questions could need to be discussed.fghanistanPr eviou seference:CC(81) 24thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theForeign Affairs Council on 22-23 June had agreed to the new Britishinitiative on Afghanistan.    It was their hope that the European Councilwould agree to its proposed terms at their meeting on 29 June, so thatan immediate announcement could then be made.    There had beenleaks about the proposals in Bonn and Paris, but the BritishAmbassador in Moscow had already told the Soviet Union about theinitiative   which seemed likely to be generally well received by othercountries although the Indian attitude was equivocal.    Even if theinitiative did not succeed, it would be valuable in presentational terms.1CONFIDENTIAL

This resolution was very moderate from an Arab point ofview, though the stance adopted by the United States in relation to itrepresented an unusually critical attitude on their part of the Israeliaction.

The President of the Commission (Monsieur Thorn) would beseeing the Prime Minister and himself on 26 June in preparation forthe forthcoming meeting of the European Council.    Earlier in theweek it had been agreed that the Commission&apos;s report would beexamined by the Committee of Permanent Representatives (Coreper)in July in order to pinpoint the areas for substantive discussion andput in hand a programme of work with a view to the matter coming tothe Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) in September.In a brief discussion it was noted  .hat the Commission&apos;s report washelpful to us in recognising the United Kingdom&apos;s budgetary problembut it took no account of the difficulties of the Federal Republic ofGermany.    The President of the Commission had made a proceduralproposal which did not show sufficient sense of urgency.tirade with Japanprevious Reference:ICC (81) 20th Conclusions,|Minute 2THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOP. TRADE said that discussions atthe recent meeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) hadrevealed a general wish to maintain pressure on the JapaneseGovernment over trading relations between Japan and the EuropeanCommunity.    While there seemed little immediate prospect ofsubstituting Community arrangements for the existing nationalrestrictions or. imports from Japan, the Commission was anxious tomaintain a Community dimension in trade relations with Japan, andhad proposed some strengthening of its representation in Tokyo. Theforthcoming Economic Summit meeting in Ottawa would be an occasionto speak firmly to the Japanese.CONFIDENTIAL

In general, theFederal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands and Denmark wanted aliberal regime to succeed the present MFA, whereas France wadtaking a hard line based on the need to protect the future of theEuropean textile industries.    The United Kingdom was seeking toensure that the future rates of growth of imports were related to thedevelopment of consumption.3oot and ShoeidustryIn a brief discussion, concern was expressed about the currentdifficulties of the domestic boot and shoe industry.    Imports wereregulated by certain bilateral agreements but on a voluntary basis.It was not easy to prove unfair competition from countries like Brazil.SheepmeatClawback:eviousleference;;C(81) 24thConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that noagreement had yet been reached on improvement in the arrangementsfor the clawback of premium payments on exports of lamb from theUnited Kingdom.    Although this was a relatively minor problem, theCommission had behaved badly: they had failed to take effective actionwithin their own powers and were proposing that the matter should bediscussed further in the Courcil of Ministers (Agriculture). Itappeared, however, that the Dutch Presidency shared tne Britishview that this was not a matter for the Council and that theCommission should take its responsibilities.The Cabinet -Took note.NORTHERNIELANDAFFAIRSdeviousReference:?C(81) 20thprolusions,&apos;inute 34. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland (C(81) 36) proposing the eventualestablishment of an independent Committee to advise on the long-termproblems of Northern Ireland prisons, and the announcement of aproposal to establish an Advisory Council for Northern Ireland.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatthere was a political impasse in Northern Ireland in which publicattention was focussed on the hunger strikes organised by theProvisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA), whose demands amountingto a claim for &quot;political status&quot;, had been firmly resisted, despitethe death of four hunger strikers.    Seven more prisoners were nowCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALrefusing food, and the first to do so was likely to die early in July,with further deaths at weeklv intervals thereafter.    The Defence andOversea Policy Committee had concluded that there would be anadvantage in establishing an independent Committee to advise on thespecial problems which would arise from the transfer in 1982 of theremaining 515 &quot;special category&quot; prisoners from their presentcompounds to a new cellular prison.    He had considered this matterfurther in consultation with the Home Secretary; they agreed that, ifthe Government were shortly to announce the establishment of aCommittee on this basis, they would be accused either of taking actionirrelevant to the immediate problems or of showing signs of yieldingto the demands of the hunger strikers.    He therefore recommendedthat he should continue to prepare for the establishment of a Committeeto examine the longer-term problems, but should defer any announce-ment until a more opportune moment, perhaps in the autumn. Hewould, however, seek an early opportunity of restating in public, andin detail, the conditions now prevailing in Northern Ireland prisonsand available to conforming prisoners, and the Government&apos;s commit-ment to the maintenance and where possible improvement of ahumanitarian prison regime.    The absence of an initiative on prisonswould make it all the more important to take an initiative in thepolitical field.    The Government&apos;s White Paper (Cmnd 7950) hadenvisaged that, if it did not prove possible to devolve executive orlegislative powers to Northern Ireland on a basis acceptable to bothparts of the Community, a more gradual approach might be adopted,under which a representative body would be set up which did notpossess such powers at the outset, but might have the possibility ofacquiring them later.    This was vhe approach he now advocated,since an Advisory Council of this kind could be established without theneed for legislation.    A properly balanced representation of the twocommunities in the Advisory Council cculd be achieved if the NorthernIreland political parties were incited to nominate representatives, inproportion to the number of seats obtained in the recent DistrictCouncil elections, from those elected to Parliament, the EuropeanParliament, and the District Councils themselves.    He proposed toannounce this measure during the debate on the renewal of theGovernment&apos;s powers in Northern Ireland, which was due to takeplace on 2 July.    Northern Ireland politicians might well acquiesce,and nominate representatives to the Advisory Council, if it were clearthat the Government were determined to go ahead.    His aim would beto complete the detailed arrangements in time for their announcementin the debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech in the autumn.In discussion the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland&apos;s proposalswere geneially welcomed, as going to the limit of what was practicablein present circumstances.    How they were presented would be veryimportant.4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe following were among the main points made in discussion:-a. International opinion, especially in the Republicof Ireland and the United States of America, wasincreasingly concerned about the situation in the Mazeprison.    It would be important to explain the reasoningbehind the Government&apos;s approach, bearing in mind that,whichever party in the Republic formed the new Government,farther early elections could be expected.    The Secretaryof State for Northern Irel?.nd&apos;s plans to make an earlydetailed statement of the Government&apos;s policy in relationto Northern Ireland prisons, emphasis?ng their excellentconditions and the conciliatory steps already taken, couldalso make a valuable contribution to improving theinternational climate of opinion.    At present the PIRAwere receiving increased support through Noraid in theUnited States, where the image of the PIRA as aterrorist movement was becoming blurred.b. Care should be taken in defining the range ofmatters on which the proposed Advisory Council shouldhave powers to offer advice: if such powers went beyondthe range of competence of local authorities, therecould be a revival of pressures for greater autonomy inScotland, particularly since Northern Ireland wouldshortly be as well represented in Westminster as anyother part of the United Kingdom.    This problemwould be compounded if the proposed Council succeeded,however unlikely this now appeared, in reaching agreementon a basis for devolution of executive and legislativepowers to the Province.c. It was suggested that the Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland might advantageously reserve afreedom to nominate to the Council people not associatedwith any political party.    Against that it was pointedout that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland wasalready advised by a number of specialised advisorybodies whose members he appointed; and it would beimportant presentutionally that the composition of theproposed new body should be seen to be determinedby the political parties themselves.d. The selection of a chairman for the new AdvisoryCouncil required careful consideration: if the choicewere left to the body itself, a heated argument could beexpected and whoever emerged would no doubt claim torepresent the collective will of the Province.    On theother hand if the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALor his nominee filled the post, he would provide adirect focus for all the resentments of the Province.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, saia that theCabinet agreed that it was necessary to make a further politicalinitiative in Northern Ireland, but at the same time not take any stepswhich might open the way to giving political or prisoner of war statusto members of the PIRA in prison.    The Secretary of State forNorthern Ireland would need expert advice or. certain longer-termproblems relating to Northern Ireland prisons, and preparations toset up a Committee for this purpose should continue, but no announce-ment on this point should be made during the forthcoming debate onthe renewal of the Government&apos;s powers in Northern Ireland. Anannouncement should be made of the proposal to establish an AdvisoryCouncil on the basis proposed by the Secretary of State for NorthernIreland.    It would be important to emphasise the experimental natureof the proposal and to avoid any commitment to the eventual extensionof the new body&apos;s powers.    Members of the Government should takeevery opportunity to put forward the Government&apos;s case, especiallyas regards the measures already taken to improve prison conditionsin Northern Ireland; and she would herself emphasise this in replyingto a recent message from the Taoiseach.    It would be valuable toexplain the Government&apos;s proposals to the Governments of the UnitedStates and of the Republic of Ireland before they were announcedpublicly.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Secretary State for Northern Ireland -i. to make a public restatement of the conditionsavailable tc conforming prisoners in NorthernIreland prisons and the Government&apos;s continuingcommitment to a humanitarian prison regime;ii. to announce his proposals as set out inC{81) 36, subject to consultation with the PrimeMinister on the terms in which the powers of thenew Advisory Council would be described;iii. to continue to prepare on a confidentialbasis for the establishment of an independentCommittee to advise on the problems arisingfrom the opportunity of transferring specialcategory prisoners to new cellular accommodation.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Foreign andCommonwealth Affair s, in consultation with the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland, to inform the Governmentsof the United States and the Republic of Ireland in confidenceof the Government&apos;s proposals, and of any statement whichthe Secretary of State for Northern Ireland made on theconditions and regime in Northern Ireland prisons.6CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALINTERNATIONAL       5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Foreign andCONFERENCE Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for theCENTRE Environment (C(8l) 34) and by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C(8l) 35) on the building and financing of an internationalprevious conference centre at Broad Sanctuary, Westminster.Reference:CC(80) 29til THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENTCone f recalled that, at their meeting on 17 July, 1980, a majority ofMinftte (jabinet had been in favour of building an internationalconference centre on the Broad Sanctuary site but that, in viewof the major objections seen to committing public expenditurefor this purpose, it had been agreed that the project should goahead only if it could be financed from the private sector. Hehad been invited to explore how this might be achieved and, withthe agreement of the Treasury, he had commissioned Healeyand Bake- to approach major financing institutions and publiclyto invite offers.    They had now strongly recommended acceptanceof the offer made by the Pearl Assurance Company.    The mainfoatures were that Pearl would finance the   estimated totalcapital requirement of  54 million, lease the completed buildingto the Government, and charge rents subject, every five years,to reviews linked to rental movements of offices in the area:the details were summarised in the Annex to C(8l) 34. Becausethere would be insufficient demand from the private sector forall the conference facilities the Government needed, there wasno prospect of a private developer providing a building to let tothe Government when required.    While this was the best form ofprivate sector financing available, it was more expensive thandirect Government financing (although not, in his view, to theextent estimated by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in C(8l) 35),but that was an inevitable consequence cf the Cabinet&apos;s decisionto rule out public sector financing.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that itwas necessary for the Government to have facilities in Londonfor holding major international conferences of the Commonwealth,the European Community (EC), the North Atlantic TreatyOrganisation and Economic Summits;  in addition, provision hadto be made for a considerable number of smaller conferences(the total this year was about 600).    The present facilities inLancaster House ?.nd elsewhere were becoming increasinglyinadequate.    It would be short-sighted and uneconomical toprovide a succession of temporary facilities at considerable cost-for example the cost of temporary facilities for the UnitedKingdom&apos;s EC Presidency in 1987 alone might be about 14 million - even if suitable sites could be found.    The privatesector financing proposals now recommended were consistentwith the Cabinet&apos;s decision of July 1980, and he stronglyrecommended that they should be accepted, so that a permanentinternational conference centre on the Broad Sanctuary sitewould be available by 1987.7CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that herecommended that the Pearl Assurance Company&apos;s offer shouldbe rejected^    Although it might be the best available, it did notrepresent genuine private sector financing and so failed to meetthe requirement laid down by the Cabinet.    Genuine privatesector financing would involve the private sector not onlyfinancing the construction but also carrying the responsibilityand the risks of management.    The Secretary of State for theEnvironment&apos;s inquiries showed that no such arrangement wasattainable.    Under the proposed arrangements with the PearlAssurance Company the building would be tailor-made toGovernment requirements and would be used virtuallyexclusively by the Government.    The site and building wouldrevert to Crown ownership at the end of the 125 year lease,during which the rent would be indexed.    If the building weredelayed, or if its costs overran the maximum amount offered byPearl, the Government would have to find the extra money. Pearlcarried very little risk in  return for providing the capital. Ineffect the centre would simply be a Government project financedwith a mortgage from the private sector.    As such, it would beattacked as a sham and as a device for evading public expendi-ture controls.    The finance for the project was on termsconsiderably more expensive than if it were financed by publicsector borrowing;  the Cabinet had., however, judged that theproject was of insufficiently high priority to be financed by publicexpenditure.    If the centre went ahead it could well prevent, ormake more expensive, the financing of genuinely profitableschemes whether in the privrte or public sector.In discussion the following were the main points made:-a. The financing proposals would have been moreacceptable if they had provided for the private sector tobuild, finance and own a building with commercialoffices and, as a condition for sale of the site, aconference centre to be made available to theGovernment on favourable terms. Arrangementson these lines had made possible the building ofthe new Mermaid Theatre.    They were not, however,practicable on the Broad Sanctuary site wherelimitations of space and planning constraints ruled outa building large enough to accommodate both aconference centre and enough commercial office spaceto warrant that sort of financial arrangement.b. If the project were to go ahead, it might bebetter for the Government to finance it directly.This would be cheaper and more defensible than thearrangements put forward by Pearl, and would avoidthe risk that the nationalised industries and other8CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALpublic sector bodies would seize on the Pearlarrangements as a precedent for similar privatesector leasing arrangements for projects whichso far had been denied them.    On the other hand,it had been agreed that room could not be found fromwithin public expenditure programmes for theinternational conference centre.    The leasing arrange-ments novv proposed were no different from thoseapplying to 60 per cent ol the Government OfficeEstate.    The decision to finance the project asproposed by Pearl could well be welcomed asenabling capital investment to go ahead with privatesector involvement and money.    It would be a boostto the construction industry and a source of employment.c.       There was a risk that the Government would becriticised for approving a major capital investmentin the heart of London and for its own use at a timewhen other public sector investment was being helddown.    This criticism would be reinforced if therewere costly delays on the project which, whateverthe details of the financing, would be regarded aswithin the public sector.    On the other hand, itwas accepted that there was a need for a permanentinternational centre both to meet the foreseen demandfor conference facilities and to avoid the high coses ofproviding a series of temporary and inadequate arrange-ments.    The Broad Sanctuary site had been empty andan eyesore since the last war.    It was eminentlysuited for an international conference centre and shouldnow be used for that purpose.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet had decided not to take the capital costs ofconstructing the international conference centre on publicexpenditure.    The balance of views in the Cabinet was clearlyin favour of proceeding with the construction of the internationalconference centre on the Broad Sanctuary site on the basis ofthe proposals, put forward by the Secretary of State for theEnvironment and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,and of accepting the Pearl Assurance Company&apos;s offer.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that an international conference centreshould be built at Broad Sanctuary, Westminster.2. Authorised the Secretary of State for theEnvironment to accept the Pearl Assurance Company&apos;soffer, as summarised in C(81) 34, for the financingof this project.Cabinet Office2 5 June 1981 9CONFIDENTIAL
