CONFIDENTIALECONOMIC The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theSTRATEGY Exchequer (C^.1) 29) on th^ Economic Strategy.    They also hadbefore them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(81) 30)covering two further papers by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:a memorandum on the Economic Impact on North 3ea Oil and GasRevenues which had been prepared for the Ministerial Group onEnergy Prices (MISC 56), and a memorandum on pay in the comingyear which had been circulated for discussion by the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion is recorded separately.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed its broad general support for maintaining theGovernment&apos;s present economic policy, and in particular forgiving continuing priority to the reduction of inflation. Thesuccessful implementation of this policy was essential if theGovernment were to achieve its broader political aim of reducingthe role of the public sector and of creating a society in which theindividual, and private sector companies, had more responsibilityand more resources.    The Cabinet agreed that, within the frame-work of the economic policy, further consideration should be givento the options for reducing the level of unemployment, particularlyamong young people;  the Secretary of State for Employment wouldshortly be making recommendations  n this to the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy.      They further agreed that, tostimulate private sector investment and to help reduce unemploy-ment, it would be necessary to look further at the hindrances toemployment which had been identified in their discussion and by theChancellor of the Exchequer in C(81) 29;   she would arrange forfurther work to be undertaken on these issues.    The Secretary ofState for Employment would make recommendations in July to theMinisterial Committee on Economic Strategy following consultationson the Green Paper on Trade Union Immunities.    The Cabinet&apos;sdiscussion, in July and in the autumn, of the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey would provide the opportunity for furtherconsideration of the balance to re struck between the Government&apos;sobjectives for taxation and for public expenditure, and of thebalance, within the public expenditure programme, between capitaland current expenditure.    It would be necessary to look at theoptions for reductions in programmes which had hitherto beengenerally immune from cuts but which might have to be reduced inthe interest of achieving the objective of stimulating private sectoractivity and so helping to reduce unemployment.    The Cabinet hadrecognised that the achievement of acceptable pay settlements overthe next two years was crucial to the success of the economicstrategy.    She would arrange for the Central Policy Review Staffto consider the options for achieving the Government&apos;s payobjectives, in both the public and private sectors, what were thehindrances to the achievement of those objectives, and what changesmight have to be made.    There was general agreement that thisCONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALdiscussion of the Government&apos;s economic strategy had been * useful, and should be repeated.    She would arrange for afurther discussion in tho autumn.    In view of the interest takenby the Press in this meeting she would arrange for guidance tobe given to the effect that members of the Cabinet were pleasfldwith the outcome of the meeting, that they had confirmed theGovernment&apos;s broad general economic policies, but they wereconcerned about unemployment, and had under study policieson the employment particularly of young people, but regarded it asimportant above all, and for the fulfilment of all the Government&apos;political and economic objectives, to keep inflation coming down,and to shift responsibility and resources from the public sectorto the private sector from which alone   new jobs would come.The Cabinet -1.

CONFIDENTIALTHIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCOPY NO35CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION ANNEXCC(81) 23rd ConclusionsWednesday 17 June 1981 at 9. 30 am^ECONOMIC The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theiSTRATEGY Exchequer (C(81) 29) on the Economic Strategy.    They also hadbefore them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C(81) 30)covering two further papers by the Chancellor of the Exchequer: amemorandum on the Economic Impact of North Sea Oil and GasRevenues which had been prepared for the Ministerial Group onEnergy Prices (MISC 56), and a memorandum on pay in the comingyear which had been circulated for discussion by the MinisterialCommittee on Economic Strategy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his memorandum(C(81) 29) was intended to help the Cabinet to take stock of theGovernment&apos;s first two years of office and to identify the key issues tobe faced in the remainder of the present Parliament and in prepara-tion for the next.    The main objectives of the economic strategywere to continue to control and to reduce inflation, and in particularto reduce interest rates, and to restore a sustainable growth ofoutput, employment and living standards.    In the last year inflationhad been reduced from 22 to 12 per cent.    The recent fall in sterlingagainst the United States dollar, and recent increases in oil prices,would make it more difficult to maintain this progress in theimmediate future, and the timing of further progress in reducinginflation was uncertain;  there was no reason, however, to revisethe present forecast of 10 per cent inflation in the year ending in thefourth quarter of 1981.    Interest rates in the United Kingdom werenow substantially below those in the United States of America and inFrance, and lower than those of other major industrialised countriesgenerally,    Industrial production had now ceased to fall, though itwas uncertain how quickly it would increase.    If these improvementswere to be maintained, it was essential to avoid short term expedientswhich could incur the risk of a further increase in inflation. Therate of increase in unemployment was now slowing down, but herecognised the political and social importance of checking andreversing this increase.    It might be possible to make somecontribution to dealing with this by more effective use of expenditureon present employment and training measures.    There were,1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALhowever, no easy general solutions.    It had been estimated, forexample, that a  4 billion stimulus to the economy would reduceunemployment by only 100, COO, but such a measure would lead tosubstantial increases in inflation and in interest rates which would bedamaging to private sector industry and, in turn, to employmentprospects.    It might be possible to give more priority, withinexisting public expenditure totals, to capital investment offering agood economic return, if other expenditure were reduced; anyincrease in the overall public expenditure totals for this purpose would,however, have to be financed either by higher taxation or by increasedpublic sector borrowing leading to increases in interest rates. Hehad set out in paragraph 43 of C(81) 29 a number of suggestions forcha.nges which might stimulate a real growth of output.    First, itwas necessary to change the patterns of economic behaviour and, inparticular, to secure a sustained change in the attitudes of paybargainers, in the public and private sectors, leading to pay increasesbelow the expected rate of inflation in the coming year. Secondly,he had suggested measures for improving the supply side of theeconomy.    Thirdly, he had raised the question of the balance of theGovernment&apos;s fiscal policy, as between its taxation and publicexpenditure objectives.    On present spending plans the Governmentwould enter the Election with an overall tax burden much heavier thanthat inherited in 1979;  in his view, this was not tolerable eitherpolitically or economically.    The Government had already recognised,and said publicly in the Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 8175),that the present public expenditure programmes were higher than itwould wish in relation to financial and economic objectives. Theneed now was to reduce the public expenditure totals for the yearsahead below those in the White Paper.    Unless this was done it wouldbe very difficult to raise income tax thresholds or to respond to thepressure from private sector industry for reductions in the burdenson them;  it would not be practicable to secure again next year thebenefits from the 1981 Budget from higher taxes on oil and from taxeson the clearing banks.    He invited the Cabinet to take note of the needto maintain the Government&apos;s preuent general approach to tha economy;and to consider how best to promote the changes in patterns ofeconomic behaviour and in the worldng of the markets which wereessential to improving economic performance, and to adapt theGovernment&apos;s fiscal and other policies to contribute to thoseobjective s.In discussion the following were the main points made:-a.       The Public Expenditure White Paper (Cmnd 8175) hadassumed unemployment in the United Kingdom of 2. 8 millionin 1981-82 rising to 3.03 million in 1982-83 and remaining atthat level in 1983-84.    These figures were annual averages;the surge of school leavers would take the totals well over3 million in the late summer and early autumn of 1982 and 1983.The impact on particular groups would be greater than thetotals suggested:  with 3 million unemployed, two-thirds of2CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALthose aged under 18 could be without a normal job;  by 1983,around 800, 000 people could have been out of work for morethan a year;  many areas would have overall unemploymentrates of 20 per cent or more which, with a few recentexceptions, would be the worst figures in Great Britain sincethe last war;  and, within the totals, unemployment would tendto be concentrated on the unskilled and on ethnic minorities.It was possible that, with reasonable growth in output, therecould be a modest fall in unemployment, of perhaps a quartermillion, in the course of 1983;  but even that small fall couldbe wiped out by a faster growth in productivity - which in otherrespects was a highly welcome result of action taken by firmsin the present recession - or by further growth in the labourforce,    If the economic strategy were not to succeed, thefigures would be worse and there would be a continued rise inunemployment.b. The continuing rise in unemployment, particularlyamong young people, was deeply disturbing.    As was alreadyevident in some areas, it produced increasing social disorderand crime.    Although it was unrealistic to look for substantialreductions from the levels of unemployment projected for1983, it was essential, if the Government were to continue tocommand support for its policies, that by then the trendshould be reversed and unemployment should be seen to becoming down.    It might well be possible to make better useof existing resources by switching funds to new employmentand training measures and by making present schemes, suchas the Youth Opportunities Programme, more effective.There were, however, limits to what the Government coulddo to create jobs.    The Government&apos;s main role should be tocreate the conditions in which private sector industry couldprosper and provide jobs;  this would be achieved bycontinuing to bring down inflation and interest rates, and byrurther action to remove constraints on private sectorinitiatives.c. The prospective level of pay settlements was a majorthreat to the economic strategy.    In order to avoid a renewedsurge in prices and unemployment, the aim for the next roundof pay settlements in 1981-82 should be to see settlementsbelow the rate of inflation, perhaps in the range of 5 to 7 percent.    This might be achieved, but it would then be rerydifficult to continue, as was necessary if the strategy were tosucceed, with a third year of restraint during which settle-ments were below increases in the cost of living.    There waslittle doubt that the unions would exert strong pressure forhigher increases, particularly in the winter of 1982-83. Itwould be easier to deal with this problem, and with that ofunemployment, if within the broad overall economic strategysome measures could be taken to bring forward, or tostrengthen, growth in output.3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALd.       In the meantime, considerable further thought neededto be f-iven to how the Government should deal with payclaims in 1981-82.    The timing of these claimo, and theirinteraction on each other, should be analysed;  their relativeimportance, and the relative strength of the unions concerned,assessed;  and a strategy and tactics for handling the payround worked out.e.       It would be politically &quot;-ery difficult to withhold&quot;Rooker-Wise&quot; increases in personal tax thresholds in thenext 3udget.    It was, however, possible that, perhaps withthe exception of &quot;Rooker-Wise&quot; indexation of allowances,the public now attached more importance to stimulating privateinvestment than to cutting personal taxation;  already publicopinion was near the point of giving greater priority todealing with the problems of unemployment rather than toreducing taxation.    If private sector industry were to earnthe profits which were a pre-condition of a revival in invest-ment leading to reductions in unemployment, it was essentialto take steps to bring down the burden of taxation, includingthat of the rates and of National Insurance Contributions.f. While some sensible savings might be found, there wereconsiderable objections to looking for yet further majorsavings from those public expenditure programmes which hadalready been repeatedly and substantially cut.    Some savingson capital programmes, such as the housing programmes,could be made if necessary, but this would be highlydamaging to private sector activity,,    Some programmes hadalready been cut to such an extent that to look for further cutswas politically unrealistic:  measured as a percentage ofGross Domestic Product, the health and social serviceprogrammes in the United Kingdom were significantly smallerthan those in all other member countries in the EuropeanCommunity.    Although the Government would continue to putpressure on the local authorities to achieve savings, it wasunrealistic to assume that large savings, beyond those alreadyin prospect, could be achieved:  under present powers, it wasnot in the gift of the Ministers concerned to deliver them.g. If it were accepted that there was a limit to the savingswhich could be sought from programmes which had been cutpreviously, and if public expenditure in total were to bereduced to make room for reductions in taxation, it would benecessary to consider the options for cuts in areas which hadhitherto been regarded as sacrosanct.    Major reductions inthe Public Sector Borrowing Requirement could be achieved -far greater than anything in prospect from confining cuts tothe programmes which had been reduced so far - if increasesin benefits and in taxation thresholds were not indexed to4CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALincreases in the cost of living, and if increases in publicsector pay were similarly kept below the rate of inflation.It could be that peopL; would be willing to accept reductionsin their real earnings if they were persuaded that thesacrifice would lead to a revival of investment which wouldbenefit both those in work and also those at present unemployed.On the other hand, there would be considerable politicaldifficulties if benefits and thresholds were not to be indexedin full.    Ministers would need to consider the expenditureoptions further in their discussion of the 1981 PublicExpenditure Survey.h. In reviewing the overall public expenditure programme,the opportunity should be taken to re-order priorities to makeroom for some further public sector capital investmentwhere a convincing case could be made that an acceptablerate of return would be achieved.    Because of the closeconnection between the public and private sectors, suchprojects could be helpful in stimulating the revival of privatesector activity,    Subject to the further studies of methods offinancing which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had recentlycommissioned, it was possible that some projects   might befinanced by the private sector outside the Public SectorBorrowing Requirement.    There was also a case for consider-ing investment to enable productivity improvements innationalised industries which were currently performing badl^and which could not be de-nationalised in the foreseeablefuture.i. The recent and sharp movements in the dollar/ sterlingexchange rate, the reduction in real interest rates, and theunexpectedly high level of retail sales had not been assumedin the forecasts made at the time of the March 1981 Budget.They appeared to provide a substantial short term stimulusto the economy which was far greater than any stimulus whichMinisters might have brought about by deliberate action. Ifthese uncovenanted changes had come on top of reflationaryaction taken by the Government, the effect would have beeninflationary and damaging to interest rates;  this reinforcedthe case for declining to take any significant reflationarymeasures now.    On the other hand, the effects of these recentchanges were uncertain.    More of the United Kingdom&apos;s tradewas with Europe than with the United States of America;sterling had not weakened against the European currencies,and it could be that European currencies would weaken furtheragainst sterling so damaging the country&apos;s trading perform-ance with Europe.    There was a case for further work overthe next two or three months, during which the effects ofthese changes might become clearer, on what were the optionsfor some shading of priorities, within the present broadeconomic strategy but aimed at ensuring that it continued tohave public support.5CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALj.       It was essential to create the conditions for a revivalof profitability in the private sector which would in turn leadto higher investmen* and reductions in unemployment. Tothis end, it was essential to reduce inflation, interest rates,and the burden of taxation and of other costs on the privatesector.    The United Kingdom had not been as successful asother countries in stimulating its private sector and increating the conditions for a strong industrial base. Therewas now evidence that other European Community countrieswere increasing their investment aids, both to the benefit oftheir domestic industries and in order to attract inwardinvestment;  a notable recent example was the measurestakeri by the French Government to stimulate their foodindustry.    In view of such action by other Governmentg, itceuld be necessary to take measures to ensure that Britishfirms remained internationally competitive.k.       The reduction of inflation, and the revival of theeconomy, could be prejudiced if the unions were to resistnecessary changes and to press for pay settlements whichwould effectively price people out of jobs.    If this were tohappen, private sector industry would be denied the profitswhich were essential to investment.    This could be dealt within part by the continuing process of educating public opinion,and in part by further legislative changes in the light of theSecretary of State for Employment&apos;s proposals followingconsultations oa the Green Paper on Trade Union Immunities.It would be particularly important to curb excessive unionpower in industries., in both the private and public sectors,of key importunce in the economy.1.       Further measures should be taken to reduce hindrancesand impediments to employment.    The difficulties and costsof dismissing workers should be reduced:  otherwise firms,and particularly small firms, would be reluctant to take onnew workers as the economy revived.    There were signs thatthe new Enterprise Zones were not working as well as theyshould, because of hindrances and delays imposed bybureaucratic procedures.    Some local authorities, inoperating their planning requirements, appeared to givegreater priority to preserving amenities than to helping smallbusinesses and employment.m.     There had been keen Press and public interest in thismeeting of the Cabinet.    The discussion had demonstratedthat there continued to be general support in the Cabinet forthe thrust of the Government&apos;s economic strategy.    It wasthe more important that, in any guidance given to the Press,the fact that there was this general support should beemphasised:  the guidance should give no credence to the myththat there had been a clash between opposing views of thestrategy, with one view prevailing over the other.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE  PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed its broad general support for maintaining theGovernment&apos;s present economic policy, and in particular for givingcontinuing priority to the reduction of inflation.    The successfulimplementation of this policy was essential if the Government wereto achieve its broader political aim of reducing the role of the publicsector and of creating a sdciety in which the individual, and privatesector companies, had more responsibility and more resoui ces,The Cabinet agreed tLat, within the framework of the economicpolicy, further consideration should be given to the options forreducing the level of unemployment, particularly among youngpeople;  the Secretary of State for Employment would shortly bemaking recommendations on this to the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy.    They further agreed that, to Jtimulate privatesector investment and to help reduce unemployment, it would benecessary to look further at the hindrances to employment whichhad been identified in their discu3sion and by the Chancellor of theExchequer in C(8J) 29;   she would arrange for further work to beundertaken on these issues.

In view of the interest taken by the Pressin this meeting she would arrange for guidance to be given to theeffect that, members of the Cabinet were pleased with the outcome ofthe meeting, that they had confirmed the Government&apos;s broad generaleconomic policies, that they were concerned about unemployment,and had under study policies on the employment particularly of youngpeople, but regarded it as important above all, and for the fulfilmentof all the Government&apos;s political and economic objectives, to keepinflation coming down, and to shift responsibility and resources fromthe public sector to the private sector from which alone new jobswould come.7CONFIDENTIAL
