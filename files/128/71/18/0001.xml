CONFIDENTIALUAMENTARY&apos;AIRS1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.jislativeIrammeriousirence:11) 32ndelusions,ate 5THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that for reasonslargely beyond the Government&apos;s control the Coal Industry Bill, theLocal Government Finance Bill, and the expected Canada Bill wouldnow be introduced considerably later than had been envisaged. Therewere now proposals for adding two more Bills, on National Insurancecontributions and Regional Development Grants, to the programme.Although this would still not make the total volume of legislationexcessive, the bunching of a number of major controversial Bills in theperiod immediately after the Christmas Recess would present difficultproblems of handling in both Houses.    In these circumstances, he couldnot guarantee that the dates for Royal Assent specified by thesponsoring Ministers could be met in every case.The Cabinet -Took note.REIGNFAIRS!v10u8erence:(81) 36th&apos;elusions,mte 32, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatit was not Clear what was the Libyans&apos; motive in withdrawing fromChad,  They might well hope that chaos would result and that they wouldthen be invited to return.    It was, therefore, welcome that theOrganisation for African Unity were pressing forward with their plans tosend in a peacekeeping force.    Requests for British help over logisticsupport for this operation had been received from both Kenya andNigeria; and though the Nigerian bid had been pitched unreasonably high,it was clear that an appropriate response would need to be provided.He was in consultation on this both with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,who had agreed that any underspend in current Foreign andCommonwealth Office Votes could be used to defray the cost involved,and with the Secretary of State for Defence.    But a problem would ariseif the Ministry of Defence felt obliged to raise charges on the basis offull rather than extra costs; this would reduce by about half the amountof assistance which could be provided for the money available.In the course of a brief discussion it was noted that the Government&apos;snormal accounting rules would require charges to be based on full costs;but that, since the Secretary of State for Defence was content to proceedon the basis of extra costs, the immediate problem should be capable ofspeedy resolution.    More generally, however, it was desirable that theaccounting practices involved in such cases should not operate in a waywhich made more difficult the achievement of policy objectives on whichMinisters were agreed.1CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALlit/Vest(lationseviousl[erence:;(81) 32ndfusions,Inute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theFederal Chancellor would no doubt be informing the Prime Minister andtheir Community colleagues later that day, in the margin of theEuropean Council&apos;s forthcoming session, about the outcome ofPresident Brezhnev&apos;s recent visit to Bonn.    Although no authoritativeaccount of this meeting had so far been obtained from the Germans, itseemed clear that the Federal Chancellor had adopted a robust attitudeand that President Brezhnev had, therefore, been denied the propagandaadvantage he had hoped to gain.    President Reagan&apos;s highly effectivespeech on arms control (to which the Prime Minister had referred atthe Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 19 November (CC(81) 37th Conclusions,Minute 2)) had been well timed in relation to the Bonn meeting, and thestage now seemed satisfactorily set for the arms control negotiations ontheatre nuclear weapons which were due to begin in Geneva on30 November.lab/Israel eviousiference;1(81) 37thInclusions,linvite 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Britainand three other European Community members had announced on23 November their participation in the proposed Sinai multinationalforce and observers.    They had at the same time made clear, withoutundue emphasis, that this represented no departure from the principlesof the Community&apos;s Venice Declaration of June 1980.    Because of thisthe Israeli Government were now threatening to veto the Europeans&apos;participation.    The Americans had arranged for the Israeli ForeignMinister, Mr Shamir, to visit Washington to discuss the matter; and itwas to be hoped that they would take a robust line with him, since therecould be no question of the Europeans resiling from the principles onwhich their policy towards the Arab/Israel problem had been based forthe past two years.    Meanwhile the Arabs had inflicted damage on theirown cause by rejecting at their Summit meeting in Fez the moderateproposals put forward by Saudi Arabia as a basis for an Arab/Israelsettlement.^Seychelles THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that duringthe past night an attempted coup d&apos;etat had been mounted in theSeychelles by a small mercenary force originating in South Africa.Some of the mercenaries appeared to be British nationals, although itwas not clear how many of these were based in South Africa. Thesituation remained obscure, but the coup appeared to be collapsing.Certain members of the mercenary force had seized an Air India air-liner at Mahe airport and forced it to fly to Durban, where they wereexpected to surrender to the South African police.    They might well bemore leniently treated there than those who surrendered to theauthorities in the Seychelles.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALThe CabinetTook note.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the European Council, underBritish Presidency, would start that afternoon and continue for as longas necessary the following day.    The prospects for reaching agreementon the three issues being dealt with under the Mandate of 30 May 1980 -the development of Community policies other than agriculture, thereform of the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the need for anequitable structure in the Community budget - were not good.    In spiteof several days&apos; discussion in the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs),and official contacts in Bonn and Paris, there remained substantialdifferences which it would be difficult to resolve at this meeting. Thediscussions on the CAP were highly technical and the differencesmarked.    As regards the budgetary problems, there was no prospect ofa detailed settlement, but the British aim was now to agree guidelineswhich would provide the basis for subsequent negotiation. Thediscussions on the Mandate were not made any easier by the fact thatthe Danish Government was facing a general election, and neither theBelgian nor Dutch Prime Minister was in a strong position.    The newGreek Prime Minister, Mr Papandreou, would wish to set out the viewsof his Government, which might well involve a renegotiation of theterms of Greek accession to the Community.    This would not be wellreceived by other member states.    It would be difficult to bring theCommunity to accept the major restructuring required until it was onthe brink of some crisis, such as the need to settle agricultural prices,There could then be a package deal.    Nevertheless, at the forthcomingmeeting she intended to push hard for a thorough discussion of the out-standing issues.    It would be damaging for the Community if the Headsof Government failed to reach any agreement.    The European Ceuncilwould also have its usual discussion on the economic situation, andwould hear from the Germans and the Italians about their plans forfurther progress towards European union.    These ideas, which includedthe creation of additional Councils, might create domestic politicaldifficulties and would be remitted to Foreign Ministers for study. TheEuropean Council would also be invited to state its support for theaccession of Spain and Portugal to the Community.    Outside theCouncil meeting itself, there would be important discussions aboutworld affairs.    As already noted, the Federal Chancellor would bereporting on his recent talks with President Brezhnev.    There wouldalso be discussions about the Middle East and about the further requestsfrom Poland for food and financial aid.    These matters would be likelyto feature largely in the public presentation of the outcome of theEuropean Council if, in spite of every effort, there was no progress onthe Mandate.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported that the Council ofMinisters (Budget) had succeeded, after a long meeting, in agreeing onthe 1981 and 1982 Community budgets, although there could still bedifficulties with the European Parliament over the 1982 budget. TheBritish Presidency had made special efforts to avoid conflict with theEuropean Parliament which had been appreciated.    The German andFrench representatives at the Budget Council had made unwelcomereferences to the level of refunds paid to the United Kingdom under theAgreement of 30 May 1980.    Their position would make it more difficultto secure a satisfactory solution for 1982 if no agreement could bereached in time on a long-term arrangement.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reportedthat, owing to the Danish elections, the next meeting of the Council ofMinisters (Fisheries) had been postponed to 14 December;  but it was notcercain that, even then, there would be an effective Danish Government.The Cabinet -Took note.IRTHERNELANDFAIRSeviousference::(81) 37 thdelusions,nute 44. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND saidthat the &quot;day of action&quot; organised by Mr Paisley and his supporters inNorthern Ireland on 23 November had passed off more quietly than hadbeen feared.    No serious incidents had occurred.    Under the ChiefConstable&apos;s leadership the police had handled the occasion well, notwith-standing rumours which had reached him beforehand that he could notrely on their loyalty in such circumstances.    The atmosphere was nowcalmer, although a good deal of underlying tension remained.Surprisingly, the Provisional Irish Republican Army had missed theopportunity to press their attacks at a time of particular vulnerability.There had been no further deaths from terrorist action.    The police hadsucceeded in frustrating a number of assassination plans, despite theconsiderable strain which such operations imposed on their manpowerresources.The CabinetTook note.CONFIDENTIAL

In his memorandum (C(8 1) 57) he had been able torecord that agreements had been reached on all programmes exceptfor regional development grants and defence, which were underseparate discussion, and housing and other environmental services,where the points at issue were set out in Annex B.    Taking accountof the position on regional development grants and defence on whichthe Chief Secretary, Treasury would be reporting, but ignoring anyadditions which might be made in respect of housing and otherenvironmental services, the public expenditure totals would be 114.8 billion for 1982-83,   120.3 billion for 1983-84 and 126. 0 billion for 1984-85.    He had drawn attention to somedifficult decisions which had been agreed in the expenditurediscussions but which the Cabinet would need to consider carefully.It had been necessary to strike a balance which took into accountboth the Government&apos;s public expenditure objectives and thepolitical constraints which affected many expenditure programmes.He wished to express gratitude to the Chief Secretary, Treasuryand to the other Ministers concerned for the understanding andco-operation which had made possible such a wide measure ofagreement.1SECRET
SECRET!jioaaliVelopment:3ntsTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that at the meeting ofthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy on 24 Novemberhe had been asked, together with the Secretary of State for Industryand other Ministers concerned, to reach agreement on ways ofreducing public expenditure on regional development grants (RDGs).It was proposed that a short Bill should be introduced as early aspossible in the current Session to enable the grants paid on verylarge projects to be tapered.    After allowance for some increasedexpenditure on selective assistance for particularly important inter-nationally mobile projects, the aim was to achieve net savings ofsome  50 million in 1983-84 and 1984-85.    It was unlikely that thelegislation would yield significant savings in 1982-83 but it wasestimated that RDG expenditure in that year might be  30 millionless than it otherwise would be;  if it became apparent that expendi-ture was likely to exceed this estimate, he would need to review theposition with the Secretary of State for Industry.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that legislation should be introducedin the current session of Parliament to permit thetapering of regional development grants on very largeprojects, and that the aim should be to achieve savingsin regional development grant expenditure of 30 million in 1982-83 and  50 million a year in1983-84 and 1984-85.jfencereviousiference:3(81) 24thInclusions,|nute 4THE CHI EF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the Cabinet hadagreed that there should be a realistic translation of the defenceprogramme from volume to cash terms.    The Secretary of Statefor Defence had however found difficulty in doing this with thegeneral expenditure planning factors in the current year 1981-82and in the three subsequent years.    He had therefore agreed withthe Secretary of State that there should be an addition to the cashlimit for 1981-82 of  300 million and that the planned expenditurefigure for 1982-83 should be increased by  375 million;  it was alsoexpected that agreement would be reached on figures for the twolater years.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the increasesproposed for 1981-82 and for 1982-83 were acceptable;  and that itshould be possible to reach agreement on figures for 1983-84 and1984-8 5 which were consistent with the Defence White Faper(Cmnd 8288) and the Government&apos;s commitments.   He would inJanuary seek the agreement of his colleagues for the measuresnecessary to enable defence expenditure to be kept within the agreedfigures.    In doing so he would seek to minimise the effect onindustry and employment but he feared that the industrial and politicalSECRET
SECRETconsequences might be serious.    He had proposed, and theTreasury had agreed, that there should be an urgent joint reviewby the Treasury and the Ministry of Defence, with the assistanceof a suitable external adviser, of the methodology of calculatingmovements in defence prices, and of arrangements which wouldenable defence expenditure to be kept within cash limits withoutdamaging effects on industry.    He was not seeking any provisionto cover the relative price effect for 1982-83, nor any specialmid-year review in that year;  but, if it turned out that defenceprices rose faster than other prices he would want to take thematter up with the Treasury on the same basis as any other Minister.The Cabinet -2. Agreed that the defence cash limit for 1981-82should be increased by  300 million, that the plannedexpenditure total for 1982-83 should be increased by 375 million, and that the totals for 1983-84 and 1984-8 5should be increased by amounts to be agreed between theChief Secretary, Treasury and the Secretary of State forDefence.3. Took note of the points made by the Secretary ofState for Defence.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCEsaid that he had agreed with the Chief Secretary, Treasury theproposal set out in paragraph 4a of C(81) 57 that student grants andthe scale of parental contributions should be frozen at their presentcash level in 1982-83 and 1983-84.    This would be unpopular withstudents but could be justified on the grounds that many other sectorsof the community were suffering cuts in real income.In discussion it was argued that a complete freeze on student grantlevels until April 1984 was excessively harsh and would be difficultto defend politically. It would be preferable to increase the grantin 1982-83 by 4 per cent, which was equivalent to the pay assumptionadopted for public expenditure in that year. It was unnecessary totake a decision now on what the level of grant should be in 1983-84.The scale of parental contribution should however be frozen, asproposed.The Cabinet -4. Agreed that in 1982-83 student grants should beincreased by 4 per cent, that the level of grants in 198 3-84would be settled later, and that the minimum maintenanceaward and the scale of parental contributions should befrozen at their present cash level.3SECRET
SECRETTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVIC ES said that itwas proposed that prescription charges should rise in April 1982from  1 to  1.30;  the present arrangements for exemptions andfor a  20 &apos;season ticket&apos; for prescriptions would stand. Herecommended that the maximum charge for dentures and dentalcrowns should be  90 rather than  100 as proposed in C(81) 57,but this would not affect the estimated yield from the proposedincreases in charges for dental treatment and for spectacle lenses.He would put forward in the near future detailed proposals, inconsultation with the Secretaries of State for Trade and forTransport and other Ministers concerned, for a scheme to chargemotor vehicle insurers the cost to the National Health Service (NHS)of treating casualties in road traffic accidents;  it would be designedto avoid the problem of &apos;no fault liability&apos;.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury had now said that the legislative provisions for this couldbe included in the Finance Bill.    If these proposals were acceptable,they would lead to savings of  -6-.million in 1982-83,  93 million in1983-84 and  101 million in 1984-85.      Until his detailed proposalshad been discussed and approved there should be no announcement ofthe scheme;   the savings of  6 million in 1982-83 should not beincluded in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s statement on publicexpenditure in that year;  and the savings for the two later yearsshould be credited provisionally, and on the understanding that nofigures which included these savings would be published unless anduntil detailed proposals had been approved and that if the scheme didnot go ahead the amounts in question would be restored to the healthprogramme.    He agreed that there should be no extra provision inthe health programme to permit certain groups of NHS staff toreceive pay increases of more than 4 per cent in the next pay round;he might, however, need to ueopen this question in the light ofnegotiations on the settlement.The Cabinet -5. Approved the proposals for health charges setout in paragraph 4d. of C(81) 57, subject to the maximumcharge for dentures and dental crowns being  90.6. Agreed in principle to the Secretary of State forSocial Services&apos; proposals for charging for road trafficaccidents and invited him, in consultation with the otherMinisters concerned, to put forward detailed proposalsfor consideration in the near future.7. Pending further consideration of proposals forcharging for road traffic accidents, agreed that no savingson this account should be announced in the statement onpublic expenditure in 1982-83 and that the savings on thelater years should be credited provisionally on the under-standing that no figures which included these savings4SECRET
SECRETshould be pablished unless and until detailed proposalshad been approved and that the savings would bereinstated in the health programme if it were to proveimpracticable to implement the scheme.8. Took note that no additional provision forNational Health Service pay beyond increases of4 per cent in 1982-83 would be made in the healthprogramme.cial Security THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthe Government were committed by the 1979 Election Manifesto tophase out during this Parliament the earnings rule for pensioners.To achieve savings of  28 million in 1983-84 and of  95 million in1984-8 5 he recommended that the earnings rule should not bephased out until 1984.    At present rates of unemployment this wasunlikely to be contentious.    There would be no abatement in theNovember 1982 uprating of benefits,, and that should be made clearat the time of the Government&apos;s statement on public expenditure in1982-83.    The shortfall, by comparison with increases in theRetail Price Index, in the uprating of unpledged benefits inNovember 1981 would not be made good in the November 1982 upratingthere was, however, no need to announce that before the 1982Budget.The Cabinet -9. Agreed that the earnings rule for pensionersshould not be phased out until 1984.10. Took note, with approval, of the Secretary ofState for Social Services&apos;  proposals relating to socialsecurity benefits.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that, as noted inparagraph 4c of C(8l) 57, it had been proposed that from November1982 16 year olds should no longer be permitted to draw supplement-ary benefit.    He had subsequently agreed with the Secretary of Statefor Employment that this change should not take place untilSeptember 1983, as envisaged by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy at their meeting on 2 November.    It would thenbe possible to defend the withdrawal of benefit as helping to pay forthe comprehensive youth training scheme which would be introducedat the same time.    The Secretary of State for Employment hadagreed to find savings from his programme which would more thanoffset those savings which, as a result of this decision, would notnow be made on the social security programme.5SECRET
SECRETThe Cabinet -11. Agreed that supplementary benefit for16 year olds should be withdrawn from September 198 3.12. Took note that the Secretary of State forEmployment would find offsetting savings from hisprogramme, as indicated by the Chief Secretary,Treasury.NationalInsuranceContributionsTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as proposed inhis minute of 25 November to the Prime Minister, he and theSecretary of State for Social Services recommended an increase inthe employee&apos;s National Insurance Contribution (NIC) rate by1 percentage point to 8. 75 per cent;  an increase from  200 to 220 in the upper earnings limit, the maximum amount of weekly payon which the NIC and National Insurance Surcharge (NIS) werelevied;  and a reduction of 1^ per cent in the supplement which theTreasury paid into the National Insurance Fund.    These changeswould enable the Redundancy Fund to stay within its statutoryborrowing limit;  allow an increase of 0. 1 per cent in the contribu-tion to the National Health Service;  prevent the National InsuranceFund from going into deficit in 1982-83;  and provide a net benefitof  250 million for the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement. Hehad already decided that he could not announce a reduction in NISfrom April 1982.    Private sector employers were likely to have topay an extra  670 million in 1982-83 compared with 1981-82 becauseof the rise in earnings and in the upper earnings limit.    It was forthis reason that he proposed that as much as possible of theadditional fund income should come from employees rather thanemployers.    To give effect to these changes the Secretary of Statefor Social Services would need to introduce a Bill next week, whenthe statement on the public expenditure in 1982-83 would be made.The Bill would need Second Reading by about 14 December, so thatFirst Reading in the House of Lords could be before Christmas, andRoyal Assent by the end of January.    To ensure its swift passageand to avoid the risk of amendments, he reluctantly could not agreewith the Secretary of State for Industry&apos;s proposal that the Bill shouldinclude a new power to enable changes in the NIS to be made by order.He would be willing to consider further whether this change could bemade in other legislation.The Cabinet -13.       Approved the proposals of the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and of the Secretary of State for SocialServices for legislation on National InsuranceContributions.6SECRET
SECRETproperty|ervice sIgencyThe Cabinet -14.       Took note, with approval, of the proposalsin paragraph 4g. of C(81) 57 for reductions of 20 million a year in planned expenditure by theProperty Services Agency.3therEnvironmentalServicesTHE HOME SECRETARY said that MISC 62 had recommendedreductions in the Department of the Environment&apos;s programme forother environmental services of  110 million in 1982-83 and of 150 million in each of the two following years.    These cuts wouldbe in capital expenditure by the Regional Water Authorities and incapital expenditure by local authorities on environmental serviceswithin this programme.    Capital cuts of this kind were regrettablebut they could be easily achieved and would involve neither legisla-tion nor the breaking of public commitments.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  THIS. ENVIRONMENT said thatsuch cuts in public sector investment would have an immediate andundesirable impact on the construction industry.    Investment by thewater industry and by local authorities had been drastically cutalready over the past few years.    He would, nevertheless, bewilling to accept cuts totalling  80 million in 1982-83 and  100million in each of the two following years.THE PRLW&amp;&apos; MINISTER , summing up thi s part of the discussion,said that while the Cabinet recognised that the proposed cuts werenot desirable they agreed that they should be made to the full extentrecommended by MISC 62 in the interests of the Government&apos;sobjectives for limiting public expenditure overall.The Cabinet -15.       Agreed that the Department of the Environment&apos;sprogramme for other environmental services should bereduced by  110 million in 1982-83 and by  150 millionin each of 1983-84 and 1984-85.lousingTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR  THE  ENVIRONMENT saidthat the provision in the Public Expenditure White Paper(Cmnd 8175) for housing in England in 1982-83 was  3,869 million.Cabinet&apos;s provisional decision that council house rent increasesshould average  2. 50 in that year meant that if the 1981-82 volumeof capital expenditure were to be maintained, further provision of 225 million was necessary.    He further recommended that, forrealism and in line with the agreed approach to other local authoritySECRET
SECRETcurrent expenditure, additional provision of  67 million should bemade for the management and maintenance of housing stock;without this provision local authorities would probably have to put uprents or rates higher than otherwise.    He was, therefore, proposingtotal additional provision of  292 million, compared with the cut of 93 million recommended by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    In hisview, it was essential to provide for housing investment as he hadrecommended.    The housing programme had bofne 78 per cent ofthe cuts on capital made by the Government since the Election, andthe programme had fallen by 45 per cent in real terms between1979-80 and 1981-82.    These cuts had occurred at a time when thenet number of households in England was rising by 150, 000 a year,an increase that was expected to continue through the 1980s. Thecuts were particularly damaging to the home improvementprogramme and to provision of housing for the needy and the elderly.The construction industry had already suffered heavily fromreductions in public expenditure:  unemployment in the industry wasnow 25 per cent, much worse than in other sectors of the economy;without more work the indust ry would not be in a position to respondquickly to an upturn in the economy.    The problem would be easedif it were agreed that unspent capital receipts could be carriedforward from 1981-82 to finance housing and other capital investmentin 1982-83 without risk of breaking cash limits and so leading to theneed for a moratorium on investment, but the Chief Secretary,Treasury was unwilling to agree to this.    His proposals for thehousing programme, and for the Rate Support Grant settlement, wereon the assumption that surpluses on housing revenue account shouldnot be paid into the rate fund but should be used to repay hausing debtor to finance new capital expenditure;  in his view these arrangementscould best be secured by voluntary agreement with the authorities inquestion rather than by legislation.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY  s aid that there was no needto increase the present housing capital provision of  2, 030 millionin 1982-83 by  225 million.    Council house sales in the year werenow thought likely to be much higher than previously assumed andthis should give the local authorities further net income of the orderof  200 to  250 million which they could then use to finance capitalinvestment over the limit set by the Government.    He recommendedagainst additional provision of  67 million for management andmaintenance;  to allow this sum would be to endorse overspending bythe authorities.    He was willing to agree to the Secretary of Statefor the Environment&apos;s proposals for the treatment of housingsurpluses provided that it could be ensured that the authorities wouldindeed generate the same level of surpluses and use them as proposedhe considered that this would require legislation.8SECRET
SECRETTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the provision for housing capitalinvestment should not be increased, but that the local authoritiesshould be told that they should assume that  2 50 million additionalreceipts would be forthcoming in 1982-83 to enable them to financethat amount of additional investment in the year.    The Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury shouldagree on these arrangements and the form of the assurances to begiven to the local authorities;  broadly, the aim should be that to theextent that the net income from additional council house sales fellshort of  2 50 million, capital receipts should be carried forwardfrom 1981-82 to finance the balance.   The Cabinet agreed that thereshould be no additional provision for management and for maintenace;they noted the Secretary of State for the   Environment&apos;s view thatthis might lead to increases in rates.
