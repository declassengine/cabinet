CONFIDENTIALXIAMEN TAR YFAIRS1. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that arrange-ments had been made through:the usual channels to ensure as far aspossible that there would be no delay in proroguing Parliament thefollowing day oecause of obstruction of outstanding Government business.Itish Nationalityjviouserence:[81) 33rdelusions,1THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Lords amendment to the BritishNationality Bill making the exercise of his discretion in certainnationality cases open to challenge in the courts had been disagreed bythe Commons by a majority of 56.    Reinstatement of the amendmentin the Lords would create expensive administrative complications, butno fundamental issue of principle was involved.    It was to be hopedthat the Government could avoid defeat in the Lords on this matter.If, however, the Government were defeated he would accept the defeatrather than put the Bill as a whole at risk.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that everyeffort should be made to ensure that the Lords did not override theclearly expressed decision of the Commons on the amendment inquestion.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toarrange for the Captain of the Gentlemen-at-Arms,to take all possible steps to try to avoid a furtherGovernment defeat on the British Nationality Bill inthe House of Lords.(libiaiousprence:81) 31stelusions,12. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thata negotiating team of officials from the five Western countries whichhad taken the lead on the Namibian issue was at present visitingrelevant countries in Africa.    So far the results had been reasonablyencouraging, and the attitude of the South African Government inparticular appeared to be not unhelpful.tysiaTHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that aworrying situation had arisen in Malaysia, where the new PrimeMinister, Dr Mahathir, appeared to harbour a grudge against Britainand to be trying to steer public sector contracts away from Britishbidders.    This would need to be watched carefully.    The British stakein Malaysia was so large that the scope for retaliation was limited.He himself would be visiting Malaysia in 1982 and would wish to reviewthe position thereafter.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIn the course of a brief discussion it was noted that Dr Mahathirclaimed to have been slighted by a British Minister while he wasMinister of Trade,    He was a Malay chauvinist by temperament whodisliked the local Chinese community&apos;s disproportionate position ofinfluence in the economy of Malaysia and therefore resented the recentdecision of certain local British firms (eg Dunlop Estates and Guthrie)to sell out to Malaysian Chinese rather than Malay interests.b/Israelviouserence;il) 33rdIclusions,lute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theForeign Ministers of the member states of the European Communityhad agreed on 26 October that, in order to help the Americans and toavoid weakening President Mubarak&apos;s position in Egypt, the Dutch,Italian, French and British Governments should participate in theproposed Multinational Force in Sinai,    From Britain&apos;s point of viewparticipation was unwelcome and had been accepted only with reluctance.A statement was being prepared which would make clear that it did notimply any British association with the Camp David Agreement; that itwas designed only to facilitate the return of Arab territory occupied byIsrael; and that British policy remained firmly based on the EuropeanCommunity&apos;s Venice Declaration of June 1980.    Some outcry in otherArab countries was to be expected; but British economic interests thereought not to be significantly damaged, since the European countrieswould be acting together and European participation would open the wayfor other Western states (eg Canada, Australia and New Zealand) tofollow suit.    In the meantime, however, some members of theCommunity appeared to be having second thoughts.    It was not nowclear whether the Greeks would be able to agree after all; the Irishwere worried about the implications for their traditional neutrality; theItalians might not be willing to participate unless all member stateswere in agreement; and there was even a report that the French, despitetheir earlier strong advocacy of participation, were consideringlimiting their contribution to equipment rather than men.    The situationwas therefore uncertain.    This was not a matter in which Britain wouldwish to proceed without full and equal participation by France,In discussion it was noted that this was not the only area in which thepresent French Government&apos;s foreign policy seemed to be highlyvolatile.    Britain&apos;s economic interests would certainly suffer if theFrench commitment to the proposed force could be made to appear lesswhole-hearted than that of the British.    French economic interests inthe Middle East had been damaged initially by the new President&apos;spro-Israeli reputation; but the French Government had recently gone along way towards redressing the position.    More generally it was arguedthat even with full French involvement British participation, thoughimpossible to avoid because of the need to help the United States, waslikely to lessen the advantage which British defence sales efforts hadrecently been achieving in the Gulf states.    Special care would need tobe taken to minimise criticism in Saudi Arabia.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALandlViouserence:(81) 26th(elusions,lute 2THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that onhis visit to the Republic of Ireland on 27 October he had had a long talkwith the Taoiseach, Dr FitzGerald.    In order to minimise possiblecriticism in Northern Ireland they had met ostensibly to make eachother&apos;s acquaintance, not to discuss Dr FitzGerald&apos;s forthcomingSummit Meeting with the Prime Minister.    But inevitably the Summithad in fact been discussed, and it was satisfactory that no details of theirconversation had so far leaked out.    Dr FitzGerald, who had been lessvoluble than he had expected, appeared well disposed and concerned tobe helpful over the Northern Irish situation.    This was much to bewelcomed, since the maintenance and development of good relationsbetween the British and Irish Governments could have an important andbeneficial influence on the course of events in Northern ireland.The CabinetTook note..1M UNITYfairs...27 Octobereign Affairsncilwiouserence:(81) 33rd&apos;elusions,lute 43. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) on 26-27 October had decidedon a number of issues including the approval of a European Coal andSteel Community loan for an investment by Sony in South Wales.Progress had been made in the accession negotiations with Spain andPortugal, but the French with Italian support had prevented theCommunity from offering improved trading arrangements to Cyprus.This could have serious consequences for the attitude of Cyprus towardsthe Community.     The Council had devoted a half-day to discussion ofthe Mandate on budget restructuring without making any progress. Itwas perhaps inevitable at this stage that each country was sticking to itsposition.    The Community rarely reached decisions until the lastminute.    The differences on reform of the Common Agricultural Policyand on the Community budget were so great that the prospect of asettlement at the forthcoming European Council on 26-27 Novemberwas not good.      It was however important that the British Governmentshould continue to evince in public a determination to try to secure anagreement at that meeting.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALIctober,eriesicilriOUSirence:11) 33rdjlusions,ite 4THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that,at the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on 27 October, the FrenchMinister had appeared to change his tactic.    Havinp previously shownno signs of urgency, he had now asked for the next meeting of theFisheries Council to be brought forward to a date before the EuropeanCouncil, perhaps with the intention of using the meeting of Heads ofGovernment to put pressure on Britain.    It would be better to stick tothe present arrangement for a meeting of the Fisheries Council after theEuropean Council and to aim for a settlement then.    He would bemaking a statement that day which would report on developments whilethe House was in Recess as well as on the latest Council meeting.Iations:theIICAN4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign andCommonwealth Secretary (C(81) 52) on relations with the Vatican.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in hisview the time had now come for the Vatican to be invited to promotetheir diplomatic representative in London to the Ambassadorial statusof a Papal Pro-Nuncio and for Her Majesty&apos;s Legation to the Holy Seeat the same time to be raised to the status of an Embassy.    The presentlevel of relations had become an anomaly.     Most other states alreadyhad full diplomatic relations with the Holy See.    The ApostolicDelegate in London, Archbishop Heim, had taken a consistently helpfulattitude towards Northern Ireland.    He proposed that an announcementshould be made around the turn of the year, well before the Pope&apos;s visitto the United Kingdom.    The Archbishop of Canterbury and theModerator of the Church of Scotland, who had already been discreetlysounded, had reacted positively.    The Secretary of State for NorthernIreland supported the proposal, as had his predecessor who had beenconsulted while still holding that office.In discussion the following points were made -a. It would be necessary to ensure that the position of TheQueen, as Supreme Governor of the Church of England, wasfully safeguarded.    She was aware informally of the proposaland was understood to be content.b. The Vatican representative in London would be a Pro-Nuncio and would not, as in Roman Catholic countries, beex-officio Dean of the Diplomatic Corps.c. There was some doubt about the attitude of the Synod of theChurch of England, and opinion among the Archbishop ofCanterbury&apos;s advisers appeared to be divided.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIAL.d. Although the Moderator of the Church of Scotland hadreacted favourably, there were likely to be objections from theScottish free churches.e. Some Protestants might argue that full diplomatic relationswith the Vatican were inconsistent with the Act of Settlement1701, although there were no good legal grounds for this view.f. The announcement should not be made near the time of thePrime Minister&apos;s meeting with the Taoiseach, nor during themarching season in Northern Ireland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that full diplomatic relations with the Vatican should beestablished and that an announcement should be planned for around theturn of the year.    The timing should be considered again just before tlannouncement was due to be made.The Cabinet -1. Agreed that full diplomatic relations; with theVatican should be established on the basis proposedby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.2. Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto plan for an announcement about 1 January 1982, butto consider the timing again, in consultation with thePrime Minister, the Home Secrevary and the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland, shortly before theannouncement was due to be made.3. Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryin due course formally to notify the Archbishop ofCanterbury and the Moderator of the Church ofScotland;  to inform the other Churches;   and tonegotiate, tho terma oi the announcement, ana anynecessary questions relating to jurisdiction, with theVatican,QOSED&apos;INERffi&apos;FREEDQtt(FiffUnMI?ICi\020005
CONFIDENTIALIjSTRlALklRS| [andriousitence:II) 33rdtlusions,ute 25. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that theBoard of British Leyland (BL) had met on Tuesday 27 October, andthere had been farther meetings with the unions concerned on28 October.    The talks had been broken off.    The Board of BL had,however, decided that there should be no written ultimatum to the work-force that week;  and they were not committed to any particular timing,should industrial action be taken as threatened on 2 November. TheBoard would not take decisions until Thursday 5 November;  and hehimself would be in contact with the Chairman on Tuesday 3 November.The Chairman had appeared on television the previous evening. Whilethere had been no substantive change in his position, his attitude hadbeen conciliatory:  he had made it clear that his letter to the workforcein the previous week had not been intended to be provocative, and hehad pointed out that the offer which had led to the strike threat hadalready been modified.    Hi6 proposal that there should be a ballot ofth* workforce had been rejected by the unions.    But the Advisory,Conciliation and Arbitration Service (ACAS) were now involved. Thearea in which there might be scope for some reconciliation of theopposing points of view was in relation to the bonus scheme.In discussion there was general agreement that the Government shouldcontinue to make it clear that it was not intervening in the dispute,though the Secretary of State for Industry remained in contact with theBoard;  and that ACAS were now involved.    In the present delicatesituation it would be preferable to avoid having to make any kind ofstatement in the House of Commons;   even though the Government couldstick to the line proposed, some Government backbenchers representingconstituencies in the West Midlands might give an impression whichwould make the dispute more difficult to r esolve satisfactorily.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theGovernment position should continue to be that it was not intervening ina matter which was for the Board of BL, and it noted that ACAS werenow involved.    If (as seemed likely) the matter was raised in PrimeMinister&apos;s Questions that afternoon, she would stick to that line, withoutsuggesting that there was no contact between the Board of BL and theDepartment of Industry.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office29 October 1981CONFIDENTIAL
