The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in thet^IKS House of Commons during the following week.danceTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER informed the Cabinet ofcertain tax changes which he intended to announce that afternoon.The Cabfnet -Took note.IEIGNTAIRSbublicIreland2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe closeness of the result in the Irish general election suggested thatthe new Government now formed by the former Opposition leader,Dr FitzGerald, might not last long.    There was a danger that theformer Taoiseach, Mr Haughey, might adopt in opposition a moreextreme attitude to the problem of Northern Ireland, although he mightbe restrained by the possibility of returning to office at an early date andtherefore of needing to be able in that event to resume a workingrelationship with the British Government.leinouslerence;[81) 25th[elusions,lute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the closeresult of the general election in Israel looked like producing anotherGovernment headed by the existing Prime Minister, Mr Begin. Thiswas regrettable.    If the Opposition leader, Mr Peres, had emerged asthe victor by a narrow margin, he would probably net have had muchscope for altering the substance of Israeli policy towards the Arabs: buthe might at least have improved its tone.&apos;10US|erence:112th[fusions,|We2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the newItalian Government, under Signor Spadolini, was unlikely to prove moredurable than its predecessors, but Signor Spadolini himself had made afavourable first impression.CONFIDENTIAL

Presentindications suggested that the Soviet response was unlikely to befavourable.    But one important aim of the initiative had been to refocusinternational attention on the situation in Afghanistan, anc this aim wouldbest be served by continuing for the present on the basis that theinitiative had a reasonable chance of succeeding.    If it in due coursebecame clear that success was unattainable, i esponsibility for that stateof affairs could then be unambiguously laid at the Soviet Government&apos;sdoor.e/emalaiousrence:II) 21st:lusions,ite 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr Ridley, wouldbe going to New York on 6 July where he would meet Premier Price ofBelize and with him negotiate with the Guatemalan Foreign Minister,Ing Castillo, with the aim of reaching final agreement on the proposedAnglo-Guatemalan Treaty concerning Belize.    A difficult situation mightarise thereafter, because Fremier Price had committed himself toholding a Belicean referendum on the Treaty, which would be fought orparty lines and might be lost.    In such circumstances Britain wouldremain committed to bringing Belize to early independence but therewould be an obvious problem about providing for Belizean security. Hewould shortly be circulating a paper on the subject, including its possiblemilitary implications for Britain, for the information of his colleagues onthe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.|nce;y&apos;iousfence;II) 24thfusions,ite 4In the course of a brief discussion of international reactions to theGovernment&apos;s announcements about defence policy on 25 June, it wasnoted that the Secretary of State for Defence had paid a successful visitto the United States.    The Administration had clearly been appreciativeof the continuing high level of British military spending and relieved thata more serious cutback in defence plans was not contemplated.    It wasalso significant and satisfactory that the subject had net been raised withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary by any of his colleagues on theoccasion of the recent meeting of the European Council.The CabinetTook note.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALJM&apos;JNITYfAlRS^peanicil3. THE PRIME MINISTER reported on the meeting of the EuropeanCouncil in Luxembourg on 29-30 June.    The new President of the FrenchRepublic and the new Prime Ministers of Italy and Belgium wereattending for the first time.    The discussion on the economic situationhad produced long interventions from most of tne Heads of State withoutmuch debate.    The French President had spoken of the need for a newsccial order in Europe without making clear what he had in mind otherthan a reduction in working hours.    The economic measures alreadytaken by the new French Government would increase the budget deficit inFrance but still leave it as a lower proportion of Gross National Productthan in the United Kingdom.    The French President had secured nosupport for his economic policies except from the Danish PrimeMinister.    There had been considerable agreement on economic policybetween herself, the Federal German Chancellor and the new ItalianPrime Minister.    The French President had made it clear that theFrench Government would not be ready to discuss the restructuring ofthe Community budget before September.    The intervening period wouldbe used co establish the necessary background information to theCommission&apos;s report, which was in very general terms.    It contained agood deal about the Common Agricultural Policy and the need to modifyother Community policies as well as about the structure of the budgetitself, but took no account of the disproportionate net contribution paid bythe Federal Republic of Germany.    The Federal Chancellor had made itclear that he wished to see limits placed on the net contribution of theFederal Republic as well as on that of the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister said that the European Council meeting had alsogiven her the opportunity for a bilateral meeting with the FrenchPresident.    This had been a friendly and useful discussion, though theyhad not dealt with any issue in substance or detail.    She had formed theimpression that in his own way he would probably be no easier to dealwith than his predecessor:  he could be stubborn, as had been revealedby his subsequent attitude towards the drafting of the communique of theEuropean Council.    She had told him that the best way to get relationsbetween Britain and the new French Administration off to a good startwas to settle outstanding differences over sheepmeat and fisheries. Ithad also become clear that he had a different approach from that of hispredecessor on the Middle East.    He did not subscribe to theCommunity&apos;s declaration adopted at the European Council in Venice,although he acknowledged that it could not now be overturned. Hefavoured a ^tep-by-step approach more akin to that of the Camp Davidagreement.    On defence matters, he had taken a firm and positive lineon the nuclear deterrent and the need to maintain defence expenditure.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said it was notclear what the French President objected to in the Venice declaration,since he had said that he approved the principles which it contained. Itseemed likely that his purpose was to distance himself from the position3CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALtaken up by his predecessor. There appeared to be some difference ofopinion on this issue between the French President andMonsieur Cheysson, the French Foreign Minister,    The Arab countiieswould be well aware of the difficulties created by the French at theEuropean Council.    Given the importance of French commercialinterests in the Arab world, some change in the new President&apos;sattitudes was not to be excluded.jepmeatlevious@rence:(81) 25thdelusions,Re 3nousrence;ll) 22nd^elusions,te 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that,since the French Government had challenged the Commission&apos;s right tosettle the outstanding problem on the Sheepmeat Regulation, a specialmeeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) had been held on30 June.    The French and Irish had refused to agree to compromiseproposals which were acceptable to all other member states. TheCommission had subsequently discussed the matter again, but stillseemed likely to be unduly sensitive to French interests in spite of astrong stand taken by the two 3ritish Commif sioners. Furtherpressure on the President of the Commission, following what the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had said to himon 26 June, would be necessary.    In the meantime, the United Kingdomreserve had been lifted on certain agricultural regulations due to comeinto operation on 1 July but maintained on others (notably on wine andcereals) which were of particular interest to France.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said the agreement whichhad been reached on the regulation of steel production, prices andsubsidies within the Community was a fragile one.    It would benecessary to watch developments very carefully in order to prevent thefavourable effect on steel prices being undermined through theCommission allowing additional quotas to certain member states.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said it was note-worthy that, at a recent meeting of the National Economic DevelopmentCouncil, several trade union leaders had stressed the need to use theoccasion of the British Presidency of the European Community as anopportunity to put across to British public opinion the importance of theCommunity in safeguarding jobs and providing a favourable climate forinvestment.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office2 July 19814CONFIDENTIAL
