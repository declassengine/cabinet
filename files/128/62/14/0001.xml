FOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle Eaot2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, referring to President Sadat of Egypt5s acceptance of Prime Minister Begin1 invitation to him to visit Israel, said this represented a major development,    It should not be assumed that it would necessarilylead to a successful Geneva conference.    But President Sadat1 s gesturewent to the heart of the problem, which was acceptance by the Arabsof Israel&apos;s right to exist.    It was a brave act on President Sadat&apos;part for which he had been much criticised in Arab countries.    Itssignificance lay in its likely effect on the atmospherics rather than inany possibility of detailed negotiations,,    It had to be recognised thatthere were still serious divisions of opinion on the terms of a possiblesettlement.Mr. Begin&apos;s forthcoming visit to the United Kingdom would also be ofgrea,t importance, assuming it still went ahead:  and would provide anopportunity for encouraging him to seek reconciliation.    The visitwould however raise considerable security problems.    It had been hoped to reduce these by having the official part of the visit at Chequers,but Mr. Begin&apos;s decision to attend a lunch for 700 members of theJewish community pi esentea added complications.    There was also apossibility of demonstrations by anti-Jewish students.rhodesia previous reference:CM(77) 35thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that president Nyerere of Tanzania was due to have an important meeting with President Kaunda of Zambia on 18 November, at which he would try to persuade President Kaunda to agree to early elections, as envisaged in the United States/United Kingdom proposals.    It wasencouraging that President Nyerere and President Machele ofMozambique both continued fully to support our initiative.Gibraltar THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that whenhe went to Strasbourg on 24 November for a meeting of the Council ofEurope at which Spain would be participating for the first time, theChief Minister of Gibraltar, Sir Joshua Hassan, would be accompanyinghim for the purpose of meeting the Spanish Foreign Minister.    It was unlikely that there would be any detailed discussion of Spanish restric-tions on this occasion, but he hoped that this meeting would improve the atmosphere for subsequent contaxts.The Cabinet -Took note.2
1978-79NATIONALINSURANCECONTRIBUTIONRATES FOREMPLOYEDEARNERS3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Minister for Social Security(CP(77) 104) a.nd a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP(77) 105) about the contribution rates to be fixed in respect ofemployed earners for the start of the New Pensions Scheme inApril 1978.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that hehad been unable to reach agreement with the Chief Secretary,Treasury on the Class 1 National Insurance contribution rate.    Adecision wan required urgently because it would be necessary tomake an announcement ir. December and to set in hand the printingof leaflets for the major publicity campaign, starting in January,on the New Pensions Scheme.    The present Class 1 rate was14&quot;! per cent (employer 8f per cent, employee 5f per cent).    he proposed that this should go up to 16 per cent, with an employercontribution of .10 per cent and an employee contribution of 6 per cent.This would be enough to finance benefits and to maintain the existinglarge surplus of the National Insurance (Nl) Fund for some years.The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposal was for a rate of I67 per cent whichwould mean announcing in December a rate for the employee of63- per cent.    The increase in the contribution rate necessitated bythe New Pensions Scheme would be unpopular in any case, but hisown strongly held view was that, on pay po3.icy grounds and in orderto give a good start to the New Pensions Scheme, the increase shouldbe kept to the minimum possible.    The NI Fund would have a creditbalance of about  3, 700 million by April next year and could wellsupport a deficit of the order of  400 million which, on the givenassumptions, would result from a contribution rate of 16 per cent.For 5 years the Fund&apos;s income had been far more than was needed for NI purposes, and this had occasioned a great deal ofParliamentary criticism.    It was now less convincing to argue theneed for this surplus on general economic grounds.    The Treasuryproposal for 16^ per cent also showed a deficit for 1978-79, but thiswas marginal and could well turn into a further surplus if earningsincreased by more than 10 per cent without any significant increasein unemployment.    The Government could therefore find themselvesin the absurd position of fixing the rate at 16^ per cent, withattendant unpopularity, only to lower it again in the following year.The Government Actuary estimated that after 1978-79 if unemploymentfell to, and remained at 4 per cent, a 16 per cent rate would suffice for over 10 years.    There was a serious risk that if the Governmentcontinued to allow large surpluses to accrue to the NI Fund, the wholeprinciple of a contributary scheme would be undermined and publiclydiscredited.    A 16-jr per cent rate would also prejudice publicacceptance of the New Pensions Scheme since 16  per cent was themaximum provided for in the legislation, and Ministers had alwaysexpressed the hope that the contribution rate would be lower.    The
Scheme already suffered from the presentational difficulty that people would have to wait for at least a year, after paying highercontributions, before gaining any additional benefits.    The greaterimpact on take-home pay of a I6j per cent rate, which would haveto be announced in December, would, in his view, do great damage to the pay policy and leave the Government bearing the criticism forseveral months before any remedial measures could be taken in theBudget.    It could also discredit the Child Benefit scheme since,taking into account the loss of child tax allowances, the net gain in family income in April 1978 would be only 41p, as compared with81p if a 16 per cent M contribution rate were fixed.THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that there were twocrucial arguments in favour of a contribution rate of 16 per cent.The first was the argument about the NI Fund:  the credit balancewas already very large and the Government Actuary had recentlyexpressed some concern about the principle of using surpluses for tax or other concessions.    The second argument was the onerelating to take-home pay and incomes policy.    A 16 per cent rate would be of appreciably greater benefit than tax cuts to low-paidemployees and he did not believe that tax concessions would have thesame public impact as a lower contribution rate.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the increase inthe contribution rate would be unpopular, whatever its size,    To fix the employee contribution at 6 per cent, with an employer rate of10 per cent, would be contrary to the undertaking given by theGovernment spokesman last December during the Committee stage of the Social Security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill that theGovernment would not seek to go beyond the 6j per cent: 10 per centrelationship expressed in Section 2 of the Social Security pensions act.    This relationship, on a 16 per cent rates would require a splitwhich, as compared with a l6^r per cent rate, would make a difference of only 20p to a man on average earnings with two children.    There were too many economic uncertainties to enable a safe prediction to be made of the contribution rate which would berequired for future years.    What was clear was that a contributionrate for 1978-79 of 16-1 per cent would result in a substantial changein the pattern of surpluses in previous years.    The main argument,however, in favour of this rate was that it would substantiallyreduce the cost to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)and so provide greater flexibility to the Chancellor of the exchequer in deciding next, spring how the additional money should be used,whether in tax concessions or public expenditure increases.    Therewas therefore an overriding political and financial advantage in fixing the rate at I67 per cent, as he proposed.4
In discussion, it was argued that, with a contribution rate of16^ per cent, the NI Fund credit balance would be reduced annuallyuntil the unemployment rate fell to 4 per cent, and this was unlikely to happen in 1978-79.    It was a fine judgment whether a lower NIcontribution rate would be more beneficial to certain groups thantax reductions but if the  400 million were used, for example, toraise the marriage allowance, this would increase the take-homepay of a married man on average earnings by about 85p a week, andpensioners would also benefit.    Many of those in work who paid notax were juveniles and single women rather than people with familycommitments.    It was impossible to say whether the economicsituation next spring would open up the option of a lower rate bandfor income tax but if it did, the cost would be at least  1, 200 million.There was an expectation that the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldmake further tax concessions in the spring if the situation allowed,and a reduction of  400 million in the PSER would undoubtedlyprovide greater flexibility for this and other purposes.    On theother hand, it was argued that a major promotional effort would berequired to &quot;sell&quot; the New Pensions Scheme, and the success of thiswas of high political importance.    Although the increasedcontribution rate, and the consequent reduction in take-home pay,would not take effect until April 1978, the announcement of the ratebefore Christmas would adversely affect the promotional campaignas well as the pay policy unless the rate was seen to be as low aspossible.    The presentational impact would not be offset byprospective tax concessions since there could be no advancecommitment to these.In further discussion, it was suggested that the judgment was essentially political.    The choice lay between a concession in theNI contribution rate now or Budgetary concessions later and thepresentational difficulty was that the options were out of phase with each other.    It was unlikely, however, that the public would see the argument in terms of a 16 per cent or 16^ per cent contribution rate.The increased rate would be unpopular whatever the size;  and theperceived effect of tax reductions might well be greater than thatof a contribution rate of 16 per cent as opposed to any higher rate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that althoughthe arguments were finely balanced, the majority of the cabinet favoured a Class 1 contribution rate of I6j per cent on the basis thatthis would give the Chancellor of the Exchequer greater flexibility in framing his Budget proposals next spring which was when the new NIcontribution ratf s would take effect.    In reaching this conclusion theCabinet had been influenced by the practice adopted by the chancellor in previous Budgetary measures of giving his Cabinet colleagues theopportunity to make suggestions on the framing of his proposals.5
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.DRAFT white paper ONTHE CONDUCTOF COMPANYDIRECTORS4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Trade (CP(77) 103) covering the draft of a White paper which he proposed to publish on the conduct of company directors.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the White paper had been discussed and its text approved by the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy,   subject to some small amendments which had been agreed in further correspondence.There had been a number of financial scandals which had made itnecessary to amend company law in some respects.    The white paper set out the Governments proposals on the duties of companydirectors, on restriction of loans by companies to directors, andon insider trading.    There was a problem over the timing oflegislation.    The Queen&apos;s Speech contained a reference to aCompanies Bill in the present Session, and this was in the &quot;essential&quot;category because of the need to implement the second european economic Community (e.c.) directive on Company Law.    He hopedit would be possible to extend this Bill to cover the points dealt within the White Paper.    But he did not seek a decision on this point atthe moment.    He recognised that it could not be settled until later in the Session, in the light of progress with the rest of thelegislative programme.    However, it would be a mistake to leavethe Opposition free to bring forward clauses of its own to deal withthese problems.    He therefore proposed the immediate publicationof a White Paper, setting oat the Governments legislative intentions.This would allow time for proper consultation with the variousinterested parties.    In publishing the White Paper, he would makeit clear that the Government was not committed to legislating onthese points in the present Session.    If necessary he would laterdefend the exclusion of these provisions from the Bill on the grounds of congestion in the Parliamentary programme.    TMs would be widely understood.    He had explored the possibility, suggested inthe earlier discussion, of so limiting the long title of the Bill as to exclude Opposition amendments, but this was impracticable.    Theessential part of the Bill would be ready for publication in the new year.In discussion it was argued that it would be difficult to resistamendments, whether tabled by the Opposition or by Governmentback benchers, and that these would consume as much parliamentary time as if the Government included its own proposals in the Bill fromthe start.    On the other hand, it was argued that publication of theGovernments legislative intentions in advance would avoid the
Opposition taking credit for dealing with these matters, and wouldprovide the basis for Government new clauses which could beintroduced if pressure became too great.    This would be preferable to a situation in which the Government appeared to have its handforced by the Opposition.    But the pressure on the legislative programme was such that it would be undesirable for theGovernment to become absolutely committed at this stage to a longBill on company law.    Indeed if it became clear that it wasimpossible to avoid adding these provisions to the Bill to give effectto the e.c. Directive it might be necessary despite the commitment in The queen s Speech to reconsider whether that Bill was essential.In discussion of the draft White Paper itself, the following points were made -a. Paragraph 6 contained the first reference to theBullock Committee, and the word &quot;also&quot; in line 1 wastherefore redundant.b. The section on insider dealing laid all the emphasisupon the unfairness to other parties to a transaction, andsought to protect them by giving them a remedy at civil law.There was however a wider public interest involved.    Thedraft should therefore make it clear that public confidence in company directors required that they should be prevented from using their specialist knowledge to further their own interests, whatever the damage to third parties.c. The proposal in paragraph 2 5 that &quot;insider dealings&quot;should not be an absolute offence at criminal law might need further consideration since at first sight it appearedinconsistent with the general principles of criminal law.This was, however, a point which could be settled in the context of the preparation of legislation.d. The term &quot;tippee&quot; in paragraphs 27 and 28 should if possible be avoided.e. The White Paper did not deal with the question whether there should be an enforceable code of conduct for stock exchange dealings and a new body to enforce them.    Thiswas however a point for the Wilson Committee rather than this White Paper but steps should be taken to ensure that theywere seized of the problem.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the terms of the White Paper, subject to the points made in discussion and to any further small drafting changes to be 
suggested in correspondence in the next few days.    The white paper should be published at an early date to be agreed betweenthe Lord President of the Council and the Secretary of State for trade     The Secretary of State for Trade should make it clear atthe time of publication that the Government was not committed to legislation on the points in the White Paper in the present Session.The Lord President should arrange for the position to bere considered by Legislation Committee in the new year.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer should make sure that the WilsonCommittee were considering the question of an enforceable code of conduct for Stock Exchange transactions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.8
INDUSTRIAL,ACTION INTHE FIRESERVICEPreviousReference:CM(77) 35thConclusions,Minute 45. THE HOME SECRETARY, reporting on the situation after three days of the strike, said that there had been fewer fire callsthan usual, but it was not clear whether this was coincidental or theresult of people acting on the advice they had been given.    The vast majority of regular firemen were on strike, but so far most of theretained firemen had responded to calls.    The 10, 000 Servicemenhad tackled about 1, 200 incidents.    They were doing an excellent jobfor which they had not been trained and for which they deservedcongratulations.    One problem had arisen over the lack cf breathingapparatus, which hampered Servicemen in going into smoke filledbuildings.    He had been advised against making this available tountrained men, but arrangements were in hand to deploy a small number of Service experts with breathing apparatus in key towns.The Press had made a lot of the fire at Tilbury power station, but his understanding was that, although the station would be out of action for several months, it produced only 2 per cent of the central electricity Generating Board&apos;s total generating capacity.    A fairproportion of the Fire Officers were working from their homes andhad given valuable assistance and advice to the Servicemen.    Therewas however now a report that the Fire Officers themselves might goon strike in support of their own wage claim.    This would cause serious trouble if it happened.    Picketing was in general goodtempered.    A problem had arisen in Walsall where, as a result of instructions given by the West Midlands representative of theTransport and General Workers Union (TGWU), drivers were refusing to deliver fuel oil to Service depots.    This was being investigated.Although sabotage was not widespread, as the Press had reported,there were a number of examples of firemen going into fire stations and damaging equipment.    Co-ordination of arrangements for dealingwith the emergency were going smoothly and regular situation reports were being produced which were sent to the Prime Minister and other ministers directly concerned.In discussion it was reported that picketing, which had previously been confined to regular fire stations, had now been extended to service depots where the green goddesses were located and that asa result some TGWU drivers were not prepared to deliver fuel oilfor heating purposes.    There was a potential problem over the useof civilian mechanics in Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers(REME) workshops to which the green goddesses which had broken down were taken for repair.    It was however hoped that the fire brigades Union (FBU) would urge other unions not to make difficulties over this.    The Services resources were being hard stretched.Troops were doirg 84 hours a week on duty, on the basis of 7 shiftsof 12 hours each.    There was a shortage of heavy duty vehicledrivers of which only 60 now remained available.    In NorthernIreland there had been no noticeable increase in fire calls;  therebad been 33 in the last 24 hours.    There had been four deaths in fires
in Northern Ireland so far, but none of them were attributable tothe strike.    Although relatively little had been heard of the irish republican Army since the 6trike started, it was feared chat theymight cause serious trouble over the next weekend.    Efforts werebeing made to get the firemen to go back to work in Northern Ireland,in recognition of the special circumstances.In further discussion the suggestion was put forward that it would berealistic for the Government to consider a settlement with thefiremen which involved an immediate payment outside the 10 per centon earnings guideline.    The firemen had a good case on merits.Public opinion did not regard the firemen as irresponsible ana mightincreasingly support their claim, especially if they developed astrategy of safeguarding lives but not property.    Against thishowever it was strongly argued that a breach of the 10 per centguidelines in the case of the firemen would have repercussions onthe police who would go back on the settlement recently reached,the local authority manual workers who were now considering thelocal authorities&apos; offer and the National Health Service ancillariesto whom an offer was due to be made in the following week.    It was by no means clear that public opinion was supporting the firemen andeven less clear that other groups were prepared to accept that theywere a special case.    There were some reasons for fearing that theprivate sector was not observing the guidelines rigorously and inparticular that doubtful productivity deals were being used as a wayround them.    The Government would need to do what it could to influence the private sector and at a suitable time to make further efforts to enlist the support of the Trades Union Congress (TUC).In the meantime it was essential to ensure strict observance of theguidelines in the public sector.    If they were breached in any significant case there would be a flood of exceptions.    If anythingthe control of wage negotiations in the public sector needed to bemade tighter and following discussion tne previous day in theSub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Strategy the Chancellor of the Exchequer would shortly be writing to all his colleagues seeking their co-operation in this andin arrangements to review well in advance the negotiations whichwould be coming forward over the next three or four months.It was however important to find a basis for settlement within theguidelines which could be put to the firemen when the time was ripe.There were three elements in a possible package - an immediatewage increase within the 10 per cent guideline;  agreement on a formula for relating the pay of firemen to that of other groups whilekeeping open the date from which it could be implemented; and areduction in weekly hours, probably from 48 to 42 after the end ofthe current pay round.    The local authorities who were negotiating with the FBU in the National Joint Council were reluctant to co-operate10
on the latter two elements unless they were assured that theadditional expenditures involved would be covered by an appropriateincrease in the rate support grant (RSG).    The cash limits for theRSG in 1978-79 which Ministers would be discussing with the localauthorities on the following day assumed that wage increases wouldbe at the upper end of the range 6 to 10 per cent.    It could be pointedout to the local authorities that if wage settlements after the end ofthe present round were higher than that the cash limit could beconsidered further.    However this point required further examination between the Ministers concerned before the meetingon the following day.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet took note of the situation in the firemen1 s dispute.    Theycommended the excellent job which the Services were doing in a difficult situation.    A large majority considered that it was essentialthat the Government should maintain the pay guidelines in the public sector and do all they could to ensure their full observance in theprivate sector.    Any departure from the guidelines in the public sector could rapidly lead to a flood of exceptions.    The success of the pay policy was crucial to the prospects of the Government and all ministers, not just those directly involved, should give full andpublic support to it.    The Home Secretary, the Secretaries of Statefor the Environment and Scotland and the Chief Secretary, treasury should consider later in the day how the discussions with the localauthorities about rate support grant and a possible settlement of thefiremen&apos;s dispute should be handled.    The outcome of their discussion should be reported to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office17 November 197711
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINETCOPY NOfaLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 36th Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 17 November 1977 at 10.45 amPA R LtA M ENTAR YAFFAIRSEu r op canAssemblyElectic-nsBillPrevious *-Reference:CM(77) 35thConclusions,Minute 1THE PRIME MINLSTER recalled that in deference to strong feelingswithin the Labour Party the European Assembly Elections Bill had beenfirst introduced at a late stage in the. previous Session, incurringsome embarrassment in the Community as a result.    It had receiveda Second Reading by a large majority:  and there had been a free vote for Ministers.    The 3ill had now been reintroduced and a number ofMinisters would no doubt prefer to vote freely on the principle once again.     The circumstances were however different.    The principle ofthe Bill had been endorsed by Parliament and its reintroduction hadbeen promised in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    Furthermore it was relevanttha*; the recent votes on the timetable Motions for the Scotland andWales Bills had shown the value to Party morale when individual?who had. previously expressed strongly-held personal views were nowready to subordinate these in the interests cf solidarity.    The questionof party morale was of especial importance at the present time and asthey moved closer to a General Election.    He understood from theLord President of the Council that those Cabinet and junior ministers who were opposed to the Bill in principle would now be prepared,despite their personal viev/s, to abstain from voting against it asecond time.    This would strengthen the Party considerably and hewas grateful to the Lord President of the Council for the consultations which he had undertaken.    In that spirit, and although he would have preferred positive support, he would not insist on the collective responsibility of Ministers to support the Bill on Second Reading.There would still be a free vote on the method of election.The Catinet -Took note; with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office17 November 1977
