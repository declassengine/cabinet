PARLIAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week, and of theintention to inform the House that, subject to the progress ofbusiness, it would be proposed that the House should rise for the christmas adjournment on Friday, 16-.Dec.smber, until Monday,9 January 1978.In discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage if theHouse were to sit for two additional days before Christmas, soas to reduce the risk of having to sit into August;  or alternativelythat the House should return as well as rise later than was proposed,since it was unusual to rise a full week before Christmas.    On theother hand, it was pointed out that many Members, especially those from the North and those with families, would welcome theadditional days off before Christmas which the normal arrangementsdid not provide.    It was noted that the proposal to rise on16 December was subject to the progress of business, and it wouldbe possible to sit in the following week if that became desirable,eg because of industrial troubles.It was also noted in discussion that Mr Graham Page&apos;s Motion on services&apos; pay on Friday, 9 December, might cause some embarrasment, and that the Opposition might seek to retainsufficient Members in the House that afternoon to obtain the closure and force a vote on the Motion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthere were differences of view on the proposed timing of the christmas adjournment, and the Cabinet should therefore acceptthe advice of the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip that tomake a change of plan at this stage would cause too many difficulties.The necessary precautions would need to be taken against any riskof Mr Graham Page&apos;s Motion on Services&apos; pay being carried.The Cabinet1&quot;.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthere would be pressure from both sides of the House in committee later that day to amend the European AssemblyElections Bill so as to make any extension of the powers of theEuropean Assembly subject to approval by an Act of Parliamentrather than by subordinate legislation under the european communities Act.    It would be argued that such an amendment would accord with the terms of the Prime Minister&apos;s letter tothe General Secretary of the Labour Party.    It would involve a departure from present constitutional practice but would be welcomed by Labour Party members who did not accept that1EuropeanAssemblyElections bill previous reference:CM(77) 36thConclusions,Minute 1
Community legislation was to be treated in the same way asinternational obligations.    He had agreed with the Lord President,the Home Secretary and the Chief Whip that it would be right to promise to bring forward at a later stage a new clause requiringapproval by Act of Parliament for any Treaty extending the powersof the Assembly.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be necessary to consider further precisely what was meant by an extension of the powers ofthe Assembly.     The intention should be to catch extensions whichwould require decisions by the Council affecting the CommunityTreaties and which would otherwise involve subordinate legislationunder the European Communities Act;  and not extensions of powersalready within the framework of the Community institutions.The Attorney General had seen no overriding constitutionalobjection to the course proposed.    But it would be difficult to makea fiim commitment to amend the Bill until it was clear that theprovision proposed could be brought within the rules of the House.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agread ixi principle to what was proposed, though it wouldbe important to ensure that the provision proposed did not open the door to further weakening of our ability to meet other international obligations.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should therefore limit himself to announcing the Government&apos; 8 intentionto introduce a new clause in due course the effect of which would bethat Ministers would not be able to agree, without an Act *fParliament, to any extension of the powers of the Assembly thatwould encroach on the legislative powers of the WestminsterParliament.    It was not the intention to restrict their power to agreeto the extension of the powers of the Assembly in other respects.The scope of the provision and the procedure for its introductionshould be considered further by the Lord President of the council with the Lord Chancellor, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,the Home Secretary and, if necessary, the Attorney General, who should report their conclusions to him.The Cabinet -I2.    Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.3.    Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary and the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.2
FOREIGNAFFAIRSSouth AfricaPreviousReference:CM(77) 35thConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the outcome of the South African general election was asubstantial swing to the ruling National Party, mainly at the expenseof the New Republic Party which was the successor to the formerUnited Party.    The only satisfactory feature of the result was thatthe Progressive Federal Party had become the official parliamentary opposition.    This held out the prospect that the policies of the SouthAfrican Government on apartheid would now be more clearly opposedin the South African Parliament than had been the case.    On the otherhand, the Government were bound to see the result as a mandate tocontinue their existing policies.    This did not, however, rule cut thepossibility of any movement on the Governments part.    There were signs of growing awareness in South Africa, particularly among thebusiness community, of the increasing strength of the internationalpressures for change in the Governments internal policies.    Weshould be ready to take advantage of any developments of this kind,not least in the United Nations.The Cabinet -1.    Took note.rhodesia previous reference:CM(77) 36thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that althoughreports of the recent Rhodesian raid on Mozambique differed, the attack had clearly been a substantial one, in which women and childrenhad probably been killed, and he had issued a statement stronglycondemning it.    He was concerned that the Rhode russians might carry out a similar incursion into Zambia.    As a result of the raidBishop Muzorewa and the Reverend Sithole were now likely to be morereluctant to reach agreement with Mr Smith on an internal settlement.They were very conscious of the danger of being branded as blackpuppets.    The raid had also underlined the need for an internationallyaccepted solution to the Rhodesian question.    It was particularly important in the present fluid situation that we continue to stand firm on the Anglo/American proposals and did not start to search for newinitiatives.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that onthe occasion of tfcft Mapai raid President Machel had not taken up ouroffers of help.    There were in any case clear limits to the assistance which we could provide.    Nevertheless, in view of the seriousness of the latest Rhodesian raid on Mozambique and of the co-operation wewere continuing to receive from him in our efforts to solve the rhodesian problem, we should ask President Machel whether therewas any help which he felt that we could give.
The Cabinet -2.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto be guided accordingly.LOW PAY and pay POLICYPreviousReference:CM(77) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2Low Pay3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(77) 106) together with an earlierpaper by the Secretary of State for Employment (CP(77) 98).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that his memorandum, circulated in October, had suggested that theGovernment should not seek to limit any increase in pay in the currentpay round to less than  4 for a normal working week.    This wouldhave effectively set a minimum floor t* the size of pay increases in thepresent round.    He had seen this as a possible concession which mighthave helped to secure acquiescence in the pay policy and to removesome particular problems with the statutory wages councils.Developments since that time had undermined this approach.    TheGovernment had been unable to prevent certain Wages Councils from giving their statutory approval to pay increases of more than 10 percent, which the Government could not set aside.    Other negotiators,for example those of the National Union of Public Employees had beenquick to build their claims upon the level thus established.    Thepresentational advantage of the  4 minimum had now been lost.    It wasnot clear what the Government gained by making a formal objection to each proposal from a Wages Council, which was then ignored.    Therewere some 40 Wages Council settlements still to come, and it was worth considering whether even at this late stage the Government shouldrevert to the idea of a minimum entitlement.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the case for aminimum level of pay increase had indeed been weakened by recent events.    If the cut-off point were to be set at earnings of  40 a week,it would not relate to a family poverty problem.    Most people earningbelow that level were juveniles, part-timers, or women who were notheads of families.    There were better methods of solving the problemof family poverty.    There was no sign that an approach of the kindadvocated by the Secretary of State for Employment would have thebacking of the Trade Union Congress (TUC).    Indeed all the pressure for increased earnings came from the higher-paid.    The TUC couldnot secure restraint on the part of the higher paid in exchange for concessions to the low paid.    He recognised that there were particular problems with the Wages Councils, and with the Agricultural wages board.    But these bodies set the minimum rate for the groups ofworkers concerned and the practical effect on real earnings was oftensmall.    In agriculture, for example, 90 per cent of the workersreceived more than the statutory minimum wage.    The right course,
in his view, was to continue the policy of making formal objections ina low key, and then to allow the Wages Councils to make excessivestatutory awards, while refraining from giving them any publicendorsement.In discussion, there was general agreement that it was now too late to make any major change in the pay guidelines to help the lowestpaid, whether or not such a provision at an earlier stage would havebeen helpful.    But it was important to recognise that for the first time, this Government was trying to run a voluntary wage policywithout any special treatment for the low-paid.    If there were to beany fresh approach to the TUC on the later stages of the present round of pay policy, this should perhaps encompass some concession forthe low paid.    Similarly, if some kind of permanent machinery for handling exceptions to the pay guidelines were eventually established,it would be important to ensure that it dealt with the problems of thelow paid as well as those of the high paid, where the anomalies of thepresent policy were most obvious.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it would be wrong to make any immediate move of the kind suggested by the Secretary of State for Employment, forthe reasons set out by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his paper(CP(77) 106).   However, the problem of the low paid was a continuingone which the Cabinet recognised would require further consideration at a later stage.     In due course consideration might also need to begiven to the position of the Wages Councils and Boards.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the sumrniug tip oftheir diacuscion by the Prime Minister.Pay Policy THE PRIME MINISTER said that the previous discussion suggested the need for a general review of progress to date in the implementation of pay policy.    The Cabinet should consider whether a completemeeting should be devoted to the subject before Christmas.In discussion, it was suggested that such a review should not be confined to pay policy.    Pay could not be seen in isolation from thegeneral economic situation, including the continuing high level ofunemployment and the prospect of five years of depression in theworld economy.    On the other hand, it was pointed *ut that ministers had recently agreed to have a general discussion ofeconomic policy during January in preparation for the run-up to theBudget, and it would be a mistake to anticipate that discussion.   Paypolicy by it self posed very large problems for a Labour Government.The central dilemma for a socialist party was to reconcile its desire for planning and intervention in economic policy with the trade union5 confidential---------------------- ..
movements&apos; wish for free collective bargaining.     But while generalwide ranging discussion of these issues was important, a measure ofimprovisation was essential during the next few months.    TheGovernment faced a series of very difficult wage claims.    maintaining the pay guidelines in all these cases might involve serious industrial action, for example by the electricity power workers.    experience in Northern Ireland in 1974 had shown how great was the threat posedby power workers to a modern industrial society, which could rapidlybe brought to a standstill if they stopped work.    Such threats couldonly be overcome with the support of public opinion and that depended on being able to demonstrate that the pay policy was fair.    TheSub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy (EY(P)) had already agreed to review the mostimportant impending pay claims taking full account of possibleindustrial action and contingency plans which might be made to dealwith that.    The results of this study could be brought before theCabinet in time for their general discussion of pay policy later in themonth.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the need for a wide-ranging discussion of paypolicy before Christmas.    Although this could not completelyexclude some of the broader issues of economic policy, the Cabinetnoted that there was to be a full discussion of these in January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would bring a paper on the payprospect before the Cabinet for a meeting on 22 December.The Cabinet -2.    Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.6
NATIONALISED 4. The Cabinet had before them a note(CP(77) 107) by theINDUSTRIES Lord Privy Seal, setting out his recommendations for dealing withBOARD MEMBERS&apos;    the increases recommended by the Top Salaries Review BodySALARIES (TSRB) in their 6th Report (TSRB 6), which covered a memorandumby officials setting out three possible courses of action to deal withthese problems.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Cabinet had discussed this problem on a number of occasions since the TSRB submittedReport No. 6 at the end of 1974, and had always postponed adecision.    There were now great problems in recruiting andretaining members of nationalised industry boards at present paylevels.    He was frequently asked to bend or break the rules.    Adecision could no longer be postponed.    The question was whetherthe Cabinet was prepared to exceed the pay guidelines in thesecases.    There was a strong argument for adopting the first courseset out by officials, which was to regard TSRB 6 as a commitment which ante-dated pay policy and could therefore be implementedwithout constituting a breach of the policy itself.    But he recognised that this involved severe presentational difficulties.If colleagues considered those difficulties to be decisive he believedthe right course was option (c) ir. paragraph 7 of the note by officialsattached to his paper - to defer action until TSRB Report No. 10 was submitted.    Option (b) - partial implementation - offered no realsolution and would have the effect of freezing the position for therest of the pay round.    If the confidence of the Review Body, to say nothing of the Board members affected, was to be retained, adecision of this kind would need to be accompanied by a clearcommitment to implement recommendations of TSRB 10 in full,though possibly in stages.    Whatever course was followed,Ministers should agree to abide by the Cabinet decision, and not topress in future for exceptions to the general treatment, and thedecision should be announced as soon as possible.In discussion, it was first argued that the problems of recruitmentwere now becoming acute.    Various expedients had been adopted to secure first rate men for some of the most important boards, forexample by arranging their secondment from private industry attheir previous salaries, which were often very much larger thanthose presently payable to nationalised industry board members.Internal relativities within many industries had been completelydistorted, with the result that many board members would have been better off to refuse promotion to the Board.    Their pensions were also severely affected.    The problem was not confined to nationalised industry board members.    There were other groupscovered by the TSRB, for example some holders of the lowerjudicial offices;  university vice chancellors;  and certain people inthe Department of the Environment field.    There was no doubt thatthose covered by the review machinery were underpaid by comparison with their counterparts in the private sector.7
Nevertheless, they were still earning, inmost cases, very highsalaries.    While their problems might generally be recognised as anomalous it was difficult to secure general acceptance of the pay policy guidelines if the best paid people in the public sectorreceived very large increases.    It was therefore generally recognised that implementation of TSRB Report No. 6 on the grounds that it predated pay policy was not in present circumstances apractical possibility.In further discussion, it was suggested that the beet solution wouldbe to apply the &quot;kitty principle&quot; but within the guidelines on thelines suggested in Option (c) of Annex C to the paper by officialsannexed to CP(77) 107.    This would be strictly in accordance with pay policy and would allow a considerable impact to be made onthe problem.    Against this it was argued that the kitty principle was inappropriate as a means of dealing with the nationalised industry problem.    The industries, and the other groupscovered by the Top Salary machinery, were not a homogenousgroup.    Nor could board members be grouped with other workersin the same organisation.    The total cost of increasing their paywas trivial compared with that cf the workforce as a whole.    Inany case, the kitty principle should not be applied in cuch a way asto give increases of more than 10 per cent for any individual boardmember.    The method proposed in Option (c) of Annex C to therote by officials would produce an increase of almost 50 per cent for the chairman of the Post Office.    In fact there was a strong arguement for applying a much lower general increase to nationalised industry board members than the 10 per cent guideline.This would help presentationally in reducing the pressure for increases of 10 per cent all round.    It would also overcome thedifficulty of paying members of the British Steel Corporation a10 per cent increase when efforts were being made to get asettlement for workers in the steel industry at well within singlefigures. It might for example be sensible to offer 4 per cent to nationalised industry board members, either across the board or as a general level, with exceptional treatment up to 10 per cent for those who had been particularly severely held back by thefailure to fmplement TSRB 6.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would resume their discussion of the problem at the next meeting.    Meanwhile the Lord Privy Seal should arrange for theCivil Service Department (CSD) to study the possibility of a scheme on the lines just suggested.    This might be on the basis of a5 per cent increase which could be applied on a kitty principle, or as a flat rate, or perhaps more probably as a general increase of5 per cent with a few exceptions up to a maximum of 10 per cent to deal with cases of particular hardship such as those covereddirectly and consequentially by the TSRB recommendations whohad previously relatively low salaries.    The CSD should also8
consider whether anything could be done to ease the problem on pensions.    The Cabinet would consider a paper from the Lord privy seal reporting the results of this work at their next meeting,together with the paper CP(77) 108 on the question of second stagepayments in respect of the 1974 recommendations of the three payreview bodies.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Lord Privy Seal to proceed accordingly.Cabinet office December 19779
