DRAFT STATEMENT      The Cabinet had before it a note by the Chancellor of theON COUNTER- Exchequer (CP(77) 80) covering a draft statement which heINFLATION POLICY       proposed to make in the House of Commons the following morning.    The Ca.binet considered the statement paragraph by paragraph and agreed a number of changes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet approved the statement subject to the amendments which they had agreed.    A number of procedural pointsremained to be settled.    The first concerned the need for a debate on an extension of the Remuneration and Charges Act andon an extension of dividend control.    The Lord President of theCouncil, in consultation with the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection, should consider urgently the form ofany further debate which might be needed.    If such a debate hadto be related to a White Paper, this should take the form of areprinted version of the Chancellor&apos;s statement, but this shouldnot be published or promised until after the debate on the adjournment on 20 July,    The Lord President of the council should also consider, in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Social Services, the need for an Order to implement the changes which the Cabinet had agreed that morning on ChildBenefit.    The question of rent and rate rebates to reflect the changes in Child Benefit should be considered again by theSecretary of State for the Environment and brought before theappropriate Ministerial Committee in the autumn.The policy on which the Cabinet had decided carried great risks.Nevertheless it was in the national interest that the Governmentshould persevere with the policies outlined in the Chancellor&apos;sstatement.    It was also in the electoral interests of the present government.    He was impressed by the air of sobriety andrealism among the trade union leaders whom they had met in thelast few days, and this gave some assurance that the policy would succeed, despite the undoubted militancy of some other tradeunion members.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet office 5 July 1977
