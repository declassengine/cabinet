PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRSArrangementwith theLiberalsPreviousReference:CM(77) 27thConclusions,Minute 11. The Cabinet had placed before them copies of a letter which mr David Steel, leader of the Liberal Party, had sent to the PrimeMinister the previous evening, concerning the renewal of thearrangement between the Government and the Liberal Party, and of adraft of a letter for the Prime Minister to send to Mr Steel in reply.Mr Steel&apos;s letter said that the Liberal Party had decided to continueco-operation with the Government into the next Session of parliament for so xong as the objectives set out in the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s statement of 15 July were sustained by the Government,and then set out a number of understandings relating to government action in the next Session of Parliament on unemployment;  on profitsharing in private industry;   on taxation;  on the reintroduction of theEuropean Assembly Elections Bill;  on devolution legislation;  onlegislation to help first-time house buyers;  on competition policy and consumer protection;  and on consultations relating to the priorities inThe Queen&apos;s Speech, including such other matters as legal assistanceat major public enquiries, scrutiny of public expenditure and reform ofthe Official Secrets Acts.    The draft reply proposed to reaffirm thatthe fight against inflation and unemployment would continue as a first priority;  to welcome the support of the Liberal Party for policies tosecure these objectives in the next Session of Parliament;  and to confirm the understandings set out in Mr Steel&apos;s letter.THE PRIME MINISTER said that Mr Steel&apos;s letter followed a series of meetings between himself and Mr Steel, who had discussed the matterfully with his own Party and had needed to work hard to secure their agreement.    Mr Steel wished the whole Cabinet to know that ministers had behaved scrupulously in fulfilling the present agreement with the liberals, who had learned a great deal in the process.    He had seen mr Steel&apos;s letter in draft, points of particular concern to department-tal Ministers had been checked with them, and there had been someamendments.    The letter now represented a final position so far asthe Liberals were concerned.    Some Liberals had wanted renewal ona month-to-month basis;  this was not acceptable to Mr Steel, whoseletter spoke of continued co-operation &quot;into&quot; the next Session.    the liberals would not be committed to supporting the Government on any specific issue, but would be committed to giving their support in anyvote of confidence while the agreement subsisted.    Cabinet ministers had agreed on 26 June to renew the arrangement with the Liberalsprovided proper terms were obtained.    The basis for renewal nowproposed would provide a measure of stability without involving anycompromise of principles, and he proposed that the Cabinet should agree to it.In discussion there was general support for the renewal of thearrangement with the Liberals on the basis proposed, though it waspointed out that the escape route provided at the end of the first paragraph of Mr Steel&apos;s letter would allow the Liberals to pull out at a
critical moment, eg over a breach of the 12-month rule for pay increases.    It was suggested that the arrangement should not appearas exclusive, and that an opportunity should be taken on a suitable occasion to bring out publicly that a minority Government needed toconstruct ad hoc majorities for its policies by obtaining what supportwas available.    In this connection, concern was expressed at recentpublic suggestions that the Government also had an arrangement withUlster Unionist Members of Parliament;   such suggestions, althoughwithout foundation, caused unease to the Social Democratic LabourParty and the minority community in Northern Ireland.    The point was made that any pixblic explanations should stress that consultationwith the Liberals in no way cut across consultations by the Governmentwith its own supporters.In discussion of particular matters mentioned in Mr Steel&apos;s letter thefollowing points were made -a. There was no explicit promise to guillotine theEuropean Assembly Elections Bill, but this seemed likely to benecessary and the exchange of letters could be regaided as animplicit commitment.b. The proposed undertaking to investigate urgently furthershort-term measures to reduce teacher unemployment could give rise to difficulty, since it was not clear what measures would be feasible, but Mr Beith, the Liberal spokesman on education, had gained the impression that nothing stood in theway of taking such measures.c. It seemed likely that agreement would be possible withthe Liberals and with the Trades Union Congress on a complexscheme of profit sharing which could be published in aconsultation document;  any legislative provisions on thissubject would be extensive, and would form a major part of aFinance Bill.d. The proposed undertaking to introduce legislation toprovide help for first-time buyers, on the lines suggested inthe Green Paper on Housing, would involve a risk that parliament would insist upon turning the Green Paper proposalfor loans into a scheme of grants which would be about three times as expensive and would involve an unacceptable shift inthe overall balance of housing expenditure.    The reasons forproposing loans rather than grants had been explained to the liberals who had not, however, committed themselves on thispoint, and it might be preferable to promise to consider theintroduction of legislation.
e.       The final sentence of Mr Steel&apos;s letter joined togetherconsultations on priorities in The Queen&apos;s Speech andconsultations on three particular matters which might well notappear in the Speech;  it would be desirable to draw a clear distinction between the two.THE prime MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the arrangement with the Liberals should be renewed on the basis of Mr Steel&apos;s letter and the draft reply.    Theexchange of letters would be made public later that day.    Before then he would explain to Mr Steel the problems which had been raisedconcerning teacher unemployment and help to first-time buyers;  andthe Secretary of State for the Environment should see Mr Ross, theLiberal spokesman, to make the position on the latter problem clear tohim, although Liberal support for a scheme of loans would notnecessarily avert attempts in Parliament to convert it into a schemeof grants;  further consultations would also be needed with the liberals on teacher unemployment.    He would also point out toMr Steel the uncertainty about the interpretation of the final paragraphof his letter, and secure a change in the grammar to bring out the distinction between consultations on The Queen&apos;s Speech andconsultations on the three specific matters mentioned;  the Liberalsunderstood the severe constraints there would be on parliamentary time next Session.    He would consider how best to make clear thenon-exclusive nature of the arrangement, without carrying anyimplication that the Government also had an arrangement with the ulster Unionists:  his Parliamentary report to the Labour party conference might provide a convenient occasion for this.Consultation with the Liberals involved difficult issues and should be conducted by members of the Cabinet themselves; it should not normally be done by junior Ministers, and then only within strictguidelines.    Finally, he wished on behalf of the whole Cabinet to congratulate the Lord President of the Council and the Chief Whip ontheir success in bringing the Governments Parliamentary business toa conclusion by the end of July and to express thanks to all the Whips.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.3
FOREIGNAFFAIRSBolivia2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Relations with the Developing countries had recently discussed the question of aid to Bolivia in the light of theBolivian Governments behaviour over human rights.    By a majoritythey had agreed with the view of the Minister of State for overseas development that she should net at present approve aid for theBolivian State mining sector and that she should seek alternativeacceptable projectr in Bolivia, possibly in the health field.    Thus this issue had been satisfactorily resolved.    This was, however, an example of the way in which it was now necessary to take account ofthe human rights issue alongside the whole range of industrial and commercial considerations when making decisions in the aid field.Departments were engaged in working out the lines of a policy whichwould ensure in future that human rights aspects were brought intoconsideration.The Cabinet -Took note.rhodesia previous reference:CM(77) 27thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had recently had useful discussions in Washington with the United StatesPresident and Secretary of State.    During these discussions he hadbeen guided by the conclusions of the Cabinet at their meeting on7 July.    These involved general approval for the constitutional proposals and for the Zimbabwe Development Fund (ZDF) andendorsement of our efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement.    TheCabinet had accepted the need for a British Resident Commissionerduring the transitional period, although it was hoped that hisadministrative responsibilities could be reduced.    They had however been reluctant to contemplate a Commonwealth Force with commitment to participation by British troops.    As regards the constitution, theproblem was that it contained few assurances for the Whites.    TheZDF could play an important part in compensating for this.    the americans ware fully in agreement with the general line we proposedto take.    Details were still being v/worked out by British and Americanofficials in Washington and there would be further discussion in the ministerial Group on Southern Africa the following week.    Our objectnow was to put forward firm proposals and take our stand on them.They would need to be seen to be fair in order to be acceptable to theinternational community.    The sort of package we were working onwould meet this requirement.    There was a chance, though possiblynot a very strong one, that our proposals might be accepted.    He didnot wish to suggest that the prospects were very promising, but therewere some small signs of light.4
THE PRIME MINISTER said that it would be necessary to watch thesituation carefully in the period up to the Rhodesian election.    the ministerial Group on Southern Africa would ensure that our proposals were within the limits set by the Cabinet, but he hoped that theCabinet would give the Group some discretion within the framework ofwhat the Cabinet had agreed.    The situation at present was very fluid.This might provide an opportunity in which, by making a firm stand,we covld affsct the course of events.    It was encouraging that the americans were giving us full support.    If it were possible to achieve a settlement in Rhodesia ard also one in Namibia, this would make an enormous contribution to the future stability of Central Africa.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.5
3. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that, followingdiscussions which he had had with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Governor of the Bank of England, it had been decided tomodify the link between sterling and the dollar.    This operationhad gone successfully.    Sterling had moved up and was at that moment standing at $1. 74.    The new situation carried problemsbut they were the problems of success, and the Chancellor of theExchequer would explain the background to the Cabinet.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the pound had reached its lowest level against the dollar in October 1976.    following the agreement with the International Monetary Fund and the measureswhich the Government had announced in December sterling had movedup to $1. 71.    It had then seemed prudent to maintain it at that levelin order to provide stability.    As a consequence we had taken in a lot of money and our reserves were at an all time high: but it had seemed too risky hitherto to allow the market to move sterling upbecause of the risk of a serious reverse if the pay negotiations failed.The situation had however now changed because the deutschmark andthe yen had strengthened while the dollar was very weak on account ofthe United States trade deficits.    In some ways these deficits werehelpful to us, but the United States had still done little about theirenergy problem and there were disadvantages for us in sterling beinglinked to an unstable currency.    It had therefore seemed right tobreak the existing link with the dollar at a time when this wouldunderline the stability of sterling rather than the reverse.    The Bankwere now managing sterling by relation to the Effective Rate Index(ERI) which was a weighted average of the currencies of our maincompetitors.    Prior to breaking the link with the dollar the effectiverate had been about 60. 7.    Sterling had now risen and stood at $1. 74and 61. 5 effective rate.    The decision to manage sterling in relationto the ERI was not of course a permanent one and we could return tothe dollar link later if this seemed desirable.    The course which hadbeen taken would result in inflation being lower than it would otherwise have been:  very broadly a 1 per cent increase in the effective rate would lead to a reduction of between j and ^ per cent on the Retail Price Indexabout six months later.     It would therefore be popular with the unions and help psychologically in a number of ways.    On the other hand weshould not be carried away by a sense of euphoria since the presentposition reflected the weakness of the dollar as well as the strengthof sterling.In discussion it was suggested that a fundamental decision had beentaken the consequences of which needed careful weighing.    It hadbeen implied that the effective rate might have to go over 62. 0 in orderto give the Bank some headroom in deciding the moment at which to start intervening to stop sterling going even higher.    An effectiverate above 62.0 would have damaging consequences to our export priceSTERLINGEXCHANGERATE
competitiveness and there should be collective discussion before this was allowed to happen.    The right course might well be to reduceshort-term interest rates to reduce the attractiveness of sterling to overseas investors.    On the other hand it was pointed out that therewere limits to the extent to which the authorities could go againstmarket sentiment.    It had also to be taken into account that prior tobreaking the link with the dollar the long tap gilts market had beenvery dcrmant.    An immediate effect of breaking the link had been active buying of long tap stock, anci this ir turn might send downshort-term rates and thus stop sterling rising further.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that in thelong run there could be a delicate balance to be struck between thearguments for reducing imported inflation or maintaining pricecompetitiveness:  but over the next few months it would be very important both to exploit every opportunity of reducing our inflationrate and to stimulate the interest of the non-banking sector in purchasing long-term debt.    He would remain in close touch with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Governor of the Bank of Englandover the management of the short-term situation.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of the discussion.
DISPERSAL:MINISTRY OFDEFENCEPreviousReference:CM(76) 40thConclusions,Minute 34. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Privy Sealand the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP(77) 8 5) and a memorandumby the Secretary of State for Defence (CP(77) 86) about the dispersal ofMinistry of Defence (MOD) staff to Glasgow.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Governments dispersalprogramme had been announced in 1974 but so far no visible progress had been made.    Firm decisions on the make up and timetable of theprogramme were now long overdue and the continuing uncertainty wasvery damaging to the Government, especially in Scotland,    The onlyremaining issue was how the target of 6, 000 MOD staff for Glasgowwas to be met.    He had now reached agreement with the Secretary ofState for Scotland on a MOD package for Glasgow involving 1, 500 staffmoving to the Anderston site by 1983-84 and4, 000-4, 500 to the St.. Enochrssite by 1985-86 to 1987-88.    The Secretary of State for Defence had however not accepted this package and in particular the proposal tomove to Anderston 970 Service personnel management -staff who hadbeen in the original package offered by MOD.    To take account of thereduction in MOD numbers in London aa a result of the Defence review and defence cuts the 1974 programme had already been relaxed infavour of MOD by reducing the commitment to Cardiff from 5, 000 staff to 4, 000-5, 000 staff and by allowing dispersal from MOD offices in thesouth of England generally and not just London.    Further reductions inthe 1974 programme should not be made.    The MOD were carrying out a feasibility study on the proposal to move the 4, 000-4, 500 jobs on service and civilian pay to St. Enoch&apos;s but the urgency was such that he recommonded that an announcement should be made now on the lines proposed in Annex B to CP(77) 85 rather than wait for completion of the study.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that it was only with considerable difficulty that he had managed to prevent an explosion of criticism in Scotland about the lack of any clear reaffirmation of theGovernments commitment to the 1974 programme.    An announcementnow was most important.    He had said 12 months ag* that the St. Enoch&apos;ssite would be ready for occupation in 1982-84;  he now accepted reluct-predominantly that occupation could not be before 1985-88.    This slippage would go down very badly in Scotland and made it all the more important tostick to the 1974 target on numbers and to get a firm commitment byMOD to it.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he appreciated the need for an early statement and the desirability of sticking as closely as possible to the 1974 programme.    But in 1974 the London-based MOD staf* totalled 19, 000.   The Defence Review and successivemanpower cuts would have trimmed this figure to about 13, 000 by1983-84.    Some reduction in the number to be dispersed had to bemade to take account of this changed situation;  this had beenacknowledged already for Wales by the reduction of staff to go to Cardiffbut no account had been taken of it in respect of Scotland.    He thoughtit reasonable to reduce the Glasgow figure to 4, 500.    It was difficult8
to see how he cculd commit himself to any higher figure without firmknowledge of the level of defence expenditure until the mid-1980s whendispersal would start,    The package proposed in CP(77) 85 included970 Service personnel management staff.    These staff were responsible for military mobilisation and moving them to Glasgowcould gravely prejudice their ability to carry out this vital rolesatisfactorily.    He could not accept that they should go.    If it were decided that it waa essential to keep to the 1974 target on numbers itwould therefore be necessary to look at other alternatives.    But theonly real possibility so far identified would be to move the qualityassurance staff from Woolwich and Bromley and this had been ruled out by Ministers when considered earlier.    If Cabinet could not agreeto reduce the target for Glasgow to 4, 500 as he would prefer then he proposed that the announcement should say &quot;up to 6, 000&quot; staff wouldbe dispersed by &quot;1985-86 - 1987 -88&quot; and that further consideration should then be given to the make up of the Glasgow package.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a discussion, said that it was reasonable for the 1974 target for MOD staff to be reduced to take some account of the reduced numbers who would be available fordispersal by the mid-1980s.    This had already been done in respectof dispersal to Cardiff and some reduction should also be made forGlasgow.    The operational arguments against dispersing the service personnel management staff seemed very strong.    It was howevermost important that dispersal to Glasgow should be started as soon aspossible, and that there should be certainty about the Government&apos;intentions.    1, 500 MOD staff should be moved to Anderston in 1983-84and 3, 500 to St. Enoch&apos;s over the period 1985-86 to 1987-88.    Thequality assurance staff should not be moved because of theGovernments commitment to regenerate the inner cities and thesocial problems of   the Woolwich area.    Thetie were firm decisions and the Secretary of State for Defence should work out with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Lcrd Privy Seal detailed arrangements tc implement them.    The draft announcement at annex B to CP(77) 85 should be amended accordingly but thedecision on the St. Enoch&apos;s site should be presented as one to move&quot;up to 4, 000 staff&quot;.    The announcement should be made in the form ofa Written Parliamentary Answer on 29 July.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office28 July 19779
