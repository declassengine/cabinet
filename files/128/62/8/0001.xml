LEGISLATIVE PROGRAMME 1977-73 12.                QUEEN&apos;S SPEECHES 6Prorogation Speech 6Opening Speech 6ii
LEGISLATIVE 1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordPROGRAMME President of the Council (CP(77) 88) setting out the recommendations1977-78 made by The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee(QF) for the legislative programme in the 1977-78 parliamentary session.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was mostimportant to avoid an overloaded programme, but this would bedifficult.    Next 5ession&apos;s programme wa?i largely dictated by theGovernment&apos;s commitments to introduce two Devolution Bille and toreintroduce the European Assembly Elections Bill, by the probability of an autumn Finance Bill, and by the fact that there were ten Bills inthe Essential category.    These Bills constituted a full legislative programme.    It would, however, be a thin one, and QF accordingly proposed that three further Bills should be promised in the Speech -those on shipbuilding redundancies, inner cities and help for xirst-timehome buyers.    An approach would also be made to the Opposition to seek their agreement to Second Pleading Committee procedure forseveral other Bills.    In addition, QF proposed the unusual step ofmentioning in the Opening Speech a number of other attractive Billsv/hich the Government would wish to introduce as soon asParliamentary time could be found.In discussion of the overall size of the legislative programme it waspointed out that the programme proposed by QF would probably involve some trimming of Recesses, and might also require an autumn spill-over, although planning would proceed on the basis that the DevolutionBills and Essential Bills must be got to Royal Assent by the end ofJuly if at all possible.    There would, however, be a shortage of legislative business for the Lords early in the Session.    TheMerchant Shipping and Northern Ireland Judicature Bills wereimportant and badly needed measures, and it was suggested that theyshould be put into the programme and introduced in the Lords at the start of the Session even if there was insufficient time subsequently totake them through the House of Commons.    These were bothuncontentious Bills (apart from the provision in the Merchant ShippingBill on foreign takeovers) which were likely to go through the Commonsmore easily after they had been scrutinised and amended in detail bythe Lords.    It might in the event prove possible to find time for themin the Commons;  and even if it was not, there would be advantage in having given them a run in the Lords and thus demonstrating theGovernment&apos;s commitment to them.    The Government were heavilycommitted to the Merchant Shipping Bill, in particular, and failure tointroduce it nexf Session might cause difficulties in relations with theNational Union of Seamen.1
On the other hand, it was argued that the Merchant Shipping andNorthern Ireland Judicature Bills were both lengthy Bills, which wouldrequire a day each on Second Reading in the Commons and which members of Parliament would then wish to examine in detail.    If theywere to be introduced in the Lords, pressure would build up to take them through the Commons, but this would not be possible withoutcreating serious overcrowding in the Commons in the summer.    Thisought clearly to be avoided, but failure to take the Bills through to royal Assent would undo ail the good created by their introduction andwould give an impression of sloppiness.    It was most important thatthe Government should be seen to be fully in control of theirlegislative programme, and that there should be no overcrowding, sothat Members of Parliament could have adequate time in their constituencies during Recesses and an autumn spillover could be avoided.The Cabinet then considered the individual Bills listed in Annex A to cp(77) 88.    In discussion of the Essential Bills in Part I of the annex, the following points were made.Civil Aviation Bill.    It was no longer proposed to include inthis Bill provisions amending the law in the light of the LakerSkytrain case.Power Stations (Financial Arrangements) Bill.    This bill would mark the start of a new programme of power stations,and seemed to warrant a mention in The Queen&apos;s opening speech.    It would be important that the Bill should be presented in the context of the Governments future policy onpower stations, to reduce opposition from constituencies inwhich there were General Electric Company factories whichwould not benefit from the order for Drax B.Weights and Measures Bill.    This Bill had to become law bythe spring of 1979 at the latest, and dealt with a sensitivesubject.    It might not be necessary to introduce it in thecoming Session.Company Law.    Although it was proposed to include in this bill some provisions not in the Essential category, these would relate to matters such as insider trading and the dutiesof directors on which amendments would be put down by theOpposition if these matters were not dealt with in the Bill asintroduced.    Such additional provisions would be popular, andit would be more advantageous to include them in the Bill fromthe start.2
In discussion of Bills to be introduced as soon as Parliamentary timecould be found, listed in Part III of Annex A to CP(77) 88, the followingpoints were made.Employment and Training.    This Bill would confer a general power to take measures against unemployment without the needfor specific statutory authority.    The Governments existingmeasures had stretched the present legal provisions, to thelimit, and a short Bill confined to the conferment of the newgeneral power might be regarded as virtually Essential.    those parts of the Bill relating to training might be dealt with in otherways.    It would not, however, be desirable to mention this bill in the Speech unless it was clear that there would besufficient Parliamentary time to get it through.Medical.    It seemed almost certain that the Opposition would agree to Second Reading Committee.    The Bill was almostready and could start in the Lords.Education.    The Liberals were keen that early action should betaken to implement some of the proposals in the TaylorCommittee&apos;s Report on the government of schools.Suppression of Terrorism.    This would be a Bill of somepopular appeal, in view of the wide public concern aboutterrorism.    The possibility of Second Reading Committeeprocedure was under consideration, but it might be concluded that the Bill waa not suitable for this procedure.Crown Agents.    The report of the Fay Committee, which wasexplosive, was to be published in November with a white paper.    Part of the problem with the Crown Agents had beenthe lack of any defined constitution.    The Government had promised in 1975 to introduce legislation to make the Agents a statutory corporation, and there would be difficulties if the FayReport was published but this legislation was not promised for next Session.    The Bill might well prove uncontroversial;  itwas probably suitable for Second Reading Committee and itcould start in iche Lords.    On the other hand, the formerdifficulties concerning the control of the Crown Agents had nowbeen put right and the final step of statutory incorporationmight not now be of vital urgency.    The Bill, on which draftinghad not yet started, would be lengthy, and if it was added to theprogramme some other Bill should be taken out.Consumer Protection:  Tobacco Substitutes and Additives.    ABill to bring tobacco substitutes and additives under theMedicines Act had been promised last year;  it would be short
and probably suitable for Second Reading Committee.    Whetherit would be better to include these provisions in a widerConsumer Protection Bill might depend on when the wider bill could be introduced.Nurses, Midwives and Health Visitors.    The Opposition were likely to agree to Second Reading Committee;  this Bill could beintroduced in the Lords, but would not be ready until the NewYear.In discussion of other Bills, listed in Part IV of the Annex to cp(77) 88, the following points were made*Official Secrets Acts.    It was yet to be decided whether the reference in the Speech should be drafted in terms of a white paper or of legislation.Films.    This Bill would be needed to increase the limit on public funds for the National Film Finance Corporation.    Ii; was proposed to add a passage to the Opening Speech to reassure the film industry that an increase would be proposed before thepresent limit was reached, though this might not be until the session after next.Electricity.    The existing central organisation of theelectricity supply industry was thoroughly unsatisfactory, with no proper provision for corporate planning.    A Bill of up to30 clauses was needed to provide powers to lay down a new structure for the industry, and should go through Parliamentwithout difficulty.    The Bill would not have great popularappeal, but was important to the industrial strategy, and to theunions and management in the industry.    This Bill might be combined with the Bill on Drax B, or it could be introduced asa separate Bill starting in the House of Lords.    It would be valuable to get the Bill a Second Reading, thus paving the way for serious preparations in the industry for the reorganisation,even if the Bill could not reach Royal Assent next Session.    Onthe other hand it was argued that, although there was clearly astrong case for the Bill, a 3ill of this kind was bound to attractclose attention in Parliament and possibly controversy;  and theidea of introducing it but not taking it through might wellrebound and put the Government in a bad light.It was also pointed out that although the Occupational Pension SchemesBill was not in the programme for the coming Session, it would benecessary to make clear, especially to the Trades Union Congress,that the Government had not given up their proposals for legislation onthis subject.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet generally endorsed QF&apos;s approach to next Session&apos;3programme     It was most desirable to avoid both the necessity for aspillover next autumn, which would limit freedom of action at thattime, and a period of heavy pressure and late nights in the Commonsnext summer.    The legislative programme should be planned on thebasis that the two Devolution Bills and the Essential Bills should become law by the end of July, if at all possible.    It had to be accepted that there would be relatively little business for the House of Lordsearly in the Session, but there were a number of Bills which could be started in the Lords if the Opposition agreed to Second reading committee procedure;  members of the Cabinet should note thatapproaches to the Opposition for this purpose should be made throughthe Chief Whip.    Some Bills in the Essential category also appearedsuitable for introduction in the Lords, and the Lord President of theCouncil would give further consideration to the possibilities.    Thelegislation to provide general powers to take measures againstunemployment would have some popular appeal, and the lord president of the Council and the Secretary of State for employment would consider whether this legislation should now be regarded as essential.    Legislation on the Crown Agents should not be mentionedin The Queen&apos;s Opening Speech, but the Ministerial Group which was toconsider the handling of the Fay Report should also consider the degree of urgency which should be attached to the legislation to incorporate the Crown Agents.      There was a strong case for early legislation on the electricity supply industry, but the problem was how to find the Parliamentary time, and whether a Bill now in theprogramme would have to be omitted in order to make room;  the lord president of the Council and the Secretary of State for Energy wouldgive further consideration to this.    Subject to the outcome of this further consideration of the Bills on employment, the Crown agents and the electricity supply industry, the Cabinet approved QF&apos;sproposals for the legislative programme.    The proposal to mention inthe Opening Speech a number of Bills not firmly in the programme would be discussed when the Cabinet considered the draft opening speech.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council and the other ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.5
QUEEN&apos;SSPEECHES2. The Cabinet considered the texts of the draft Queen&apos;s Speechesannexed to the memorandum by the Lord President of the Council(CP(77) 88).ProrogationSpeechThe Cabinet approved the draft Prorogation Speech, subject to the replacement of the second sentence of paragraph 3 on page 3 by a sentence to the effect that British Shipbuilders had acquired by negotiation a major part of vhe ship-repairing industry, and to one ortwo minor drafting amendments which the Secretary of State for industry would also send to the Lord President of the Council.OpeningSpeechIn discussion the general point was made that to avoid tediousrepetition the phrase &quot;continue to&quot; should be used sparingly.    TheCabinet then considered the text, paragraph by paragraph, and thefollowing points were made and amendments agreed:Page 12nd and 3rd paragraphs.    These paragraphs should be amended and run together to read as follows:    &quot;My Governmentreaffirm their policies in international relations and defence.They remain committed to the aims of peace and collective security;  and of detente, disarmament and prevention of the spread of nuclear weapons.    They will contribute fully to thework of the United Nations, the Commonwealth and the north atlantic Alliance. &quot;4th paragraph.    This should be amended to read:   &quot;my government, while working for policies which fully reflect theinterests of the United Kingdom, will play a full andco-operative part in the activities, the development and theenlargement of the European Economic Community. &quot;5th paragraph.    It was agreed that this paragraph would be improved by a reference to the United Kingdom&apos;s relations withEast European countries (comparable with the sentence, at the top of page 2, dealing with the Middle East) instead of restingmerely on the reference to participation in the currentAlliance studies of East/West relations.    The Lord chancellor would propose a form of words to the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
Page 22nd paragraph.    The following minor drafting amendments were agreed:  in the second line, substitute &quot;their proposalspublished in September this year&quot; for &quot;the proposals published on 1 September&quot;;  and in the third line, substitute &quot;will beready&quot; for &quot;hope&quot;.4th paragraph. It was agreed that this paragraph should be divided into four separate paragraphs, the first, second andfourth of which would read:&quot;The strengthening of our financial position and of the balanceof payments opens the prospect for a continuing improvementin the economy and the maintenance of financial stability.My Governments main objectives are the speediest return to full employment and a sustained growth of output.    In order to achieve these objectives my Government will give the highest priority to further reductions in the rate of inflation&quot;.&quot;My Government will continue to promote industrial training and to create and maintain jobs through manpower measures&quot;./Paragraph on North Sea oil/&quot;My Goverment will continue to work in close co-operationwith the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of BritishIndustry&quot;.The third paragraph, dealing with North Sea oil, should refer tothe Governments intention to use the opportunities now presented by North Sea oil to strengthen our manufacturing base and to achieve a lasting improvement in our industrialperformance.    It would also be desirable, however, to refer tothe implications of North Sea oil for living standards and improved public services.    The precise wording of the para-graph as a whole would need further consideration, and thePrime Minister would arrange for a draft to be circulated.5th paragraph.    It was agreed that this should be amended to read:   &quot;My Government will continue to urge internationallythat the stronger economies should take the lead in promoting a sustained growth in the world and that adequate official financeshould ta made available on appropriate terms to countries withcontinuing deficits in the balance of payments&quot;.
6th paragraph.    In the second sentence, the words &quot;forScotland and Wales&quot; should be omitted.Page 31st paragraph.    Doubt vas expressed whether the results of the consultations on the consultative document would be of sufficient importance to justify a mention in the Speech.    It wasagreed therefore to omit the paragraph.2nd paragraph.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Office had proposed the insertion of a reference to  continuing co-operationwith the Government of the Republic of Ireland, and theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland had indicated that hewould be content with this provided that the reference werestrictly limited to co-operation on security.    It was agreedtherefore that after the phrase &quot;supported by My armed forces&quot; theie should be a full stop and that the paragraphwould then continue:   &quot;My Government attach special importance to co-operation on matters of security with theGovernment of the Republic of Ireland.    They will continue to seek measures to strengthen the economy of Northern Irelandand improve its social environment&quot;.4th paragraph.    The wording of this paragraph on industrial democracy would have to be left over until the relevantMinisterial Group had decided what recommendations to make on the course which the Government should pursue.    The point was made, however, that it would in any event be desirable todetach from this paragraph the reference to legislation amendingCompany Law.5th paragraph.    It was agreed that this paragraph should be amended to read:   &quot;My Government will also hold consultationsabout encouraging profit-sharing through the tax system&quot;.Following this paragraph a new paragraph should be insertedreading &quot;My Government are considering further measures toassist small firms&quot;.6th paragraph.    The paragraph had been included in square brackets pending discussion by the relevant ministerial committee of a paper circulated by the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection.    It was agreed, however, thatif a reference to the review of competition policy was to beretained, the drafting of the paragraph should be revised to makeit more clear and straightforward.
7th paragraph.    The words &quot;to provide&quot; should be substitutedfor the words &quot;for the provision of&quot;.8th paragraph.    in the second sentence the word &quot;improve-ments&quot; should be substituted for &quot;further improvement&quot;.Page 43rd paragraph.    The words &quot;for the further development&quot;should be substituted for &quot;to sustain and promote further thedevelopment&quot;.5th paragraph.    Subject to the Secretary of State for theEnvironments views, the sentence should be amended to read:   &quot;A Bill will be introduced to renew and revive the innerurban areas&quot;.6th paragraph.    It was argued that there were severaladvantages in adopting the recommendation of The Queen&apos;speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QF) that a paragraphon these lines should be included in the Speech, setting out, inorder of priority, the Bills which the Government wished tointroduce as soon as sufficient time coold be found.    It wouldreassure those, such as the Post Office unions, who hadspecial interests which the Government had undertaken to meetby legislation as soon as possible;  it would dispel any idea thatthe Government had no further desirable measures of reform tointroduce, and it would leave open the possibility oflengthening the Session, without any shortage of Bills tointroduce, if this should later seem   desirable.    There was aparticular danger that if no mention was made in the Speech ofsuch Bills as those relating to merchant shipping or the right of post Office staff to take industrial action, the Governmentwould be accused of breaches of faith.    On the other hand, itwas argued that the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the Debate onthe Address provided a more appropriate and effective occasion for informing Parliament and the country of the measures whichthe Government would be ready to introduce when parliamentary time allowed, whether in the coming Session or the next.    Tointroduce into The Queen&apos;s Speech a catalogue of the kindenvisaged would be likely to invite ridicule.    Moreover, itsapparently exclusive nature would increase the difficulties ofthose Ministers whose Bills, such as the occupational pension Schemes and Road Traffic Bills, did not feature in it.There might also be some risk of encouraging Members ofParliament to jettison the Devolution Bills in favour of thoselisted.    It was suggested that at the most The Queen&apos;s Speechshould refer to &quot;other desirable measures of reform&quot;,possibly citing one or two as an example, but in any eventleaving the main exposition to the Prime Minister in his speech in the Debate on the Address.9
Page 51st paragraph.    It was agreed that the Home Secretary should consider a revised wording to brisig out the purpose of theproposals on broadcasting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinr t had agreed a number of amendments to the two draft Speeches.They had also identified several points in the draft Opening speech which required further consideration.    Of these the most importantwas the proposed paragraph dealing with North Sea oil, on which hewould circulate a suggested text in the light of the discussion.    On thequestion whether any reference should be made in the Speech to bills which it was hoped to introduce as soon as Parliamentary time could befound - whether the full list.proposed by QF or a shorter one - heshared the feeling of those members of the Cabinet who thought thatthe purpose of such a reference would be better served by a suitablepassage in his own speech in the Debate on the Address.The Cabinet -Tookncte, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office11 October 197710
