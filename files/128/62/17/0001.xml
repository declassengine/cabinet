.ROWN AGENTSCOMMITTEE OFINQUIRYPreviousReference:CM(77) 35thConclusions,Minute 61. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP(77) 113) on the form of a further inquiry into thefacts disclosed by the Fay Report on the Crown Agents and a draft statement to the House of Commons circulated with the letter m 7 December from the Private Secretary to the Prims Mfoiister to thePrivate Secretary to the Lord President.THE PRIME MINISTER said that as a result of the decision of theHouse of Commons on 5 December, he had the previous afternoondiscussed with the Ministers principally involved what might be themost suitable form of further inquiry.    They had concluded that theleast disadvantageous course would be a public inquiry under the tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Act, 1921.    This would be a heavyw*apon and would have a number of disadvantages.    The terms ofreference would also have to be carefully drafted in order to avoid the inquiry ranging too widely.    If Cabinet agreed he proposed to announce the Governments decision that afternoon in the Howse ofCommons in the terms of the draft which had been circulated.    Heenvisaged that the necessary Resolution in both Houses ofParliament should not be moved until after the Recess.right discussion, there was general agreement that there w?.s no alter-natlvo but to accept the wishes of the House of Commons for a public inquiry, even though it was argued that the Governments original proposal for a private inquiry, the report of which would have been published, would have been preferable.    A public inquiry was bound to damage the reputations of individuals against whom allegations weremade even though those allegations subsequently proved unfounded.It should however be possible to avoid involving the interests of thoseforeign and commonwealth governments for whom the Crown Agentshad been acting.   The choice of public inquiry lay essentially between a Select Committee and a 1921 Act Tribunal.    In favour of the former,it was argued that since the affairs of the Crown Agents had extendedover a considerable period of time during which there had been bothConservative and Labour Governments, the interests of Governmentand the Opposition were involved.    The legitimate interest of theHouse of Commons could only be satisfied by a Select Committee.A major concern was to establish what had gone wrong and to ensurethat steps were taken to prevent a recurrence.    A further inquiry should be directed to this rather than to the culpability of individuals.A statutory Tribunal was not properly equipped to discharge thatfunction, whereas the House of Commons was uniquely qualified to doso.    On the other hand, it was argued that the Fay Committee had reported on this issue and that the Government, had already taken steps to remedy the ambiguous constitutional position of the CrownAgents which was at the root of many of the difficulties.    other considerations pointed clearly towards a judicial inquiry under the1921 Act.    Even though the arguments in the debate in favour of apublic inquiry were not always mutually compatible, it was clear thatthere was a strong desire in the House of Commons to ensure that theculpable, be they organisations or individuals, should be identified,
and that those who had refused to come forward with evidence to theFay Committee should now be forced to do so.    The report of theRoyal Commission on Tribunals under Lord Justice Salmon in 1966had concluded emphatically against Select Committees for investigatingallegations of public misconduct.    Such matters, that report had said,should be entirely removed from political influence.    There was alsothe question of public confidence in the Government and in Parliament.Many people who in their minds linked the House of Commons with theGovernment would regard an inquiry by a Select Committee as a furthercover-up.    A further factor was that an inquiry by a Select committee might be terminated by a dissolution of Parliament possibly before its work had been completed.    The terms of reference of the inquiry would need further confederation, including the question whether they should extend to organisations as well as individuals.    There was, however,general agreement that the inquiry would need to cover the conduct ofthose involved in the private sector as well as in the public organisa-tions cone erne doIn further discussion, the draft for the Prime Minister&apos;s statement tothe House of Commons was endorsed subject to a few amendments.    Itwas agreed that it should be mere forthcoming in saying that theGovernment accepted - rather than did not intend to stand in the way of -the wishes of the House (paragraph 1).    The final sentence of thesecond paragraph should be so divided as to draw a clear distinctionbetween the need as far as possible to protect the legitimate rights ofthe innocent and the problem of identifying those responsible for the affairs of the Crown Agents to which the Fay Report had drawn attention.    The first sentence of the third paragraph should be amended to say that the appointment of a Tribunal would effectivelyprevent criminal proceedings being taken in future against any witness,and that civil proceedings might be affected.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas strong support for the view that the original proposal for a privateinquiry under Sir Carl Aavold but with publication of its findings,remained the best solution and the only one that could be relied upon toprotect effectively the reputations of the innocent.    However theCabinet agreed that in the light of the debate in the House of commons on 5 December, a public inquiry was now unavoidable.    The general view of the Cabinet was that a Tribunal under the 1921 Act, was theleast disadvantageous form of inquiry though it would be lengthy and costly.    He would announce that afternoon the Governments decisionto accept the view of the House and propose the establishment of sucha Tribunal.    The Resolution by both Houses needed to establish theTribunal would not be moved until after the Recess.    In the meantime,careful consideration should be given to the terms of reference and composition of the Tribunal.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.2
PARLIAMENTARY   2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.In discussion of the Supply Day debate on the Polish shipbuildingorder on 12 December, the point was made that the Government hada good defence to any criticisms, which could be put strongly.    the size of the intervention fund and the way in which it would be usedhad been explained to the House, but to reveal the actual rates of subsidy in particular cases would undermine our negotiating positionin competing for orders.In further discussion it was pointed out that two Orders were to betaken on 15 December after the main business, and that late nightson Thursdays were unpopular with Scottish Members.    It was explained in reply that arrangements of this kind had to be negotiatedand were not solely within the Government&apos;s control;  members would be free for nearly a month following the conclusion of thebusiness on 15 December.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it was absurd that the Government should be criticised forwinning orders for British shipyards which would otherwise have gone overseas, and the Government should not adopt any defensiveattitude.    The Secretary of State for Industry, who would be speakingin the debate, would attack the Conservatives strongly and on abroad front, putting the Government&apos;s case in terms of the thousands of jobs which had been saved in the shipyards and in associatedindustries rather than in terms of the detailed operation of the intervention fund.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.FIRE SERVICEDISPUTEPreviousReference:CM(77) 37thConclusions,Minute 33. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENTsaid that following informal discussions which had taken place duringthe last two days he had that morning met the Joint Secretaries of theNational Joint Council (NJC) to give them guidance on theGovernments attitude.    This guidance accepted the need for a formula to determine future rates of pay, which would be negotiatedin the NJC and which might define the relationship between the pay of firemen and other workers.    The Government could not agree toan increase above 10 per cent for the year beginning 7 November 1977,
but would agree to the full implementation of the formula in twoapproximately equal stages in November 1978 and November 1979,would undertake its share of the cost through the rate support grant,and would, exceptionally, guarantee that this phasing in would notbe thwarted by some unforeseen adverse change in economic circumstances.    The Government also hoped that negotiations would continue on the reduction of the 48 hour week, on the basis ofmore productive working practices which permitted a more cost-effective use of time not spent fire fighting.    He would be making astatement about this development in the House that afternoon, andthere would then be urgent negotiations in the NIC on the envisagedformula.    There could be no certainty of a successful outcome, butif all went well the negotiations could lead to the recall of the fire brigades Union Conference the following week.In discussion some concern was expressed about the possible repercussions of a settlement on these lines, with a firm forwardcommitment, on other groups in the public sector - and in particularin the water industry - which were also restive and looking forsettlements above 10 per cent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Home Secretary on this development.    On the question of repercussions, the guidance to theNJC spoke only of a &quot;defined relationship&quot; with the pay of other workers, but did not specify what relationship there might be withother workers in the public sector;  and the relationship would haveto be negotiated, just as ather public sector groups would have tonegotiate cn their pay claims.    The guidance provided a usefulformula which might point the way to a more rational relationship between pay in the public services and in private industry on linesrecently advocated by Mr David Basnett of the Trades Union CongresThe possibility of developments on these lines, and the question ofrepercussions, were matters which could be brought up in theCabinet&apos;s general discussion on pay policy in a fortnight&apos;s time.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.
4. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that the objectives which he and the Secretary of State forScotland had pursued at the Fisheries Council earlier in the weekhad been to maintain our ability to take national conservationmeasures at any rate until effective Community measures existed;to secure immediate conservation measures and notably an adequateNorway pout box;  and to resist any interim settlement for 1978 basedon an unacceptable quota allocation for the United Kingdom.    the objectives had been preserved in spite of strong pressure from theCommission and the Germans, to which the Irish had eventuallysuccumbed, to give up our right to take national conservationmeasures.    There had in the event been no suggestion of atemporary arrangement for 1978.    The prolonged discussions had shown distinct movement by other Member States andCommissioner Gundelach had at last indicated that the commission was now in a position to amend its earlier proposals which were quite unacceptable to us.    Considerable progress had been madeon conservation measures and it seemed possible that some formulaon fishing zones beyond 12 miles might prove possible.    It had beendecided to hold a further meeting in mid-January and to &quot;stop theclock&quot; so that, for this meeting, the Belgians would continue to hold the Presidency.    In the meanwhile existing Community and nationalconservation measures would remain in force.    This procedure had at least avoided a confrontation during the simultaneous meetingof the European Ccuncil.In a brief discussion it was emphasised that it would still be difficultto secure a credible outcome in relation to our demand for a preferential zone of 50 miles.    Full Ministerial consideration wouldbe necessary before the next Council meeting.Summing up, THE PRIME MINISTER said that the ministerial committee on European Questions should consider the matter earlyin January.The Cabinet -Took note.5COMMUNITYAFFAIRSCommonFisheries PolicyPreviousReference:CM(77) 37thConclusions,Minute 5
MILK PRICESPreviousReference:CM(77) 18thConclusions,Minute 35. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs(CP(77) 109), seeking decisions on certain questions that the ministerial Committee on European Questions had been unable to resolve.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD,introducing the discussion in the absence of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary,  said that the main question for decision was the level of the producer price for milk for the period january to March 1978.    His colleagues in the Ministerial Committee hadbeen ready to agree to a compromise figure of 48 pence per gallon,but he now sought the agreement of Cabinet to a figure of 49. 2 pence.This was the minimum required in his judgment to restore confidence and to arrest the decline in the size of the national dairy herd whichwas continuing despite the favourable weather of the past year.    a figure of 49.2 pence would provide a net margin per cow of  91,equivalent to  4000 per annum for the average herd, to provide fora return on capital, finance for new investment and an income tothe producer.    This net margin could be compared with figures forearlier years of decline in the national herd ranging from  26 to  49.In discussion it was argued that a producer price of 47. 4 pence,compared with the average for April to December 1977 of 46. 5 pence,should be adequate to restore the confidence of producers since itwould still allow for a very substantial increase in the net marginper cow.    There was no precise link between profitability and the size of the national herd.    A producer price of 47. 4 pence could be financed by twc phased increases of ^p in the retail price during1978 whereas a producer price of 49. 2 pence would require animmediate increase of lp in the retail price and a further increasebefore the end of the year.    It would be important for theGovernment1 s counter-inflation policy to avoid such a further increase.    The suggested compromise figure of 48 pence wouldprovide a net margin per cow of  88.    This would represent ahandsome increase in profitability by the standards of theGovernment&apos;s incomes policy; it would be only slightly smaller thanthe margin of  91 which would result from a producer return of49.2 pence.On the other hand it was argued that even a price of 49. 2 pencewould disappoint producers and might not arrest the decline in theherd.    In that event consumers would suffer in the longer term.The Government&apos;s policy of expansion would lose credibility and thebalance of payments would suffer.    The compromise figure of48 pence would not be seen as adequate for a period of seasonallyhigh production costs.    Producers would benefit from a prospective increase in the value of Community prices in the spring but this
increase was likely to be minimal.    Meanwhile they were facing amarked increase in the cost of replacements for their herds.Particular account should be taken of the situation in NorthernIreland, where employment was heavily dependent on agricultureand returns from milk production compared unfavourably with thosein the Republic.    There was a risk of smuggling which had alreadynecessitated costly counter-measures in the meat sector.In discussion of the future of the retail price it was stated that itwould be possible, with a retail price of 1Z.\ pence per pint and aproducer price of 49.2 pence per gallon, to avoid announcing theneed for a further increase until November 1978 when a review ofdistributive costs would be completed.    It would however be unwise to make an announcement in those terms because this would appearto prejudge the outcome of the review.    On the other hand it waspointed out that the deferment of an increase in the retail price would entail a larger increase when the time came.    It was also suggested that there would be advantage in a firm commitment tohold the retail price unchanged for as long as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said tnatCabinet agreed by a majority that the producer price for milk forthe period January to March 1978 should be 49. 2 pence per gallonas proposed by the Minister of Agriculture.    It was generally agreedthat the retail price of 12^ pence per pint from 1 January 1978 shouldnot be further increased before November 1978 but that no suchcommitment should be made public, though it would be possible toindicate that no further increase would be needed for some considerable time.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to be guided accordingly.
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (CP(77) 11?), setting out further recommendations inthe light of Cabinet discussion the previous week for a general5 per cent increase to board members of nationalised industries and certain analagous groups.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that he had, as requested, consideredvarious arrangements which could be adopted to give effect to ageneral 5 per cent increase.    There were no special factors, otherthan pay levels, which would provide a consistent and generally acceptable means for distributing the increase.    In his view, if asolution on these lines were to be adopted, the best course was theone described in the paper which gave a flat rate of 5 per cent increase to all board members, but with increases up to 10 per cent for those earning less than  13, 000 a year.    He had found no wayof easing the pension position of existing board members in such a situation..    Inland Revenue rules did not allow pensions to be related to notional salaries which the employer had no intention of paying.These proposals if adopted should extend not only to nationalised industry board members, but to a number of other groups described in his paper.    Since the paper was prepared, the Lord Advocatehad drawn his attention to the need to cover also the Law commission for Scotland.    This solution would lead to problems with the top salaries Review Body (TSRB).    These proposals amounted to around three settlement for the nationalised industry board members from 1 January, and this looked like a rejection of the Sixth Reportof the TSRB.    It also carried an implied threat to the implementation of their next report due on 1 April 1978.    The implications for doctors, the higher Civil Service and other top salary groups wouldbe clear.    Some members of the TSRB might decide to resign inprotest and this could affect the position of the other two reviewbodies.    For these reasons he strongly recommended Cabinet toconsider an alternative course, which was to postpone a decision until TSRB Report 10 was ready in April 1978.    In that event, hewould want to make an early announcement of the government&apos;s decision.In discussion, it was argued that it would be better to defer adecision, and to consider the position afresh when the 10th Reportof the TSRB was received in April.    This would give theGovernment a freer hand and would avoid giving offence to themembers of the TSRB and similar review bodies.    Theirresignation at this stage would be embarrassing for the Governmentand would cause serious problems with the groups whose pay theyreviewed.    The Government would probably have to approveincreases of 10 per cent anyway, since this was the norm which was now being established for the present pay round.    It would be easier to do that in April on the basis of the 10th Report of the TSRB.8PAY OFNATIONALISEDINDUSTRYBOARDMEMBERSPreviousReference:CM(77) 38thConclusions,Minute 4
On the other hand, it was argued that the decision would become more difficult if it were postponed.    April would be a bad time tohave to agree to large pay increases, particularly if the Governmentwere then engaged in discussions with the Trades Union Congressabout a further stage of a structured pay policy.    A 10 per cent increase all round would not be inconsistent with the line being taken with other negotiating groups.    But the absolute sums involved were very large for some individuals, and it would be difficult to defend10 per cent settlements for them, while seeking a lower outcome forother groups, cuch as steel workers.    It would be better, therefore,to proceed as tentatively discussed at the previous meeting, by ageneral increase of 5 per cent with some marginal improvementfor the least well paid members of the nationalised industry boards.In this way the impact on the rest of the pay round would beminimised.    It would however be necessary to explain the positionto the TSRB and to seek to avoid their resignation.    This would be particularly difficult, given the nature of the undertakings they hadreceived in July, when they were told that the new pay policy would permit a start to be made on the removal of pay anomalies such asthose of the groups for which they were responsible.    The best course would be to reassure the TSRB that the 10th Report due inApril would be considered on its merits although of course also inthe light of the pay policy then in force.    The arrangements madefor nationalised industry board members should apply to analagousgroups like the Law Commissioners.    It was however pointed outthat members of the boards of Natior-al Enterprise Boardsubsidiaries were paid at commercial rates.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that amajority of the Cabinet favoured an immediate increase of 5 per cent for all nationalised industry board members with the possibility of increases up to 10 per cent for the less well paid of them but taperedso that those earning more than  13, 000 a year received only per cent.    Similar arrangements should apply to the other groupscovered by the TSRB who did not receive a stage one increase underreport no. 6.    The Review Bodies should be encouraged to continue their valuable work, in establishing market rates forthe groups theycovered but it would be for the Government to decide how much ofthose market rates could be paid in present circumstances.    TheLord Privy Seal should announce the decision before Christmas, interms which should be agreed with the other Ministers concerned andcleared with the Prime Minister.    He should also co-ordinatearrangements for the Ministers concerned with the nationalised industries to notify the Chairmen of those industries before any statement was made;  and he should consult the parliamentary secretary, Privy Council Office about publicity handling.9
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Lord Privy Seal and other ministers concerned to be guided accordingly,THE 1974RECOMMENDA-TIONS OF THETHREE REVIEWBODIESSecond StagePayments7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Seal(CP(77) 108) covering a memorandum by officials on the problem of implementing the second stage of salary increases recommendedby the review bodies the implementation of which had been prevented by the introduction of pay policy in 1975.    Cabinet also considered a memorandum (CP(77) 111) by the Attorney General setting out thelegal considerations which bore upon the decision whether or not to implement the second stage payments for consultants and the first stage payments for members of the board of British Nuclear FuelsLimited (BNFL) who like the members of the boards of nationalised industries had not received those payments.THE ATTORNEY GENERAL said that his advice was that there wasa clear pre-pay policy contractual link between ENFL Directors&apos;salaries and the corresponding Civil Service grades, and that a claim by the BNFL Directors for stage one payments similar tothose awarded to senior civil servants at the beginning of 1975 would therefore succeed in the courts.    With the consultants the problem was over second stage payments.    The previous advice given by the solicitor General and the Lord Advocate in August had been that the consultants had a good claim to the second stage increase due on1 April 1977.    Having reviewed the papers, he was of the opinionthat the Government were fully entitled to resist in the courts a legalclaim for the second stage payment from either 1 April 1977 or1 April 1978.    The Solicitor General now agreed with him on bothcounts.    The Lord Advocate agreed with him in respect of1 April 1977 but felt that the consultants had a good claim from1 April 1978.    There was however no doubt that the consultants hada strong moral claim for a settlement originally due on 1 April 1976,and that it would be difficult to defend deferment of the settlementbeyond 1 April 1978.In discussion, it was generally agreed that in the light of the newlegal advice a decision on the consultants&apos; claim should be deferred until the next report of the Doctors and Dentists Review Body was available in April.    In discussion of the BNFL case it was argued that the Government could not ignore the advice it had now receivedfrom its law officers.    No employer should refuse to pay the legalrate for the job until it was taken to court.    If the Government had10
intended to override its legal obligations, it should have included the groups within the Remuneration and Charges Act 1977.    On theother hand, it was argued that to concede the right of BNFLdirectors to the stage one payments would encourage other groupscovered by the review bodies to pursue legal claims and could also have wider repercussions.    The legal advice was not conclusiveand in any case if the BNFL Directors had a legal claim it was because of a defect in the 1977 Act contrary to the intention ofParliament in passing that Act.    It would be better to allow theBNFL Directois to take their case to court, if necessary, and forthe Government to lose.    At least it would then be clear that theGovernment was forced to act contrary to pay policy because of anoverriding obligation.    As ioy any moral obligation there were many other cases in which the wider requirements of the pay policy andthe national interest, had necessarily taken priority over theGovernments moral conrmitments.    Moreover the Directors ofBNFL were analogous to mambars of nationalised industry boardsrather than to civil servants and should be treated on the same basis as the former.TKE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no second stage payments should be made to national Health Service consultants and the other groups concerned at this stage.    The matter should be reconsidered in April in thelight of the report expected then from the Doctors and DentistsReview Body.    A majority of the Cabinet also agreed that the claim of the Directors of British Nuclear Fuels Limited to the stage oneincreases given to corresponding grades in the Ci^dl Service at thebeginning of 1975 should be resisted but that they should be awardedpay increases on the same lines as those agreed under the previousitem for the board members of nationalised industries.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office8 December 197711
