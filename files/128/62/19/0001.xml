The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(77) 116) which discussed in broad terms the outlook forthe remainder of Phase 3 of the pay policy and tentatively what should come after Phase 3;  and a note by the Secretary of State for Energy(CP(77) 117) which set the pay situation in the wider context ofGovernment strategy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that so far the currentpay round had gone better than most people had expected at last July.There was evidence of strong and growing public support for the policy,especially in accepting that there could not be special cases gettingmore than 1C per cent.    It was noticeable that public support for thepolicemen and the firemen had eroded as the situation developed.There was also evidence of growing positive trade union support forthe policy.    The 12-month rule was holding absolutely and trade union leaders were showing more than just a grudging acquiescence in the10 per cent guideline.    This was noticeable in the decision of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) General Council the previous day not toundertake a campaign in support of the firemen.    National and regional organisers in some unions were now taking a distinctly lessmilitant line.    All delayed Phase 2 settlements had now been made within the guideline and over 90 per cent of workers covered bymonitored settlements for the current round had settled within the10 per cent on earnings guideline.    The Ministerial Sub-Committee on pay Negotiations (EY(P)) had been meticulous in taking drift fully intoaccount in approving offers.    Settlements so far in the current roundcovered many fewer workers than at this stage last year but the localauthority manuals settlement now concluded could lead to a number ofother major public service settlements within the guidelines, forexample gas manuals, water manuals, and National Health Service(NHS) ancillaries.    But there were some unsatisfactory features.Few settlements had been achieved well within the 10 per cent guide-lines and there had been two major settlements which breached thepolicy - Fords and Vauxhali.    Because nearly all settlements had beenright up to the maximum allowed within the guideline there was littleroom for flexibility to deal with anomalies.    However the kittyprinciple had been applied in some settlement in order to give a fewpercentage points more to skilled workers.    It was difficult to getinformation about productivity deals in the private sector but theevidence was that about one firm in five was making deals and that theyadded 5-10 per cent to earnings.    Hence his assessment that the overall effect on average earnings of the productivity deals would be to add one to two per cent.    It was not possible to say what percentage ofschemes were genuinely self-financing though he thought that more ofthem might be so than had been the case in the 1960s.     This was partly because of the potential for increased productivity within industry andpartly because employers could not afford to pay for bogus schemes.If the round went on in accord with the pattern so far he expected the
outturn on earnings to be in the range of 10-15 per cent.    This marriedin quite closely with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)estimate of 13-14 per cent.    But it was necessary to keep in mind that only 15 per cent of the total workforce had so far made settlements andthat the level of settlements would only be kept down if the presentunremitting monitoring by Ministers continued.    He noted in a widercontext that the lag in reaching settlements had meant that wage increases had provided less stimulus to the economy than might other-wise have been the case but that later on as many backdated settlementscame into effect there would be a correspondingly greater stimulus.For the rest of the round his biggest concern was the build-up offorward commitments in the public sector.    The firemen had alreadybeen given a guarantee which would in effect ensure that they would get3-7 per cent more in each of the next two years than they would other-wise have got.    The commitment to the police would have to work outin practice in terms which were at least as good.    Dealing with thevarious Review Bodies reports, for Servicemen, doctors and the top salaries group might require further forward commitments to be givenin order to obtain settlements within 10 per cent in the current round.However it would be necessary to try to restrict forward commitmentsas tightly as possible within the public sector.    In general hisassessment, wets, following a review of forthcoming settlements by officials, that it might be possible to get all the main settlements withinthe guideline provided there was no breach anywhere.    But a breachcould have a rapid domino effect.    Key groups in relation to the rest ofthe round were the power group - gas, electricity supply, and coal-miners - where a careful study of the interconnections betweennegotiations and how they might best be influenced would be necessary;and the white-collar groups in the public services where the mainsettlements came up in April and a problem would be how to handleReview Body recommendations.     The Home Secretary had conducted a forward review of contingency arrangements for the rest of the round.This had underlined the great difficulty which would arise if troops hadto be used in more than one situation at once.    This added practicalweight to the political argument that troops should only be used wherethere was a clear overriding national interest or where lives were at stake.Looking beyond the current round his assessment was that there wouldbe a greater need than ever for moderation in pay because of theeffects of North Sea oil on the economy.    Since the Second World Warthe country had achieved poor productivity growth compared with its competitors but had paid similar wage increases.    To achieve this ithad been necessary to depreciate the currency in order to staycompetitive in prices.    This in turn had led to increased inflation andthe need for wages policies.    But North Sea oil would make it moredifficult to continue to depreciate as it would not be possible tomanipulate exchange rates against the flow of the market.    So
moderation in wages was needed.    He believed, however, that it was now more possible to achieve this than in the past.    New attitudes and understanding were gaining ground in the unions and in the public mind.Leaders of the public service unions in particular recognised the needfor a public sector pay policy as had been obvious from recentstatements made by Mr Basnett, General Secretary, General and municipal Workers Union, and Mr Drain, General Secretary, national and Local Government Officers&apos; Association.    He believed that talksshould begin with the public service unions shortly after Christmasabout pay policy for the public sector.    It would not be possible to runa pay policy for the public sector if the private sector was completelyout of control.    However he thought it too early as yet to be talking tothe TUC about pay policy generally after round 3.    Mr Murray, theGeneral Secretary of the TUC, had however expressed a wish toreactivate the regular talks between senior Ministers and TUC leaderson wider economic matters and he hoped these could start again in thefirst half of January.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he was concerned to ensure that pay policy was considered in a wider economicand social setting.    He thought at present there was too muchconcentration on pay policy and an exaggeration of its importance.Looking to the future it was clearly essential for the Government toretain the continuing support of the TUC.    This was not quite sosecure as it might appear even though they would wish to support theGovernment fully in a run-up to a General Election.    Nor was he sosure that public opinion was firmly behind positive pay policy.Conservative opinion in the country might support the policy becausethey saw it as anti-union and the floating voters might be converted bythe anti-trade union approach in the media but he doubted if Labourvoters genuinely backed pay policy.    It was necessary to define a newperspective for economic development in the future, in concert with the tuc, and to find the appropriate place for pay policy within thatperspective.In discussion of the prospects for the rest of the current round therewas general agreement that the 10 per cent guideline must continue tobe rigorously policed and that no exceptions could be allowed.    Asregards the power sector, it was suggested that the gas manuals wouldprobably settle within the guidelines and that the electricity supplyworkers might follow.    Their power was so great that they could notin practice use it fully although they could by limited action bring muchof the economy to a standstill.    It was difficult to forecast the outcome of the present internal struggle within the National Union of Mine-workers;  but the pressure for productivity deals could cause a lot oflocal disputes.    The Civil Service settlements came relatively late inthe round and if other groups had been held within the guidelines thereshould not be too much difficulty about getting a settlement at 10 per
cent on earnings.    There was however growing evidence of militancy.Some Civil Service unions felt particularly strongly about postpone-ment of pay research and were concerned that the Government would attempt to force on them a settlement well below 10 per cent.Discussions with union leaders might help to ease these fears.    In thelocal authority and related fields the local authority manuals settlement and the local authority construction workers settlement had both beenwithin the guidelines.    The main remaining anxiety was the watermanuals.    Industrial action within the water industry would have amassive and immediate impact on the life of the country which itwould be virtually impossible to rectify by contingency arrangements.But there was now a distinct possibility that a settlement within theguidelines would be achieved.    An offer had been made and the resultsshould be known in January.    The Armed Forces could not be treatedas a special case in terms of breaking the guidelines but it was argued that they had spec ial features which required adequate consideration.Tney had no union representation, did not benefit from wage drift andhad dri occasions to accept exceptional working conditions.    It wouldbe helpful if the Armed Forces Pay Review Body could be given a steerto give figures on how far the Forces have slipped behind theiranalogues.    The Armed Forces should get a forward commitment atleast as good as that given to the police and the firemen.    In the NHSthe local authority manuals settlement would be helpful in achievingsettlements with the ambulancemen and ancillaries.    Handling the doctors and dentists would depend on the Review Body report and on how the discussions on a new contract for the consultants went.    Againthere was likely to be a problem over forward commitments.    In theeducation field teachers were expected to settle within the guidelineand the main problem was the university teachers who had sufferedbadly from the effects of earlier rounds of pay policy.    Justicerequired that something should be done to rectify their position andalthough their settlement for this round would have to be within theguidelines there might have to be a forward commitment.    The factthat they had not taken militant action should not rule this out.    InBritish Rail and in other nationalised industries such as steel and shipbuilding where large losses were being made it was arguable thatsettlements well below 10 per cent should be the order of the day.Attempts were being made to secure lower settlements both in british steel and British Shipbuilders.     This was proving extremely difficultbut there were some signs that the unions might be brought to accept that if wage settlements near 10 per cent were conceded they wouldhave to be associated understandings about rationalisation of theindustries.    In Northern Ireland Harland and Wolff and Shorts hadsettled within the 10 per cent guideline.    In general there was agree-ment that the round had gone well so far as compared with earlierexpectations.    But the number of forward commitments was particularly worrying and was already beginning to place constraintson the shape and effectiveness of pay policy from August 1978.    The4
reopener clauses conceded in the case of the local authority manualsand in one or two other cases were weakening the validity of thel?.-month rule even though they were in very general terms and linkedto a fall in living standards which seemed unlikely to occur.    Therewere problems too at the top and bottom ends of the incomes scale.There was at present no effective means of influencing top salaries inthe private sector in the way in which the Government were trying to doin the public sector.    In relation to low pay the effect of wages councilawards and Schedule 11 awards tended to conflict with the pay guidelines.In discussion of the future of pay policy beyond the present round therewas broad support for the need to continue an incomer policy in some form although it would be inadvisable to make much of this in public atthe present time.     It was argued that such a policy was now anessential part of modern Government at least as regards the public sector.    There were signs of growing public under standing of the link between pay, prices and unemployment on which it was important tobuild.    The public should be led to see pay policy not simply as ameasure in times of crisis to protect the economy and real living standards but as a positive contribution to better standards of living.It was still far too common a belief that pay policy meant sacrificesbut there was now an opportunity to advance public thinking and getsupport for a long-term approach to pay restraint.    However the view was also expressed that incomes policies had never worked for very long, if at all, in the past and that previous attempts by a labour government to sustain a pay policy over a long period had beenpolitically disastrous.    The TUC had voted in favour of a return to free collective baigaining and there could be no hope of getting thesupport of the rank and file of the trade union movement for a further period of wage restraint.    Workers did not like to be lectured on whatthey should get by those who earned more than they did and they were well aware that many groups were always able to escape the effect of a wage policy which always applied most rigorously to the employedworking class.    Rather than thinking in terms of further pay restraintthe Government should be developing the concept of the social contract and the social wage and agreeing with the trade union movement on abroad economic and social strategy within which the trades unions wouldtake a responsible attitude to wages.In further discussion it was argued that any new guidelines for payrestraint after the current round would need to allow room to deal withsome of the serious problems which it had not been possible to tackleduring the last two years and which in some cases had been madeworse.    These included differentials between skilled and unskilledgroups and between management and supervised grades, and theproblems of skill shortages.    A pay policy which was compatible withthe objectives of the Governments industrial strategy needed to be developed.   It also had to be capable of handling serious problems of
differentials and comparability within the public services.    There wasa need for fresh thinking in this area and it might be desirable to commission a study from the Centred. Policy Review Staff or to embark on a joint study with the TUC.    It was also argued that a continuation of incomes policy meant that new institutional arrangements might benecessary.     So far the success of the current round had owed much tothe detailed work undertaken by EY(P) but this did not provide asatisfactory basis for a long-term approach.    Previous experience hadnot thrown up the ideal answer.    There might be a role for an institution separate from Government which could give authoritativeadvice.    On the other hand the really major decisions still had to be amatter for Ministers and there were dangers of over-centralisationand lack of flexibility if new central institutions were established.   Thework of any institution would in any case have to be informed by government policy.    It was argued that such a policy should include notonly agreement on the size of any increase in the aggregate national wages bill but also guidelines on distribution, however vague.    The12-month rule should also be a central feature of any new guidelinesbut it should be possible to allow exception to this and other guidelineswhere circumstances justified it.    Examples might be where it was essential to get restructuring within a company, such as british leyland or an industry like steel.    An institution separate from government might be helpful in validating such exceptions.In further discussion it was generally agreed that it would be essentialto involve the TUC in developing further thinking about the developmentof pay policy after the present round.    There would be an opportunityto make a start through taking up the willingness of public sector tradeunion leaders to talk about an approach in the public sector, building onthe ideas expressed recently by Mr Basnett.    The TUC were alsowanting to resume discussions about broad economic issues and thiswould be essential in any case in the run-up to the Budget.    Some formof broad understanding with the TUC on social and economic objectiveswould also be necessary against the possibilities of a GeneralElection next year.    There was a case for some contingency planning in case that understanding had to be worked out quickly.    It would notbe right to attempt to discuss broad economic and social objectiveswith the TUC without reference to pay policy any more than pay policy could be considered as a separate issue.    Different views were expressed however on the extent to which agreement with the TUC on broad economic and social policies would in practice enable them toenter into an effective agreement on wage restraint or would foster a responsible attitude in wage demands.    It was not clear, for example,that offering a Wealth Tax and introducing improved Child benefits would in practice lead to a lowering of wage objectives particularly ata local bargaining level, although it would be important in securing theagreement of TUC leaders.    There was a risk that the unions wouldnot be able to deliver their part of any social contract and that the
price for Government might be too high.    However the improvedeconomic climate provided a more promising background for conductingdiscussions with the TUC than had been the case in the past.    It wasalso argued that, although th* TUC stood in a special relationship tothe Government and to the Labour movement, the Government shouldalso take into account the views of other groups.    In particular efforts should be made to gain the co-operation of the CBI and to bring home tothem their responsibilities for helping to make wage restraint work inthe private sector.    The views of the public at large also needed to betaken into account.    It was necessary to recognise also that the tradeunion leaders had to carry their rank and file with them.    There was a risk that by drawing the leaders close to Government thinking theycould become isolated from their members.    Ministers had perhapsgiven insufficient support to trade union leaders when they had defendedpay policy in the past and should try to do more in future.    Thislinked with the general need to build up public support for pay policyand the biggest boost for this would be to achieve success during thecurrent round.    It was necessary to recognise also that the weakness of the trade union movement was a factor limiting their ability to work with Government in carrying out policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thediscussion had been an extremely helpful analysis both of the presentround and the problems and possibilities for the succeeding period.Things had gone much better than expected in July and great credit forthis was due to EY(P) and the officials supporting them.    This work would have to go on throughout the current round.    There was howevernow a good prospect that the public sector would be kept to 10 per centalthough the miners and the power workers in particular constitutedspecial risks.    In the private sector it was necessary to bring home to the CBI their responsibilities.    They had told the Government that unless public sector pay was held within the guidelines they could do nothing in the private sector and the Government had so far kept its part of the bargain.    The CBI should now be pushed to do more.    even with the success so far there was no room for euphoria.    A 9 per centinflation rate next year was still too high in relation to our competitorsabroad.    The Government should be quite open with the public about this.    For the next round whatever guidelines were adopted the aimmust be to get average settlements down to around 5 per cent althoughit did not follow that there should necessarily be a guideline expressedin that way.    It was also essential to ensure that any future policyreinforced the need for long intervals between settlements - 12 months should be regarded as the minimum period.     The present support fromthe public and from trades unions for the pay policy stemmed not only from a fear which people had of inflation and unemployment but because they were now really feeling the benefits of the policy.Ministers should use all opportunities to speak up in favour of thepolicy either through their contacts with trades unions or through
public speeches.    During the rest of the round it would be particularly important to minimise the number of reopener clausesbecause they departed from the principle of the 12-month rule and thenumber of forward commitments because of their impact on pay after this round.    In relation to current problems it had been suggestedthat if the firemen had not returned to work after Christmas an improved offer might have to be made.    In his view that should not becontemplated.    Looking beyond the current round it was encouragingto see that the leaders of the public sector union were coming torecognise the need for a public sector pay policy and the Secretary ofState for Employment was free to discuss possibilities withMr Basnett and others.    It would be necessary for Cabinet to decidelater when talks might begin with the TUC on a more formal basis aboutthe longer-term approach to pay policy generally.    In the meantimethere should be no public discussion of the possibility of a phase 4.However, these talks should not be long delayed and the Governmentshould not wait until the TUC declared themselves ready     The TUCwere now willing to talk generally about the whole of the economicfield and it was not realistic to leave pay out of this particularly as itwas so central to their activities.    In relation to the longer term itwould be helpful if the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretaryof State for Employment either jointly or separately put forward a paper or papers on possible approaches, including institutionalpossibilities.     The Cabinet would have an opportunity to consider the wider economic strategy in January when the paper by the Secretaryof State for Energy (CP(77) 117) would again be on the agenda.    it seemed to him that there was now a growing convergence of policies and thinking, as had been evidenced by their discussion last week onthe use of the benefits of North Sea oil.    There was, however, a need to clarify relationships between economic and social aims and to thinkfurther about a new accord with the TUC and its relationship to paypolicy.    Development and exposition of thinking on these mattersmight help to give a new impetus to the TUC-Labour Party liason committee.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Employment to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office23 December 1977
