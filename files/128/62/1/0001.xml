PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.    In connection withthe Supply Day debate which was now expected to take place on  July, it was noted that the handling of the Motion by the ScottishNational Party and Plaid Cymru to reduce the salary of the PrimeMinister would depend on the attitude of the Conservatives, whichwas not yet known;  they might not wish to support the nationalistparties, whose main theme would probably be the lack of progress on devolution.Energy THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he hadCommission informed Mr Frank Chappie, General Secretary of the Electrical,Electronic, Telecommunication and Plumbing Union, of the decision by the Ministerial Committee on Energy that the Energy commission should comprise 7 trade union representatives, 7 representatives of management in the energy industries and 7 independents:  and he had raised no objection.    Mr Murray, General Secretary of the TradesUnion Congress, had still to be informed, but he proposed to make an announcement of the composition of the Energy Commissionbefore or during the debate on energy on 28 June.    It would not,however, be possible to announce the membership at the same time.The Cabinet -1. Took note.Debates on In connection with the debates on a number of Northern ireland northern Ireland       measures on 30 June and 1 July, it was noted that questions were likely to be raised by Ulster Unionists about the Government1 attitude to the new Government of the Irish Republic, relatingparticularly to Fianna Fail&apos;s views on Irish unity and to security.Such questions might also arise on a Parliamentary Question to be answered that afternoon.    The general line of reply would be that theGovernment would deal with the new Government of the Republic inthe same way as its predecessor, that the people of Northern ireland had decided by referendum by a large majority that they wished toremain part of the United Kingdom, that close co-operation with theGovernment of the Republic was continuing and that terrorism was acommon enemy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theway in which the Government&apos;s attitude to the new Government of theRepublic was expressed required careful thought; it was important toavoid any risk of prejudicing relations with them.    The Secretary ofState for Northern Ireland would let him see in advance the text of what he proposed should be said in Parliament on these matters.1
2The Cabinet -   .2. Took note.
EUROPEAN 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the SecretaryASSEMBLY of State for the Home Department (CP(77) 62) covering a draft ofELECTIONS BILL  the European Assembly Elections Bill.previous reference:CM(77) 22ndConclusions,Minute 1THE HOME SECRETARY introducing his memorandum said that theBill had been drafted, in accordance with the conclusions reached bythe Cabinet at their meeting on 26 May so as to provide for the regional list electoral system set out in part II of the Bill unless theHouse were to resolve in favour of the simple majority system witha single transferable vote (STV) in Northern Ireland set out inpart III.    This provision for a choice by resolution was designed toavoid the procedural objection which the Speaker might otherwiseraise to a Bill which proposed two incompatible electoral systemswithout a means of choosing between them.    It would also accord with the desire of the Liberal Party to avoid a vote on the choice of electoral system this Session because the Speaker would be unlikely to allow a reasoned amendment on Second Reading which wouldanticipate the choice.    In practice however it was likely that the choice would actually be made on the basis of an amendment in committee on the lines of Annex B to his paper.    Under the regionallist system, the electoral regions in England would be based oneconomic planning regions except that Greater London would form aseparate region.    Since there would thus be no need for boundary commission recommendations the regional list system would enableAssembly elections to be held in May/June 1978, whereas this wouldbe impracticable under the simple majority system unless parliament were prepared to accept Boundary Commission recommendationswithout representations and enquiries.    Under the proposed regionallist system votes would be cast for individual candidates but wouldalso count for their Parties in accordance with the arrangements described in Annex B to the White Paper on Direct Elections.    Seatswould be allocated to Parties in proportion to the votes cast, using the highest average principle.    The Liberal Party were not howeverentirely satisfied with the structure of the Bill, for reasons whichwould be explained by the Lord President of the Council.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that Cabinet hadearlier contemplated that the simple majority system might berelegated to a Schedule to the Bill.    This possibility had been mentioned to the Liberals in preliminary discussions.    More recentlyin discussions on the present text the Liberals had recognised its technical superiority but had expressed a strong preference onpresentational grounds for relegating the simple majority provisions to a Schedule.    There was little practical difference between thesetwo possibilities and he had concluded, with the agreement of theHome Secretary, that nothing would be lost by acquiescing in theLiberal preference.    The procedure for making a choice in favourof the simple majority system would be essentially the same as under
the Bill circulated by the Home Secretary.    This procedure wouldin any event have to be made clear when a Bill was published,though it was not the intention that the choice should be made this session.In discussion there was general agreement with the alternativeform of the Bill proposed by the Lord President of the Council.    Itwas noted that the fixing of a date for holding Assembly electionswould be expressed in the Bill as being at the discretion of the HomeSecretary.    This had the advantage from the point of view of feeling in the Party of apparently keeping open the possibility of holding suchelections simultaneously with Westminster elections, but anyattempt to persuade other Community countries that the timing of assembly elections should conform to that of Westminster electionswas bound to fail.    The Government could not publicly resile fromtheir commitment to us^ their best endeavours to hold Assemblyelections on a date to be agreed in May/June 1978 without incurringthe cdium of responsibility for the failure of such elections to takeplace.    A new situation might arise if the House chose the simple majority system and thus made it impossible to fulfil our best endeavours.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion on the form ofthe Bill said that Cabinet were agreed that the Bill should be presented on 24 June with the provisions for the simple majorityelectoral system incorporated in a Schedule as proposed by theLord President of the Council.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary to arrangeaccordingly for the presentation of the Bill andto explain to the Lobby the procedure by whichthe House could choose the simple majorityelectoral system.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he proposed that the Governmentshould make a recommendation in favour of the regional listelectoral system in terms designed to avoid unnecessarilyantagonising those Government supporters who favoured the simple majority system.    There might be no need for any formalannouncement about this: the position could be made clear inlobby briefing.4
In discussion it was argued that the form of the Bill as now approvedby Cabinet gave sufficient preference tc the regional list systemwithout the need for a positive recommendation in its favour whichmight offend some Government supporters.    The view was also putforward that a recommendation in favour of proportional representation for European Assembly elections would inevitably be regarded asforeshadowing proportional representation at Westminster.    It would accordingly provoke united opposition from opponents of the system and from opponents of our membership of the Community, and itwould be seen as gravely damaging to the interests of the LabourParty.    It would transform the British Party system paving the way for coalitions and the undermining of the legitimacy of Governments.These consequences were too high a price to pay for Liberal support.In any case such a major constitutional change would be an appropriatematter for a Speaker&apos;s Conference and should not be forced onParliament by a Cabinet decision.On the other hand a large majority in the Cabinet argued that theGovernment could not remain equivocal without inviting ridicule andwas therefore bound to advocate the system proposed in its own Billin reasonably positive terms.    Indeed some felt that there were clearadvantages for the Labour party in the regional list system for european elections.    A recommendation to this effect need not however be made provocatively, and should not be ill-received inthe context of the decision to allow a free vote.    Reference of theissue to a Speaker&apos;s Conference was in no way a more democraticprocedure and there was plainly no question of seeking to force therecommendation through Parliament.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion on theGovernments recommendation, said that there was a clear majority in favour of making a recommendation in favour of the regional listelectoral system in measured terms as proposed by the Home Secretary.In the present Session Ministers would have a free vote on the principleof Assembly elections and on the choice of electoral system in theunlikely event that this stage were reached.    It would however be preferable if Ministers who could not support the Government on these issues were able to abstain or avoid being present.    In the interests ofsolidarity no Ministers should vote against the Government on other issues arising in proceedings on the Bill:  and no Ministers should speakagainst the Bill or the Government&apos;s recommendation.    Cabinet ministers should make the position clear to their junior Ministers.The Cabinet -3. Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.4. Invited the Home Secretary to announce theGovernments recommendation in favour of the regionallist electoral system to the Lobby.5
COUNTERING 3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home SecretaryUNEMPLOYMENT      (CP(77) 64) setting out the recommendations of the Ministerial group on Unemployment among Young People (GEN 27) on measures to relieve unemploymentsTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the recommendations from GEN 27needed to be seen against the worsening unemployment figuresespecially among young people and long term unemployed adults.New measures were needed.    GEN 27 recommended unanimouslyacceptance of the Manpower Services Commissions (MSC) proposalsfor an integrated programme of training and work experienceopportunities for young people in the 16-18 age group, providing130, 000 places.    Apart from the Chief Secretary, Treasury, GEN 27also recommended provision of an additional 10, 000 places in further education (FE) aimed specifically at unemployed youngsters and thosein need of remedial education;  and extension of the YouthEmployment Subsidy (YES) until 31 March 1978.    GEN 27 did notthink that there should be any immediate improvement in educationalmaintenance allowances (EMAs) but recommended that officials should be asked to make a broadly based study of support arrange-ments for pupils and students continuing their education beyondschool leaving age.    For adults GEN 27 endorsed the MSC proposalsfor providing 8, 000 places for unemployed adults in supervising the youth programme and for introducing a new Special TemporaryEmployment Programme (STEP) in place of the existing Job CreationProgramme.    The MSC had proposed 15,.000 places in STEP but,apart from the Chief Secretary, GEN 27 recommended increasingthis figure to 25, 000 in order to protect the existing level of provision for the 19-24 age group and to concentrate among those over 25 on those unemployed for 12 months or more.    GEN 27 hadbeen unable to agree on whether the Job Release scheme, whichexpired at the end of this month, should be extended until 31 March1978 as proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment.    the costs of all these measures would be a charge oi. the contingency reserve.    The Secretary of State for Employment and the chief secretary expected to be able to achieve savings on the estimates setout in Annex A to CP(77) 64, especially for 1978-79, through a more realistic assessment of the rate of build up of the schemes.    ButGEN 27 regarded it as essential to cast no doubt on the target of130, 000 places in the MSC programme for young people.    Theexpenditure on these measures would be a charge on the contingency reserve.In discussion of the proposals for young people there was warmsupport for the MSC proposals.    They represented a significant andimaginative step forward and had the backing of the General Councilof the Trades Union Congress (TUC).    Presentationally it would be particularly valuable to be able to say that, when the new programme was fully operational, all autumn school leavers unable to find employment would be guaranteed the offer of a place in the programme by the following Easter;  and it was accordingly important that the
MSC should be persuaded to accept that this would be possible.    TheMSC had agreed that the phasing of the programme could be flexiblein order to reduce the costs in 1978-79 and that they would be willingto see what staff economies might be made to reduce the manpowerimplications of their proposals, other than for the Careers Servicewhere the figures were regarded as irreducible.    The proposed 18 a week allowance would replace a number of different ratespaid under the present Job Creation arrangements; the TUC had agreed not to press for the rate for the job on the basis that trainingwas provided and had accepted a common allowance providing it was at least  18 a week.    The introduction of a common allowance of 18 for those in the MSC programme would highlight the inadequacy of present discretionary arrangements for financial support for16-18 year olds at school or in further education.    The study ofpupil/student support arrangements recommended by GEN 27 wastherefore urgently required but it would be undesirable to announce the study until it had been completed and conclusions reached.In further discussion it was argued that the MSC programme for young people should be complemented by an expansion of 10, 000places in non-advanced FE, as proposed in the GEN 27 report.These extra places would be specifically for unemployed young people on supplementary benefit, and others needing remedialeducation before they could benefit from the MSC work experienceor training courses.    The Council of Local Education authorities had agreed that any extra money provided would be used solely tohelp the unemployed and arrangements would be made to ensurethat this was so.    On the other hand it was argued that expansion ofFE was not directly relevant to countering unemployment and that to commit expenditure now meant pre-empting other options.    It was accordingly preferable to consider this proposal as part of the public expenditure Survey rather than to accept it now.    Extension of theYES to 31 March 1978 was desirable because it would be damaging to announce its termination at the same time as announcing a new programme which would not be fully operational for some time.    Itwould however be desirable to announce now that the scheme would end on 31 March 1978.In discussion of the proposals for unemployed adults it was arguedin favour of a new STEP expanded to 25, 000 places that it would otherwise be difficult both to maintain the present level of provisionunder the job creation programme for the 19-24 age group and tobias STEP in favour of the long term unemployed over the age of 24.It was also argued that the achievement of the 8, 000 places forunemployed adults as supervisors in the youth programme might notbe possible.    However doubts were expressed about the feasibility of achieving a 25, 000 programme in the timescale envisaged.    Theriwas a risk that Cabinet might commit money for this purpose which7
would pre-empt other options and then not be fully taken up.    Thiswas however primarily an argument for a more realistic assessment of costs.    Extension of the Job Release programme until31 March 1978 would reduce the Unemployment Register by 30, 000by the end of the year and was the only scheme which acted directlyon labour supply.    Withdrawal would be seen as a blow to the assisted Areas to which it was at present restricted.    Howeveralthough the number in employment taking advantage of the schemewas increasing most still came from those on the UnemploymentRegister of whom many were occupational pensioners; the schemewas therefore largely cosmetic and the  16 million cost of its extension could be more uuefully employed.    An extension of thescheme limited to those in employment had however much to commend it and would reduce the costs by about half.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment could take great credit for an impressive andimaginative plan to provide an integrated programme of opportunities for unemployed young people which marked an impressive advance.The Cabinet endorsed the MSC programme for 130, 000 places for young people, subject to annual review.    They agreed that 10, 000extra places should be made available in full time non-advancededucation and that the YES should be extended until 31 March 1978though the announcement of acceptance of the MSC proposals shouldmake it clear the YES would then finish.    They endorsed theproposals for replacing the Job Creation Programme for adults by8, 000 places for adult supervisors in the work experience courses for young people and for a new STEP for 25, 000 places:   eligibility for those aged 25 and over should be limited to those unemployed for12 months or more.    The Job Release scheme should continue until 31 March 1978 but be restricted to those in employment.    Thecost of these measures should be accepted as a charge on the contingency Reserve but the Secretary of State for Employment andthe Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster general should consult with the Chief Secretary, Treasury with aview to reducing costs especially in 1978-79 while maintaining thenumber of jobs to be provided.    There should be a study by officials of support arrangements for those continuing education beyondschool leaving age but there should be no public reference to this study.    The Secretary of State for Employment should announce theGovernment1 s decisions in a statement to the House of Commons onWednesday 29 June, the text of which should be agreed with theSecretary of State for Education and Science and Paymaster General.In consultation with the Parliamentary Secretary, Privy CouncilOffice, he should take steps to secure maximum publicity for thenew measures and should arrange for speaking notes to be madeavailable for the use of all Ministers.    The Secretary of State for employment should consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer aboutthe terms in which a reference to the forthcoming Governmentannouncement should be made at the European Economic CommunityTripartite Conference in Luxembourg on Monday 27 June.8
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theSecretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly.education in SCHOOLSA ConsultativeDocument4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science and Paymaster General and theSecretary of State for Wales (CP(77) 63) to which was annexed adraft consultative document on education in schools.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that the text of the draft consultative document took account of comments mede by her colleagues in earlier discussion and correspondence, and she would make further amendments to take account of comments made by the Secretary ofState for the Environment and the Secretary of State for Scotland onthe need to make it more clear that the proposals as a whole did not involve public expenditure commitments beyond what had already beenagreed.    She considered that Section III on the criticism and debateabout schools would make a more arresting introduction to the document and she proposed to bring it forward accordingly.    Thecovering memorandum drew specific attention to paragraph 99 of the document, dealing with the needs of ethnic minorities.    Views hadbeen invited from a wide range of bodies, including the representativesof minority groups, on the recommendations of the House of CommonsSelect Committee on Race Relations and Immigration which had urged the collection of education statistics on an ethnic basis.Statistics about the ethnic origin of pupils and teachers was a pre- -condition of positive discrimination in favour of minority ethnicgroups.    But it wa3 an explosive subject, and she considered that itwould be wrong for the Cabinet to take a view on it until the consultations were completed and reactions known.    The style of the document suffered from the need for it to be addressed to aspecialised educational readership as well as to the general public.It was important to enlist the support of the majority of teachers forthe proposals in the document which, though they were phrased withan eye to the sensitivities of the teaching profession and local educationauthorities, would entail major changes which many teachers wouldnot welcome.In discussion the view was widely expressed that the document did not bring out with sufficient clarity and conviction the initiatives and changes of direction which it proposed or the philosophy which underlayit.    The descriptive and analytical style of the document, as well as^
its length, would reduce its public impact.    In particular, it was argued that the drafting paid too much attention to the sensitivitiesof the teaching profession and other educational interests.    Whetheror not much of the present criticism of the standards of teaching andlearning in schools was misplaced, it reflected public concern; andit was arguable that the cause lay in radical changes which had takenplace over the last decade in the role and methodology of teacherswhich had been promoted, in a largely unsupervised way, by the teaching profession itself and which imposed a considerable strain on resources.    Against this, it was pointed out that the EducationMinisters had no real powers of control:  resources were providedthrough the Rate Support Grant without any central government control over the direction and quantity of their allocation toeducational expenditure.    Even in relation to the introduction of comprehensive secondary education, it was unlikely that the courtswould regard the additional powers in the 1976 Act as overriding theinterpretation which had been placed on the 1944 Act by tneTameside judgment.    Unless therefore the Government wereprepared to see radical changes in the powers of the EducationMinisters, including those governing the allocation of resources,there was little alternative but to proceed by persuasion and inco-operation with local education authorities and the teaching profession.In further discussion, the following detailed comments were madeon the text of *b.e draft document:a. Although paragraph 171, in the chapter on proposals and recommendations, said that it was essential that schoolsshould be accountable for their performance, paragraphs and 10, to which this summary referred, did not bring out what was meant by accountability, particularly in terms of sanctions, or how it might be improved.    The propoaslswhich had a bearing on this, particularly those on standards and assessment, were dealt with elsewhere.b. The concept of a core curriculum, to which a gooddeal of attention had been paid in the public debate, was referred to only obliquely in paragraph 66.    This and section V as a whole should more clearly reflect publicpreoccupation with this aspect of school education and shouldbe couched in more positive tsrms.c. At their first meeting, held the previous day, theAdvisory Council on Race Relations had expressed themselvesfirmly in favour of the collection of statistics on an ethnicbasis for such purposes as educational provision;  and although10
consultations with wider interests were still in train, therewas no reason why paragraph 99 of the document should notexpress a provisional Government view subject to the need to complete these consultations.d. Paragraph 103 contained much that should apply tothe Government&apos;s educational philosophy generally, and it was questionable whether it should not be given greater prominencein a more general context than the needs of the handicappedand the other disadvantaged.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral feelirg in the Cabinet was that the consultative document,as drafted, did not do justice to the basic aims and initiatives whichwere largely embodied in it and which the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General had herself brought out more clearly in the discussion.    It was essential that the publisheddocument should strike the right balance and make the necessarypublic impact.    The remedy might well lie in a considerably shorterdocument consisting of an expansion of the proposals andrecommendations at the end of the report with much of the earlierdetailed description and analysis either being omitted or relegatedto an annex.    They recognised the importance of publishing the document before the Summer Recess in order to enable some of the detailed proposals to be followed up with local education &quot;authoritiesbefore the next academic session.    The Secretary of State for Educatioand Science and Paymaster General should therefore urgently recastthe draft in the light of the points which had been made:  she should then discuss it informally with the Secretary of State for the environment, the Secretary of State for Social Services and theSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection; and withthe Secretary of State for Wales, she should circulate a revised version to the Cabinet for approval at their meeting on 7th July.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General and the Secretary of State for wales to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office23 June 197711
