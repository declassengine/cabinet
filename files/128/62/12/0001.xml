FOREIGNAFFAIRSSouth AfricaPreviousReference:CM(77) 15thConclusions,Minute 21. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY,reporting on the debate in the Security Council on South Africa,said that the Miristerial Group on Southern Africa had discussed on26 October the line which Mr Richard should be instructed to take.We were close to agreement with the other four Western membersof the Security Council on the text of a resolution, based on theAmerican draft.    It was virtually certain that we would have toaccept a mandatoiy arms embargo against South Africa under chapter VH of the United Nations Charter and the inclusion of some general request to member states to review their economic relations with South Africa, which however would not involvemandatory action under Chapter VII.    We had to recognise that, ifwe succeeded in holding the line at this point in the current debate,we should come under increasing pressure to accept mandatoryeconomic sanctions if the situation in South Africa continued on itspresent path.    We should try to resist and delay any proposals ofthis kind being made.    On the whole the African countries understoodour position and we could hope that they would avoid facing us withsuch a proposal.    If however a resolution involving mandatoryeconomic sanctions was put forward, he would recommend that weshould use our veto.    If it came to this he was fairly confident thatwe should have unanimous support from the other Western membersof the Security Council and that the Americans would also veto.    Weshould however be in a stronger position to resist going further ifwe had agreed to a mandatory arms embargo.    This would notchange South African policies, although he hoped that after theelections the South African Government would relax their presenthard line.    There were already some signs that this might happen.The consequences of a resolution on the lines proposed for thenegotiations on Namibia and Rhodesia were impossible to determine.No doubt the condemnation of South Africa would give some comfortto Mr Ian Smith who might hope that the South Africans would reduce their pressures on him.    But the South Africans themselves would not. necessarily take this view:  they probably saw it as being in their interest to reach a settlement in Namibia and Rhodesiawhich would leave them free to continue the struggle from within their own borders.In discussion it was pointed out that the present resolution wentfurther than anything we had previously contemplated.    It must beseen as a step on the way to a Chapter VII determination involvingnot only mandatory economic sanctions but also the possibility ofmilitary measures, including a blockade.    We had the largest stakeof any Western country in South Africa.    Annual exports werearound  650 million, our investments were just over  2 billion andwe depended on South Africa for the supply of important raw materials.Even the present proposed resolution carried some danger, not only because it introduced Chapter VH language for the first time, but also
because it would be left to individual member states to decide howrigorously to apply it.    There was little doubt that we should have to stop the supply of military spares amounting to about  10 million ayear, and problems would also arise in relation to dual purposeequipment.    Moreover, we tended to give more Government aid toexporters than other Governments and any general economicrestrictions would therefore be more damaging to our interests.We should discuss with the other main trading countries how they intended to interpret the resolution and should make it clear thatwe were not prepared to apply it more rigorously than our competitors.In further discussion concern was expressed at the possibility ofthe United Kingdom vetoing a resolution calling for general economic sanctions.    Such a step would be a most serious one, particularly if we had to act alone.    Prior consultation with the Cabinet would be needed.    On the other hand the situation during a debate in theSecurity Council could be a very fast-moving one and we had to remember that we had vital economic interests at stake.    We had also to consider the position of Botswana, Lesotho and Swazilandwho would be directly affected by economic sanctions and whom itwould not be in our power to relieve.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that we could not avoid going as far as theAmerican draft resolution which was now being discussed.    they recognised however that this went further than anything they had beenprepared to accept previously and that there were real risks that we might later come under pressure to adopt mandatory economic sanctions.    In view of our major economic stake in South Africa weshould have to resist this and, if necessary, be prepared to vetomandatory economic sanctions.    We would expect the americans and French to act likewise.    He would hope to consult senior ministers if the need arose for an urgent decision, but in view of the speed at which events tended to move in the Security Council it mightnot be possible to call a meeting of the full Cabinet.    As regardsthe current resolution, Mr Richard should make a statement to theeffect that Her Majesty&apos;s Government were aware of the responsibilitiewhich it imposed on members and would, in their interpretation of it,be guided by the way in which others carried out its provisions.    Weshould consult other industrial countries on the measures they proposed tc take in connection with the review of their economic relations with South Africa.    As regards reviewing our own economic relations, the Cabinet Office should arrange for a paper to beprepared on how far we could afford to go, with an explanation ofwhy we could not go further;  Ministers would then seek to establish a clear policy on which they could stand both in discussions withother Governments and in any public statements.2
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, andinstructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangefor a paper to be prepared on the lines agreed.JointEuropeanTorusPr eviou reference:C   &apos;77) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet noted with satisfaction that at the Council of Ministers(Energy) agreement had been reached on Culham as the site for theJoint European Torus (JET) and paid tribute to the efforts of thePrime Minister and several other Ministers, including the Ministerof State, Department of Industry (Mr Kaufman) (who had to chair a difficult meeting of the Council in March) in the achievement of thissatisfactory result.    The degree of support from other member states was an indication that the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to theGeneral Secretary of the Labour Party had not adversely affectedour general standing in the Community.Common THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the fisheries failure to agree in the Council of Ministers (Fisheries) on necessaryPolicy conservation measures would probably require us to take nationalaction to restrict fishing for Norway pout in the North Sea, but it seemed likely that we could count on the Commission&apos;s acquiescence.In discussion on changes in the commcn fisheries regime it waspointed out that some progress had been made in bilateral contacts.We now had a strong common position with the Irish.    The italians were showing more understanding of our problems and the Dutch,who were willing to accept some form of exclusive belt, had suggested a further bilateral meeting.    On the other hand virtually no progress had been made in the Council discussions and it was very unlikelythat any agreement would be reached at the meeting scheduled for early December.    Nor would it be any easier to reach agreement under the Danish Presidency.    Given the wide differences whichpersisted and the strength of feeling, not only in this country but inother member states, it might be a long time before any definitivesettlement could be reached.    If there was no sign of progress atthe December meeting of the Council it might be desirable for theCabinet to have some discussion about the issues involved.3
PrimeMinister&apos; cLetter to theGeneralSecretary ofthe LabourPartyPreviousReference:CM(77) 32ndConclusions,Minute 1THE PRIME MINISTER said that as a result of discussion at theNational Executive Committee (NEC) meeting the previous day ithad been decided that the first step in the follow-up of his letter toMr Hayward would be a general discussion on Europe between theCabinet and the NEC.    The specific issues in his letter wouldthereafter be examined by a smaller group drawn from the NECand the Cabinet.    In parallel, it would be necessary for theGovernment to prepare its own position so as to be ready before thenext meeting of the European Council to explain its approach in more detail to our Community partners.    This work would be co-ordinatedby the Cabinet Office.    He had also given instructions that whenForeign Affairs was on che agenda at future meetings of the Cabinetthere should be a sub-heading &quot;Community- Affairs&quot; in order toprovide a specific opportunity for reports on matters arising out ofour Community membership.Industrial THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that a group of collaboration Ministers had, earlier that morning, had a useful discussion on thproblems facing West European industries.    Some aspects of this he would be pursuing bilaterally with President Giscard during his visit to London in December.    But he intended to raise at themeeting of the European Council on 5 and 6 December the more general problems for the world economy caused by the increasingscale of Japanese balance of payments surpluses and possibleUnited States reaction to them.The Cabinet -2. Took note of the statements by thePrime Minister and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.4
WIDERIMPLICATIONSOF THEINDUSTRIALSTRATEGYPr previous reference:CM(77) 27thConclusions,Minute 52. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP(77) 94)by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and Secretary of State for industry, together with their earlier paper CP(77) 84-    these papers covered a draft paper on the wider implications of theindustrial strategy for submission to the National economic development Council (NEDC), revised in the light of discussion in a small group of Ministers (GEN 98).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that when the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had discussed theindustrial strategy on 25 January they had agreed that the mainfoundations had been well established but there were problems whenthe strategy conflicted with the objectives of other government policies.    The Prime Minister had subsequently asked him and theSecretary of State for Industry to prepare a paper for NEDC dealingwith some of these conflicts, and suggesting ways in which theymight be resolved.    There was no question of giving the industrialstrategy an overriding priority:  the problem was to ensure that itwas weighed against other objectives.    Following preliminary discussion in Cabinet in July, the paper for NEDC had beenextensively redrafted in a small Ministerial group under his chairmanship.    The main changes which had been made wereoutlined in CP(77) 94.In discussion, it was emphasised that the paper wa3 not a review ofthe whole of industrial strategy.    It omitted or mentioned only in passing such important subjects as industrial democracy and planning agreements.    The present draft was unnecessarily self-critical thus giving hostages to the Opposition and the whole tonewas too portentous.    It conveyed the impression of the establishmentwringing its hands over the relatively poor performance of theUnited Kingdom economy.    The emphasis of the paper should beshifted.    It should demonstrate that the Government was seeking toput its own house in order, and invite industry to do the same.It was certainly the case that in the past bright youngsters had been encouraged to go into white collar jobs rather than onto the shop floor,But a major factor now in influencing the choice of employment wasthat young people did not recognise the link between an improvementof our industrial performance and the needs of a caring society.They needed to be convinced that industrial performance should be improved in order to create the means to fulfil social and environmental objectives.    The title of the paper should be changed to &quot;Some Wider Implications of the Industrial Strategy&quot;     TheChancellor of the Exchequer should also revise paragraph 1 of theintroductory memorandum (Annex A to CP(77) 94) in the light of thepoints which had been made in discussion and also consider whether any other changes were necessary in the later paragraphs of theintroduction.5
In further discussion of the main paper (Annex B of CP(77) 94)the following points were made.School and higher educationThis section was somewhat narrowly drafted and gave too muchemphasis to formal education and not enough to experience of life.There was a great danger of over supply of highly qualified andunemployable people.    But these issues were too broad to be raised in the present paper.    There should however be specific references to the need for industry to second people for university study in mid-career, to provide work experience between school anduniversity, to provide genuine work for those they recruitedparticularly at graduate level and to provide improved day releasefacilities, and better opportunities for school and university teachersto obtain industrial experience.    The Secretary of State for education and Science would provide appropriate amendments.Incentives towork and taxationThis section as drafted particularly paragraphs 1.19 and 1. 23contained major hostages to the Opposition.    The paper shouldmake clear that baoic motivation, job satisfaction, and the sort of society which was being built were as important as purely financialincentives.    It was arguable how far financial incentives reallyaffected behaviour.    Much of the current dissatisfaction with thelevel of tax was the result of inflation in the last four years ratherthan of the tax system itself.    The Government had made a start in reducing the effect of taxation, but it should not make too much of avirtue of this in the present paper, so as not to concede the argumentto the Opposition.    The international comparisons should bere-examined, to avoid hostages and to bring out the effect ofemployer as well as employee contributions to social security(which meant that people paid higher prices rather than taxes and contributions).    It was not clear that differentials had beencompressed in the post war period, although they had suffered inthe last two or three years.    The reference to achieving a betterbalance between direct and indirect taxation should be omitted.    TheChancellor of the Exchequer should redraft paragraph 1.19, 1.22,1. 23 and 5.1ii. to reflect these points.Small firmsThe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster would suggest an additionto paragraph 3.2 to include a reference to the particular problemsof small firms.
E-ergy prices the paper correctly recorded the present interdepartmentallyagreed position on the need for higher energy prices, but Ministersneeded to recognise that there was a developing problem of &quot;fuelpoverty&quot; and it might prove necessary eventually to restrain prices in the domestic sector for social reasons.Transport costsParagraph 8. 7 would need revision in the light of discussion inthe European Economic Community (e.c.) Council of Ministers.Research andDevelopment(R     D)The Secretary of State for Education and Science, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Industry, would provide an additionalpassage on the problem of slow exploitation of technical innovationby British industry.Civil Service/IndustryMobilityThere was a case for encouraging exchanges with both sides ofindustry, and not merely with management.    Civil servants would benefit from practical experience of the trade union movement.The unions themselves might however have difficulty in releasingpeople for secondment to the Civil Service.    There were in any caseproblems in making as many as two hundred transfers a year, andthere would be some opposition from the Civil Service unions towhat was proposed.    The present Civil Service non-contributablepensions arrangements might be a barrier to such transfers.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange for paragraphs 13.1to 13. 5 to be redrafted to cover these points.Burdens onIndustryThis phrase was unfortunate and should be replaced. The proposedfact finding exercise was probably too elaborate, and it might in theend be better to attempt something more modest.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theMinisters concerned should now send their final suggestions forredrafting the paper to the Chancellor of the Exchequer as soon aspossible.    The Chancellor should arrange for a redrafted version tobe circulated to the Cabinet for clearance if possible by correspondence.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of this summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 October 1977
