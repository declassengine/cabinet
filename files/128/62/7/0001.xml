FOREIGNAFFAIRSRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM(77) 28thConclusions,Minute 21. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYintroducing a discussion on Rhodesia, said that the Cabinet wouldhave seen the White Paper containing our proposals and theaccompanying statement on law and order which he had issued fromSalisbury.    The international response to the package had been generally good and no single Government had come out publiclyagainst it.    The key question was the attitude of the African Statesthemselves.    There was always the risk of a Soviet veto in theUnited Nations utvless it could be demonstrated that we had Africansupport for United Nations involvement.    The Scviet Union were generally reluctant to endorse peacekeeping proposals unless they believed that their opposition would lose them local support.    Inthis connection the Front Line Presidents were of particular importance.    The crucial issue in his discussions with the parties had been the future of the Rhodesian forces.    The Patriotic Frontdemanded that they should be dismantled, whereas Mr Smithinsisted that they must be retained.    He had been careful to avoidanswering the direct question whether we were for or againstdismantling, and the proposals, as finally presented, provided forthe Liberation Forces as a basis for the Zimbabwe Army, butensured also that there was no time at which there would not be stillan element of the Rhode sian forces in existence in some form.One delicate problem for the transition period would be to remove from the Liberation Forces those elements who would not acceptthe objective of a democratic Zimbabwe so that there would be areliable force available to support the independent ZimbabweGovernment.    This problem was understood by Mr Nkomo whowould be the key figure in the negotiations for a ceasefire and alsoBishop Muzorewa.    While he recognised the difficulties,Lord Carver&apos;s view was that this would not be an impossible task.The first step would be to go to the Security Council, probably inthe week beginning 26 September and seek approval for a limitedresolution which would invite the Secretary General to appoint arepresentative to enter into discussions about a ceasefire and thefuture role of the forces as envisaged in paragraph 11a. of theWhite Paper.    We had assurances of support from President Machelof Mozambiaue and from General Obasango of Nigeria, and president Kaunda of Zambia     who hau seen many difficulties in theproposals and was still worried about how Mr Smith could beremoved, was also prepared to give the initiative a chance.    ThePatriotic Front had just produced a document containing their comments, which was cleverly framed and avoided rejecting theproposals, but was aimed to improve their prospects for winningthe election.    His view was that Mr Smith would like to reach asettlement altnough he saw great problems over law and order.The White Rhodesians were by no means defeated but were ready tobe more accommodating as the recognition grew that they would lose the struggle over a period of years.    But Mr Smith, like thePatriotic Front, had some major reservations about the constitutional arrangements in the package and there would be a need to discuss these.    The South African Government had been helpful in bringing1J
pressure to bear privately on Mr Smith to ensure that he did notreject the proposals outright.    As regaras future action, theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary r.aid that at this stage he was seeking approval for a limited first step in the Security Council.At a later stage it would be necessary to seek Security Councilagreement for a mandate for the United Nations Force.    But no final decision was required on this yet.    Before then he would wishto come back to theCabinet and also go to Parliament.    There wasno .ieed yet to take a decision on the question of oil and armssanctions:  this would only arise if we reached a position when therewas agreement on a viable package and Mr Smith refused to give uppower.    The South African Government were aware of thepossibility that sanctions might be introduced if things did not go well.They were anxious to avoid this but they had to strike a delicatebalance between bringing effective pressure on Mr Smith and not doing so overtlv in a way which would provoke opposition from theirown public opinion.In discussion it was pointed out that there was little prospect of achieving total agreement on a constitution.    Comments made bythe various parties would be discussed with them with a vdew toachieving more precision and taking as many as possible of their suggestions into account.    This would be done bilaterally.    Butthere would need to be a formal constitutional conference during the transition period to promulgate the revised constitutional package.Lord Carver would not be directly involved in this process but,prior to the transition, would be engaged with the United NationsRepresentative, and later with the United Nations forcecommander, in trying to negotiate a ceasefire.    His first task wouldbe to reach agreement with the United Nations Representativesso as to ensure that we were seen to be co-operating closely withthem in all subsequent discussions with the parties.    Although aceasefire was not likely to be achieved until sufficient progress had been made on the political side, it would not be possible tomove to the transition period in advance  of a ceasefire.In further discussion it was recognised that while the White paper had been generally well received, ths outstanding problems shouldnot be underrated.    On the financial side we would need to work out what might be the cost of a United Nations Force and we should bevery cautious about going beyond the commitment we had already accepted on the Zimbabwe Development Fund.    As regards oil andarms sanctions, it was not clear just what their effect might be andwe lacked any agreed assessment of this.    It might be argued thatthe threat of sanctions would make it more difficult for Mr Vorster,the South African Prime Minister, to co-operate, and if the south africans had adequate stockpiles of oil, as had been suggested insome Press reports, sanctions might prove to be counter-productive.There was of course a certain element of bluff in the situation.    Theintroduction of oil and arms sanctions would be a major thresholdwhich we would hope not to have to cross, and in view of the risks
to our own economic and trading interests we should keep them in reserve unless or until we were confident that we would really getsomething in return.    At least the discussion of sanctions withthe Americans had had the useful effect in educating them as to the dangers of following this course and in particular of the risk of aChapter VII resolution against South Africa and of driving the south africans into a laager mentality.In further discussion it was suggested that we had to be ready for various possible developments.    If in the end it turned out that bothsides could accept a revised version of our proposals, we would beable to move into the transition period.    If however both sidesrejected them, the war would continue.    this would be an unsatisfactory outcome, but at least we should be on record as having made an honourable attempt to reach a settlement.    More difficultyfor us would be acceptance by one side and rejection by the othertI  Mr Smith were to accept and the Patriotic Front to reject, thenMr Smith would go ahead with the internal solution, which would bebased on majority rule with one man one vote.    We could not openlysupport this but equally we could not resist it, especially if thenegotiations had broken down as a result of intransigence on the partof the Patriotic Front.    On the other hand if the Patriotic Frontaccepted and Mr Smith rejected the proposals we should be understrong pressure to apply sanctions and to taKe other steps to removeMr Smith from power.    This could be exploited by the conservative opposition.    Possibly an even greater danger would be if thingswent wrong after the transition period had started and Lord Carverhad been installed as Resident Commissioner.    In this situation weshould have great difficulty in avoiding becoming increasinglyinvolved to an extent the Cabinet had always foreseen and had been anxious to avoid.    It was however pointed out that whether we likedit or not we were already heavily involved.    If we had not goneahead with our initiative during the summer, sanctions against SouthAfrica would have been a major issue in the United Nations.    Atleast we could expect to avoid this.    We had always recognised thatthere were great risks both in doing something and in doing nothing.But by bringing the United Nations in and acting with the full support and co-operation of the United States we had a greater chance than under our earlier proposals of keeping control of the situation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet wished to congratulate the Foreign and commonwealth secretary on his handling of the situation during the Recess.    Therewere, as they had always recognised, great risks involved.    But theCabinet were prepared to endorse the package as presented in theWhite Paper and the statement on law and order, and they approved the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposals for approaching the United Nations and for the subeequsnt discussions envisaged withthe various parties in Southern Africa.    Further work should be done to produce an assessment of the likely effect of an oil or arms embargo and the Cabinet would wish to be consulted again before any
action was taken to introduce sanctions.    Meanwhile they agreedthat the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should pursue the tactics he considered would provide the best prospects for asettlement on the lines of the White Paper proposals, acting inconsultation with the Ministerial Group on Southern Africa, whichwould report back to Cabinet as appropriate.The Cabinet -1.      Took note with approval of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordingly.2.       Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet toarrange for the preparation of an assessment asindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, reporting onhis recent visit to Madrid, said that in discussing the possibility of spanish entry into the European Economic Community (e.c.) hehad followed the general line agreed at the meeting of Ministers on29 July.    Mr Saurez, the Spanish Prime Minister, had welcomedour support.    He had explained that his objective was to complete the development of democratic institutions: however there still remained a great deal to do, in particular over the whole area of relations with the trades unions.    As regards the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) the Spanish Government needed more time and no decision was to be expected for possibly another twoor three years.    He had made it clear to Mr Saurez we saw this asa totally different issue from Spanish entry into the e.c. but that if and when the Spanish reached a decision to apply to join NATO theycould rely on our support.    On Gibraltar the Government continuedto maintain the Spanish claim and thi3 was supported by theSocialist Party (PSOE) but the Government wished to find some wayof establishing a direct relationship with the Gibraltarians.    It wasvery much in our interest to encourage this and he hoped we would see some movement.    He had explained our position on Belize and had had a reasonable hearing.    The remarks made by King Carlos during his recent visit to Guatemala were regrettable and entirelyinconsistent with the discussions he had had in Madrid.    The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary agreed that it was necessary to seek an explanation oi these remarks before Mr Saurez came to London on19 October.The Cabinet -3.       Took note of the statement by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
2. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that the strike by members of the Bakers1 Union affected onlythe major plant bakeries, which normally supplied about 80 per cent of the total demand for bread.    The remaining 20 per cent wasnormally provided by the independent master bakers, who were not affected by the dispute.    They had temporarily expanded their production to cover about 40 per cent of demand.    This, togetherwith the special arrangements which had been made by the Bakers&apos;Union to meet the needs of hospitals, old peoples homes and prisons,accounted for something like 45 per cent of the normal requirement.If the employees of the Co-operative Wholesale Society (CWS)returned to work, as expected, a further 10 per cent of the demand would be met.    There were good supplies of alternative foods,including a temporary glut of potatoes.    Experience in the previousbread strike in 1974 suggested that production of 35 per cent of demand was a tolerable level for 10 days.THE MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT, saidthat in discussions under the Advisory Conciliation and ArbitrationService the two sides in the dispute had now agreed in principle toaccept independent mediation.    They were meeting again that morning to try and agree on a mediator and his terms of reference.    If theysucceeded the mediator might begin work later in the day.    Atseveral stages, employers in the Bakers Federation had argued thatthe claim infringed pay policy.    This was not the case and it was important to make clear that the strike was not about a pay policyissue.In discussion, concern was expressed about the adequacy of breadsupplies, particularly to working class areas, where independentmaster bakers were thought to be few.    Statistics showing the overall national position did not reveal individual trouble epota, nor didthey cover the problems of the housebound and elderly who mightsuffer because they were not covered by the special arrangements madefor hospitals.   Although there were few reports from constituenciesof any real hardship at this stage, it was important to secure up todate information about the effect of the strike, and the Weights and measures inspectorate of the local authorities might be a usefulsource of information.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that although there were prospects of an early settlement of the dispute,it was important that Ministers should be informed about the impact of the dispute whether there were any areas where there was ascarcity of bread and what could be done to relieve it.    TheSecretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection should therefore arrange, in consultation with the Secretary of State for the environment, for reports on the local situation to be obtained from the weights and Measures Inspectorate of the local authorities and for asummary of these to be circulated to members of the Cabinet.5
The Cabinet -1.    Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection to proceed accordingly.The General THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that discussion of paySituation at the Trades Uninn Congress (TUC) had gone better than mostobservers had expected.    Both the size of the majority in favour ofthe 12 month rule and the tone of the debate, had been good.    TheMinisters concerned had worked during August to minimise the riskof early adverse settlements, and skilful handling of government publicity for good economic news had helped considerably.    SinceCongress a number of phase II settlements had been completed anda few early settlements in Phase 3 had been negotiated within the10 per cent guidelines.    The major settlements were of course still to come.    It was difficult to form an overall judgment, but in his view there was some increase in the sense of moderation on both sides ofindustry.    He expected the main problem over the next few months tobe the emergence of a large number of artificial &quot; self-financingproductivity deals&quot; which would be seen by the unions as the mainescape route from the constraints of pay policy.    Since theseinvolved a modification of the 12 month rule, it should be possible to persuade the TUC to play an active role in containing the situation.He intended to speak to Mr Len Murray to seek his support before leaving for Barbados the following week.    He recognised thatoperation of the policy posed many problems for departmental ministers, and might conflict with their normal departmentalpriorities.    Restraint in pay settlements was however the key to continue recovery in the period until the next election and after and very high priority should be given to achieving it.THE MINISTER OF STATE,  DEPARTMENT OF EMPLOYMENT, agreedthat the main effect of the vote at the TUC on the 12 month rule was tokeep them involved and in play in the conduct of pay policy, and it wastherefore very important to have an early meeting with Mr Len Murray.There were a number of difficult individual cases in negotiation, someof which involved potential breaches of the 12 month rule or the10   per cent guidelines, including the plumbers, the West MidlandsRoad Haulage Association and J Mackie and Co. Ltd in Northern Irelandbut these were all being discussed in the normal way by the Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy (EY(P)).6
In discussion, it was argued that although a number of small caseshad been satisfactorily resolved, the major cases     were still tocome.    Some of these,  including the local authority manual workers and the police, would need to be discussed in Cabinet after EY(P)had considered them, since they raised very large issues.    although there had been a good response on the 12 month rule at the TTJC,contacts with individual unions at branch level indicated considerablepresrure for large pay increases, notably in the engineering industry.But most union negotiators showed no desire for confrontation andwere seeking a way to meet their members wishes without a fight.The majority of the country had not forgotten   the experience ofhyper-inflation in 1974-75, and wanted moderation.    But this climateof opinion would be influenced by the prospects for action to stimulate the economy.    This was important, for the success of the pay policy and for the Government1 s electoral prospects.    TheCabinet should therefore have an early opportunity to discuss thegeneral economic situation,.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the need to keep the TUC involved in the generalconduct of pay policy.    Certain major cases, including localauthority manual workers and the policei    would probably need tocome before the Cabinet for consideration at a later stage.    EY(P)should continue to handle individual cases on the lines already agreed.He hoped departmental Ministers would give maximum support to making a success of pay policy in the next few months, even if this involved some detachment from their normal departmental priorities.Publicity was important and the Committee of Information Officersunder the Parliamentary Secretary tc the Privy Council Office was doing a very good job.    It was however for the Ministers concerned to take final decisions on publicity.    The Cabinet would have theopportunity for a general discussion of the economic situation afterthe Labour Party Conference.    He had asked the Chancellor of theExchequer to consider some of the possibilities for a stimulus tothe economy.    It was however important not to create a climate ofexpectations which it might not be possible to sustain, or whichmight lead to the measures being discounted.    Ministers should therefore avoid, 30 far as possible, encouraging expectations until theGovernment had agreed upon and announced its policy.The Cabinet -2.       Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office15 September 1977
