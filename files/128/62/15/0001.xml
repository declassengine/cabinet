parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.EuropeanEconomicCommunityLegislationTHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the effect ofMr. Nigel Spearing&apos;s Motion on Parliamentary control over european community legislation, to be debated on 28 November, would be torequire Parliamentary approval before decisions were taken in brussels.    This raised a major issue concerning parliamentary control which was covered in the Prime Minister&apos;s letter toMr Hayward, General Secretary of the Labour Party, and which ministers would need to discuss collectively.    He proposed to sayon 28 November that the Government were looking at all aspects ofthis matter, which they regarded as one of first importance.    he hoped, but was not sure, that Mr. Spearing would withdraw hisMotion, which would be talked out if necessary.The Cabinet -Took note.Sheriff(removal from Office)order the Cabinet were informed that the debate on the prayer against theOrder dismissing Sheriff Peter Thomson was expected to take placeeither on Wednesday, 30 November or on Monday 5 December.    Itwas important that this Order should be debated before the prayingtime expired on 6 December in order to rebut accusations that theGovernment were shirking debate;  but members of all the minorityParties had put their names to the prayer, and the attitude of theOpposition was not yet clear.    It might be desirable to defer the debate until 5 or 6 December, with a view to ensuring that theOpposition understood the constitutional issues involved and wouldnot support the prayer; but the Secretary of State for Scotland wouldbe in Brussels on those days for discussions on fisheries matters.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthis debate should be held on whichever day would produce the bestresult in the vote, and special arrangements would be made ifnecessary for the Secretary of State for Scotland to return fromBrussels for the debate.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.
private member&apos;motion on nuclear power the PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion on the handling of the debate on 2 December on Mr Leo Abse&apos;s Motion on nuclear power, said that debates on this subject should not becentred on the environment, with environmentalists making all the running.    It was important to preserve balance, and to presentenvironmental considerations in the context of energy policy as awhole.    If Mr Abse&apos;s Motion, when tabled, was concerned entirely with environmental matters a Department of the EnvironmentMinister would speak in the debate, but if the Motion went wider theGovernment spokesman should be a Department of Energy Minister.The Cabinet -3. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.DEFENCEEXPENDITUREPr previous reference:CM(77) 32ndConclusions,Minute 32. THE PRIME MINISTER said that when the Cabinet discussedpublic expenditure on 20 October, they left it to the Defence and oversea Policy Committee (DOP) to consider the level of futuredefence expenditure and to report back to the Cabinet.    DOP had nowheld two meetings on the subject.    They had agreed to the Treasuryfigure of  6, 466 million for 1979-80 which was  55 million lower than the most recent published figure for that year revalued at 1977Survey prices.    This was an important point politically of which theGovernment could make use when the new figures were published.DOP had also agreed that the figures for 1980-81 and 1981-82, 6, 660 million in each case, need not be as firm as the 1979-80figure and that they should be shown in the forthcoming White paper on Public Expenditure in a way which would indicate that they were subject to review later in the light of the economic situation.    defence was the last outstanding issue in the Cabinet&apos;s review of public expenditure, and the Chief Secretary, Treasury would now be ableto keep to his timetable for bringing the Public Expenditure white paper to Cabinet next month.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.2
3. THE HOME SECRETARY drew attention to a report by theCivil Contingencies Unit which would be circulated separately to theCabinet.    He had discussed the situation on picketing with the ChiefInspector of Constabulary and the Metropolitan Police.    In HighWycombe the station, which had been kept open by non-Fire BrigadeUnion (FBU) firemen, had been closed due to pressure from pickets,but elsewhere there was no serious picketing problem and reasonablerelations were being maintained between the Servicemen and thepickets.    The standard of some of the accommodation for the Service-men had been criticised in the Press;  the Secretary of State for     ,Defence was taking steps to improve it and District Commanders werebeing told to consult local authorities if necessary about possible alternative accommodation.    Some local authorities wanted to move the Servicemen into regular fire stations, but they had been advisedagainst this.    Representatives of the fire officers had represented tohim the difficult circumstances in which their members were having to operate and had said that the Servicemen would not be able to provide an effective service without their assistance.    The fire officers were considering how to handle their own claim for a 40 per cent increase,but it seemed likely that they would be prepared not to press this forthe time being.    As regards firemen&apos;s pay, no proper discussions hadtaken place since the breakdown of talks between the two sides on18 November.    The time had come for the National Joint Council to reopen talks about the question of hours and about efficiency.    The useof manpower in the Fire Service was in some places very inefficientand there might be scope for stepping up the effort devoted duringworking hours to fire prevention activities, which were vitally important and which the FBU themselves strongly advocated.In discussion it was pointed out that the firemen who were undertaking a national strike for the first time felt that they had a good case andwere gaining the support of public opinion.    They were looking for avery large immediate increase in pay and it would be difficult to bridge the gap between their aspirations and any improvement on the currentoffer which could responsibly be made.    Nevertheless it was impor-tant to try and find a way of restructuring the offer which would makeit acceptable to the firemen.    The offer had been generous especiallyin its proposals on hours of work and any restructuring might involvedropping some of its features and replacing them by others.    there might, for example, be scope for increasing pay in return for improved use of manpower but that would require concessions from theFBU as well as the employers.    Another possibility would be animprovement in the pensions paid to all widows of firemen to bring them nearer to the pensions paid to widows of firemen killed in seeking to save life.    A possible assured approach to a link withaverage industrial earnings might also be explored further, since thefiremen might settle for 10 per cent if they had certainty about a future bench-mark and over when it would be attained.    If, at the end
of the day, a settlement outside the pay guidelines were forced on theGovernment it would be better to present it as a defeat rather than toadopt an obvious contrivance in an attempt to demonstrate that it was within the guidelines.    As against this it was argued that it was difficult at present to envisage any improved offer which could be compatible with the guidelines.    Furthermore it had to be remem-bered that there were many major groups waiting to see if theGovernment would breach its own guidelines.    If that happened therewould be very great difficulty in containing the breach.    All this was relevant to the possibility and content of any revised offer.    Therewere also important timing considerations, particularly since any new offer had to be made by the local authorities.    An early improvedoffer, even if justified, could prejudice major current negotiationswith the local authority manual workers, construction workers and engineers and the National Health Service ancillaries.    It was also important that an improved offer should only be made when there was reasonable certainty that it would be accepted by both the executive and Conference of the FBU.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment had to fight very hard to maintain the 10 per cent guide-line and there should be no cynicism about the Government&apos;s intentionto do this.    He did not at present see how the gap between the expectations of the firemen and any offer that the Government mightresponsibly contemplate could be bridged.    In any case the timing ofany revised offer compatible with the guidelines would need carefulconsideration to avoid prejudicing other negotiations and to securethe best chance of acceptance.    It was however important that theGovernment should reach its own view of what improvements in theoffer might be acceptable in due course as compatible with the guide-lines and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for this to beconsidered at an early meeting of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.
FOREIGNAFFAIRSMiddle east previous reference:CM(77) 36thConclusions,Minute 24. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that so far there was little that he could report about developments in theMiddle East following President Sadat of Egypt&apos;s visit to Israel.    Itwas still not clear to what extent this visit had improved prospects for a Geneva Conference.    The Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Begin,was due to visit London from 2-4 December, and this would provide an opportunity for encouraging him to make some move.    the israeli Foreign Minister, Mr Dayan, had recognised on the previous day that there was a need for the Israeli Government to put forward a new position, but so far there had been no sign of movement ontheir part.I  Ha THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Prime Minister of India,Mr Desai, had spoken to him on the telephone on 23 November aboutbis proposed visit to India in January, and the fact that it was dueto take place shortly after the visit by the President of the United States,Mr Carter.    Mr Desai had said that a visit by a British PrimeMinister was more important than one by President Carter becauseIndia and the United Kingdom were members of the sameCommonwealth family.    This was a welcome indication of theimportance Mr Desai attached to the maintenance of close relationsbetween the two countries.    The visit would be the first to India by aBritish Prime Minister since independence.    He also intended to visitBangladesh and Pakistan and attached importance to these visitsbecause of the number of citizens of these two countries who werepresent in the United Kingdom.    The dates of his visit to theSub-continent were not being announced for the time being.The Cabinet -Took note.5
COMMUNITYAFFAIRSEuropeanRegionalDevelopmentFund5. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reportedthat the Foreign Affairs Council on 22 November had failed to reach agreement on the future of the European Regional Development Fund.The French were pressing for an increase in their 15 per centnational quota in the interests of their overseas territories andwere opposed to the creation of a section of the Fund outside nationalquotas.    These issues would be referred to the European Council atwhich we hoped to secure a satisfactory enlargement of the Fund.But the French were likely to make a link with the settlement of member States1 contributions to the Community Budget.contributions to theC .nmunityBudgetTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the controversyover member States&apos; contributions to the Community budget in 1978and 1979 had been discussed at the Joint Foreign Affairs and FinanceCouncil on 21 November.    A compromise had been proposedinvolving a budgetary deficit to be financed by borrowing until 1980,when contributions would be determined under other arrangements.The French regarded this compromise as too favourable to us andwe could not prevent its reference to the European Council.    But ifthe Council rejected it our position would be safeguarded.    meanwhile the problem would be considered by the Ministerial Committee on european Questions.CommonFisheriesPolicyP previous reference:CM(77) 35thConclusions,Minute 3THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODreported on his recent discussions with Danish and Belgian Ministersabout the revision of the common fisheries policy.    There was some prospect of an understanding with the Danes on conservation issues.The Belgians had shown some recognition of our major interest infisheries and had acknowledged our case for some preference though not in the terms we were currently seeking.    We should be able toavoid a confrontation at the Fisheries Council in December.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office24 November 19776
