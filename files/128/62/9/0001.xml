It had not been clear until Septemberwhether there would be any scope for such a stimulus, but the rapid improvement in our financial position now made this possible.We should take advantage of this improvement to bring downunemployment and to increase the rate of growth.    Although therewere wide margins of error, he now expected that there would beheadroom of about  1 billion in the Public Sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) during 1977-78, compared with the levelswhich had been agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF).He foresaw no problems with Domestic Credit Expansion (DCE)and any pressures there might be on monetary targets should bemanageable.    The improvement was due to a more rapid reductionin interest rates than he had foreseen, together with highernationalised industry surpluses and higher tax receipts.    Theseforecasts did not depend critically on the level of pay settlements in the next few months.    The position in 1978-79 was much lesscertain, and b&quot; contrast would be greatly influenced by the outturnon pay.    His forecasts assumed earnings increases of only 10 per centon average.    A significantly higher outturn would increase prices and unemployment towards the end of the year.    At this stage, it seemed best to take up the headroom which was obviously available
in the current year in ways which did not automatically affect theposition in 1978-79.    The measures to be adopted should have thefastest possible effect on employment, and should therefore be mainly confined to cash measures rather than those involving the direct use of resources which were slower to take effect.    this meant limiting action to taxation and to cash transfers.    One optionwould be to cut Value Added Tax (VAT) which would reduce prices at a s&apos;roke; but this would have a perverse effect.    We now hadthe lowest rates of VAT in Europe; the Trades Union Congress(TUC) were understood to have rejected such action, and in his view it was not realistic.    Nor would a cut in specific duties be sensible;action on tobacco or petrol would run counter to the Governmentsother policies     The options on direct taxation were similarlylimited.    It was not possible to change the rate of income tax inthe middle of the year.    But the Government was committed to raisepersonal allowances in Jine with inflation next April (unless it could secure the votes in the House of Commons to override the 1977Finance Act) and it would be possible to bring forward some or all of these increases now.    This could only be done if the Government,at the same time, decided not to tax the increase in old age pensionsdue in November; this would release spare capacity in the InlandRevenue to undertake the necessary recoding.    Because such anincrease in allowances would be backdated to the beginning of thefinancial year, it would result in a big rebate in the hands of taxpayersat the end of November or early in December, provided decisions were taken quickly.    This would give a big immediate injection of purchasing power into the economy.    It would have the merit of surprise, and nothing should be said about it in public at this stagefor that reason.    Turning to public expenditure, the options were limited especially if there was to be no effect in the following year.The Government could decide to reverse the administrative delays in the payment of Regional Development Grants (RDG) which would cost about  100 million, or it could give a Christmas bonus,preferably under another name, to pensioners at about the same cost.It would be difficult to do both, because there was only about 143 million left in the Contingency Reserve;  even one of theseoptions would leave very little for the rest of the year.    His ownpreference was for a Christmas bonus.    Two million pensionerswould be receiving some tax relief if his other proposals were adopted, and all taxpayers in employment would be receiving arebate, while the very poorest would be getting help with theirelectricity bills as already agreed.    There was therefore a casein equity for giving something to the remaining pensioners.    Turningto 1978-79, decisions would be needed in the near future for incorporation in the January public expenditure White Paper.These should be considered against a background of an 18 monthstimulus to the economy.    Decisions already taken had added about 500 million at Survey prices.    There was a strong case for a
construction industry programme costing about  300 million andfor a few minor measures. This total of  3 50 million at 1977Survey prices ( 1, 000 million at outturn prices in 1978-79) was inIris judgment the maximum which it would be sensible to commit atthis stage.    Nevertheless, this left the Government with a serious problem.    In April 1978, the introduction of the new superannuationscheme would bring a big increase in contributions which, togetherwith a cut in child tax allowances, would remove  1. 50 from theaverage weekly wage packet (although of course mothers v/ouldreceive the increased child benefit at the same time).    Politically,he thought it would be necessary to offset some or all of this.    Ifthe whole of the benefit of indexation was brought forward inNovember, there would be nothing left on that account the followingApril to help the individual taxpayer.    In addition, the gap betweenthe level of eligibility for benefits and the level at which the averageman moved into the tax paying bracket was narrowing, even afterautomatic indexation of allowances, and he would like to be able to offset this by an increase in the tax threshold orthe introduction ofa reduced rate band of income tax which the TUC favoured; but themost modest practicable band would cost a further  1, 000 billion.Faced with these demands, he advised caution, in order to leavesome headroom next April for budgetary decisions then.    If wage increases turned out excessively high, or if economic growth wereslowed down by supply constraints, the scope for increases in Aprilwould be very small, and it might even be necessary to increaseindirect taxation in order to produce some relief on direct taxation.There were two ways in which these risks could be reduced:  eitherto agree now not to increase public expenditure so fast, or to holdback part of the indexation of personal allowances which might otherwise be brought forward to November.    The latter would beregrettable, because it would imply not using headroom which was already available in the current year.    His own preference at thisstage, subject to the view of the Cabinet, was therefore to inject afurther  1 billion in the current year, mainly in cash, and to increasepublic expenditure by  1 billion at outturn prices in 1978-79, whichwould amount to a total  3 billion stimulus over the next 18 months.But within these totals, there was room for considerable politicalchoice.In discussion, a number of points were first clarified.    TheFinance Act 1977 required revaluation of personal allowances eachApril in line with inflation since the previous year&apos;s Budget.    on present forecasts, this would require an increase of about 12 per centin April 1978.    It would be possible to bring this forward, and tobackdate the increase to April 1977, provided it were clearly understood that this was in anticipation of the April 1978 increase,and that there would not be a further full indexation at that time.    Itwould be necessary to secure the full support of the parliamentary labour Party on that point.    The increase in personal allowances
would represent an increase in demand in 1978-79, as well as in1977-78, but the effect in 1978-79 would be partly offset in demand terms by the increase in superannuation contributions at that time.It was not easy to estimate the demand effect of any further measures next April, which would depend greatly on circumstancesat the time.    But the United Kingdom economy, alone amongOrganisation for Economic Co-co-operation and Development (OECD)countries, was likely to be growing faster in 1978-79 than in 1977-78,perhaps by 3-3-1 Per cent, and the measures now proposed v/ould adda further 0.5-0. 75 per cent to that rate of increase.    An increaseof  1 billion in demand should work through to provide a further70, 000 jobs over the next two years.    The multiplier effect on confidence, for example on business investment, should increase this further, particularly from the middle of 1978, while a reductionin the savings ratio, which now seemed quite possible as confidencereturned, could have an even greater effect.    The underlying trend in employment, however, might already be improving, and it wasnecessary not to pump in too much additional demand at this stage.On pay, the Chancellor&apos;s forecast assumed that the Government10 per cent guideline was maintained.    If earnings in fact increasedby an average of 15 per cent, and nothing else in the forecast changed,there would be very little headroom left in 1978-79;  if the outturnwere in the range of 12-13 per cent this would leave come room for manoeuvre, though not as much as now forecast.    The effect on prices of a breach in the pay guidelines was less easy to forecast.If the pound continued to appreciate, some authorities thought thatgeneral inflation would remain below 10 per cent, even if theincrease in earnings accelerated again to 15 per cent.    The effectof the proposed measures on wage settlements was also unpredictable.It was arguable that the change in general sentiment was largelyattributable to the 1977 Budget and July cuts in taxation, which hadthe result that incomes were no longer falling in real terms.Although the unions would not overtly accept such arguments in wage negotiations, they might help to influence the general climatein which wage claims were formulated.    Action on VAT need not be ruled out at this stage; it was just possible that it would be easier to increase VAT next April if the Retail Price Index were thenfalling, and the proceeds could then De used to offset further improvements in taxation.    Great care would however be neededafter this year&apos;s experience on the proposed increase in petrol duty.In further discussion, it was argued that it would be quite wrong for the Government to introduce massive reflationary measures atthis stage in th.-; hope of securing support which would help it win anearly election.    It was necessary rather to concentrate on a programme for the next 18 months to two years.    The economy was still in a very serious state.    The apparent improvement was attributable largely to the arrival of North Sea oil and to inflows of4
speculative money.    The underlying improvement was only justbeginning, if at all.    Against this background, there was a case for a much larger stimulus to the economy.    But our recoverydepended critically upon success in the Government&apos;s wages policy,and there was a danger of the Cabinet becoming too complacent onthis score.    All Ministers, and not just those directly concerned,should make a point of lending support to the wages policy in public.If it sncceeded, there was a good chance that real earnings would improve by 7 per cent by spring 1979, more than enough to offset the fall of recent years.    Unemployment, while probably still over one million, would have been falling for 12 months, and the inflation rate would have stabilised at or below 10 per cent.However, unemployment remained a very disturbing problem, andit was arguable that the Governments measures should concentratemore directly upon the creation of jobs, particularly throughadditional support for the construction industry.    It was in anycase desirable in the longer term to maintain a high and increasinglevel of public expenditure in order to achieve the Government&apos;ssocial objectives.    While reductions in personal taxation might be politically necessary at the present stage, they should not go too faruntil the rundown in social services had been arrested and reversed.It was however important to recall that the taxpayer had suffered a real cut in his take home pay since 1974 while public expenditurehad been continuing to grow in real terms.    Further increases in public expenditure must await an improvement in the real prosperity of the country on which they depended.    Priority in public expenditure should however be given to the construction industry,and in this context a further  300 million could be seen as trivial,since it represented only three weeks&apos; work for the industry.    Inthe short term, any further increases in public expenditure should in principle be concentrated in areas where they would have leasteffect on expenditure in 1978-79.    But there were many otherclaimants.    In the field of social services, priority should begiven tc further help to the long term unemployed, and there weremeasures, costing  22 million in a full year, which could beintroduced as early as February.    An improvement in the mobilityallowance for the disabled was also urgently needed, as was a modest improvement in Family Income Supplement (FIS) by allowing the heads of single parent families to work longer hours beforeforfeiting their right to benefit.    More generally, the cuts in theNational Health Service were reaching the point where they were now politically intolerable and would have to be reversed.    Inother areas, too, considerable unavoidable extra expenditure wasforeseen which would limit the Government&apos;s freedom for manoeuvre.    For example, the deficit of the British steel corporation (BSC) could be as high as  500 million, compared with 60 million allowed for in the Chancellor&apos;s calculations, while sizeableadditional support might also be needed for the British Leyland MotorCorporation (BLMC) particularly if its cash flow suffered as a resultof threatened strike action.5
In further discussion, there was general support for the proposalto bring forward the indexation of income tax allowances due next april.    It was however suggested that there was a good case forwithholding part of the proposed indexation until the next Budget,to leave the Government room to give some assistance to pensioners and to allow more rapid payment of RDG, which wouldhave considerable political attractions in the regions.    On the otherhand, the psychological impact of an early and sizeable increase in personal allowances would be valuable.    Looking to 1978-79 therewas a strong case for introduction of a reduced rate band of incometax, but this would have no political advantage if it had to be financed by an increase in rates of VAT, particularly at a time when thereduction in the rate of inflation might be faltering.    There wasa strong case for further relaxation in public expenditure as soonas conditions permitted, although it was probably too early to agree on increases beyond thode proposed by the Chief Secretary at thisstage.    None of the tax cuts proposed would help with the lowestpaid employees, and there was a case for more direct action to help them.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to bring forward to Cabinet a general paper on the future of the incomes policy, inwhich the problem of the lowest-paid would be dealt with.    The low-pay problem might perhaps be made one element in a fresh approach to the TUC (and indeed to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI))to seek at least their tacit support for the wage policy in the nextfew months.    The Government could no longer rely on sanctionsalone as its main instrument, and there were signs that the time was now ripe fcr a further move.    The CBI might be asked to ensure thatits members would not make massive pay offers, even where this might be the cheapest way of buying off trouble, while the TUCmight be asked to put pressure on individual unions not to pressexcessive claims.    The improvement in confidence, both at homeand internationally, vindicated the stern measures adopted by theGovernment a year ago.    Provided the incomes policy could bemaintained with the support of all interested parties, there was now a reasonable prospect of sustained recovery, in which theChancellor1 s new proposals would play an important part.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had clearly decided against any rapid restimulation of the economy in the hope of winning an early election.    The Chancellor&apos;smeasures should be considered against a longer timescale.    TheCabinet were not taking immediate decisions.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should now reflect on what had been said and bring forward his detailed proposals for a stimulus to the economy in1977-78.    The general feeling was that such proposals should provide for a stimulus of about  1 billion and that the tax element of this should take the form of a reduction in income tax rather than of VAT.    The Chancellor should consider the suggestions which had6
been made for increased public expenditure in 1977-78 and also theproposal made at the meeting the previous day with the national executive Committee of the Labour Party that there should be anincrease in child benefit.    Consideration of public expenditure in1978-79 should for the present proceed on the basis of additional expenditure of up to  1 billion at outturn prices.    While many members of the Cabinet would prefer a commitment to an evenbigger increase in public expenditure the public clearly wantedreductions in taxation at this stage, and ?t would be unwise to ignorethis pressure.    Increases of even  1 billion could nave quitedamaging effects on confidence and would need careful presentation.The suggestion of further contacts with the CBI and the TUC wasvaluable and the Chancellor would arrange these.    The cabinet would consider in detail the public expenditure figures for 1978-79and later years at their next meeting.    Following that final decisions would be taken on the stimulus to the economy in 1977-78 and on public expenditure.    Meanwhile, the Cabinet should note that many of the matters they had been discussing were of a Budgetarynature which would not normally be discussed so far in advance ofa public announcement.    Members of the Cabinet should thereforeobserve absolute secrecy about this  discussion even when talkingto close collaborators.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Ministerand invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office14 October 19777
