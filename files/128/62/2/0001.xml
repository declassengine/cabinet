PARLIAMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.Abortion bill previous reference:CM(77) 21stConclusions,Minute 1THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,as he had reported in his letter to the Lord President theprevious day, Mr Benyon had approached Mr Moyle to act as an intermediary in discussions with the opponents of the Bill on theStanding Committee, with a view to reaching agreement on a modified version of the Bill.  The Bill was strongly opposed inthe Labour Party, and there would be difficulty if it went throughin its present form; but if it failed to become law in one form or another in the present Session, the whole exercise would probablybe repeated in the next Session.    There would be advantagetherefore if the matter could be settled this Session on the basisof a compromise which would effectively confine the Bill to theprovision of statutory backing for the administrative measureswhich had already been taken.    A Bill on these lines would belikely to gain wide support in both Houses.    There seemed nobetter than an even chance that the Bill&apos;s opponents in theStanding Committee would agree to any compromise, but if theydid, there would be a case for providing Government time to enablethe Bill to reach Royal Assent.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatif the sponsors of the Bill and its opponenets reached genuineagreement on a compromise and asked for Government help toenable the amended Bill to get through, and if the provision ofGovernment time would enable the problems surrounding this Billto be settled in the current Session in a way which would notexpose the Government to attack, the Lord President, theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Whip were authorised to arrange accordingly.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.1
jiTHIRD PAY ROUND      2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, following the vote theprevious day at the Transport and General Workers1 UnionConference supporting an immediate return to unfettered freecollective bargaining, he had discussed the position with theChancellor of the Exchequer, and the guidance given to the press had been reflected in the morning&apos;s papers.    It remained theGovernments major task to conquer inflation and secure an orderly expansion of the economy, and there could be noaeparture from the financial and monetary constraints which hadbeen agreed.    There had been a tendency to see a formal agreement with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) as the essentialingredient of the next stage of pay policy; but there were otherconstraints on pay, and the impression should not be allowed to gain ground that without such an agreement the government&apos;s policy on pay would have crumbled or that the efforts of the TUCwere valueless.    Mr Jack Jones and Mr Hugh Scanlon had b**thmade clear to him that they would continue to do their best toprevent the situation getting out of hand, though Mr Jonesforesaw trouble with the dockers and the car workers;  and the attempt to reach some agreement with the TUC should not begiven up.    The Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategywould be discussing the matter on 11 July, and the following day the Chancellor would be meeting the TUC Economic Committeeto see what understandings could be reached, especially on the12-month rule.    The result of these discussions would be reported on 14 July to the Cabinet, which would then have to reach conclusions on the budget and amendments to the Finance Bill.The Cabinet would also need to approve a White Paper to bepublished in the near future, covering the Governments own policy for the next pay year, though this should be cleared withthe TUC so far as possible.    The Cabinet would also have toconsider their stance on future pay claims, especially those whichwould come forward soon after the end of July.    The Governmentcould not throw away all that had been achieved on the economicfront, and settlements would have to be reasonable and rational.As regards the Liberals, the Government would have to make up its own mind and to give a clear lead on the course which shouldbe followed.The Cabinet -Took note.
FOREIGN 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary affairs reported to Cabinet on the dispute with Guatemala over Belize.The discussion is recorded separately.BelizePakistanPreviousReference:CM(77) 17thConclusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported thatthe Government of Prime Minister Bhutto in Pakistan had beenoverthrown by a military coup.    The Chief of the Army GeneralStaff, General Zia, had taken over as Chief Martial LawAdministrator.    He had announced his intention of holdingElections in October and of handing power back to those elected,and there was no reason to think that he did not genuinely wishto carry out this intention.The cabinet took note.3
4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(77) 76)on Rhodesia: A Negotiated Settlement.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, introducinghis memorandum, said that we were facing a serious situation in rhodesia, which was changing rapidly.    He was not at this stageseeking firm decisions but he thought it right to tell his colleagues of the proposals being considered by a smaller group of Ministers.Our overriding task was to achieve a negotiated settlement.    Therewas no certainty that we would succeed, but we must keep on tryingand, even if the situation should slip out of our control, we must beseen to be doing so at all times, with the support of the United States.We should not allow ourselves to be diverted from this task by day today statements, which were often contradictory, by Mr Smith and theNationalist leaders.    There were three principal elements in any settlement:  the negotiation of an independence constitution,transitional arrangements and the post-independence period.    Theseelements must be taken together as parts of a single package.    Asregards the constitution, we were in agreement with the United Statesthat it should be based on universal suffrage, which was unpopular with the whites but which they might be brought to accept in conjunc-tion with the other elements of the package.    The principal anxietiesof the whites concerned the possible loss of their pension rights andof their farms and other assets.    We had tried to mitigate theseanxieties through the Zimbabwe Development Fund.    When the fund was originally launched, too much emphasis was given to the ideaof buying out the whites, which alienated many potential contributors,and not enough on the idea of persuading them to stay.    It was hopedthat the Fund would be of the order of $1.2 billion and its primary purpose would be to aid the development of the economy under thedirection of the Zimbabwe government.    But it would also provideforeign currency backing for the payment of pensions and, if required, for the remittance of proceeds of the sale of farms and other assets.    Provision could be made for support from the Fund to be withheld from a Zimbabwe government which went back on theconstitution and this would be a means of providing assurance to thewhites.    We were in agreement with the Americans over this andwe hoped to be able to persuade the whites of its advantage for them.Any arrangements we proposed for the transitional period were unlikely to find immediate acceptance with both the Rhode sian front and the Patriotic Front.    It was however important that our proposals should appear reasonable.    In hie view, there were fivefundamental conditions which must be satisfied in any settlement: -i.     There must be agreement on the terms of theindependence constitution for Zimbabwe.
ii.    We should have to take over the administration ofthe country for a maximum period of six months priorto independence under a British Resident Commissionerwhose main responsibility would be to organise andsupervise elections.iii. Mr Smith and th&apos;j Rhode sian Front would have to give up all power when the British Resident Commissioner took over.    It was clear that until this happened, the nationalists would not regard themselves as committed toany settlement, including calling off the guerilla campaign.iv. There would have to be agreement by the Rhodesianarmed forces and the Liberation Armies of the guerillasthat they would accept the authority of the british resident Commissioner and that there would be a ceasefirewith effect from the day on which he took over,v.    We should alpo need to secure agreement from theFront Line Presidents that they would not harbour or givesupport to guerillas who engaged in warlike activity.One of the major difficulties arose from the existence of the twoarmies and the problem was how they should be dealt with.    the rhodesian armed forces were seen by the whites as providing fortheir protection and there would therefore be reluctance to accept their disbandment.    But Mr Smith would realise that the newZimbabwe government would want its own defence forces.    Equally,the Patriotic Front would have to accept that we could not hand overpower to one group alone.    Each side would see that, if there was tobe a settlement, some compromise would have to be reached.     Hehad considered ways in which the British Commissioner could disbandthe Rhodesian armed forces and build up the Zimbabwe forces and had come to the view that the Commissioner must have the support ofsome outside force either to provide command and trainingfunctions or with wider law and order responsibilities.    The most likely basis for such a force seemed to be the Commonwealth.There were serious difficulties about the alternative of a united nations force, including the possibility of a Soviet veto.    the praticability of a Commonwealth force would depend very much onthe attitude of the largest Black African country, Nigeria, which we did not yet know.    A possible alternative would be for the two existingarmies coming together under the British Resident Commissioner,but this was an unlikely development.There were admittedly risks in the policy he had outlined but thedanger of doing nothing would be even greater.    If there was a breakdown of authority which resulted in a massacre of the whites,the United Kingdom would be held responsible for the situation.    we also had great economic interests in Africa which would be at risk ifwe were to abandon our efforts to seek a solution.    He had general
United States support for his approach and he expected to be able toreport next week to the Cabinet about the outcome of the consultationscurrently being conducted by the Anglo-Urdted States team.In discussion agreement was expressed with the view of theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary that the United Kingdom couldnot opt out of the situation even if we wished to do so.    We had moral and legal responsibilities, and we also had important economic interests.    There was a real danger that war might be international -ised.    The Cubans were already offering assistance to the guerillasin a number of ways.    So there was every possible incentive for us,to continue our efforts to achieve a negotiated settlement, even if wehad great difficulties in doing so.    It was important that theconditions mentioned by the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should be seen ?s a single package, since, if we were to become involved to the extent suggested, we could only consider doing so onthe basis that they were all met.    If there was to be a Commonwealthforce there would be advantage in some outer country, possiblyNigeria, providing the Commander.    No doubt we should have to do much of the planning, and would contribute a small contingent.    Butwe should avoid playing the predominant role.    There were undoubtedly major risks and whatever solution was reached wouldrequire the approval of Parliament.    But if we tried to shift our responsibilities to the United Nations, we should lose control of thesituation and have much less chance of avoiding the internationalisa-tion of the conflict.    Moreover people in the United Kingdom who hadfriends and relatives in Rhodesia v^juld press for us to intervene ifthings started going wrong.    It would be difficult to maintain that wewere doing our best if we had handed responsibility to the united nations.    This argued in favour of continued British involvement,including participation in a Commonwealth force.On the other hand it was argued that on the day the British resident commissioner arrived the rebellion would end and responsibility would pass to British Ministers who would be accountable toParliament.    We would then be in a position where the british people would regard it as the primary duty of the Government tosafeguard the lives of British servicemen in Rhodesia.    If all thefive conditions were to be met and maintained, there ought to be no danger, but we could not rely on this happening.    We could notcontrol the guerillas and the settlement might break down.    It waseasy to put forces in but even if we put a limit of six months on their presence it would be very difficult to withdraw them if trouble broke out.    There was a real possibility of things going badly wrong and ofour finding ourselves out of our depth financially and militarily.Inevitably, once there was a British force in Rhodesia they would beseen to be acting in defence of the whites and we could find ourselves in a position of fighting for the whites against the blacks.    This wouldhave a serious effect on our whole position in Africa.    We should certainly go on trying to achieve a negotiated settlement, but weshould draw the line short of putting in British troops.    The choicewas not, as had been suggested, between increasing British involve-ment, including a military presence, and a blood bath.    There was
a real danger of a blood bath, whatever we did.    The choice for ustherefore was whether, when it came, we should be in the middle ofit or whether we should keep out.    In this situation, despite the riskof a Soviet veto, there were attractions in a United Nations role,with a possibility of a United Nations force and administration by a united Nations Commissioner.In further discussion it was pointed out that we had a legal andhistorical role with regard to Rhodesia which we could not abdicate.There was a real possibility that Mr Smith might walk out and thathis government would then collapse.    This could lead to chaos.To abandon Rhodesia to a blood bath in these circumstances wouldnot relieve us of strong pressures to intervene.    But we should consider whether there were possible ways of achieving a settlement which would enable us to avoid the dangers which would result from adirect British presence in Rhodesia.   The possibility should be examined further in moving straight from agreement on a settlement to independence, without an intervening caretaker period.    despite the objections to this idea the advantages to us of working for a coalition government of moderate whites and nationalists who wouldtake on responsibility for the transitional arrangements were verygreat.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theissue was an immensely difficult one.    The whole Cabinet agreed onthe importance of making every effort to achieve a peacefulnegotiated settlement.    But there were considerable differences overthe extent of British involvement that we could accept to obtain sucha settlement.    Strong reservations had been expressed about sendingBritish troops to Rhodesia and about the difficulties we should face inthe event of a breakdown of the settlement.    On the other hand,emphasis had been placed on the vital importance to us, in the widercontext of our political and economic interests in Africa as a whole,of a peaceful settlement and thus of being prepared to accept certainrisks in order to achieve one.    We would need to ieel our way forwardcarefully and, in his further exploratory talks in Southern Africa,the Foreign and Commonwe alth Secretary should take account of theviews expressed in the discussion.    He should seek to discoverwhether a basis for agreement on an independence constitution existed,but without offering any committment on the question of a Britishpresence.    Before the Cabinet could reach any conclusion on this pointthey would need to know more about the prospects feu: achieving asettlement and whether an offer by us to take control during the care-taker period was likely to be a crucial factor.    Meanwhile theGroup of Ministers handling the matter would continue to examine the options on a contingency basis and the possibility of eliminating thecaretaker period on the lines suggested in discussion should befurther studied.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.7
EDUCATION INSCHOOLSA ConsultativeDocumentPreviousReference:CM(77) 23rdConclusions,Minute 45. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster General and the Secretary ofState for Wales (CP(77) 74) to which was attached a revised draftof a consultative document on education in schools.In a brief discussion, it was suggested that paragraph 7.7 shouldbe slightly expanded by a reference to the role of the Departmentof Employment and, as from this month, the Welsh Office inguiding the Careers Service and by a statement to the effect thatthe Careers Service had a major contribution to make to theinitiatives described in the preceding paragraphs.    It was also suggested that the word &quot;may&quot; in the second sentence ofparagraph 10.4 was too weak, particularly since the sentence didnot imply the allocation of additional resources towards measuresof positive discrimination.THE PRIME MINISTER., summing up the discussion, said that theSecretary of State for Education and Science and Paymaster general was to be congratulated on the revised draft of the consultative document which was a good paper, worthy of the public debate whichhad so far taken place on education in schools.    Any furthersuggestions for minor drafting changes should be sent to theSecretary of State as soon as possible.    Subject to these and to the suggestions made iu the discussion, the Cabinet approved the textfor publication, which was likely to be on 21 July.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General and the Secretary of State for wales to proceed accordingly.8CONFIDENTIAL_ ._ 1
PUBLIC 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEXPENDITURE Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(77) 70) setting out the economic1978-79 TO 1980-82   background and two memoranda by the Chief Secretary, Treasury,on the Public Expenditure Programmes (CP(77) 69) containing his previous proposals for the handling of the Survey, and another covering a reference: report of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee (CP(77) 73).CM(77) 11thConclusions, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER, introducing his paper,Minute 6 said that it attempted to set out in more detail than the paper whichhe had circulated for the Chequers meeting (CP(77) 65) the back-ground to the decisions they now had to take on public expenditure.He emphasised that the medium term assessment on which they were based was not a forecast, but a method of exploring the interactionsof different economic variables if past relativities continued.    Thegeneral picture was one of unprecedented opportunity from themiddle of 1978, with the exception of a continuing high level ofunemployment which was largely attributable to the increase ofone million in the labour force.    But there were great uncertaintiesunderlying the employment assumption and in any case the wholepattern depended upon the future course of inflation.    The paperillustrated two alternative assumptions about the course of earningsover the next year.    The lower case, assuming 10 per cent increasein earnings, was that which he had used in his last budget, andproduced exceptional growth rates and increase in living standards.But the 15 per cent case, which did not now look excessivelypessimistic, produced a much less favourable outcome.    Moreoverthere was a danger that if earnings rose even faster, a multipliereffect would set in, leading to a decline in confidence.    It wastherefore essential to be seen to maintain over the next six months the targets agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and toavoid any impression that the Cabinet were preparing to abandonthem.    There might in the autumn or winter prove to be scope forfaster expansion, though he would wish this primarily to increasetake-home pay rather than public expenditure.    After 1978-79, itmight be possible to seek a higher rate of increase in public expenditure than the 2 per cent which the Chief Secretary proposed,but it would be premature to start planning on this assumption at thepresent time.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that his own paper setout a way in which public expenditure could be kept within the limitsindicated by the chancellor s analysis.    He had been very anxiousto avoid a further round of public expenditure cut s, and by thevarious means outlined in his paper had suggested a method of keeping within the published public expenditure targets while stillleaving a significant though uncomfortably tight contingency reserve.He had done this by taking advantage of the net savings which lookedlikely to emerge in 1978-79, including some  120 million on housingresulting from the lower interest rates now assumed.    This did not represent a cut in the physical programme, but in the expected costof the agreed number of starts.    He was still left with a large
number of additional bids, listed in tables B and C of his paper,which he proposed should be absorbed or offset within existingdepartmental programmes.    This would allow the Cabinet to agree on public expenditure totals for 1978-79 which included a rather,low contingency reserve.    Cabinet would then have the option of publishing these figures, or publishing a slightly higher figure which made more room for a reconstituted contingency reserve.Decisions would be needed in the early autumn in time for the rate support Grant (RSG) negotiations and other preparations for 1978-79.He proposed to have bilateral discussions with the main spendingMinisters before the autumn about the rate of expenditure in1979-80 and later years.In discussion, it was argued that the Chief Secretary1 s proposals made inadequate allowance for the inevitable shortfall in public expenditure.    The practice of previous years had been to make a specific adjustment for this, but it had not been done this year,although it was allowed for in estimating the Public Sector borrowing requirement (PSBR).    that  made a big difference;  it might provideas much as a further  500 million room for manoeuvre in 1978-79.Programmes as a whole had been heavily underspent in 1976-77,partly as a result of the introduction of cash limits, although as thesystem became more familiar in its third year, this effect mightdiminish.    It was difficult for Departments to quantify the amountof shortfall on individual programmes, and to write their totalsdown accordingly at this stage;  to do so increased the risk of overspending on particular items.    It would be useful if the Treasurycould arrange for an analysis of the main causes of under spendingto see whether there was any systematic bias in addition to theeffect of cash limits.It was also argued that the Survey rested on unrealistic assumptions,for example, about the level of unemployment.    It was inconceivablethat the Cabinet would tolerate a level of unemployment as high as1.9 million;  the effect of substituting a more politically realisticlevel of 1. 5 million would be to reduce the estimate for unemploymentpay in 1978-79 by about  400 million.    On the other hand, it was argued that there were a number of h:.ghly optimistic assumptionsbuilt into the Survey as well, and that the two sets of assumptionstended to cancel one another out.In further discussion, it was argued that it would be a mistake to commit the Government now to damaging cuts in its programme(some of which would have to be announced in the immediate future)when the prospect might look quite different in the autumn, and whenbetter figures, for example about the likely impact of shortfall,might be available.    On the other hand, it was pointed out thatshortfall was extremely difficult to estimate until towards the endof the year in question.    The timetable for the RSG negotiations wasnot totally inflexible.    Moreover, the White Paper itself need notnecessarily be published as early as December, as the Treasuryplanned at present.    It was also pointed out that the economic
prospects outlined by the Chancellor were much less optimisticthan those put to the Cabinet at its informal discussion at Chequersthe previous month.    These had held out the prospect of an early and cautious move towards reflation.    The present papers took analtogether too narrow view.    They ignored the prospect ofsignificant additional revenue from the North Sea.    They assumedimplicitly policy decisions on other matters, for example the2 per cent target for the surplus on the balance of payments,which had never been endorsed by the Cabinet as a whole.    nor could it be assumed, as the Chancellor had done, that anyreflationary measures would largely be confined to tax.    There wasa strong case for some of it taking the form of additional expenditure.Such expenditure, for example, subsidies to food and fuel, wouldhave an immediate effect on the purchasing power of families, andwould be at least as acceptable to the TUC as reductions in personaltaxation.    The Cabinet&apos;s freedom of choice in these matters shouldnot be pre-empted by excessively rigid public expenditure plans.On the other hand, it was argued that early public talk of the scope for reflation, in whatever form, would have a very damaging effecton confidence and should be avoided, except for the relatively smalladjustments which would be the subject of a separate discussion inthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy in the next few days,and which were concentrated almost entirely on 1977-78.    (Theproposal to postpone the increase in the price of school meals,however, would have an effect which would persist throughout the planning period.)On the Chief Secretary&apos;s specific proposals, it was argued strongly that some Departments had contributed savings on their ownprogrammes in order to offset the increase which earlier in theyear had been expected on the housing programmes over the years1977-78 and 1978-79 on account of higher interest rates.    Now that interest rates were falling again, there was a case for reallocatingthose funds to the Departments who had made them available,rather than adding them to the general pool.    On the other hand, itwas argued that the expected reduction in housing expenditure hadlargely beeu pre-empted by the decisions recently taken on youthunemployment and other similar additions to expenditure.    Theywere no longer available to add back to other programmes.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not ready to take any firm decisions, although some public expenditure decisions largely but not exclusively related to1977-78, would have to be taken by the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy in the next few days in the context of thediscussions with the TUC on pay policy.    The Cabinet accepted that a decision to reflate the economy, whether by public expendi-ture or by fiscal measures could not be taken yet.    But the size and form of any reflation could have a significant bearing on theirpublic expenditure plans.    The Cabinet also wished to look again
at recent experience of shortfall in public expenditure programmes,its causes and its likely future pattern, especially in the financialyear 1978-79, bearing in mind the effect of likely higher rates of inflation on cash limits in that year.    As regards the detailedprogrammes for 1978-79, the Chief Secretary should begin a seriesof bilateral consultations with the Ministers concerned, about theextent to which their additional bids could be offset against expectedshortfall or other savings in their programmes.    As regards1979-80 and later years, he should discuss with his colleagues the implications of the 2 per cent growth rate for public expenditureidentifying the extent to which it would be possible to keep within these guidelines and the policy changes which would be necessary todo so.    He should report the results of these dicussions back to theCabinet in the early autumn, when decisions would be taken on the levels of expenditure to which the Government could then commititself in public.    Meanwhile, members of the Cabinet should be careful to avoid giving any impression of the prospects for reflation,whether by public expenditure or fiscal means.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up bythe Piime Minister of their discussion.12
7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(77) 72) recommending increasedfamily support in 1978-79 through Child Benefit (CB).THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Ministerial Group under his chairmanship had considered the general case for improving familysupport and the methods by which this might be done.    Other optionshad been examined but the Group had concluded that the right course was to improve CB for which the political case was very strong.Child Benefit would not give preferential help to poorer families butthe squeeze on living standards over the last two years had affectedall families and improving CB would help all of them, especiallylarger ones.    The Group had made no firm recommendation on thelevelof any increase.    Various options were set out in table 2 to thereport by officials attached to his paper.    The Chief Secretary,Treasury, recommended option 3 which would cost an extra 112 million in 1978-79 which would give  2,00 per child plus a 50ppremium for one parent families.    The rest of the Group thought thistoo low and the Minister of State, Social Security, had argued strongly that option 7 was the minimum acceptable increase.    This would cost an extra  320 million and give  2.40 per child.    The Groupconsidered that the political arguments favoured option 7 butrecognised that final decision would have to be taken as part of the review of public expenditure in the light of wider considerations.The Group was clear that it would be wrong to pursue the option of retaining child tax allowances at the present levels rather thancontinue to phase them out.    They had considered the possibility ofgiving further help to families over the costs of school meals but had concluded that a suspension of the announced increase on school mealcharges this autumn should not be regarded as a substitute for ahigher rate of CB and could only be justified in the context of settle-ment with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on pay restraint.In discussion, it was argued that the case for increasing CB wasvery strong.    Family support in the United Kingdom was worse than any other country in theEuropean Economic Community apartfrom Ireland.    Its real value had fallen since the Labour Party took office in 1974 and not to increase the level of direct family support toat least the 1974-75 level would leave the Government open to thecharge that it did less for families than the Tories.    To avoid this meant adopting option 7 rather than any of the less costly alternatives.More cash in the pocket of housewives would help to win over animportant part of the electorate amongst whom the Party was losingsupport.    There was a danger also that, if an inadequate increasein CB were made, changes in the Finance Bill to stop reductions inchild tax allowances would be forced onto the Government.    Nextyear it would be necessary to increase contributions by 50p or 60pin connection with the new pension scheme and this strengthened thecase for a substantial CB increase.    It was noted also that, had CBnot been introduced, it would have been necessary to raise childtax allowances and this would not have been considered in a public13CONFIDENTIAL
expenditure context.    On the other hand it was argued that whilstthere clearly was a strong case on political grounds for some increase in CB, there was little case on the grounds of relievingpoverty.    The cost of option 7 had to be seen in the context of theother pressures on the Contingency Reserve for 1977-78 which was already dangerously low.    As CB was available to all families the ..cost of achieving even small increases was very high - a lp increasecost for all children cost an extra  6 million.    The extra 40p perchild available under option 7 as against option 3 cost over 200 million more.    The benefit gain less fall in take-home pay ofoption 3 was 35p per week for the first child and 3p for each subsequent child.    This was a fair increase and politicallydefensible.In further discussion it was argued that table 2 gave a misleading impression of the net gains of the various options because it didnot take account of the fact that increased family income affected the amounts which could be claimed in rate rebates, and rent rebates and allowances.    This could, for example, reduce thenet benefit, under option 3 of 3lp for the first child to a figurebetween 2p and 12p.    Similarly eligibility for free school mealscould be affected which could mean that the effect of the increasein CB was a decline in household net income when school mealcharges were taken into account.    It would accordingly be unwise to reach any decision on the level of increase of CB until properassessment had been made of the effect on eligibility for other benefits or reliefs.    On timing it was noted that although anincrease in CB would not be payable until next April preparatory work would need to start in September and a decision needed to be announced before then.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were unable to reach a conclusion on what the level of increase in CB should be without a clearer picture of the effectof increasing CB on eligibility of families for relief from other charges.    They would need to resume their discussion at themeeting on 14 July.    The Secretaries of State for the environment and for Education and Science, in consultation as necessary withthe Secretary of State for Social Services, should consider further the points which had been made about effects on eligibility for raterebates and rent rebates and allowances, and free school meals.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet office July 1977 14
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 24th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 7 July 1977 at 9. 30 am27FOREIGN THE FOREIGN mind COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY   reporting onAFFAIRS the dispute with Guatemala over Belize said that the possibility ofmilitary action against Belize by Guatemala could not be entirelym m mdiscounted.    The Defence and Oversea Policy Committee hadBelize considered the situation and decided on an immediate reinforcement ofthe garrison.    This was a purely defensive measure.    Guatemalanmilitary capability had improved and the balance of forces was nowdecidedly in their favour.    The airfield on which we would depend to reinforce the garrison was particularly vulnerable to surprise attack.Six Harrier aircraft were arriving in Belize today and a battaliontactical headquarters and an additional infantry company were due on8 July.    Tigercat surface-to-air missiles were being deployed forairfield defence.    HMS Achilles had been hull down 130 miles from thecoast since 6 July and 2 other frigates were being despatched to thearea.    The Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,Mr Rowlands, was currently engaged in talks with the Guatemalans in washington.    Although it was too soon to come to any firm conclusions,the talks were going as well as could be hoped, and we were still trying to achieve a settlement.    The Americans had been informed about there reinforcements and the Guatemalans would be told towards the end ofthe talks today.    We must then expect some extravagant and bellicosestatements from the Guatemalan Government.    But we had strong support in the United Nations for our position.    The Mexican Governmentwas anxious to help and had offered to mediate in the dispute, but theBelizeans were not enthusiastic.    The Americans had not been as forth-coming in their support as we would have wished, because of their traditional policy of avoiding involvement in intra-American disputes.Indeed they were pressing us to give up some Belize territory ia orderto achieve a settlement.    Information about the reinforcements and an explanation of our intentions had also been given to CommonwealthCaribbean governments.    The deployments had been implementeddiscreetly and had successfully avoided attracting public attention so far.1
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wished to emphasise theimportance of avoiding premature disclosure of the despatch of reinforcements.    For the time being members of the Cabinet shouldtreat this information as Secret.The cabinet took note.Cabinet office July 19772
