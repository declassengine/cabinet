PARLIAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed ox the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week, and that it wouldbe proposed on 29 July that the Hou3e should rise for the SummerAdjournment until 26 October.    It was hoped to complete the session&apos;s business before the Summer Adjournment and to prorogueon 26 October, though there was a possibility that the House of lords would not be able to return the Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill tothe Hiuse of Commons in time for this, and that the final stages ofthis Bill would have to be taken at the end of October beforeProrogation;  the new Session would then start in tue following week.The Cabinet -1. Took note.SelectCommittee onthe Conduct ofMembers ofParliamentPreviousReference:CM(77) 25thConclusionsMinute 2THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the pattern ofdebate on 26 July vo uld be that he would first move a formal motionthat the Select Committee&apos;s report should be considered.    Each ofthe three Members concerned would then be able to make a personalstatement, after which they would withdraw.    He would then movethree separate motions, that the House agreed with the report so faras it related to Mr Cordle, Mr Maudling and Mr Albert Robertsrespectively.    It had been confirmed through the usual channelsthat the Opposition did not object to this approach.    Bearing in mind the background to the setting up of the Committee, the standing of its members and the care with which they had reached their conclusions,he believed that to do less than move motions to this effect would fail to give the Committee the support their report deserved, while to do more could be regarded by Members as taking too strong a lead on matters which were essentially for the House to decide.In his view it should be for the three Members concerned to decide on their course of action in the light of the views expressed by theHouse.    Other Members, however, might table amendments to hismotions proposing expulsion, suspension or censure of the three members; he himself would not vote for any such proposals.    TheOpposition might not support Mr Cordle in any vote on his expulsion,and it was possible that Mr Cordle would resolve the issue in hisown case by resigning, or indicating in his personal statement thathe would accept the decision of the House.    This was not a matter onwhich the Government should form a view but one for the House.    Henaturally hoped that his colleagues would agree with his own judgment,but the issue should be decided on a free vote of all Members, andhe would make clear in the debate that he was acting in his capacity as leader of the House and not expressing a Government view.The cabinet took note.
Ar rang em entwith theLiberalsPreviousReference:CM(77) 12thConclusionsTHE PRIME MINISTER said that he had read summaries of thediscussions with the Liberals on their 10 areas of policy, and members of the Cabinet had done well to carry these as far as theyhad done.    Mr Steel&apos;s disposition was to get agreement on the renewal of the arrangement between the Government and the Liberalsbefore the Summer Recess, and the Government should encouragethis provided the terms of renewal were sensible.    Mr Steel was,however, finding it difficult to get his colleagues to agree on anything,and his proposals tended to change daily.    Until the previous dayMr Steel had been proposing to discuss the matter with the otherLiberal Members of Parliament on 26 July and then to announce infairly general terms that the arrangement would continue;  but he had just sent a message that he now wished the renewal to be based onan exchange of letters.    The Prime Minister had asked Mr Steelfor a draft of the letter he had in mind to send, and had pointed outthe difficulties created for the Cabinet in not yet knowing the basis on which the Liberals wished to proceed.    He considered that an exchange of letters would be acceptable provided that Mr Steel1 sletter was in general terms relating to such matters as continuanceof the Government&apos;s economic policy, but there might be difficultyif the letter sought to lay down detailed conditions.    He had made clear to Mr Steel that there would be little room next Session forBills other than those on devolution and direct elections, and he didnot expect that Mr Steel would seek to make renewal of the arrange-ment dependent on the inclusion of a list of additional proposals inThe Queen&apos;s Speech.    It was now necessary to wait and see whatthe draft letter contained and whether the Liberals would have stillfurther changes of mind.The cabinet.Took note.2
FOREIGNAFFAIRSR.hodesiaPreviousReference:CM(77) 24thConclusions,Minute 42. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatit was toe early to judge the purpose behind Mr Smith&apos;s decision tohold elections in August.    The elections would be based on no morethan 3 per cent of the population.    It was possible that Mr Smith mightsee them as a means of strengthening his hand before taking a moreintransigent position:   alternatively, he might look to the elections toprovide him with support for coming to terms with realities.Bishop Muzorewa and Mr Sithole were standing firm on the principle ofone man, one vote, and would therefore have nothing to do withelections on the basis proposed by Mr Smith.    It was difficult at thisstage to say how we should respond.    The important thing was that weshould keep in close touch with the United States Administration and hewould be going to Washington the following day for talks with theUnited States Secretary cf State, Mr Vance.    If, after the elections,Mr Smith decided to go for an internal solution, this could createproblems for us.    Although such a solution would be attacked by thePatriotic Front and others, it could not be ruled out.    The important thing was that we should stick to the one man, one vote, principle.For the moment we should avoid doing anything dramatic, but weshould continue to work on our constitutional proposals and theZimbabwe Development Fund.    When he returned from Washington itwould probably be necessary for him to make a statement in the Housebefore the Recess.IsraelPreviousReference:CM(77) 20thC   idusions,Minute 3THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thePrime Minister of Israel, Mr Begin, seemed, during his visit to theUnited States, to have shown a greater degree of openness than he had done previously.    He now appeared to want the Geneva Conference tobe resumed in October.    The Foreign and Commonwealth secretary said he hoped this would not be too early:  the major problem ofPalestinian attendance had still to be resolved.    But the main role inall this was for the United States.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.UnitedState a IGermanRelationsTHE PRIME MINISTER said he had talked on the telephone with theChancellor of the Federal German Republic, Herr Schmidt, on thelatter&apos;s return from his visit to Washington.    He had been worried atthe time of the European Council about the extent to which herr Schmidt seemed to be lining up against the United States with president Giscard of France.    Their common ground was dislike of
the way the President of the United States, Mr Carter, had handled thesubject of human rights.    At the suggestion of several of the smallercountries he had been in touch with President Carter about this and thelatter had shown that he understood the problem.    The Prime minister was therefore pleased to hear from Herr Schmidt that his visit to washington had gone well.    Herr Schmidt had made it clear that thecordiality had been genuine and that there had been substantivediscussions also.    Herr Schmidt had told the Prime Minister that he felt President Carter was wholly serious ?.n his handling of the human rights issue and that tactically it should cause no problem at Belgrade.Herr Schmidt had said ths only real problem between him and president Carter concerned policy on non-proliferation.    He had hadno account yet of Kerr Schmidt&apos;s dinner with President Giscard, but inhis view, the outcome of the Washington visit would be that herr Schmidt would reaffirm his traditional Atlantic policy.    Tnevisit had been a timely one and its outcome would be reassuring to thesmaller countries.The Cabinet -2.       Took note of the statement by the PrimeMinister.
DEVOLUTION 3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord President of theCouncil (CP(77) 81) covering drafts of a proposed statement and a white paper on financial arrangements for the devolved services.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was essential for the Government to announce their intentions on devolution beforethe Recess.    The draft statement contained a clear commitment to theintroduction next Session of separate Bills for Scotland and &quot;Wales.Separate Bills had been strongly urged by the Scottish Council of theLabour Party, the Scottish Trades Union Congress and the Liberalsand would provide the best means of ensuring progress.    the separation of the proposals was not favoured by the Labour Party in wales and it would be essential to emphasise that the Government were equally committed to the passage of both Bills.    The changes for legislation described in the statement fell a long way short of the liberals&apos; demands, but could all be justified on merit and would not increase opposition to devolution.    He had discussed the changes withMr David Steel and was confident that they provided a sufficientmeasure of agreement to ensure the general support of the Liberalsfor new legislation for devolution.    The Liberals would nevertheless be free to seek to secure further changes by reasoned amendment.Mr Steel had however asked that the statement should repeat theGovernment&apos;s earlier undertaking to allow a free vote in any futuredebate on proportional representation for the devolved Assemblies;include a short reference to the continuing consultations on the consultative document &quot;Devolution:  The English Dimension&quot;;  andfollow more closely the words in the draft White Paper in announcing the proposals on financial arrangements.    There were no difficultiesin making these changes.    The White Paper made clear that an acceptable revenue-raising power for the devolved administrations hadnot been found, but that the Government would be willing to consider sympathetically any proposals they might have for a limitedsupplementary tax power, provided it did not relate to oil revenues.A detailed analysis was provided of the whole question of revenue-raising powers and a reasoned explanation of the Government&apos;attitude.    The proposals for assisting in the determination of blockfunding were not for legislation but for discussion with the devolvedadministrations.     They included the possibility of an independentadvisory board to assist in the provision of basic information about theneeds and standards of public services and the possibility of relatingthe total of devolved public expenditure in Scotland and Wales tocomparable expenditure elsewhere in the country on a basis ofrelative need.     This could be expressed as a percentage of comparable expenditure in the country as a whole and this percentagecould be established for an agreed period, perhaps four yearscorresponding with the administrations&apos; terms.5
In a discussion on the prospects for the support of new legislation inthe House, it was suggested that the Scottish National Party and thePlaid Cymru could hardly fail to support the Government in key votes,for which the Liberals1 support was also assured.    The position of the ulster Unionists was more uncertain, but the appointment of the speaker&apos;s Conference on Westminster representation and possioleprogress on arrangements for local government could gain the supportof some of them.    Some of the Governments own supporters who hadbeen opposed to devolution still seemed intransigent in their opposition, but there were signs that others were prepared to change their views.    It would be essential to persuade them that their support was critical.    A key element in this would be a demonstration of the united will of the Cabinet to fulfil the Governments commitment to devolution.    Having separate Scotland and Wales Bills would be convenient for the House and should increase the prospects ofcarrying the proposals into law.In continued discussion it was stressed that the announcement of separate Bills could pose serious political difficulties in Wales wherethere were already divisions in the Labour Party on devolution.    Itwould be tragic if legislation were enacted for Scotland but not for wales.    Such an outcome would immensely encourage the growth ofnationalism which in Wales had so far been contained.    It wastherefore of the utmost importance that the Government should notonly be fully committed to both Bills but should be equally committed to both.    Ideally, there should be one timetable Motion for both bills to ensure their progress.    Although there was ready agreement to giving equal support to both Bills, it was suggested that arrangementsfor a timetable Motion could only be decided in the course of the next session.     The Second Reading of the Wales Bill would need to followclosely the Second Reading of the Scotland Bill and, following atimetable Motion, a Committee of the whole House would need toconsider first the Scotland Bill.    Successful progress on that bill could well be found to assist subsequent progress on the Wales Bill.Time for the passage of both would have to be secured.In further discussion it was pointed out that 35 days were to have been allocated for the Scotland and Wales Bill and this suggested that something of the order of 24 days might be expected for the ScotlandBill and 16 days for the Wales Bill.    There would accordingly perhaps be only 15-20 days available for other Government legislation, otherthan finance Bills, and within this, time would have to be found on the floor for the European Assemblies Bill.    This would impose very severe constraints on the rest of the legislative programme, thoughone possibility might be to extend the next Session.6
In a discussion on the drafts of the statement and the White Paper, itwas suggested that the intention to impose a duty on the welsh assembly to review the structure of local government in Wales couldcreate pressures for changes in local government structure inEngland.    On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Labour Partyin Scotland did not wish to see any early changes and care needed to betaken to ensure that any statement critical of the structure of localgovernment did not extend to local government in Scotland.    It wasagreed that the specific reference to offshore oil revenues in thestatement could unnecessarily give offence.    It would be better toinclude a general reference in the statement to the conditions for anytax power set out in the White Paper, which made clear that oilrevenues were excluded.    It was suggested that an independentadvisory board, even though it had no executive powers, could be a source of embarrassment if it sought to make representations to theGovernment on the use of resources.    It was however recognised thatthe board would do no more than assist in establishing the facts as a necessary basis for judgments end decisions;  it would not be able to seek to influence the allocation of resources.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the Lord President of the Council should announce, in a statement in the following week, that separate Billsproviding for devolution to Scotland and to Wales would be introducednext Session.    Both were equally important in fulfilling theGovernment&apos;s obligations and the Cabinet were agreed that it was essential that there must be a full and equal commitment to both andthat this should be made evident.    The Whips should have this clearly in mind in ensuring that the necessary support was achieved in theHouse.    The Cabinet also agreed to the changes the Lord President ofthe Council had himself proposed for his statement and to the text asa whole, subject only to the deletion of the specific reference to off-shore oil revenues.    They were also agreed that the White paper should be published, as drafted, on the day the statement was made.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.7
LEGISLATION 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of on P.OAD State for Transport (CP(77) 83) about legislation on road safety.SAFETYTHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the purposeof his memorandum was to enable the Cabinet to judge how far thedifficulties of next Session&apos;s legislative programme should be allowedto stand in the way of the introduction of road safety legislation.    HehimselJ strongly favoured a comprehensive Bill next Session, covering the recommendations of the Blennerhassett Committee on Drinking andDriving, the compulsory wearing of seat belts and restrictions onmotorcyclists holding provisional licences.    These three groups of measures could be expected to reduce by about 1, 500 the total of 6, 000deaths on the road each year;  and the Cabinet, in assessing thebenefit, should take into account that the average age of those killedwas 32.    The Blennerhassett proposals had already been endorbed bythe appropriate Ministerial Committee as a basis for legislation, andthere was no dispute about the provisions on seat belts contained in theBill which was before Parliament last Session.    The new proposals were those for restrictions on motorcyclists, which were justified bythe sharp increase in the mileage covered and the proportionate numberof casualties in recent years.    He recognised that the issues raised by,and likely public reactions to, the three groups of proposals weredifferent in each case.    But he believed that comprehensive legislation would command a wide measure of public support and that, despite theopposition of small minorities, the pressures for Government action,particularly on seat belts and drinking and driving, would steadily grow;failure to take action would increasingly be seen as a lack of politicalwill.    In assessing the political attractions of the proposed legislation the Cabinet should remember that the Bill leading to the Road SafetyAct 1967 straddled the Labour Party&apos;s victory in the 1966 GeneralElection.    He believed therefore that comprehensive legislation in thenext Session was morally and politically justifiable;  and that if theParliamentary difficulties and constraints on legislative time shouldmake it impracticable to carry through such legislation, theGovernment should nevertheless stand by their commitment to it andfrankly explain the difficulties which prevented them from fulfilling itin this Parliament.In discussion there was a wide measure of agreement that comprehensive-sive legislation on road safety was highly desirable.    In support ofthis view, it was argued that, apart from the Manifesto commitment,there was a need for the Government to give a positive lead not only ondrinking and driving but also on seat belt legislation which, it was widely felt, could have been carried in the last Session of Parliamentif the Government had been prepared to make the necessary effort.On drinking and driving, the public were now more aware of the growing problem of alcoholism in general and would be likely tosupport the Blennerhassett proposal for spot checks, though it was
suggested that care should be taken to create a climate of support forthe change and to distinguish it from random testing.    The point wasalso made that the Dill on road safety in 1966 provided for spot checks,and this provision was only removed when the Bill was reintroducedafter the General Election.    On motorcycling, the proposals seemedsensible and might be particularly welcomed by the mothers of youngmotorcyclists.    It was suggested that the cost of attending training courses was a major disincentive for young people and that this aspect,together with the funding and accessibilitv of courses, should befurther examined.In further discussion serious reservations were however expressed about the desirability of introducing comprehensive legislation next session.    The proposal to allow the police to carry out spot checks todetect drinking and driving offences would present particular difficulty.    Informal soundings of a Group in the Parliamentary LabourParty had indicated that a large majority would not favour thisproposal;  and although the police wanted the power and saw noproblems in exercising it, the average motorist and the public generally might see the matter in a different light.    It was alsoargued that while there was a good case on the merits for legislation on seat belts, the Government had decided that the Bill introduced last session should be treated as a matter of conscience and left to a free vote of the House, and there would be obvious difficulties in presenting a reversal of this decision after such a short lapse of time.Moreover, there would be a strong reaction against any suggestion ofa guillotine Motion, and the Opposition could be expected to exploit theGovernments Parliamentary difficulties to the full by representing theBill as a further instance of interference with individual liberties.The proposed provisions on motorcycling, however meritorious,would also be likely to be misrepresented by many young people.    Itwas noted that the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland was proposing to publish a draft Order in Council making the wearing ofseat belts compulsory in Northern Ireland where the death and injuryrate from road accidents was more than twice as high as in GreatBritain.    There were arguments in favour of going ahead with this onthe basis that the draft Order in Council would provide an opportunityfor representations to be made and public opinion to be tested.    Onthe other hand, there would be implications for the position adopted bythe Government in relation to Great Britain, and these should befurther examined before any draft was published.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas wide support in the Cabinet for comprehensive legislation on road safety, although some members had reservations on particular points.This was not the time, however, to offend the considerable number of active lobbies which would strongly oppose such legislation.    It was ofa kind suitable for introduction early in the life of a new Parliament,
but it should not be attempted in the present Parliament.    He did not himself regard any of the Secretary of State for Transports proposals as matters of conscience, but it would be bound to cause practicaldifficulties for the Chief Whip if a proposal which had been left to a free vote in one Session was then whipped in the next.    The Secretaryof State for Transport would now consider how the Governments stanceon road safety legislation could best be publicly presented at thepresent juncture, and would prepare material on road safety, whichshould be in general terms, with a view to its inclusion in the nextLabour Party Manifesto.    The handling of the envisaged Order inCouncil to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory in NorthernIreland would need further consideration in the light of the conclusionwhich had been reached in relation to Great Britain, and meanwhile no promise should be made to publish a draft Northern Ireland Order inCouncil on seat belts.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Transport, and the Secretaryof State for Northern Ireland to be guided accordingly.WIDERIMPLICATIONSOF THEINDUSTRIALSTRATEGY5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Industry (CP(77) 84)covering papers which they proposed to circulate to the national economic Development Council (NEDC) on the wider implications ofthe industrial strategy.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, following thePrime Minister1 s request in February, officials had made a study of ways in which Departments not primarily concerned with the industrialstrategy could adjust their own policies in order to further the objectives of that strategy.    The Secretary of State for the.Environment and the Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General nad already made effective appearances at NEDCto explain the way in which their Departmental policies contributed tothe strategy.    The present paper went much wider, and described a wide range of policies where it might be possible to make adjustments in the interests of the industrial strategy.    The paper was however achecklist of proposals for further study, rather than an announcementof specific changes in policy.    There was an understandable reluctancewithin Departments to give the industrial strategy priority over theirown policies, and there was therefore a need for a strong lead fromMinisters in further work of this kind.    He was not wholly satisfiedthat the present paper was yet ready for presentation to NEDC inAugust.10CONFIDENTIAL
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the industrialstrategy had been launched successfully.     Both sides of industry were now committed to its success.    Much was being done to advance the strategy through minor economic measures like industry schemes butit was essential that the right macro-economic conditions should be created.    If the rate of inflation could not be brought down, if interest rates could not be kept low, and if the exchange rate deterioratedfurthei, no amount of micro-economic adjustment could restore thesituation.    However, if the right conditions could be created bymacro-economic policy, industrial strategy could succeed.    He had allthe legislative powers he needed, and was not at present seekingfurther funding.    The next uteps were to ensure that the recommen-dations of the various sector working parties could be translated into action by individual firm?, and that the conflicts between theindustrial strategy and some of the Governments other policies couldbe reduced.    The pre pent paper concentrated on this last point.Some recent decisions, for example on the Temporary EmploymentSubsidy, assistance to the Chrysler Motor Company, the steelinvestment programme, and tha Drax B power station, although taken for good reasons, conflicted with the strategy.In discussion it was argued that Ministers had had insufficient time toconsider the paper in the necessary detail.    Cn a first reading it looked too much like a report by officials in which the necessarypolitical touch was lacking.    It was not clear that industrial strategycould always be given priority over other policies.    For example,the Trades Union Congress attached great importance to a reductionin standard working hours, yet the paper treated this as an illustrationof the kind of social policy which frustrated the industrial strategy.Similarly, despite the uncertainties created by some kinds ofindustrial legislation, the Government was committed to make further progress on industrial democracy, on the law of picketing, and onoccupational pensions.    No paper presented to NEDC at this 3tageshould suggest that the Government was going slow in these areas.Moreover, the paper tended to over-emphasise the burden on industry of previous employment legislation.    There were other areas of conflict where the industrial strategy should not always automaticallyhave priority:  for example, there were genuine political anxietiesabout pollution which could not be brushed aside.    On the other hand,there were some developments for which the Government could takeproper credit in the paper, for example the pilot scheme for providing houses for workers moving into new areas.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet felt it had not been able to study the paper in sufficient detail.The paper should not therefore be submitted to the August meeting ofthe NEDC.    Ministers who had specific points to raise on it should write to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    The Chancellor of the
Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Industry should prepare a revised draft paper in the light of the discussion for submission to theNEDC in the autumn.    He would consider further with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the arrangements for the examination of this revised draft by Ministers before it was brought back to Cabinet.The Cabinet -I took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Industry to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office21 July 197712
