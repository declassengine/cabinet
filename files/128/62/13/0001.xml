INDUSTRIAL ACTION IN THE FIRE SERVICESPAY POLICYCROWN AGENTS:   THE FAY REPORT
PARLIAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inj-affairs the House of Commons during the following week.Scotland andWales BillsPreviousReference:CM(77) 27thConclusions,Minute 3THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, followingwhat the Prime Minister had said at the Labour Party Conference,he believed that there was now a general understanding of the needfor all members of the Parliamentary Labour Party to support theScotland and Wales Bills and the timetable motions on these Bills,and that the votes on the two Second Readings and the timetablemotions the following week could be won.    Both Bills now containedreferendum provisions which should help to persuade those who haddoubts about devolution to vote for the Bills.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that thelargest majority was likely on the Second Reading of the ScotlandBill, with a less good majority on Second Reading of the Wale3 Bill.There had been some shift in the Opposition1 s attitude to the time-tabling of these Bills, and it should be possible to carry the timetablemotions though the size of the majorities would depend on the behaviour of the minority Parties.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Government would be in a very embarrassing position if they lost their major legislative proposals of the Session.    Both Bills nowcontained provisions for a referendum, and to vote against them would be to attempt to deny the people of Scotland and Wales theopportunity to decide whether they wished to have devolution.    all members of the Cabinet should make a positive and constructiveeffort to persuade those Government backbenchers whom they werein a position to influence of the need to vote for the Scotland andWales Bills on Second Reading and for the timetable motions.    Itcould not be assumed, however, that no problems would arise on other parliamentary business.    The Opposition would be looking foropportunities throughout the Session to bring defeats on theGovernment, which could not afford to relax, and the parliamentary secretary, Treasury would take appropriate action to make clear to Government supporters the need to be present for divisions.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of this part of their discussion.Merchant THE LORD property /Y SEAL asked whether it would be possible to shipping Bill introduce this Bill in the House of Lords, a course which had beenfavoured by a major .ty of members of the Legislation Committee(LE) and was strong y urged by the Secretary of State for Trade.1
THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion,  said thatit was necessary to consider the impact on thu Commons of introducing this Bill in the Lords.    There was no point in introducingBills so a3 to provide business for the Lords if there was not thetime to get them through the Commons.    Should time become avail-able for an additional Bill, there were other Bills in competition with the Merchant Shipping Bill;  for instance, he was under pressure from the Co-operative Movement to introduce legislation to establish a Co-operative Development Agency, and there was the education bill.    LE would continue to keep the progress of the legislative programme under review, but any final decision to introduce theMerchant Shipping Bill would be a matter for the Cabinet.The Cabinet -2.       Tcok note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.Private The Cabinet had a brief discussion of Bills suitable for handing to members&apos; Bills Members successful in the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the list of Bills suitable for handing to Private Members,which had been drawn up following a trawl of all Departments,would be circulated to all members of the Cabinet, who should consider whether there were any further Bills of an attractivenature which might be added to the list, and let the Lord Presidentof the Council have their suggestions as soon as possible.    It mustbe expected that one of the Members successful in the ballot would introduce a Bill on Abortion;   the best solution to this difficultissue would be a compromise Bill which could be accepted by bothsides, and the Secretary of State for Social Services would reportto him, with copies to other members of the Cabinet, the outcome of the discussions with interested Members of Parliament whichwere being held with the aim of securing such a compromise.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.European Assembly    The Cabinet were informed that a number of Ministers had beenElections BillPrevious Reference:C*&apos;(77) 23rdCe-xclusions,Minute 2approached by Liberals about their voting intentions on this Bill;the object of these approaches was apparently to enable the leader of the Liberal Party, Mr David Steel, to be informed how manyMinisters would vote for the regional list system.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Lord President of the Council would take up this matter withMr. Steel, and all members of the Government would be advisednot to reply tc any such approach from the Liberals.The Cabinet -4.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.3
FOREIGNAFFAIRSSouth AfricaPreviousReference:CM(77) 34thConclusions,Minute 12. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY,referring to the Security Council debate on South Africa,  said thatwe had been criticised, especially by the Africans, for vetoeing,together with the Americans and French, the three resolutionsimposing sanctions on South Africa.    Now that the debate was over,there was a greater understanding of the reasons why theseresolutions were unacceptable to us.    This applied even to tfeeAfrican countries, although they would not say so publicly.    Therewas now a mandatory arms embargo in force but we were not obligedby the United Nations resolution to take any economic measures.He had discussed the position with the Economic Committee of theTrades Union Congress, who understood the reasons for the line wehad taken in relation to economic sanctions.    They wanted us, however,to do all we could to ensure that the Code of Conduct was applied andto take steps to restrict new investment.    From what the SouthAfrican Prime Minister, Mr Vorster, had said on 8 November, wecould expect retaliatory action against Botswana, Lesotho andSwaziland in the event of any further measures again3t South Africa.This underlined the need to proceed cautiously.rhodesia previous reference:CM(77) 29thConclusions,Minute 1THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hewould defer a substantial report on the situation until Lord Carverreturned from Africa.    President Kaunda of Zambia was showingsigns of going back on his support for a settlement based on earlyelections:  this was something which we could not underwrite.There was to be a debate in the House of Commons on 11 Novemberabout the renewal of sanctions, but it seemed unlikely that this would present problems for the Government.L-&quot; anon THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that negotiations had been going on for a long time.    There was still nostability and sporadic outbursts of violence.    It had not provedsatisfactory to rely on ad hoc measures, as had been the case so far,and in his view there might be a need for a United Nations peace-keeping force.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
COMMUNITY 3. THE PRIME MINISTER said he had decided to include the\FFAIRS sub-heading &quot;Community Affairs&quot; on Cabinet agendas to enable theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary or other Ministers with european responsibilities to report on recent developments in theCommunity which it wculd be useful to inform the Cabinet.    Therewas however no intention of using this item to by-pass the ministerial committee on European Questions and there could of course be noquestion   of seeking to settle matters of which notice had not beengiven-CommonFisheries PolicyPreviousReference:CM(77) 34thConclusions,^    ute 1THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reportedthat he and his Irish colleague had encouraged the fishing industries of their two countries to meet in order to maintain a united front in negotiations on the Common Fisheries Policy.    There were signs ofthe Dutch showing greater understanding of our position but the continuing political uncertainty in the Netherlands had delayed aprojected meeting with his Dutch colleague.    From whatCommissioner Gundelach had told him it seemed that the Germansrather than the French might be emerging as the biggest obstacle to the achievement of our fishery objectives.Drivers&apos; hours THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said the withdrawal and Tachographs       of the French objection at the recent Council of Ministers (Transport)had enabled us to secure a further 3-years in which to adapt to community regulations on drivers&apos; hours.    A different problemarose from the Commission^ intention to take us to the EuropeanCourt for failure to enforce the introduction of tachographs indrivers&apos; cabs.    To do so would lead either to considerable industrial unrest or an additional 5 to 10 per cent pay claim from the unions.We should need to apply the Directive in due course but he was seeking to slow down the legal procedures as much as possible.The Cabinet -1        Took note.France It was suggested that the honour conferred by the President ofFrance, M Giscard d&apos;Estaing, on the Premier of Quebec,  &apos;M Levesque, had been very provocative both to Canada and to us as amember of the European Community.    We ought therefore to take anopportunity of registering our disapproval.    It was however pointedout that the separatist issue was a very difficult and delicate one forthe Canadian Government and any protest by us could well be counter-productive.    We had close and excellent relations with Canada, butthey would be very sensitive about our taking up any public position on a Canadian domestic problem.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatwhile the Cabinet agreed that the French had behaved in aprovocative way we should not intervene unless Mr Trudeau wishedus to do so.    Indeed unilateral action on our part might be taken as implying a relationship with Canada which the Canadians themselves would not regard as appropriate.The Cabinet -2        Took note.6
.NDUSTRIAL 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENTACTION IN THE       said that the Annual Conference of the Fire Brigades Union (FBU)FIRE SERVICES       had decided on 7 November to call a national strike from the morning of 14 November if their wage claim had not been met.    although there were some indications that a stoppage might not be complete inall areas, there was little doubt that we were faced -with the prospectof a major withdrawal of fire services throughout Great Britain.    InNorthern Ireland too he understood that the firemen had made knowntheir intention to take similar action.    Contingency plans had been putin hand to use servicemen who would man Home Office emergencyappliances.    About 10, 000 men would be trained and about 750emergency appliances were being issued from Home Office and scottish Office depots.    These arrangements would enableemergency fire cover to be made available in urban areas on request from the local authorities^    Although the servicemen could be relied upon to respond to whatever calls were made on them, they could notbe a full replacement for the normal fire service.    Consultationshad been taking place between the local authorities, the Chief FireOfficers and the Chief Constables and the District Army Commandersthroughout Great Britain in order to make detailed preparations foreach locality.    It was up to local authorities to request serviceassistance and the Home Office had sent a circular to fire authoritiesso that they would know exactly what to do.    He had arranged for anOperations Room to be set up in his Department which would be mannedaround the clock to respond to requests for assistance.    similar arrangements had been made by the Secretary of State for Scotland.Advertisements in the Press and on television over the next few dayswould advise the public on individual fire precautions.    In addition,he was arranging for more detailed guidance to be issued on theparticular hazards, such as schools, hospitals, and in industry.The emphasis would be on vigilance and self-help.    arrangements were being made that day to co-ordinate all departments  relationswith the Press and the media.    As a further step he intended to broadcast on Sunday evening, when he wo^ld underline the guidancewhich was being given.    The possibility of picketing was a matter ofsome concern.    Strict application of Defence Council instructionswould mean that servicemen would not cross a picket line on their way to answer a fire call.    The FBU had however made it clear thatthere would be nc question of their members picketing the emergencyfire services:  the real worry was from others, such as the SocialistWorkers Party.    He had sought the advice of the police authorities on. the control of pickets and he would remain in close consultationwith the Secretary of State for Defence.In discussion, it was argued that the Government1 s attitude should notbe to raise public opinion against the firemen&apos;s cause.    unstanding of their case should be shown whilst making it clear that there were other, overriding factors which precluded a settlement outside theguidelines.    Moreover, the Government should not appear to beaccepting that a strike was inevitable, but to be working towards asettlement on the basis of a 10 per cent increase in pay and a formula
on the reductionin hours.    The National Joint Council was already-working on the details, but there seemed little chance of developmentsthis week which could lead to a change in the strike decision,especially as the FBU Executive would have to reconvene theconference before the strike decision could be revoked.    There was general support for the argument that the way forward lay in working out in greater detail how a reduction in hours would be achieved, and how the training of the required numbers of extra recruits could beput in hand,    The firemen were unique in working a 48-hour week andwere genuine in seeking shorter hours rather than the opportunity to earn increased overtime.    It was important, however, not to go beyond the money offer of 10 per cent because of its implications forthe public sector as a whole.    The claim by local authority manual workers would shortly be for negotiation and there were also smallergroups such as employees of the water authorities who, if they decidedto strike, could have an impact on the public even greater than thefiremen.In further discussion, it was noted that in Northern Ireland, part-timefiremen would probably continue to work, but the full-time menwere expected to strike.    It was unlikely that there would be anypicketing, especially as the FBU Executive had made it known that a token stoppage by firemen in Northern Ireland would be accepted asan adequate mark of solidarity.    In the hope that at least the part-time firemen would continue to work, it was not intended to introduceservicemen immediately, but troops were being trained and emergency appliances were being transferred from store in Scotlandagainst contingencies.    We must expect the Provisional IRA to seek to take advantage of a firemen1 s strike, but they   might take some time to react.    Nevertheless, there was a hazard fromcassette incendiary bombe,    not only in Northern Ireland itself butalso on the mainland.In further discussion, consideration was given to special fire hazardsin schools, hospitals and in industry,    Consultations had taken place at Ministerial and official level between the Home Office and theother interested Departments in compiling detailed guidance on particular fire hazards.    It would be for each Department to ensurethat this advice was disseminated to all who needed it and it wassuggested that members of Cabinet should satisfy themselvespersonally that this was being done.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted with approval the steps being taken to provideemergency fire cover in the event of a strike.    All members of theCabinet whose fields of responsibility were affected should take a personal interest in ensuring that all possible preventive measures were taken and that advice was widely disseminated.    If the striketook place - and it should not yet be accepted as inevitable - everyeffort would need to be made to find a means of resolving the disputewithout compromising the pay guidelines.    The best hope lay in
working out practical details for reducing firemen&apos;s hours of work,but it was particularly important that strict secrecy should be preserved over this to avoid premature disclosure of a negotiating position.    The Government should not endeavour to set publicopinion against the firemen.    The latter had a case even though there were wider factors which meant that it could not be met in full.The Government&apos;s public stance should be that the offer of a10 per cent increase and a possibility of a reduction in hours was themost that could be afforded in present circumstances andconstituted a fair offer which they hoped the firemen would reconsider the Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.9
PAY POLICYPreviousReference:CM(77) 33rdConclusions,Minute 25. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, during the discussion on theprevious item, it had been suggested that the Government needed tomake a new approach to the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on paypolicy since they were at present staggering from one crisis toanother.    He did not take this view of recent events.    The problemsfacing the Government were very considerable but their policy ofbeing firm but not provocative was meeting with a huge response as would be seen from the replies to a public opinion poll to be publishedlater that day.   In a situation where living standards had fallen overthe lust two years and where differentials had been distorted there could be no magic solution to reconcile the overriding economic needsof the country with the legitimate grievances felt by certain groups.It would be wrong to overstate the success of pay policy to date.Nevertheless the fact remained that it had survived one crisis after another with increasing public support.    The basic reasonablenessof the Governments position rested on the fact that not only had living standards stopped falling but that there was real evidence of inflationcoming down provided the 10 per cent pay guideline   was observed.This guideline was, if anything, on the high side and the Governmentwould have to continue to explain, patiently but firmly, that, while they understood the reasons- why higher claims were being pressed,the level of settlements must conform to the guidelines.In discussion it was suggested that the Government, despite the apparent large degree of popular support for their policies, shouldbeware of the motives of the media in dramatising situations in whichthe Government was seen to &quot;win or lose&quot;.    Any appearance of a repetition of the events of 1974 needed to be avoided:  otherwise,even if the Government were successful, long term damage might bedone to their relations with the trade unions.    The Government1 sstance should be to show understanding of real grievances, which themedia tended totally to ignore until there was a severe industrial dispute, but to explain why grievances could not be remedied at thepresent time.    In other words the battle to secure acceptance of paypolicy should be accompanied by a highlighting of the real problems.In further discussion it was argued that the degree of success achievedto date had been overstated.    The pay policy was not working over a wide field.    Furthermore even if the line was being held reasonablvwell in the public sector there was widespread evasion in the private sector through the medium of bogus productivity deals.    Thisstrengthened the case for a new approach to the TUC who had as muchinterest as the Government in ensuring an orderly return to collective bargaining.    Another point which might merit discussion with the tuc was the fact that there were no incentives for workers whosettled within tne guidelines:  this was a weakness of using a relativelyblunt weapon and the possibility of a more regular process of reviewsought perhaps to be considered.    Against this it was argued that paypolicy could be said not to be working over a wide field only in the sense that a settlement level at 5 per cent or 6 per cent had not beenestablished as a norm.    This was not perhaps surprising given the factthat the months before Christmas were always bound to be the most10
difficult because the fall in inflation would be less visible.    Thereally striking fact however was the degree of success achieved inavoiding settlements above 10 per cent;  and there had been somenotable successes in the private sector.    Investment confidence wasreturning and there was a wider degree of acceptance that the present economic difficulties were being overcome.    The need for the closest possible understanding with the TUC was generally recognised:  butthe question of any approach to them needed very sensitive handlinggiven their existing mandate.    The question of any recognition forgroups with genuine grievances who settled voluntarily within theguidelines had inevitably to be a matter for the next phase of paypolicy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Government were achieving a greater degree of successthan might have been expected.    They ought however to be neitherelated nor depressed.    They had to combine resolution firmly tomaintain the guidelines with understanding of the problems of thosewho had to suffer disappointments as a consequence.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.6. Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord Chancellor(CP(77) 102) to which was attached a draft White Paper in reply to theFay Report, together with a note by the Secretary to the Cabinet(CP(77) 101) with which was circulated summaries of the Fay report and of the Stevenson Report on the Crown Agents.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the Ministerial Group under his chairmanship (GEN 104) had considered the problems raised by thereceipt of the report of the Committee under Judge E S Fay which hadbeen appointed in April 1975 to inquire into the circumstances which led to the financial difficulties of the Crown Agents in the previous year.    The Report was severely criticial of the conduct of theCrown Agents in the 1960s and early 1970s which had led to a deficit of  200 million which would either have to be met by the taxpayeror would be a continuing burden on the Crown Agents.    The Fayreport attributed these losses to incompetence rather than misconduct,combining the actions and inactions of individuals with a defectivesystem.    Outside -agencies contributed to the failure to prevent the losses.    It was important to note that the failures of Government toinform itself of the developments, to appreciate the risks and to graspthe need for quick action had been a major contributory factor.Although most of the blame attached to the previous Administration,some of the events giving rise to the losses had taken place under thepresent Government or a previous Labour Administration.    While the11CROWN AGENTS:THE FAY REPORTPreviousReference:CM(77) 30thConclusions,M-nute 1
Ministerial Group were agreed that the Fay report must be published(as had been promised in Parliament), its appearance must be handledwith sensitivity.    There were three further points to considered  .What should the Government do about individuals who might have beenculpable or have failed in their duty?   Criminal and civil proceedings were under way in appropriate cases but there remained the questionof what should be done about individuals in the public services who had fallen short of the standards which were expected.    The MinisterialGrouo preferred, by majority, an outside inquiry to examine the case for disciplinary action.    This was the pattern which had been followed in the Crichel Down aad 3ossard cases.    A minority of the Group,however, thought this would be unproductive because the most culpableindividuals had now left the public service and further effective actionagainst them was impracticable.    The second issue was the publicationof the Stevenson report.    Parliament had been told that the report would not be published.    However, the former Minister for overseas development, Mr Richard Wood, together with the Chairman and members of the Committee, were now content that the report shouldbe published despite this statement.    In the special circumstances theGroup recommended this course.    The third issue was the urgency of legislation to put the Crown Agents onto a new constitutional basis.The Group were satisfied that legislation was desirable but no longeressential, since the necessary action to reorganise the Crown agents and define their relationship with the Minister had already been taken.In discussion, it was agreed that the Stevenson report should bepublished, with the deletions necessary to keep confidential the transactions of certain client governments or to avoid quotations fromwitnesses.    Although the existence of these minor deletions mightattract comment, the Government could give firm assurances thatthere was no cover-up involved.In further discussion, it was argued that the appointment of aCommittee of Inquiry was necessary to satisfy Parliamentary andpublic pressures following publication of the Fay report.    It wouldgive some of the individuals mentioned in the report the chance xoclear their names, while establishing the degree of blame to be attachedto others.    An inquiry would help to establish the responsibility of organisations as well as of individuals.    The precedent of the inquiriesestablished following the main inquiries in the Crichel Down and Bossardcases should be followed.    An inquiry under the 1921 Tribunals of inquiry Act would be too cumbersome.    The appointment and terms ofreference of such an inquiry should be announced when the Fay report and White Paper were issued.    The alternative of saying that theGovernment was considering the possibility of an inquiry was unsatisfactory.    The Governor had with some reluctance agreed toco-operate in an inquiry which covered the Bank of England.    TheChairman of the Public Accounts Committee and the Comptroller and auditor General should be informed before the announcement if,    as was proposed, the inquiry was to cover the Exchequer and AuditDepartment.12
On the other hand, it was argued that a further inquiry would merelyrepeat the work cf the Fay Committee:  the proposed terms ofreference were in substance the same as those of the Fay Committee.It would prolong the affair thus making more difficult there-establishment of confidence in the Crown Agents who were playingan important part in the export effort.    Most of those really culpablehad either died or retired since the events in question.    It waslegally impossible to withhold their pensions.    It followed that theonly disciplinary action which might follow would involve only minorpenalties against relatively junior officials.    It was the responsibilityof the individual Departments and organisations ccncerned to pursue their own disciplinary action.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed on the need to publish the Fay report and anaccompanying White Paper giving the Governments views.    TheMinister of State for Overseas Development had discretion to makeany minor editorial changes in the text of the White Paper whichmight prove necessary and should look again at the order cf the argument.    She should circulate copies of the revised version to theCabinet before publication.    The Stevenson report should be published at the same time, with the minor deletions needed to protect theposition of foreign governments and to avoid direct quotations fromwitnesses.   The deletions should be agreed between the LordChancellor, the Attorney General and the Minister of State for overseas Development.    A majority of the Cabinet considered thatthere should be an external inquiry into neglect of duty by individuals in the public services and that this should be announced in the white paper.    The Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Lord Privy seal the Attorney General and the Minister of State for Overseas development should give further consideration to the terms of reference.    TheChairman of the Public Accounts Committee and the comptroller and Auditor General should be told of the intention to establish the inquiry.    The Co-operation of the Governor of the Bank of england had already been secured.    The report and White Paper should bepublished on the first convenient Thursday in the form of a parliamentary return, in order to ensure absolute privilege.Finally, the Cabinet should know that action had been put in hand toguard against a repetition in other organisations in the public sector of difficulties similar to those encountered by the Crown Agents.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister, and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office10 November 1977
