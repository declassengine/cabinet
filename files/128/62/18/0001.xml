PARLIAMENTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the week beginning 9 January 1978.EuropeanAssemblyElections bill previous reference:CM(77) 38thConclusions,Minute 1In discussion of the handling of the amendment to Clause 3 of theEuropean Assembly Elections Bill which would provide forAssembly elections in Northern Ireland to be held under the firstpast the post system, the point was made that the Government were fully committed to the use of the single transferable vote system inNorthern Ireland notwithstanding the decision of the House to adoptfirst past the post for Great Britain.    It was most important tosecure the defeat of this amendment, but to issue a three-line whipcould cause problems given the general whipping arrangements onthe Bill and the free vote on the method of election in Great Britain.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Chief Whip would send a special message with the whip making clear the reasons for defeating this amendment, which in the normal way would have justified a three-line whip, and members of theCabinet would reinforce this message in their contacts with membersof the Parliamentary Labour Party.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.arrangement with theLiberalsPreviousReference:CM(77) 28thConclusions,Minute 1THE PRIME MINISTER said that, when Mr Steel, the Leader of theLiberal Party, had seen him following the rejection by the House ofthe regional list system for elections to the European Assembly, hehad been able to show, and Mr Steel had accepted, that theGovernment were amply fulfilling all the understandings in hisexchange of letters with Mr Steel in July.    The Liberal Membersof Parliament had subsequently decided not to withdraw from theagreement with the Government, but there was likely to be a specialLiberal Party Conference in January, when Mr Steel would have tofight hard to secure endorsement of the continuance of the agreement and might not succeed.    There were considerable advantages in a formal agreement which enabled the Government to assure themselvesin advance of Liberal support in Parliament on matters ofimportance, but Liberal withdrawal from the agreement would notnecessarily mean that they would vote against the Government in anyvote of censure.    The Opposition would, however, mount an attackon the Government on the alleged inadequacies of the country&apos;s defence,
and this was an issue on which the liberals might support the conservatives.    The Government might accordingly find themselvesisolated and vulnerable to a Parliamentary defeat in the DefenceDebate which would take place before the Budget.    If this happenedit would be a serious matter for the future of the Government.The Cabinet -2. Took note.2
FOREIGN 2. The Cabinet were informed of the latest developments in affairs the Middle East.    Mr Begin&apos;s meeting with President Carter was an encouraging development and it was clear that he was takingsubstantive but limited proposals with him.    Whether these wouldMiddle East be adequate to ensure progress with Egypt and the other Arab Statesremained to be seen.    Mr Begin was keeping in very close touchPrevious with the Prime Minister and hoped that we would use our influenceReference: with the other members of the European Community.CM(77) 37thConclusions,Minute 4South em Afri caPreviousReference:CM(77) 38thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, onour proposals for Rhodesia, we were at present in the position ofbeing attacked by both sides.    President Kaunda of Zambia hadpersonally been responsible for dealing some serious blows to ourinitiative.    Only three days before the Security Council meeting atwhich the initiative was discussed, the Foreign and commonwealth secretary had discovered that President Kaunda had agreed to meet mr Ian Smith.    If this had leaked out there would have been greatdifficulty in getting the resolution through the Security Council.Now President Kaunda&apos;s abandonment of support for early electionshad had a bad effect on the Patriotic Front who were adopting an increasingly unreasonable position.    They were demandingarrangements during the transitional period which would mean, ineffect, rigging the elections.    This was completely unacceptable tous.    Equally, however, we could not come out in support ofMr Smith&apos;s proposals which would exclude participation by thePatriotic Frcnt.    So he agreed with the United States Secretary ofState, Mr Vance, that the best course was to stand firm on our own position for the time being and see how the situation developed.    Hewas still maintaining contact with the South African Government,who wanted a settlement and would probably be prepared to bringfurther pressure on Mr Smith to achieve one.    We were also in contact with the South African Government over the problem ofNamibia, where difficulties had arisen.    The South West AfricaPeople&apos;s Organisation (SWAPO) were beginning to doubt whether theycould win the elections.    The South Africans were prepared to go ahead and to accept a United Nations presence, although there was still some discussion about the withdrawal of South African troops.But without SWAPO&apos;s support no eolution was likely to be acceptable to the international community.    It had to be recognised that SWAPOhad achieved considerable influence in the United Nations, where theywere in a position virtually to control any vote on Namibia.    Theposition was therefore that by January we could be in a situation withregard both to Namibia and Rhodesia where elections were in prospecton the basis of one man, one vote, but without general international support.3
THE PRIME MINISTER said that in Rhodesia, the Patriotic front had clearly overplayed their hand.    But there could be no certainty that, given Mr smith s past record, the internal talks would notbreak down.    The Foreign end Commonwealth Secretary shouldcontinue to pursue his present line of policy and should circulate a report on developments after the Recess,The Cabinet -Took note.4
3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the visit of president Giscard and other French Ministers earlier in the weekhad justified the claim in the Press that Anglo-French relations hadbeen &quot;totally restored1&apos;.    President Giscard had been anxious toavoid   differences with us.    There had been useful talks aboutindustrial collaboration over nuclear energy, the aircraft industryand the proposed cross-channel electricity link, and between british Leyland and Renault.    President Giscard&apos;s conception ofEurope appeared to be similar to ours.    He had expressed the wishfor closer links between himself and the Prime Minister on community matters, stressing that agreement between France,the Federal Republic and the United Kingdom was essential to thesuccessful functioning of the Community.    He had not been forth-coming when the Prime Minister had explained our political difficulties over the Common Fisheries Policy and a French movebefore their forthcoming elections seemed unlikely.    He had appeared to be genuinely disappointed at the prospect that    directelections to the European Assembly could not be held in 1978,although he was understanding of our position.    On South Africa,President Giscard had said the French favoured resisting firmlyinternational pressure to go beyond the arms embargo in force,but it was not clear whether the French would maintain this position in the United Nations if they found themselves isolated.Energy Council THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said the recent meeting of the Energy Council had been disappointing, notably inour failure to secure adequate preference for Community coal production.The Cabinet -Took note.-5-COMMUNITYAFFAIRSVisit of president Giscardd&apos;Estaing
PUBLICEXPENDITUREPr previous reference:CM(77) 32ndConclusions,Minute 34. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP(77) 114) covering a draft of volume 1 of thePublic Expenditure White Paper which he proposed to publish on12 January.    Volume 2 was circulated separately for clearance in correspondence.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the White Paperembodied the decisions which Cabinet had taken on 20 October.    Thedraft needed amendment to reflect a number of later decisions,including those on Regional Development Grant and on milk.    Italready included the additional  1 billion of public expenditure in1978-79 which the Cabinet had approved in October, together with additional expenditure on energy conservation.    The rate of increaseof public expenditure over the period as a whole was approximately2 per cent, as the Cabinet had agreed, but the figures for the lastyear were as uoual very provisional.    The White Paper made itclear that the Government would be able to revise the figures for allthe later years, in the light of changing circumstances, and that only those for 1978-79 were firm at this stage.The Cabinet considered the draft page by page,points were made:The following a. There were dangers in publishing any forecasts of gross domestic product so far forward.    The forecasts inparagraphs 56-59 including table 8, were unnecessarilyspecific.    They assumed a growth rate of 3j per cent per annum in gross domestic product (GDP) which was fairlyoptimistic but still left a very high rate of unemployment at the end of the period     It would be better to expose a wider range of variant cases in a memorandum to theSelect Committee on Expenditure of the House of Commonsthan to publish a single case in the White Paper.b. Whatever GDP rate was forecast, it would be a mistake to indicate too precisely the respective shares of public expenditure and of private consumption.    There were strong political arguments for looking for a recovery in personal consumption, following the real fall of recent years.    But itwas politically difficult to publish figures showing public expenditure, in particular consumption, rising more slowlythan private consumption.c. The agreed figures showed that defence expenditure would be growing faster than public expenditure as a wholein the period after 1978-79.    This was contrary to theGovernment commitments in its election manifesto to reducedefence expenditure as a proportion of GDP to something more
closely approaching that of our allies.    But it could be argued that defence was starting from a lower point thanthe other programmes,  50 million below that forecast in the previous year&apos;s White Paper for 1979-80.    In anycase these comparisons ignored the very large contingency reserve in later years, and when these were added to therest of the civil public expenditure programmes, theimbalance was largely corrected.    In presenting the figurescare should be taken to stress the way in which defence expenditure had grown much less quickly than, for example,expenditure on health over the period since 1972-73.d. The figures for housing expenditure in Table 16 werepotentially misleading, although a footnote pointed out thatthe apparent reduction in housing subsidies was the resultof the lower interest rate assumption used in the White Paper.However, the unusually tentative nature of the housingfigures could be explained by a more extended footnote.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would prefer the macro-economic forecasts contained inTable 8 and the accompanying paragraphs to be omitted from theWhite Paper.    A wider range of illustration could be used later ina memorandum for the Select Committee on Expenditure.    Furtherminor consequential amendments might be needed in other parts ofthe text.    When the White Paper was published, the defence figures should be explained in the manner suggested.    The Secretary of Statefor the Environment should agree with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the terms of an extended footnote on housing in Table 16.    Anyfurther minor drafting amendments should be agreed quickly in correspondence with the Chief Secretary.    The Chancellor of theExchequer should publish both parts of the White Paper as arrangedon 12 January.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theother Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.
BENEFITS OF 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theNORTH SEA OIL      Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for Energy(CP(77) 115) on the benefits of North Sea oil, to which was attached a discussion paper along the lines of that presented to the TradesUnion Congress (TUC) Labour Party Liaison Committee;  and also a minute by the Secretary of State for Energy to the Prime Minister of12 December 1977, to which was attached copies of the minutes ofthat meeting and the statement made by the TUC subsequently.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the discussionpaper which he and the Secretary of State for Energy had preparedwas very similar to that which the Liaison Committee had considered, but it embodied certain changes to take account of that meeting.    The paper&apos;s main aims were to quantify the benefits from north Sea oil, to set out what should be the country&apos;s objectives-indxewing on them, and to comment on the options available.    By 1985,North Sea oil could be expected to be contributing  7- 8 billion ayear towards our balance of payments and adding about  5 billion ayear to our gross national product.    It would also provide a neweource of revenue to the Government rising to a peak of about 3^ billion a yaar, or 7 per cent of total revenue in the mid-1980s.By the late 1980s oil production would probably begin tc decline,and by the end of the century the reserves would be largely exhausted.Though extremely useful, these benefits would not go very far inrelation to what we wanted to do.    Moreover, we had had the benefitof North Sea gas for a number of years and scarcely noticed theireffects.    The conclusion which the paper drew was that the benefits of Ncrth Sea oil must not be frittered, but used in ways which would produce permanent improvements, for example, by strengthening the industrial base.    We must not repeat the experience of the Dutchwho used their gas revenues - which in proportionate terms weresimilar to this country&apos;s benefits from North Soa oil - to make possible large increases in wages and transfer benefits.    As aresult, their imports increased, their exchange rate rose, and theirmanufacturing industry suffered severely so that they were facingserious difficulties in maintaining their standard of living now thatthe gas was becoming exhausted.    He wished to emphasise that allthe economic benefits of North Sea oil had already been taken intoaccount in the medium term economic forecasts which determined the volume of resources available for the programmes proposed inthe Public Expenditure White Paper.    He also wished to draw attention to the difficulties of quantifying the alternative uses towhich the oil benefits could be put, because the different measures would have different effects on the economy.    It was clear, however,that not all of the available options could be pursued simultaneously:the benefits were not sufficiently large for that.    He and theSecretary of State for Energy were agreed on many of the issuesunderlying the discussion paper, but not on the question of whether there should be a separate oil fund.    In his view it would be a cosmeticoperation, not least because it would not be possible to say that oilrevenues were being directed exclusively to a particular activity if-8
that activity would otherwise have been financed out of generalrevenues.    Previous experience of special funds - eg the Road fund and the Land Fund - were that they became an embarrassment.Above all the creation of an oil fund would play into the hands of theScottish Nationalists for whom it would become a major politicaltarget.    When this was discussed by the TUC Labour Party liason committee, a substantial majority was against a fund.    As regardsthe major options, the Liaison Committee were unanimously againstoverseas investment until higher domestic priorities had been satisfied.    As for debt repayments, we had liabilities of $22 billionwhich we had to pay off by 1985.    There was no question ofdenouncing these obligations, but he considered there wereadvantages in new borrowing to spread repayment of the debts moreevenly, perhaps up to 1990.    He and the Secretary of State for Energywere agreed on the importance of investing in new sources of energy.As for improvements in our industrial base, although there was animportant role for institutions like the National Enterprise Board(not), most of the investment would in our mixed economy have to beby the private sector.    Private companies would invest only if theyhad confidence that there would be a continuing high and stable levelof demand, and he believed that cuts in personal taxation had animportant part to play in achieving this.    He hoped however that atime wovld come when it would be sensible to increase public expenditure in line with gross domestic product.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that although thefinancial benefits of North Sea oil were relatively modest, the issues to be decided were not.    The TUC seemed quite clear on thedesirability of a two-part strategy:  firstly, that, when the oil ran outwe should have a continuing strong industry:  and secondly, becausere-equipment of industry could be expected to reduce the number *fjobs available, that there should be expansion of public servicesespecially in the development areas.    He saw the issues under-lying the benefits of North Sea oil as a basis for a new accordbetween the Government and the TUC in the run up to the next general Election.    Both the TUC and the Labour Party had a common interest in demonstrating that real benefits existed;  and for thisreason he was in favnur of an oil fund.    He was not unduly worriedabout the attitude of the Scottish Nationalists- for they would press for the benefits of what they considered to be their oil irrespective of whether such a fund is set up.    The aim should be to demonstrate that the benefits had been wisely invested.    The TUC certainlywanted a development fund of which the oil benefits could be oneelement.    This was important because we were at present losingthrough unemployment twice the value of oil revenues in the 1980s,Discussion of the benefits of North Sea oil thus raised the wholequestion of the instruments of industrial policy - for example the role of the not.     He would like to see a fairly strong policy leadin the published document - that it should be more White than Green.
In discussion, agreement was expressed with those sections of thediscussion paper dealing with the size and permanency of thebenefits; the main objectives; and what should be the overallstrategy within which the oil revenues would be spent.    It was argued that in general the benefits of North Sea oil should not beused to improve personal consumption either through tax reductionsor improvements in social benefits but should be concentrated on themeasures necessary to enable us to survive when the oil ran out.These measures included the development of new energy reserves,energy conservation, industrial regeneration and an improvement inour economic and social infrastructure.    To create a stabledemocratic society with growth and increasing standards of living itwas necessary to get back to full employment.    The necessary changes would not be secured by feeding the benefits of North Sea oilinto the economy as a whole.    There was a case if not for an oilfund then for a wider development fund of which the oil revenuesmight contribute part.    Such an arrangement was a politicalnecessity for Scotland.    Reductions in taxation and improvements in social benefits could then come from the general growth of the economy.    An approach of this sort could provide the basis for a document - White rather than Green - which demonstrated a consistent political approach and would give the Government theinitiative in the period until the General Election.   On the other hand,it was argued that, because a mixed economy required most invest-ment from the private sector, the best use of oil revenues would beto create an environment of economic stability which we had lackedfor many years.    In this respect, relief from the pressures of thebalance of payments would be a most important benefit.    It should,not be thought however that there were new solutions which requiredonly additional resources to implement.    The low level of investment of the not had not been because of the lack of funds.    TheGovernment was often not well placed to make specific decisions aboutindustrial investment and there was a danger that if the North Sea oilbenefits were largely hypothecated to such activities they would beused to support loss making industry.    We could then still end up with a low wage, low productivity and low growth economy.    It wouldbe better to use the North Sea revenues mainly to reduce direct taxation which could play an important part in stimulating demand and reducing unemployment;  and to give priority in increasing public expenditure to improvements in the social infrastructure.    Theclaims of Scotland and Northern Ireland to specific measures shouldnot be overlooked.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were grateful for the paper by the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Secretary of State for Energy which had provided the basis foran excellent discussion.    They were agreed that the presentation ofthe Government&apos;s proposals for the use of the benefits of North Seaoil would provide an opportunity which could mould the debate for thenext election.    It was therefore essential to get the political back-ground right.    The document should therefore be primarily a White,10CONFIDENTIAL
rather than a Green Paptr.    It should not over-estimate the benefits of North Sea oil, but nevertheless emphasise the real opportunity theypresented.    The public was not obsessed with the idea of taxreductions, but it would be important nevertheless not to give theimpression that the Government was opposed to selective taxreductions.    The document should start with a statement of thepolitical background and then state the Government&apos;s objectivessuch as the need to invest in new energy sources and energyconservation in preparation for the time when our present resources were used up and to achieve a basis for permanent growth in thestandard of living and for full employment.    There had been a difference of view on the desirability of hypothecating oil revenuesto a special fund and the Cabinet should consider this further on thebasis of alternative drafts.    He would oversee the preparation of adraft which the Secretary of the Cabinet would undertake.    It was ofcourse open to any member of the Cabinet to circulate his own ideas,but any suggestions for incorporation into the draft to be preparedunder his supervision should reach him with a copy to the Secretaryof the Cabinet before Christmas.    The aim would be to have afurther discussion in mid-January.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and instructed theSecretary of the Cabinet to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office15 December 197711
