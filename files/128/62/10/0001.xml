FOREIGNAFFAIRSGermanHijae?cUag1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the advice and practicalassistance we had been able to give the German Government in connectionwith the rescue of the hostages in the hijacked Lufthansa aircraft hadundoubtedly helped to strengthen Angle-German relations.    He hadreceived an urgent telephone request for advice from Herr Schmidt, theFederal German Chancellor, on 14 October,    He had assured him of ourmoral support for the firm stand which the German Government was considering taking.    He had also suggested that Herr Schmidt should send representatives to London to discuss the problem and how we might help.    Meetings had taken place at No. 10 later that day between Britishand German officials and experts.    In addition to certain diplomaticsupport we had made available expertise and equipment which theGermans did not possess.    We were involved in the operation inMogadishu to the extent that two British soldiers accompanied the Germanteam and took part with them in the assault.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that we would continue to support efforts to achieve an international convention onhijacking, but the attitude of the Algerians and Libyams made  heprospects unpromising.THE PRIME MINISTER said that events had moved so fast that there wasno opportunity to consult the Cabinet before providing assistance to theGerman Government.    He had however judged it right to assume their agreement.    This had been a valuable example of co-operation fromwhich we had gained experience which would be useful to us in the eventthat we had to face a similar problem.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the Prime ministers statement.Joint European       THE PRIME MINISTER said that discussion of the JET project during hisTorus (JET) visit to  Bonn   had taken place in a relaxed atmosphere.    It was clearthat the Federal Chancellor had two preoccupations.    The first arose from internal Party difficulties.    The transfer of discussions from the research Council to the Foreign Affairs Council had meant that the handling had been moved from an SPD to an FDP Minister.Herr Genscher had not wished to be the person to give way because of thepolitical consequences in Bavaria if Garching was not chosen as the site.It appeared however that he was now willing to accept a consensus decision in favour of Culham provided that the responsibility for the decisionreverted to an SPD Minister.    This proviso had been met by agreeing that the decision should be taken at a special meeting of the research council.    Chancellor Schmidt&apos;s second concern was to avoid anyimplication that a site in Germany was unacceptable on wider grounds.The Prime Minister said that President Giscard of France had told himt that in no circumstances would the French Government accept a decision\ in favour of Garching although he had given no reason for this.    TheFederal Government could not &apos;
accept any implied reflection on their status as a non-nuclear weaponspower.    It had therefore been agreed that both Governments should propose in the Research Council that if there was a follow-up to JET itwould be open to all Member States to propose a site in their ownterritories with the exception of the country where JET itself was to besited.    Chancellor Schmidt wanted it to be understood that this formularesulted from his refusal to accept discrimination against non-nuclearweapon states in the development of peaceful nuclear technology.    this understanding would be noted in the records of the German Cabinet andwe had been invited to do the same.In discussion it was pointed out that it was the SPD Minister who had originally gone back on the pledges he had given last March.    on present knowledge, the JET project had no strategic significance andthere did not seem to be any objection to the face-saving formula proposed.The Germans intended to be represented only at official level at the research Council on 25 October and it was for consideration whether weshould be represented at Ministerial or official level.    The Secretary ofState for Energy would have an early opportunity to discuss this question with Commissioner Brunner.    It would be important to ensure that thepromises of support for Culham were maintained and in particular to assure the Irish Government that there had been no deal with the Germanson the calculation of budgetary contributions.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the proposed formula relating to the siting of any possible successor project to JET.    The Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Secretary of State for Energy should decide on the most appropriate way for the United Kingdom to be represented at the forth-coming Research Council at which it was hoped to secure a decision infavour of Culham.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Prime Ministers   THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at theletter to the recent informal meeting of Foreign Ministers of the EuropeanGeneral Secretary Communities, the Prime Minister&quot;s letter to the General Secretary ofof the Labour the Labour Party about Europe had been discussed.    The Press briefingParty which had been given by the Germans did not reflect the actualdiscussion and this had been publicly confirmed by the Danish ForeignMinister.    While it was felt that we were not the most enthusiasticmembers of the Community, most Ministers and the President of theCommission had shown understanding of our position.    The onlysignificant criticism had related to what had been said about the effects of enlargement, which had been interpreted as a wish to weaken the\2
Community.    There had been, a wide measure of agreement, if fordiffering reasons, that the Common Agricultural Policy should be changed.    No doubt Herr Genscher, who was a Federalist, would continue to try to secure tactical advantage from our position but themisleading Press briefing by the Germans had probably done ourcause more good than harm and might have been helpful over the JETdiscussions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was to be expected that we wouldbe subject to criticism from some quarters within the Communityfor the line the Government was taking as set out in his letter to theGeneral Secretary.    He had discussed with Chancellor Schmidtwhether it would be helpful for him to refer to this subject in his address to a meeting of SPD members during the course of his visit to Bonn.    The Chancellor had advised that this was not necessarysince the only people who were worried were the professionalEuropeans and the Brussels Press.    In consultation with theLord President and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary he wasin touch with Mr Hayward about the appropriate arrangements forfollowing up the action proposed in his letter.The Cabinet -3.       Took note.3
2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(77) 93) to which was attached a revised version of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of the new Session.The Cabinet first discussed the matters which they had remittedfor further consideration on 11 October.North Sea Oil.    It Was agreed that paragraph 6 on Fage 2 of thedraft Speech should read:   &quot;My Government will ensure that thebenefits of North Sea oil are used to achieve a lasting improvementin our industrial performance and therefore to provide more jobs,higher real incomes and improved public services&quot;.Electricity Dill.   It was agreed that this Bill should be included inthe legislative programme and combined with the Bill on Drax Band the Atomic Energy Bill.    Paragraph 1 on page 4 of the draft speech should be amended to read:  &quot;Legislation will be introducedproviding for changes in the structure of the electricity industryand other matters affecting the industry&quot;.Employment Bill.  It would be possible to continue the TemporaryEmployment Subsidy and most of the other existing manpowermeasures without fresh legislation, but doubt was expressedwhether the Small Firms Employment Subsidy could be continuedbeyond March 1978 without a Bill, and it would in any event bedesirable to obtain next Session, if possible, permanent and more flexible powers to take manpower measures.    It was agreed thatthe very short Bill required for this purpose should accordingly beprepared and an opportunity sought to fit it in during the coming session.    Paragraph 5 on page 2 of the draft Speech should be altered to read:    &quot;My Government will continue to take action toreduce high unemployment through manpower measures and topromote industrial training&quot;.BILLS TO BE INTRODUCED AS SOON AS parliamentary time CAN BE found the LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said mat he understood the reason why a catalogue of such Bills might not seem advisable,but he still thought it important that the Speech itself shouldmention the Merchant Shipping and Post Office Bills, in view ofwhat had been said to the unions concerned and the public commit-ments which had been made.    He had proposed a form of words inparagraph 8 on page 4 of the draft Speech.    This paragraph wasagreed.    Although the paragraph was in terms which gave no commitment to introduce the Bills concerned in the coming Session,it was urged in discussion that the Merchant Shipping Bill shouldbe introduced in the House of Lords early in the Session.4THE LEGISLATIVEPROGRAMME1977-78 AND the queen&apos;S speech on THE OPENINGOF THE NEWSESSIONPreviousReference:CM(77) 30thConclusions,Minutes 1 and 2\
In further discussion the following points were made en thelegislative programme.     The Opposition had now confirmed their agreement to Second Reading Committee procedure for theMedical Bill, and it would help the Governments relationships with the doctors if the Speech could promise the introduction of this bill.    The Opposition were being approached about Second reading committee procedure for the Northern Ireland Judicature Bill, andif they agreed, this Bill might similarly be mentioned in the Speech.Tie Opposition were being asked to agree to this procedure foreight Bills in all, and three of the Essential Bills also seemedsuitable for introduction in the House of Lords;  there should accordingly be an appreciable amount of legislative business forthe Lords in the early part of the Session.    The Education bill was supported by the Liberals, it would be popular and was high onthe list of Bills to be introduced as soon as parliamentary timecould be found;  it might accordingly be mentioned in the paragraphrelating to the Merchant Shipping and Post Office Bills.    On theother hand the sense of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 11 October hadbeen against the inclusion in the Speech of a shopping list of bills for which parliamentary time would clearly not be available.    Itwas also suggested that although the policy for this Bill had beenapproved by the Home and Social Affairs Committee its provisions on parental choice might be seen as undermining the comprehensiveprinciple and ought therefore to be considered by the Cabinet before any decision was taken to introduce legislation.    The occupational pension Schemes Bill was not in the programme because it wouldnot secure sufficient support in the present Parliament, but a reference to the Governments continued commitment to theseproposals might be made in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech in the debate on the Address.The Cabinet then discussed the views on the contents of the Speechrecently expressed by the Liberal Party.    THE LORD PRESIDENTOF THE COUNCIL said that in September he had indicated toMr David Steel the likely contents of the legislative programme,with three major measures strongly supported by the Liberals, anumber of Essential Bills and parliamentary time available for only three other Bills, including the Bill on help for first-timehome buyers.    Mr Steel understood the situation, but it was not sowell u. lerstood by all the other Liberal Members of Parliament.The Consultative Committee had met on 18 October and, although he had explained the problems of parliamentary time, the Liberalmembers of the Committee had nevertheless indicated a number offurther items they would like included in the Speech.    One waslegislation to establish a Land Bank, but a paper which mr Geraint Howells had been requested to prepare setting out theLiberals1 proposals had only been given to the Departmentsconcerned on 18 October, and he had therefore written to the liberals to explain that there was unlikely to be time to reach conclusions on this matter before the Speech was delivered.    The
Liberals also favoured the Consumer Protection Bill, the proposals in theEducation Bill on school governing bodies and parental choice,and a Bill to give effect to recommendations by the Speaker1 conference on mutiple registration.    They were in favour of aCo-operative Development Agency, which the Prime minister would be mentioning in a speech on 22 October, and of a Christmasbonus.    He had promised, without making any commitment, totake account of these views, and had emphasised the pressures on parliamentary time.    The Bill on multiple registration would be short, and the possibility of fitting it in might be looked at.    the liberals had also said that they would oppose the Bill to give PostOffice workers the right to take normal industrial action.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion,   said that theCabinet agreed to the inclusion in the legislative programme of theElectricity Bill, combined with the Drax B and Atomic Energy Bills,and had agreed the wording of passages in The Queen&apos;s opening speech on this Bill, on North Sea oil, on manpower measures andon the Merchant Shipping and Post Office Bills.    The Medical andNorthern Ireland Judicature Bills could be promised in the Speechprovided the Opposition had given a firm undertaking that they agreed to Second Reading Committee procedure for these Bills.It would not be appropriate for the Speech to include a long list of bills which the Government would wish to introduce as soon as theparliamentary situation allowed, but the Governments position on these other Bills could be explained, in his own speech in the debate on the Address, and in speeches by the ministers responsible for them.    The questions whether, and when, it wouldbe possible to introduce any of these Bills, and in particular theMerchant Shipping Bill, would be for the Legislation Committee toconsider.    The Lord President of the Council would explain to the liberals that he had reported their views fully to the Cabinet,which had also taken full account of the views which the Liberalshad previously expressed on the legislative programme and the queen&apos;s Speech.    The Liberals had in fact done very well, with aconsiderable number of items in the programme and the speech which they supported.    No further Bills could be added to theprogramme without also taking out Bills now included in it, and itwould not be appropriate to make any such changes in the legislativepriorities which the Cabinet had decided on 11 October.    The Queenhad asked that not all the opening paragraphs of the Speech should begin with the words &quot;My Government&quot;, and the reference to &quot;the strengthening of our financial position&quot; in paragraph 4 on page 2 wasambiguous and needed reconsideration.    Subject to these points and any othe r points of drafting, the Cabinet had approved the text of the Opening Speech.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.6
PUBLIC 3. The Cabinet considered public expenditure 1978-79 -EXPENDITURE 1981-82.    Their discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.previous reference:CM(77) 24thConclusions,Minute 6 and cm(77) 31stConclusionsCabinet Office20 October 19777
F ^viousReference:CM(77) 24thConclusions,Minute 6 and cm(77) 31stConclusionsTHE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday, 20 October 1977 at 9. 30 am the Cabinet had before them two papers by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, on public expenditure in the medium term and on theproblem of shortfall in public expenditure (CP(77) 89 and 90) anda paper by the Secretary of State for the Environment on theconstruction industry (CP(77) 92).THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the cabinet ought now to reach firm decisions on public expenditure in 1978-79and more provisional decisions on the later years.    They hadprovisionally decided the previous week that an additional 850 million at 1977 Survey prices, equal to  1, 000 million at1978-79 outturn prices, should be added to the figures in the public expenditure survey for 1978-79.    The figures for later years were more provisional, but his paper set out the consequences of the additions which he proposed in 1978-79.    The result was that,whereas in July the Cabinet had provisionally agreed that expendi-ture should increase by 2 per cent a year in 1979-80 and later years,there would now be an increase of about 2 per cent a year startingin 1978-79.    The detailed breakdown of his figures was set out in annex A to his paper CP(77) 89.    The additional  850 millionincluded the consequences in 1978-79 of decisions on youthemployment and child benefit which had been taken in the summer,and the balance represented a package of  300 million for theconstruction industry and a series of relatively small increases,covering part but not all of the departmental bids for additional expenditure, offset by a number of savings.In general discussion it was suggested that the slow recovery in world economic activity, and the particularly poor performancehitherto of the United Kingdom economy, would justify a more rapidrate of expansion in public expenditure than the Chief Secretary&apos;sproposals.    On the other hand, on present international forecaststhe United Kingdom economy would be growing faster than that ofany other developed country in 1978.    Market confidence was stillfragile, and while it might accept an additional  1 billion public expenditure in 1978-79, on top of the tax reductions which theChancellor also proposed, its response to an even larger increase was unpredictable and could be severe.    The estimate that aCOPY NOCABINET
 2 billion stimulus in 1978-79 was needed was based on the assump-tion that pay increases would be kept within the Government1 s10 per cent guidelines.    This now looked less likely, and the room for further manoeuvre was correspondingly reduced.    There was a real danger that the expansion of the economy could be held back bysupply and labour constraints.    There was however no need to rule out the possibility of further expansionary measures later in the yea:if circumstances were propitious.The Cabinet then discussed the individual spending programmes setout in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper.    In discussion the following main points were made:-a. Defence.      The Chief Secretary&apos;s proposals would permit a 3 per cent annual rate of increase, in line withthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) target in1979-80 and 1980-81.    This was contrary to theGovernments political commitment to reduce its defence expenditure as a proportion of gross national product(GNP) and to bring it in line with that of its allies.However, these differences did not arise in 1978-79, when there would be no increase in the defence budget exceptfor any part of the new construction programme which wasallocated to the Ministry of Defence.    There was need fora more general discussion of the defence budget in later years so that agreed figures could be incorporated in thePublic Expenditure White Paper at the end of the year.This discussion should take place first initially in the ministerial Committee on Defence and Oversea Policyand thereafter in Cabinet.b. Foreign and Commonwealth Office.    The figuresproposed by the Chief Secretary allowed for commitments in Cyprus and Belize, together with offsetting savings,but made no provision for further cuts in expenditure whichmight arise from the review of Overseas Representationrecently completed by the Central Policy Review Staff.c. Overseas Development.    It was argued that there wasa strong case for the restoration of the cuts made in the aid programme in 1976.    The level of our overseas aid wascentral to our relationship with the Third World;  the1976 cuts had caused anguish to Government supporters; andmore rapid development of Third World countries would greatly help United Kingdom export trade.    A further 69 million in 1978-79 would restore the cuts previouslymade, and an additional  50 million a year thereafter would raise the United Kingdom official aid programme to0. 6 per cent of GNP a year by 1980-81, compared with theUnited Nations target of 0. 7 per cent.    A significant partof the aid programme was in fact earmarked for projectsoutside the agreed aid strategy.    On the other hand, it was
argued that while there was a strong case for an increasein our aid programme when we could afford it, it was difficult to justify complete restoration of the cuts in the aid programme when other programmes remained at a lower level.d. European Economic Community Contributions,including agriculture Support.     These figures were onlyforecasts, and were not within the control of the UnitedKingdom.    They made adequate provision for the expectedchange in the method of calculating the European Unit of account.e. Agriculture.    The figures in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper were the best estimate that could be reached ofnon-e.c. agricultural support, and included provisionfor cancellation of the slow down in payment of capital grants.f. Industry.g. Trade.    The figures under these headings had beenagreed with the Ministers concerned.h. Employment.   There were difficulties in applying afurther cut of  6 million to the Manpower services commission budget, because they had already promisedsavings of  30 million to offset the additional costs ol theHolland Committee Youth Employment measures.    However,the Manpower Services Commission had underspentconsiderably in the current year, and it was doubtful whetherthey could in fact spend the whole of their public expenditure survey provision.i. Prices and Consumer Protection.    The figuresunder this heading had been agreed between the ministers concerned.j*     Energy.    It was pointed out that decisions yet to betaken on the next generation of thermal nuclear reactorsand on the Joint European Torus might add substantially to the agreed totals for these programmes.    Expenditureon energy conservation was to be considered as a separateitem.k*    Transport.    A slight adjustment in the figures hadbeen agreed between the Ministers concerned since thepreparation of the Chief Secretary1 s paper.3
1.    Housing.    It was argued that the houaing programme had carried the major burden of the 1976 cuts in public expenditure, and it was intolerable that there should nowbe a further reduction which would reduce the Governmentshousing programme below the level of that inherited fromthe previous Administration in 1974.    On the other hand, thefigures in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper took account of savings which largely resulted from the fall in interest rates,and in the shift in mortgage lending from local authorities to building societies.    The proposals on corstruction wouldprovide a considerable boost to the housing programme,although some of it would go to improvements and not to new construction.m.   Other Environmental Services and development commission.    These figures reflected some small agreedsavings consistent with the plans of the Regional water authorities, together with a small addition for theDevelopment Commission.n.    Home Qffi.ce.    It was suggested that the Governmentshould make financial provision for a fourth televisionchannel, to which it was now publicly committed.    On theother hand, it was argued that this must remain as a potential claim on the Contingency Reserve until the cabinet had considered the report of the Annan Committee on broadcasting later in the year,o.    Lord chancellor s Department.    These figures were agreed between the Ministers concerned.p.    Education.    The figures in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper represented a revised estimate of the cost of keepingpace with demographic change in the school population, and did not represent any increase in services.    There was however a strong case for additional expenditure of 3 million on extra teachers for deprived areas, of 2 million on the science programme for developments which would assist the industrial strategy, of  2 million for the National Heritage, to allow the purchase of arttreasures which would come on the market in the next year,and of  3 million to improve the maintenance allowances for students in non-advanced further education, thus helping to avoid a bottleneck in the provision of skilled employeeswhen the economy began to expand,q.    Health and Personal Social Services.    The figures inthe Chief Secretary&apos;s paper assumed imposition in 1978-79of a further  10 million on dental charges, as part of the economies agreed in 1976;  this was now politicallyinappropriate.    The relatively steep rise in provision in
later years represented a change in the population at risk,and not an improvement in the standard of services provided.    There was a strong case now for restoringsome of the cuts in health service current expenditure,thus helping to avert some of the worst hospital closures,and allowing new buildings to be fully exploited.    A further 30 million was suggested for this purpose.    Any moneymade available to the health programme under theconstruction proposals would have to be devoted largely tomaintenance and minor works because there were no currentfunds available to staff any new buildings.r.    Social Security.    The highest priority here was for additional support for the long term unemployed, whichwould cost a further  22 million a year, together with 10 million for improvements in the mobility allowance.s.    Other Public Services.t.     Superannuation.   The figures under these headingshad been agreed at departmental level.u.    Scotland.v*    Wales.    The figures under these headings wouldrequire amendment in the light of decisions on other programmes.w.    Northern Ireland.    The figures put forward by theChief Secretary were agreed with the Secretary of Statebut there were large impending claims on the contingency reserve for further industrial support in Northern Ireland.x.    Urban Programme.    The figures in the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper represented an agreed addition to public expenditure which would have to be allocated to individual deparmental programmes.    There was however a case for the additionof a further  5 million in 1978-79.y.    Employment Protection Act.     The figures here werehighly uncertain but represented the best available estimateof the additional cost to local authorities in implementing the Employment Protection Act.z.    Fnergy Conservation.    These figures were the first instalment of a series of proposals which the Secretary ofState for Energy would be bringing before Ministers shortly.These further proposals would involve a claim on the contingency Reserve.    They should be considered as aneconomic investment on which an early return could beexpected.
aa.       Nationalised Industries.    The figures under this heading represented the net financing requirements of the nationalised industries, after taking account of their capital programmes and their revenue surpluses and deficits.Although provision had been made for an additional 60 million to help finance the British Steel corporation in 1978-79, it was now apparent that this was a considerableunder-estimate, and on some forecasts the figure could be as high as  500- 600.million.   It would be prudent to earmark alarger provision, of at least  130 million  for this purpose..bb.       Construction Industry.    The Chief Secretary&apos;sproposals allocated a further  300 million for constructionto be spread, between different departmental programmes.This formed the largest single element in the total 1 billion additional public expenditure which he had proposed,and it was argued that the industry might not be able to spend more in 1978-79.    It was also argued that the netaddition to the Public Sector Borrowing Requirementwould be much less than the gross public expenditure cost,because of the saving on supplementary benefits to men whowould be brought back into employment.    The additional expenditure could not be confined to 1978-79, because mostof the construction projects spanned more than one financialyear.    The import content of ennstruction programmeswas relatively small, and the true cost to the economy was negligible because the resources involved would otherwise be unemployed.cc.       There was however a serious danger that additionalmoney for the construction industry would lead to higherwage settlements in the building trades, and it would be important to ensure that contracts were allocated only to firms which undertook to observe the Governments payguidelines.In further general discussion it was argued that additional public expenditure needed to be looked at together with the Chancellor&apos;stax proposals as a total package.    The implications of the totalpackage for employment should be used in discussion with the TradeUnion Congress (TUC) to seek their continuing support for theGovernment1 s pay policy.    But the employment consequences of the package would take some time to work through, and would probablyproduce less than 200, 000 new jobs by the first quarter of 1979.There were Signs that employment was already picking up, althoughthe figures were difficult to interpret.    The additional bids now putforward by Ministers, together with those already accepted by theChief Secretary, amounted in total to about  1, 300 million at 1977Survey prices, rather than the  850 million at Surrey pricesprovisionally agreed by the Cabinet, and some selection was inevitable.A possible compromise would involve allocating a further  150 million to the most sensitive programmes.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now completed its consideration of public expenditure in1978-79.    He was grateful to his colleagues for the constructive andco-operative manner in which they had approached the problems.The main elements of their decisions would by incorporated in theChancellor&apos;s statement on the economic situation, which he nowproposed to make in the House of Commons on the afternoon ofWednesday 26 October.    The statement would be repeated in theHouse of Lords immediately afterwards.    Cabinet would meet again on Monday afternoon 24 October to consider the taxation elements ofthe chancellor s proposals, following which, the Chancellor would discuss the text of his statement with him.    The statement wouldmention in broad terms the main additions to public expenditure in1978-79 on which the Cabinet had just agreed.    They had approved,subject to any minor amendments agreed between the Chief Secretary,Treasury and the Ministers concerned, the additional expenditure in1978-79 set out in Annex A to CP(77) 89 amounting in total to 850 million at 1977 Survey prices.    In addition, they agreed that afurther  100 million should be allocated to the construction industry;a further  20 million to the aid programme;  a further  10 million to education;  and a further  20 million to health and social security.This brought the total additional expenditure approved by the Cabinetto  1,000 million at 1977 Survey prices.    These decisions should bekept absolutely secret.    They should not be communicated even toother Ministers, departmental officials or other close collaboratorsuntil after the Cabinet meeting on Monday.    Therafter the utmostdiscretion should be exercised by all concerned until the announcement on Wednesday.    The Ministers concerned should inform theChancellor of the Exchequer on Monday morning of the way in whichthey proposed that particular increases in 1978-79 should be described in his statement.    As to later years the figures for which would bemore provisional, the Chief Secretary, should discuss separately withthe Ministers concerned the implications of the additional expenditureagreed in respect of the construction industry, the aid programme,education, and health and social security.    He should report theresults of these discussions to the Cabinet for consideration at alater meeting.    The Prime Minister would arrange for the level ofdefence expenditure in 1979-80 and later years to be considered firstin the Ministerial Committee on Defence and Oversea Policy and then in Cabinet.    The figures for other programmes in later years setout in Annex A to CP(77) 89 were approved.    The Cabinet would need to consider well before Christmas the figures to be included in theannual public expenditure White Paper, for publication in January.The Cabinet would need to consider carefully the scope for anyfurther additional expenditure, in the context of a fresh stimulus tothe economy, in the light of further developments over the next6 months or so.    But for the time being, it was important that the newly agreed totals should be strictly adhered to.7
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office21 October 19778
