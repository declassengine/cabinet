ECONOMIC I. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached arePOLICY recorded separately.The Next StepsPr previous reference:CM(77) 31stConclusionsPAY POLICY 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(77) 96) taking stock of the present general stage reached in the development of pay policy and proposing linesof action for the next few weeks.    They also had before them amemorandum by the Secretary of State for Employment (CP(77) 98)about the problem of the lowest paid people in employment.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Governmentcould be moderately satisfied with the progress of the pay policy sofar, but there were many problems ahead.    Although more than90 per cent of those covered by settlements since July had receivedincreases within the pay guideline, many settlements had been delayed.    The Ford settlement, although it had been well received,was above the guidelines, and established a pattern which would bedifficult to break.    The next key cases were in the public sector.Ten per cent now looked like being the norm for settlements, andwas in danger of becoming a floor.    The flexibility which was anessential feature of the Governments policy was operating in onedirection only.    On present form and if there were no furtherslippage the outturn for the year looked like being a 12-14 per cent increase in earnings.    This posed a threat to the promise of singlefigure inflation by the end of 1979, which would be politicallydamaging.    There was pressure for the maximum possible benefit for the lowest paid, and indeed the local authority offer to theirmanual workers was right up to the 10 per cent ceiling.    But at thesame time, there was pressure from many unions for increaseddifferentials for the higher paid.    There were claims for special treatment by the police, the fire services, the armed forces andothers, mainly in the public sector.    There were widespread fearsthat the policy would discriminate against the public sector, althoughthe financial constraints now operating in the private sector hadhelped to keep pay settlements there to a reasonable level.    As the inflation rate began to fall visibly, and the effects of the neweconomic measures worked through, the situation should become alittle easier.    The Government should therefore take the opportunityto tighten its interpretation of the pay policy without restating the1
guidelines themselves.    Meanwhile, the government must keep thewhole range of available sanctions intact, although it should be careful not to threaten their use unless the threat could be implemented.    It was important to get legal advice on each individual case.    The fear of sanctions had certainly helped to contain the repercussions of, for example, the Mackie settlement.The time had probably come for a fresh round of talks with TradesUnion Congress (TUC) and possibly with the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI), but this should be approached cautiously, and theGovernment should await their reaction to the economic packagebefore making a move.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that hewas less optimistic than the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    the longer the round continued the more settlements there would be over 10 per cent.    Productivity schemes which were not genuinelyself-financing would also pushup earnings.    The Governmentneeded the support of the TUC in helping to identify those cases which needed special treatment and it was essential to resume adialogue with them.    The problem of the lowest paid particularly those covered by Wages Councils needed special attention.    wages councils were not prepared in all cases to accept the Governmentsadvice that the increase in such cases should be restricted to10 per cent on earnings.    Since their recommendations werelegally binding there was nothing the Government could do to redress the situation.    Breaches of this kind would have immediaterepercussions, for example upon local authority manual workers.It would be better to redefine pay guidelines to legitimise theposition.In discussion it was pointed out that there was normally no chanceof offsetting especially generous treatment for the lowest paidwithin the settlement for a total negotiating group.    This was particularly true in the case of local authority manual workers,because different grades were represented by different unions, eachof which would protect the interests of its own members.Moreover very few of the lowest paid were heads of families infull time employment.    It would be a mistake to offer any formalamendment of the pay guidelines to the TUC, who would have nothing to offer in exchange at this stage.    It would be easier to toleratethe occasional exception than to reformulate general principles.In further discussion, it was argued that the most critical case inthe next few weeks was that of the miners.    It was important thatthe miners should accept the proposed productivity deal, so thatthe National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) might then go slow withits claim for  135 a week from 1 November.    There were signs thatthe ballot about the productivity deal was going to be very close.2
In some areas, the local leadership was deliberately holdingdetailed information about the National Coal Board (NCB) offerfrom their members, and the NUM nationally were placingadvertisements in national newspapers to redress the balance.There was a case for a strong Ministerial statement at this stage,designed to influence the outcome of the ballot.    On the other hand,similar interventions in the past by the NCB had been counter-productive, and it was not certain that a Ministerial speech would achieve the right response.    It was desirable in any case to takeinformal soundings with the NUM leadership before deciding whether to make any public intervention.    But if the response was favourable,strong speeches by Ministers, putting the productivity scheme inthe context of pay policy and of total energy policy, might help toensure the successful outcome of the ballot.In was further pointed oat that there had been continuing contacts with the TUC during the last few months.    There were problems in negotiating with the six TUC representatives on the national economic Development Council (NEDC) who had different interests to safeguard and in any case did not represent all the unionsinvolved in the most critical forthcoming pay cases (eg. the NUM).One possibility would be to make a formal approach to the TUCimmediately after the economic package.    However, there was a real danger that any new approach to the TUC would automaticallylead to the establishment of a new pay norm.    This would destroy the credibility of the whole policy, and let down those unions whohad settled early in the pay round at or below that level.    The betterapproach might be informal discussions with Mr Len Murray,leading perhaps to a series of contacts with the TUC on a range of separate issues, of which pay policy, including the special problemsof the low paid, might be one.THE PRIME MINISTER summing up the discussion said that theGovernment had achieved some reasonable successes although itwas important to remember that even if the increase in average earnings during the round was held to 10 per cent, which now seemed unlikely, our rate of wage inflation would still be substantially higherthan in some competing countries.    It was essential therefore thatall Ministers should continuously emphasise in public speeches and private discussion the importance of keeping within the pay guidelinesand that they should instruct their officials to use all the influencethey had to that end.    He would speak personally toMr Lawrence Daly of the NUM about the desirability of a ministerial intervention in support of the proposed productivity dealfor miners before the miners&apos; ballot later in the week and wouldthen be in touch with the Secretary of State for Energy who would nodoubt take his own soundings on the matter.    The Cabinet shouldresume its discussion of the problems of the lowest paid at a later3SECRET
meeting for which the Chancellor of the Exchequer would submit a further paper setting out his own views:  the crucial question would however be whether a concession for the lowest paid would help in securing an overall increase not exceeding 10 per cent.After his new package of economic measures had been announced the Chancellor of the Exchequer should discuss informally withMr Len Murray whether and if 30 how best a dialogue on pay withthe TUC could be resumed and should report the results of this discussion to the Cabinet.    Subject to these points the cabinet endorsed generally the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper cp(77) 96.The Cabinet. -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.4
THE HOME SECRETARY said that he would be meeting the PoliceFederations for England and Wales, Scotland and Northern ireland on Thursday 27 October.    The negotiating machinery had broken down, and there was no hope of persuading the police to rejoin thePolice Council.    In the course of a publicity campaign designed to influence public opinion, the police had gravely misrepresented thefacts of their case.    But there was a serious manpower problem,accen&quot;&quot;uated by high wastage rates, and strengths were decliningespecially in urban areas, to the point where the Chief Constableswere now seriously worried.    At the same time, crime rates wereincreasing, and the workload, especially of the metropolitan forces,was increasing.    The Police Federation represented the whole country, and would not easily be persuaded to accept anything buta national settlement.    The Government could not put forward any solution which would involve a breach of pay policy, but an offerconfined to negotiating machinery, without cash on the table, wouldprecipitate early industrial action.    In some areas this might takethe form of a withdrawal of labour, or a reduction in overtimeworking.    The effects would vary, but in some cases it might takethe form of a full police strike, which has not happened since 1919.There were a number of issues on which talks could be started.The Police Federation had submitted a long memorandum on theirown case, which did not however provide a satisfactory basis fordiscussion.    The Edmund-Davies enquiry into negotiating machinery was not expected to report until the New Year.    There was a case for re-examining the structure of the Police Federation itself, andin the background was the issue of the police right to strike.    In his view, the best course now was to make a flat rate offer of 10 per centeffective from 1 September for all ramcs, together with an offer of along term enquiry which would subsume the Edmund-Davies enquiry,the role of the Federations, and other related issues.    TheGovernment, the official side and the Federation could all give evidence.    Such an enquiry might take six months or so to report,and the Government would not necessarily be committed to implement its findings.    Judge Edmund-DaTdes himself would be a chairman who would be acceptable to all parties, but the member-ship of his Committee would need strengthening to cope with the wider terms of reference.In discussion, it was argued that the Cabinet must accept theHome Secretary&apos;s diagnosis of this situation.    The issue beforethem was whether they were ready tc face a police strike, howeverragged that might be in places.    Whatever the outcome, theGovernment weald be blamed for the immediate consequences of astrike, for example the breakdown of law and order in a particulartown.    More seriously, a strike would alter the whole quality of thepolice force, and its relations with the public.    An offer on thelines the Home Secretary had suggested would probably be accepted5
by the public as evidence that the Government was going to the limits of its own pay policy to help the police-    The police had already tosome extent spoiled their own case by over-stating it.    Despite the undoubted and legitimate public concern about the growth of crime,public opinion would probably support the Government in offeringthe maximum possible under pay policy plus an external enquiry,even if it led to sporadic outbreaks of industrial action by the police in some areas.    The form and nature of the proposed 10 per cent increase in wages should be considered urgently among officials;it would be important to define precisely such points as whether itcovered rent allowances.    The terms of reference of the proposedenquiry should be worked out urgently between the ministers concerned.    It should certainly be able to cover the question of regional differentials and tne whole question of the changing job ofthe Police Force.    It would be important to carry the localauthorities with the Government in proposing an enquiry, and theMinisters concerned should meet them the day before the meeting.If the proposal was to have any chance of acceptance by the PoliceFederation the terms of reference could not include a reference topay policy and the Government would have to commit themselves inprinciple to accept the recommendation.    The timing ofimplementation should however be kept open and there should be no mention of an interim report about a pay increase additional to10 per cent in the current round.    It would be important to isolatethe police case, sc far as possible, from all other claims to betreated as &quot;special cases1, even those like the Armed Forces or the fire Services which had some points in common with the police.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that at the meeting with the Police federation on 27 October Ministers should offer an immediate 10 per cent increase in wages, effective from 1 September and a longer termenquiry.    They should make it clear in a tactful way that theGovernment were not prepared to go beyond this.    The HomeSecretary should arrange for the precise terms of the offer of a10 per cent increase to be agreed urgently between Departments.He should also prepare urgently in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Secretaries of State for the Environment,Scotland, Northern Ireland and Employment terms of reference for the enquiry and should submit them to the Prime Minister.    Theenquiry would need to be wide-ranging, taking full account of the changing nature of the police job in different parts of the country,especially since the Royal Commission of I960, but it should bedeliberately presented as an aspect of Government policy on lawand order, and not as a special case justifying an exception to theGovernments pay policy.    All Ministers concerned would need to seek arguments to distinguish the police from other claimants for treatment as special cases.    Although the Government would be
morally if not formally committed to accepting the findings of theenquiry, it should reserve its freedom of action on the phasing ofimplementation of any new pay system.    The enquiry should not be encouraged to bring forward an early interim report, and thereshould be no promise to the police of a second pay increase within12 months of 1 September.    The membership of the enquiry should probably include Lord Justice Edmund-Davies and the existing members of his Committee, with some new members.    The HomeSecretary, together with the Secretary of State for Scotland, should see the local authority employers on Wednesday 26 October to seektheir support for this proposal, but there could be no question of thelocal authorities having a veto on the establishment of the inquiry.The Cabinet -2.

THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINET. JO NO MICPOLICYThe Next StepsPreviousReference:CM(77) 31stConclusionsLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 1Monday 24 October 1977 at 3.00 pmTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet had agreed at its previous discussion of the economic situation toincrease public expenditure in 1978-79 by about  1 billion at 1977Survey prices, and to accept the indexation provision of the 1977Finance Act for 1978-79 at a cost of approximately  1, 200 billion.They had left unresolved the question of further action in 1977-78.The problem was to create as much additional demand as possiblein the short term, with the minimum carry-through to 1978-79.This pointed towards action on direct taxes.    No-one, including theTrades Union Congress (TUC) with whom he had discussed the matter the previous week, now favoured reductions in indirect taxes.    Therewas a case for holding back some part of the indexation of allowances,in order to give the Government something to offer in April 1978 to offset the increase in national insurance contributions and thewithdrawal of child tax allowances.    But his own preference nowwas to introduce the whole of the indexation change of 12 per centimmediately, backdated to April 1977, making it clear this was in anticipation of the April 1978 increase which would not then be repeated.    In addition, the Cabinet had already noted his intentionto exempt the next increase in national insurance benefits inNovember from tax in 1977-78, at a cost of  40 million.    This was essential to leave administrative room for the necessary re-codingof tax allowances.    This required a big additional effort fromInland Revenue staff and he proposed to tell the Inland Revenue StaffFederation, when he saw them shortly, that the Cabinet appreciated the efforts which had been made to help with this year&apos;s tax changes.He now recommended a  10 bonus for old age pensioners - a proposal which the Cabinet had been inclined to favour.    This left 45-  60 million in the Contingency Reserve for 1977-78, and he therefore proposed to defer a decision on acceleration of regional development Grant payments until it was certain that identifiablecountervailing savings could be found.    If they could, a concession1
on this point would be a useful make-weight economic measureearly in the New Year.    He did not intend to announce any specificfurther changes in income tax in 1978-79, but to hold out the promisein general terms that if circumstances permitted, there might befurther changes in the next Budget possibly including a start on theintroduction of a reduced rate band.    Finally, the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster, in consultation with the Chief Secretary,Treasury and the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State,Department of Industry, had devised a package of measures designedto help small firms, involving some minor tax changes, which would cost a further  10 million in 1977-78 and  75 million in a full year.The effect of this total package which amounted to  1090 million in1977-78 and  2275 million in 1978-79 would be to increase gross domestic product (GDP) by about j per cent in the first quarter of1978 and 1 per cent by the first quarter of 1979, to add 40, 000 to employment in the first quarter of 1978 and 160, 000 by the first quarter of 1979;  to reduce unemployment by 15, 000 at the beginningof 1978 and by 100, 000 by the beginning of 1979, and to add about 1 billion to the public sector bcrrowing requirement in the current year and  1.7 billion in the following year, still within the agreedtargets.    He would announce overall increases in the planningtotals of public expenditure for 1978-79, on the lines agreed by theCabinet at their dJscr:ssion the previous week, and promise that theremaining details would be set out in the annual public expenditure white Paper.    He would take the opportunity to announce some further small relaxations in exchange control.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were grateful to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster for the work they had done onthe package.    They endorsed the recommendations which theChancellor of the Exchequer had made.    The new measures wouldbe announced on 26 October.    The statement itself should be keptreasonably short to avoid criticism that there was no time for a debate in the present Parliamentary Session.    Members of theCabinet should continue to observe the strictest secrecy until theannouncement on 26 October.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office26 October 1977
