THE QUEEN&apos;SSILVER JUBILEEPreviousReference:CM(77) 11thConclusions,Minute 11. The Cabinet were informed by the Prime Minister thatThe Queen had formally conveyed to him her thanks for the presentation which the Cabinet had made to mark her Silver Jubileeand had expressed her particular appreciation of the fact that theCabinet had wished collect?, voly encl in person to present the giftto her.PARLIAMENTARY        2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.    In discussionof the Report Stage of the Finance Bill, it was noted thatGovernment backbenchers Mr Rooker and Mrs Wise were expectedto accept the Government&apos;s proposals to modify the amendment on personal allowances which they had supported in Committee, andthat no difficulty was expected on other votes;  the amendment madein Committee on the indexation of personal tax allowances was nowof marginal importance and need not be reversed.Select Committeeon conduct ofMembers ofParliamentPreviousReference:CM(76) 29thConclusions,Minute 1THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the reportof the Select Committee on Conduct of Members would bepublished that day.    If the Members of Parliament concerned fely strongly that there should be an early debate, he would try to arrangethis before the summer recess on the basis of a motion to approve the report.    The latter did not recommend what action the house should take on its findings and although one of these was thatMr Cordle had committed a contempt he did not think that it wouldbe appropriate for a Government motion to propose specific action.Mr Cordle might decide to resign:  if he did not, it would be opento any Member to put down a motion for his expulsion.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Lord President of the Council should consult the Oppositionabout the Parliamentary handling of the report.    In the light of these consultations and of the report itself and reactions to it, he should,then consider further what action it might be appropriate for himto take in his capacity as Leader of the House.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion and invited the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.1CONFIDENTIAL_:-------.-------J&quot;.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that this bill had now completed its Committee Stage but it was low on the listof Bills for discussion on 15 July, the last day for Private Members1Bills in the Session, and had no prospect of passing in the House ofCommons without Government time.    Mr Benyon had made some concessions in Committee and had withdrawn four clauses, but theBill as reported by the Committee still contained some elementswhich its opponents found objectionable, and did not represent an agreed compromise.    The Bill&apos;8 supporters would press stronglyfor Government time to enable the Bill to get through, but he did not propose that time should be given for the present Bill in the current session.    It was, however, most desirable to take the heat out ofthe situation and he proposed that, at the time when it finallybecame clear that the Bill could not reach Royal Assent this Session,the Government should announce their willingness between now andthe start of the new Session to call together all the parties concerned to see if it would be possible to formulate a modest agreed measure which could be brought forward next Session by a Private Memberwith Government support.In discussion the point was made that, although the Governmentsposture was one of neutrality and nothing had been done to obstruct the Bill, the impression had gained ground that the Government were on the side of its opponents.    Furthermore the National ExecutiveCommittee of the Labour Party, following the vote against the bill at the Labour Women&apos;s Conference, had taken up an open stance of strong opposition to the Bill and had been trying to influence theposition of individual Labour Members.    This situation was damaging to the Government and to the Party, particularly in parts of Scotlandand Wales.    It was pointed out, on the other hand, that anyappearance of Government support for the present Bill, such as would be created by providing Government time for it, would givegreat offence to the strong minority who opposed it.    The Governmentshould clearly remain neutral on what was an issue of conscience,and it was suggested that agreement on a compromise measure was unlikely to be attainable.    It was urged, however, that theGovernment should more clearly be seen to be neutral and to beoccupying the middle ground, and that the action proposed by theSecretary of State for Social Services would be helpful in achieving this.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment were getting into a difficult situation over this Bill.The Cabinet had already agreed, in discussion the previous week,that if a compromise could be reached between supporters andopponents of the Bill, the Government should be prepared to give some assistance to enable the problems surrounding the Bill to be settled.It was desirable to explore whether agreement on compromise2
proposals could be reached, and the Secretary of State for social services should proceed as he had proposed, making a statementof the Governments intentions at the appropriate time.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion, and invited the Secretary of State for Social services to be guided accordingly.3
3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(77) 79), covering a draft White Paper titled&quot;Maintaining the Attack on Inflation1&apos;, replacing an earlier draftcirculated as CP(77) 78.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he, together with the Lord President,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the other negotiating ministers had met the Economic Committee of the Trades Union Congress (TUC)the previous evening.    He had explained to them the need for acredible counter-inflationary policy in the period after 31 July, andthe overriding importance of keeping earnings to an acceptable levelconsistent with the Governments other economic and social policies.The TUC had urged that the Government should not under-estimate the extent to which the 12 month rule, which they had alreadyreaffirmed, would help ensure an orderly return to free collective bargaining, by spacing out fresh pay settlements until the middle of1978, and preventing an immediate wage explosion.    He hadreceived no clear impression of the tuc&apos;s view of the consequences of very high settlements with those unions who were due to negotiatein the autumn.    Both sides had understood the other&apos;s dilemma, andthere had been no confrontation.    But the TUC were clearly opposedto the publication by the Government of any figure for the desirablelevel of pay settlements in phase 3.    It had been clear, as in. earliermeetings, that the TUC was in no position to agree any formalquantitative guidance.    They understood the nature of the criticalvote which the Government would face the following week in the Houseof Commons and would no doubt do their best to ensure as favourablea response as possible to the Governments policy statement.    Theywould probably welcome the proposed measures on taxation and prices which he had outlined to them.    Both sides had agreed to resume discussions in the autumn.    The Government now had toconsider what line it should take, in public and in Parliament, inthe light of the tuc&apos;s inability to co-operate.    The draft White paper before them was one possible response, although he himselffavoured a somewhat shorter document on the lines of the statement which the Chancellor originally intended to make on 15 July to accompany publication of the White Paper.In discussion, it was argued that the draft White Paper before theCabinet would be regarded as the Government s electoral programme,and it was wrong to ask the Cabinet to decide upon that at such short notice.    The present draft was not intellectually credible, and was too dependent upon suspect economic forecasts.    Its whole tenorwas inconsistent with the Governments objectives since it came to office and its publication would create a situation in which the tradeunion movement would be blamed if inflation did not fall in line withthe forecasts.    It might be better for the Government to rest upon astatement of the measures it intended to take in order to create a4
more favourable climate, and then to return to the problem in theautumn in the light of further discussions with the TUC.    On theother hand, it was pointed out that such discussions had continuedsince March.    Phase 2 of the pay policy expired at the end of July,and negotiators particularly in the public sector would need guidance on the line to be adopted during the summer.    There was also a danger of a collapse in confidence in sterling if there were no statement of Government policy until the autumn.    Moreover, now that the package of measures had been explained to the TUC, therewas a danger of leakage if publication were deferred even beyond the weekend.    There was however an argument for concentrating upon a rather shorter statement, of the kind the Chancellor had alreadyprepared, and incorporating in it some of the material from the draft white Paper, which could then be dropped.    A fuller White Paper onthe Governments economic strategy could then be published later in the year, if necessarv, in the light of the continuing dialogue withthe TUC.In discussion of the guidance which should be given in the statement,it was pointed out that the TUC were now unable to agree to anyquantitative guidance or statement of normal expectations for futurepay settlemente.    The Government had therefore to decide for itselfwhat policy it should recommend in the private sector and apply toemployees in the public sector, despite the danger that an early announcement of a specific figure would reduce its room for manoeuvre.    There were 17 major settlements due in the next threemonths, of which 9 were in the public sector.    If the Governmentwere to maintain its credibility, it had to give quantitative guidancewhich could be used in these negotiations.    Quite excessive wage claims were already being formulated by a number of unions, and amore realistic figure had to be introduced into public debate very quickly.    The TUC were unlikely to make a direct public attack upona 10 per cent figure for the increase in overall earnings.    the basic arithmetic which pointed to 10 per cent as the desired level of increase in earnings next year had been known since the time of theBudget.    The alternative approach, of negotiating each case on its merits, simply led to rapid escalation of settlements, as had happened in 1974.Against this, it was argued that the public had now rejected the policyof wage restraint and the cuts in living standards which went with it.The lower paid workers would see any figure in the region of10 per cent as an attack upon their living standards.    The TUCmaintained that a published figure would defeat its own objective and put at risk the 12 month rule which could only be maintained if unionscould see the possibility of genuinely free collective bargaining atthe end of Phase 2.    It was the 12 month rule that would do most toensure that excessive settlements were not reached over the next few5
months, after which the rate of inflation could be expected to slowdown, so that it would become easier to achieve relatively low wage settlements.    The tuc&apos;s advice during Phases 1 and 2 had been consistently sound.    They now urged the Government not to givequantitative advice on the level of settlements since this wouldsimply become a floor in future negotiations.    If this advice wereignored, it would be very difficult for the TUC to support theGover^unent in any wages policy.    If a 10 per cent figure were published, there would be a danger of it being misinterpreted as applying to wage settlements rather than to the increase in earningswhich these would produce and it would be necessary to explainpublicly that wage settlements must fall well below this to make room for wage drift.    Moreover every settlement above the publishedfigure would be seen as a defeat for the Government.    There was thus a strong argument for avoiding any quantitative advice, and merely relating the desired level of wage settlements to whateverwas necessary to bring down the level of inflation to that of our competitors and to achieve the objective of no further decline in living standards.In further discussion, it was suggested that the opposing views expressed could be reconciled if the statement juxtaposed anacknowledgment that different wage settlements would vary considerably within a wide range of figures, and the insistence thatan overall national target figure was essential.    This argumentwould be more convincing if the Chancellor^ statement demonstratedclearly the consequences of the overall level greatly exceeding10 per cent; the material on this in the existing draft of the white paper might therefore be incorporated in the Chancellor&apos;s statement.The statement should also include some reference to the problem of low pay and the need for continuing discussions with the TUC aboutways of resolving this.    It might repeat the Government&apos;s firmview that there was no question of any statutory wages policy.    Itshould emphasise that the effect of the Government&apos;s tax and other measures should be to ensure that there was no further decline inthe standard of living of the majority of workers during the rest of1977, after which the rate of inflation could be expected to declineif wage settlements were kept within the recommended level.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should make astatement the following day on the lines discussed that morning.There should not however be a White Paper in addition.    The cabinet agreed on the need for the statement to include guidance on the levelof wage settlements over the next 12 months, and a statement of theGovernments intentions for pay settlements in the public sector.A majority of the Cabinet wanted this guidance to take a quantitativeform, but the exact way of doing this was a matter of presentation,6
which the Chancellor should now consider urgently.    His statement should also explain the consequences, for the rate of inflation andfor the economy generally, of any general departure from the overall level of settlements which the Government recommended.It should mention the need for continuing discussions with the TUC,and some or all of the specific issues covered by the draft white paper such as the position of the review bodies and dividend control.The Chancellor&apos;s statement should form the subject for debate on20 July, on a motion for the adjournment of the House;  this debate would be a matter of confidence.    If necessary, the Chancellor&apos;sstatement could subsequently be published as a White Paper inorder to provide a statutory basis for the exercise of powers underthe Remuneration, Charges and Grants Act 1975.    The Cabinet didnot rule out the possibility of another and more wide rangingeconomic White Paper later in the year (though it should not bepromised at this stage), nor the possibility of publishing a popularversion of the Chancellor&apos;s statement.    Meanwhile, the cabinet would meet again at 6. 30 pm that evening to consider a further draftof the Chancellor&apos;s statement, revised in the light of their discussion.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.7
PUBLICEXPENDITURE1978-79PreviousReference:CM(77) 24thConclusions,Minutes 6 and 74. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for the Environment (CP(77) 71) on action to assist theconstruction industry;  a memorandum by the Secretary of State forthe Home Department (CP(77) 72) on family support and a note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (CP(77) 77) on the inter-relationship of child Benefit (CB) and meano-teoted benefits.Construction THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that theIndustry construction industry was facing a major crisis.    Last year&apos;expenditure cuts reduced public sector demand by  1, 000 million over1977-79.    Some help in 1978-79 and thereafter was essential.    he proposed that public sector construction programmes in 1978-79 shouldbe increased by  400 million.    This would have a net public SectorBorrowing Requirement (PSBP.) of only  240 million and would createmore work equivalent to 60, 000 more jobs though the actual number of jobs created would be less because of the present low level of productivity in the industry.    A decision now rather than later in theautumn when main public expenditure decisions for 1978-79 would betaken would greatly help to create the climate for pay settlementswhich the Government wished to establish, especially with unions withconstruction industry membership, including the Transport andGeneral Workers Union,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that it hadalready been agreed there should be a  100 million package for theconstruction industry in 1977-78 and this would form part of theannouncement on Friday 15 July by the Chancellor of the Exchequer onthe attack on inflation.    The Cabinet agreed that there was a strong case for further assistance to the industry in 1978-79.    On the otherhand there were obvious risks if the Government committed itself nowto specific proposals ahead of their renew in the autumn of public expenditure in 1978-79.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s announce-ment on 15 July should therefore indicate that the Government wouldbe considering, as part of their review in the autumn of public expendi-ture as a whole, what more could be done to help the industry.    TheSecretary of State for the Environment should agree a form of wordswith the Chief Secretary, Treasury.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of this part of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.8
Family THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that theSupport paper by officials circulated by the Secretary of the Cabinet(CP(77) 77) made it clear that the higher the level of CB increase thesmaller were the adjustments necessary to the rules governingeligibility for means-tested benefits to avoid recipients of CB losingany significant net amounts from an increase in those benefits.    Itadded strength to the argument for increasing CB to  2.40 per childper week as he had proposed at the last meeting.    Any level of increasebelow jhis rate would leave the Government open to the charge that ithad let direct support to families fall below the real level of 1974-75which could be politically very damaging.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet regarded it as important to make a substantial increase in CBfor 1978-79 but in view of the public expenditure outlook they did not feel able to accept the full increase proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services.    They agreed that CB should be increased to 2. 30 per child per week with a premium of  1 per week for singleparent families.    These increases should be announced by theChancellor of the Exchequer in his statement on 15 July.    The cost ofthese increases would represent a further call on the contingency reserve for 1978-79 the size of which would need to be considered inthe autumn when public expenditure figures for 1978-79 were reviewed.Until then the total public expenditure figures published in Cmnd 6721for 1978-79 should continue to be used for provisional planning purposes.The Cabinet -2.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministersaamming up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office14 July 19779
