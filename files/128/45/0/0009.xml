CC 9 (70)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. They noted that theHouse of Commons would adjourn for the Easter Recess onThursday, 26th March, and would reassemble on Monday, 6th April.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council on future legislation (C (70) 31).The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for theFuture Legislation Committee to consider Departments&apos;proposals for future legislation; and to report their conclusion to the Cabinet after Easter.The Cabinet considered the position of junior Ministers whoseconstituencies might be affected by the siting of the Third london airport. It was suggested that, since no Government decision had yet been taken on this issue, there need be no objection to theirgiving evidence, as representatives of their constituencies, to theforthcoming public sessions of the Commission on the Third london airport (the Roskill Commission). On the other hand it had beendecided that Ministers should not give such evidence in the case ofinquiries about the siting of New Towns, major road developments and similar matters; and the general view was that to depart fromthe normal practice in the case of the Roskill Commission would create an undesirable precedent. It would be open to members ofthe Government whose constituencies might be affected to representtheir views to the responsible Ministers in private before a decisionon the siting of the airport was taken.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that Ministers should not give public evidence, as representatives of their constituencies, to the Commissionon the Third London Airport.(3) Agreed that all Ministers in charge of Departments shouldbe invited to ensure that their junior Ministers were informed of the Cabinefs decision.confidential. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theItalian Prime Minister, Signor Rumor, was now attempting to forma Centre-Left Government. Although he was likely to encounterdifficulties in doing so, these should not affect Italian support forthe British entry into the European Economic Community.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the leader of the present regime in Lesotho, Chief Jonathan, had rejected the appeal which had been made to him by the President of Botswana,Sir Seretse Khama, to ask for the good offices of the commonwealth secretary-General, Mr. Arnold Smith, in mediating between him and his political opponents. The situation in Lesotho remainedconfused. Our normal criterion for recognition of a Government which did not necessarily imply approval was that it should be ineffective control of the country concerned; but the extent to whichChief Jonathan was in control was still in doubt. Meanwhile, wehad refrained from any action. which might be construed asrecognition. Chief Jonathan^ regime had now signified their acceptance of an offer of aid which had been made before he hadstopped the elections and suspended the Constitution; but theMinister of Overseas Development, in reply to a Question in theHouse of Commons, had informed the House that the question of aid was in suspense.In a brief discussion, the point was made that at a time whenthe Rhodesian regime was probably about to take action which,like Chief Jonathan^ coup d&apos;etat, would in effect result in theestablishment of a one-party State, we should be careful to avoid giving the impression that we applied different standards to a country governed by Africans and other where a white minoritywas in power. So far as aid was concerned, we should continue to defer a decision for as long as possible. It would be difficult tojustify giving aid to a country whose Government we did not recognise, though it was pointed out that we had continued to givetechnical assistance to Tanzania after she had broken off diplomatic relations with us.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theChinese authorities had recently released from detention a 78-year-old British subject, Mr. McBain. It was not known why the Chinesehad arrested Mr. McBain in the first place; nor was it possible toconjecture why he had now been released. A number of Britishsubjects still remained in detention. Some of these weresympathisers with the Chinese regime, who had subsequently got into trouble with it. It was difficult to see what action could usefully be taken on their behalf.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the report made to Congress by the Pesident of the United States, Mr. Nixon,on the previous day contained nothing startingly new. Perhaps its most satisfactory feature from our point of view had been the presidents firm rejection of isolationism and of any idea ofdisengagement from Europe.
IndustrialAffairsFord motor company:pay negotiations(previous reference:CC (70) 8thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that 1,500 Ford workersin Swansea and 3,000 in Halewood were now on strike; elsewhere the men had voted overwhelmingly to accept the increase in payoffered by the company. The national leadership of the two principle trade unions involved was in a state of confusion. TheTransport and General Workers&apos; Union had now advised their members to accept the company&apos;s offer but the attitude of theAmalgamated Engineers&apos; Federation would not be determined until later in the week. The company had made it clear that, unless themen now on strike went back to work quickly, production wouldbe disrupted and large numbers of workers would have to be laid off.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the First Secretary of State.AgriculturalPolicyAnnualReviewof theAgriculturalIndustry, 1970SECRET4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister without portfolio (C (70) 30), to which was attached a report by officialsabout the 1970 Annual Review of the Agricultural Industry.The Minister without Portfolio said that the ministerial committee on Agricultural Policy (AP) had agreed unanimously tothe proposals in the report attached to C (70) 30. The proposals were designed to provide the resources necessary for the continuedwell-being of the agricultural industry and to secure further progress towards the objectives of the Governmenfs selective expansion programme. They involved commodity determinations worth some 52 million, which would go mainly to beef and milk, cereals, pigs and sheep; they also included arrangements to encourage theeradication of brucellosis and further measures to relieve farmers&apos;immediate cash needs and to inject capital for further investment.There would be a  10 million increase in the fertiliser and limeIn discussion it was pointed out that what the President had said in regard to United States policies in the Far East andSouth-East Asia appeared to be closely in line with our ownthinking. Good use of it could be made in justification of our own policy in the area.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.
subsidies for one year only; and increases in the rates of capital grants to provide an extra  20 million over the next two years,which AP had agreed should apply only to new agriculturalinvestment. The proposals would entail demands on the public expenditure contingency reserve of some  11^ million in 1970-71;and of some  17 million in 1971-72. The direct effect on consumerprices would be limited to milk; and, although the price of milkwould, as a consequence, rise to Is. a pint on 1st December, 1970,this increase would in any case have had to take effect on 1st January,1971, as a result of decimalisation. It was not certain that the farmers&apos; representatives would accept the proposed package; but itwas well balanced and publicly justifiable. It had been approvedby AP on the explicit understanding that the total final awardwould be no greater than that proposed, although the agriculture ministers might come back to AP if they felt it was desirable withinthe proposed total to make adjustments in the balance between individual items in the package.In discussion, the proposals were generally welcomed. If the farmers&apos; representatives showed a strong preference for the increasedrates of capital grant to apply to work for which claims for grantwere received on or after the increases came into effect, AP might consider adopting alternative (a) in Annex D to the report attached toC (70) 30, though this was much less attractive on public expendituregrounds because of the increased expenditure in 1970-71 which itwould involve. Careful consideration would need to be given tothe timetable for dealing with British Leyland&apos;s proposals to increasethe prices of their tractors, especially if there was a risk of tractormanufacturers generally increasing their prices.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed AP&apos;s agreement on the proposals in the reportattached to C (70) 30, on the basis that, however the negotiationswith the farmers&apos; representatives went, there was no question of granting a total award greater than that now proposed. If necessary,however, consideration could be given by AP to adjustments withinthe proposed total. The Cabinet also endorsed AP&apos;s decision thatthe proposed increased rates of capital grant should apply only to new investment, though AP might consider adopting the alternative method put forward in the report attached to C (70) 30 if the farmers&apos; representatives showed a strong preference for it. It was most important that there should be no premature disclosure ofthe proposed package.
The Cabinet-CD Took note with approval of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved the proposals in the report attached to C (70) 30.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State and the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food, to consider in relation to the timing of the Annual Review, the handling of proposals toincrease tractor prices.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19 February, 1970.
