ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessDeer Huntingand HareCoursingAbolition Bill(previous reference:CC(70) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President of the Council said that the Cabinet had agreed on 5th February that Government time should be providedfor the Deer Hunting and Hare Coursing Abolition Bill. although there was widespread support for the Bill&apos;s objectives, the oppositionto it was very well organised; and it now appeared unlikely thatthe Bill would be passed in the House of Commons unless theGovernment took it over. The House of Lords would almost certainly reject the Bill in any case but this was not in itself an argument against adopting it as a Government measure.The Cabinet Agreed that the Deer Hunting and Hare Coursing AbolitionBill should be adopted as a Government measure.commission for IndustryandManpowerBill(previous reference:CC(70) 11thConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that the Cabinet had agreed on 5th March that provisions for requiring attendance and thesupply of information should be included in the legislation settingup the Commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM); but in viewof the problems arising from the application of such requirements to trade unions they had asked that particular attention should bepaid to the drafting of the relevant clauses in the Bill. In the lightof further consideration and of discussion in the legislation committee on 10th March, she had come to the conclusion that thebest course would be to omit from the Bill any provision forproceedings against trade unions and other unincorporated bodies.This would be in line with the existing legislation on monopolies.Its effect would be that proceedings could be taken against individualtrade union officials for failure to appear before or supply information to the CIM but not against trade unions as such.In discussion it was suggested that the provisions relating toattendance and the supply of information should be applied without discrimination to all organisations, whether incorporated or not. Itwas questionable whether a trade union official acting on behalf ofhis union ought to be made liable to proceedings which could notbe taken against the union. Moreover, some employers&apos; organisationswere unincorporated; and, if the First Secretary of State&apos;s proposals were accepted, these organisations would be exempted from the requirement to supply information to the CIM.  The provisions of
the Bill should be made to apply to all unincorporated bodies,though this need not involve any mention of trade unions as such.On the other hand it was argued that the provisions in the legislation on monopolies had proved quite satisfactory; and there was noreason to believe that the omission of any reference to unincorporatedbodies would give rise to any difficulty in practice.In further discussion it was pointed out that the legislation committee had left open for further consideration the questionwhether the remuneration of members of the Northern ireland parliament should be brought within the scope of the Bill. In viewof the United Kingdom Governmenfs responsibilities in this regard,there was a strong case for doing this; and it should be acceptable to the Northern Ireland Government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the CIM Bill should not include any provisionfor proceedings against unincorporated bodies. They agreed that the remuneration of Northern Ireland Ministers and Members of the parliament of Northern Ireland should be brought within the scopeof the Bill; and that the CIM should submit any reports on such remuneration to the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the draftCommission for Industry and Manpower Bill to be amended on the lines indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.CommercialPolicyImports of butter and cheese fromthe irish republic(previous reference:CC (70) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that whenthe Cabinet had last discussed butter and cheese imports from theIrish Republic, they had concluded that we should adhere to theattitude which we had adopted and make it clear to the IrishGovernment that we intended to do so, while allowing them timefor second thoughts. Action had been taken accordingly. On11th March the Irish Ambassador had informed the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster that our offer was unacceptable and, in theview of the Irish Government, contrary to the spirit and intention ofthe Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement. The Ambassador had saidthat the Irish Government were not prepared to operate a voluntaryrestraint scheme for cheese imports; and were ready to take theconsequences of their refusal to accept our offer. On 10th march the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr. Lynch, had written to the Prime Minister on similar lines. The British Ambassador in dublin had reported that the reaction of the Irish Government toour decision to maintain our original attitude and imposecountervailing duties if necessary had been such that, if we persisted
in that decision, we might forfeit the degree of co-operation whichwe might otherwise hope to obtain from the Government of theRepublic in dealing with the sensitive problem of Northern Ireland.Even so, it would probably be right, on balance, to adhere to our original decision. Our offer had been a generous one; and the irish republic had fared better than any of our suppliers including our major ones, for example Australia and New Zealand. It was truethat the Irish Minister responsible for the butter and cheesenegotiations, the Minister of Agriculture, Mr. Blaney, had taken anoutspokenly nationalist line over Northern Ireland; and no doubthis views on the latter issue had coloured his attitude on the former.But we had some reason to believe that the intransigent line headvocated was actively supported by only a few of his colleagues inthe Irish Cabinet; and it had been suggested that, if we could makea small and unpublicised addition to the proposed cheeseallocation this might tip the scale. If this was in fact the case, thepossibilities would be worth investigating. But it did not seem avery satisfactory way of handling the problem; and his recommendation was that we should stand firm on our existingoffers.In discussion it was pointed out that the facts did not supportthe Irish contention that our proposals represented a breach of theletter or spirit of the Anglo-Irish Free Trade Agreement; nor didour proposals conflict with our other international obligations.Irish exports of butter and cheese were subsidised to an extent whichclearly justified the imposition of countervailing duties. While itwas recognised that there might be political advantage in notproviding Mr. Blaney with a grievance which he could exploit toour detriment in the context of Northern Ireland, there was no certainty that concessions would have the effect we desired or thatthe Irish would not draw the conclusion that obduracy paid. our final offer had been generous in relation to our treatment of othersuppliers. To go any further would land us in serious difficulties with the latter; aggravate the problem of the disposal of surpluses;and endanger the stability of the British market.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that whilefull weight had to be given to the wider political considerationsarising out of our current problems in Northern Ireland, the cabinet were clearly in favour of standing by our offer. We should accordingly proceed on these lines, bearing in mind the desirabilityof presenting our case in the most favourable light possible.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theChinese authorities had recently arrested and detained the mastersof two British merchant ships belonging to the Blue Funnel line and the Glen Line. In the former case the owners had not wishedus to take any drastic action, since it was thought that the arrest hadbeen made by the local authorities in Shanghai and that there wasa possibility that their action might be disowned by Peking.Representations had however now been made in regard to both cases by our Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking; and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary were now considering whether to reinforcethese by a parallel approach to the Chinese Charge d&apos;Affaires inLondon.The Cabinet (1) Took   note   of   the   statement   by   the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that our efforts to induce friendly Powers to close their consular Missions had met with considerable success. Only six countries now had consularrepresentation in Rhodesia, namely South Africa, Portugal, Greece,Belgium (who had only an honorary Vice-Consul in Bulawayo andno representative in Salisbury), Germany (whose Consulate was concerned only with questions of compensation for victims of the nazi regime) and Switzerland (who in view of her neutral statuswas a special case and who was in any event reviewing her position).The Prime Minister said that during the visit of the german chancellor, Herr Brandt, to London, he had raised with him thequestion of the German Consulate in Salisbury. He had indicated to him that we should raise no objection to continued Germanrepresentation in Salisbury if it were made clear that this was concerned exclusively with questions relating to compensation. some further pressure on Greece would no doubt be required; butmeanwhile the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary on the results which had so far been achieved.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the security council of the United Nations would shortly be meeting to considerthe draft resolution on Rhodesia tabled by us and also an Africanresolution. The latter was less satisfactory than our own draft, inthat it called inter alia for a severance of communications withRhodesia and also for the extension of sanctions to South Africa
and Portugal. On the latter point our position was clear: we couldnot support a resolution which included it. But if the Africans, towhom our attitude on this question was well known, were to decide to drop this proposal in favour of a resolution calling only for communications sanctions, we should be in a much more difficult position.In a brief discussion the point was made that it would bedesirable, if time and developments in the United Nations permitted,for our attitude to any draft resolutions which might come beforethe Security Council to be considered by Ministers. But if this werenot possible, sufficient guidance was already available to ourPermanent Representative at the United Nations, Lord Caradon,whose instructions had been drafted in the light of the Ministerialdiscussions which had already taken place.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the point made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the recentattempt on the life of the President of the Republic of Cyprus,Archbishop Makarios, had most probably been made by extremistelements of the Greek Cypriot National Front. Fortunately it hadnot exacerbated relations between Greece and Turkey.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the soviet union had failed to respond to our appeal to them, as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference, to engage in consultations with the other signatory Powers. They had instead suggested direct talks betweenthe respective leaders of the Royal Laotian Government and thePathet Lao. There were some indications that such talks might inin fact take place.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen a violent attack on the North Vietnamese Embassy in PhnomPenh. It was unlikely to be purely coincidental that this attack had occurred six years to the day after the similar attack on the british embassy and that it took place during the absence abroad of theCambodian Prime Minister, Prince Sihanouk.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that as he had informed his colleagues, the South African Ambassador had recentlycome to see him about the Anglo-South African agreement on thenaval base at Simonstown and about our refusal to supply Wasphelicopters to the South African Government. He had now returned
a substantive reply to the Ambassadors representations, making thepoint that we attached importance to the Simonstown agreement which we regarded as still being in force. With regard to Wasphelicopters, we did not accept the South African contention thatour refusal to supply was in breach of our previous understandingswith the South African Government.The Cabinet-(4) Took  note  of  the  statements   by   the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.MaltaAgreementon FinancialAssistance(previous reference:CC (69) 20thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Defence Secretary (C (70) 43)proposing that we should offer to reopen negotiations on the termsof our aid to Malta covering the five-year period from 1st April, 1969,and should be prepared to provide up to 75 per cent in the form ofa grant.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in 1964it had been agreed that aid over the five-year period ending31st March, 1969, should be in the form of 75 per cent grant:25 per cent loan. The appropriate percentages over the next five-year period were left for later discussions. We were committed to making available  23 million of aid during this period and theCabinet had previously agreed that 50 per cent should be in theform of a grant. The maximum cost of the concession he nowadvocated was, therefore, that 25 per cent of  23 million, or 5 - 75 million, would be available as a grant over the five-year period ending on 31st March, 1974. Since our offer of a 50 per cent granthad been made, negotiations had been at a standstill; and it wouldbe highly undesirable for the deadlock to remain unresolved overthe election period in Malta. The question would become an election issue; and, whatever view was taken about the outcome ofthe elections or about the possible effect of the aid dispute on itsoutcome, we would be worse off than if we had reached agreementbeforehand. The political and military stakes were high. A breachwith Malta might not only cause difficulties for us; it would dismayour North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) allies and might eventually lead to a situation in which the base was not merelydenied to NATO but was made available to the Soviet Union. Suchdevelopments would provoke strong criticism within NATO of ourhandling of the problem and would finally frustrate our long-termaim of associating Malta more closely with NATO.The Defence Secretary said that there were two main reasonsfor departing from the decision which the Cabinet had made inMay 1969. First, the hope that the Maltese Prime Minister,Dr. Borg Olivier, would accept the 50 per cent offer had proved
unfounded; and his position was bound to harden as electionsapproached. Secondly, the coup in Libya, although it had eliminateda national commitment which required the use of Malta, nowopened up the prospect of a situation in which Soviet influence couldbe dominant in all the countries on the southern shores of theMediterranean, with obvious consequences not only for theMediterranean members of the Alliance but also for Israel. this danger had sharpened NATO&apos;s fears for the future in Malta. if mr. Mintoff won at the next elections and he would certainly make good use of the absence of an aid agreement with us againstDr. Olivier he would, at best, demand a high price for our continued presence; and at worst might break with NATOcompletely, with the gravest strategic consequences to NATO&apos;position.In discussion it was argued, in favour of the proposals in thepaper, that the consequences of harassment of our forces in Malta,which though it had not so far materialised was still a realpossibility, would be such as to outweigh, in cost alone, the valueof the concession now proposed. We also enjoyed a very largefavourable trade balance with Malta which a dispute could endanger.The right course, therefore, was to reopen negotiations, makingminimum concessions in the first instance, but empowering our negotiators to go up to the full 75:25 ratio if agreement could not otherwise be obtained. Against these arguments it was suggestedthat the changes which had occurred since May 1969 were not suchas to warrant a reversal of the Cabinefs considered reaffirmation ofthe 50 per cent offer. The Malta economy was prospering; and tomake a further concession now would savour of weakness, leavingus the more likely to be subjected to further pressures. Even if we agreed improved terms with Dr. 01ivier&apos;s Government, we might still find ourselves faced with a victorious Mr. Mintoff after theelections, in which case we should have thrown away a goodnegotiating card in what might be regarded as an unsuccessfulattempt to influence the elections in favour of his opponent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that by an arrow majority the Cabinet was in favour of adhering to thedecision made in May 1969 not to go beyond an offer of aid on thebasis of 50 per cent grant:50 per cent loan. The decision was,however, finely balanced; and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary and the Defence Secretary should feel free to reopen thequestion if there was any material change in the political or militarysituation.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
IndustrialAffairsTeachers&apos;Pay(previous reference:CC(70) 11thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that in a circular dated4th March the General Secretary of the National Union of Teachers(NUT) had stated that the NUT Executive confidently expected thatin the forthcoming negotiations on a new pay structure the union&apos;snegotiators would succeed in securing further increases which would ensure that every teacher would receive an increase of at least  135in the year ending 31st March, 1971. The circular drew attentionto the fact that the agreed Press statement issued after the burnham committee&apos;s meeting on 3rd March contained a reference to the factthat &quot; not less than  42 million &quot; would be available for salary increases. The circular went on to say that in the year ending31st March, 1972, not less than  84 million would be available andthat it would be the task of the NUT&apos;s negotiators to ensure thatthis figure was substantially exceeded in the coming negotiations.The line taken in the NUT circular was disturbing; and it was difficult to reconcile with the report on the terms of the settlementreached in the Burnham Committee which the Secretary of State for education and Science had circulated following the discussion in theCabinet on 5th March.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe matter could not be carried further for the moment, since theSecretary of State for Education and Science was not present.Nevertheless, the Cabinet were concerned about the apparentdiscrepancy between the line taken in the NUT circular and thereport of the Secretary of State on the terms of the agreement reached in the Burnham Committee on 3rd March. The NUT circular wouldgive rise to grave embarrassment in the negotiations with the scottish teachers, which were to be resumed on 20th March. The Chancellorof the Exchequer should discuss the position urgently with theSecretary of State for Education and Science, in consultation withthe First Secretary of State and with the Secretary of State forScotland, who had been asked by Scottish teachers to intervene in thenegotiations on their wage claim and would have to reply to this invitation very shortly. He would ask the Secretary of State for education and Science to return to London for this purpose as soonas possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe First Secretary of State and the Secretary of State forScotland, to consider urgently with the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science the apparent discrepancybetween the NUT circular and his own report on theterms of the agreement reached in the burnham committee on 3rd March.
AgriculturalPolicyFarm price review, 1970(previous reference:CC (70) 9thConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET7. The Prime Minister said that he had seen Mr. Plumb, thePresident of the National Farmers&apos; Unions (NFUs) that morning.Mr. Plumb had indicated that if the Governments present offerswere increased by about  15 million the NFUs might be able to reach an agreed settlement. Agreement would not be possible for anysmaller sum. According to Mr. Plumb, the bonus incentive schemefor brucellosis-free herds would not help the great majority of dairyfarmers and he had asked for an increase of 2-^-d. per gallon on the milk price. The Minister of Agriculture had indicated that theGovernment might be able to offer an additional 2d. per gallon ifthe farmers accepted the review with reasonable grace. Mr. Plumbhad said that the proposed capital grants scheme was not particularlyattractive, partly because the farmers had not found investmentprofitable recently and partly because capital improvements accruedto the landlords of tenant farmers. Mr. Plumb had referred to the expected shortage of potatoes in the current season and had suggested that a somewhat larger increase in the guaranteed price for potatoes than that proposed by the Government would avoid a repetition of this shortage next year. He had gone on to argue thatan increase in the guaranteed price would not involve any additional cost to the Exchequer because of the relation between guaranteedand market price.The Minister of Agriculture said that, throughout thenegotiations with the NFUs, he had kept strictly within the limitsagreed by the Cabinet when they had previously discussed the farm price Review. He considered that it would be desirable to offer anincrease of 2d. per gallon on milk in order to meet the serious problems of small dairy farmers, even though such an increase would involve offering less than was desirable on other commodities in order to keep within the agreed total commodity determination of 52 million. Such an increase in milk prices for the farmers,together with forthcoming increases in milk distributors&apos; margins,would lead to an increase in the retail price of milk from 1st October,1970.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed to a settlement on the lines indicated by theMinister of Agriculture including an increase of 2d. per gallon on milk which was consistent with the Cabinets earlier decision. TheMinister of Agriculture would give further consideration to the date from which the consequent increase in retail milk prices should operate, bearing in mind that Ministers had not collectively agreedto any increase in milk distributors&apos; margins. The agriculture ministers should also consider further with the Chief Secretary
whether some additional increase in the guaranteed price forpotatoes could be offered without risk of increasing the exchequer cost. If so, the Cabinet were prepared to authorise such an increaseeven though it involved a small addition above the  52 millionpreviously decided as the total value of the commoditydeterminations. The White Paper reporting the outcome of the farm Price Review should be circulated to the Cabinet prior to its publication in the following week.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture (a) To be guided by the Prime Minister^ summing upof their discussion in settling the 1970 Farm price review.(b) To circulate copies of the White Paper reporting the outcome of the Farm Price Review to the cabinet before its publication in the following week.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, in consultation with the Home Secretary, theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Secretary of Statefor Wales, to consider further on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister in his summing up, whether a further increase in the guaranteed price for potatoes should be offered.Prices andIncomesPolicySalaries ofChairmen and members ofNationalisedIndustryBoards(previous references:CC(69) 15thConclusions,Minute 2, and cc(70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)Salaries ofthe higher judiciary(previous reference:CC (70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 4)SECRET*8. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Chancellorabout the salaries of the higher judiciary (C (70) 6 and 37) and memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal about the pay of the higher civil Service (C (70) 40) and about salaries of chairmen and membersof nationalised industry Boards (C (70) 41).The Lord Privy Seal said that his proposals on salaries for the nationalised industry Boards and for the Higher Civil Service were linked in the sense that the Government had issued statements ofpolicy in the previous year in similar terms in relation to the reportof the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on the formerand to the Plowden Report on the latter; and there was a clearpresumption that the two reports would be treated similarly. Forthe nationalised industries Stage 1 of the total increases proposedby the NBPI had been implemented on 1st April, 1969. He nowproposed that Stage 2, involving an average increase of 9-10 per cent,should be implemented on 1st April, 1970, and that at the sametime   the   Government   should   announce   their   intention   of* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
implementing Stage 3 a further 8^-9 per cent on average on1st April, 1971. The Government had accepted a year ago that thetotal proposed increases were justified. Since then salary settlementshad been running at an unusually high level; and it was clear thatrewards in the public sector were again falling substantially behindthose in the private sector. In general, incomes policy might besaid to have become a good deal more flexible since the middle ofthe previous year. Meanwhile, the salary structure within the nationalised industries remained unsatisfactory: for example, airpilots were being paid more than members of the Boards of theAirways Corporations. While it would be possible, if it were thought desirable for presentational reasons, to pay the remaining increases in three shorter stages instead of two annual stages, he would not recommend such a course.The Higher Civil Service was entitled to the same treatment asthe chairmen and members of the Boards of nationalised industries.Successful implementation of the proposals for restructuring theCivil Service, with a unified grade structure extending to the top,would require the full co-operation of the Staff Side. The latter had made clear to him very recently their close concern in the earlyimplementation of the salary increases proposed by the plowden committee. There would be an additional complication in thecompression of the pay differentials between Assistant Secretariesand Under-Secretaries if the full pay increases proposed by the plowden Committee for the latter were unduly delayed.The Lord Chancellor said that he had been asked for a salaryincrease last December by the Judges; and he had informed themthat he would be prepared to put forward proposals for an increasestrictly within the prices and incomes guide-line and thereforeamounting to 3\ per cent per annum over the four years since their salaries were last increased. Apart from Members of Parliamentno one else had had to wait four years for an increase in salary; andit was impossible satisfactorily to explain to the Judges why theyshould have to do so. It should be borne in mind that the lastincrease for Members of Parliament had been no less than 90 percent as well as Government contributions to their pensions. Thehigher judiciary on the other hand had received an increase of merely20 per cent in 1966; and that was only the second increase they hadreceived since 1832.In discussion it was suggested that any increase in the salaries of the higher judiciary should, in principle, be effected by stages, asin the case of the Higher Civil Service and the Boards of nationalised industries and that consideration should therefore be given to appropriate Stage 2 and 3 increases, reckoning the Lord Chancellors
present proposals as Stage 1. On the other hand there would be great difficulty in securing the agreement of the House of commons to an increase in pay for the higher judiciary at the present juncture,notwithstanding that the increase could be effected by Order andwould not require legislation and that the increasing public concern about the enforcement of law and order would probably make it easier to secure acceptance of the large amounts proposed. It wouldbe preferable to seek to relate the timing of any increase for the judges to the likely timing of a further increase in the pay ofMembers of Parliament. It might therefore be desirable to postponeany increase for the Judges, together with the implementation of stage 2 of the increases for the nationalised industry Boards andfor the Higher Civil Service until 1st January, 1971. Meanwhile,discussions might be opened with the Judges about the size and timing of a three-stage increase on the lines of those for the higher civil Service and nationalised industry Boards.On the other hand it was argued that it would be impossibleto explain to the Judges why they alone apart from Members ofParliament should be asked to wait still longer for a much overdueincrease in salary. They would justifiably see no legitimateconnection between their pay and that of Members of Parliament.In any event it would be wise to terminate the relativity between the remuneration of the Judges and that of the Higher Civil Service andto arrange henceforward for any further increase in Judges&apos; paybeyond the amounts currently proposed by the Lord Chancellor tobe based, like the pay of other classes, on a thorough evaluation bythe Commission for Industry and Manpower.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, summing up thediscussion, said that the Cabinet agreed, on balance, that the salaries of the English Judges should be increased as proposed by the LordChancellor in C (70) 6. Corresponding increases would be requiredin the salaries of the higher judiciary in Scotland and NorthernIreland. They agreed the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s proposal that Stage 2of the increases for members of nationalised industry Boards andfor the Higher Civil Service should take effect from 1st April, 1970,and 1st July, 1970, respectively and that the corresponding Stage 3increases should take effect from 1st April, 1971, and 1st July, 1971,respectively. The Government should announce their decisions inrespect of Stages 2 and 3 of the increases for the nationalised industryBoards and the Higher Civil Service in a single statement; but the timing of this announcement should be reserved for furtherconsideration by the Cabinet at their next meeting.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals for increases in salaries of thehigher judiciary in the United Kingdom set out inC (70) 6.
(2) Approved the proposals in paragraph 9 of C (70) 41 relatingto Stage 2 and Stage 3 salary increases for members of nationalised industry Boards.(3) Approved the proposals in paragraph 11 of C (70) 40 relatingto the Stage 2 and Stage 3 increases in the pay of theHigher Civil Service.(4) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Lord Chancellor and the first secretary of State, before their next meeting, the timing of an announcement of their decision and the terms inwhich it might be made.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th March, 1970.
