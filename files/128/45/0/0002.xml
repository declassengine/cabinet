CONFIDENTIAL3CC 2 (70)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.*They also considered arrangements for the despatch ofParliamentary business if the printing of Parliamentary papers was interrupted by industrial action.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Cabinet had asked the group of Ministers under his chairmanship to consider whether any further action should be put in hand to deal with a possible recurrence atHer Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office (HMSO) of the industrial actionwhich had for some time been causing disturbance to the provisionof Parliamentary papers. The Ministerial group had concluded thatalternative facilities of the kind envisaged would be liable to be needed on a continuing basis and that no accommodation for them could be provided in the Palace of Westminster, since the spacewould then be incapable of being used for any other purpose. Theyhad accordingly chosen a building in Parliament Street which seemeda suitable location for an emergency service; and Xerox machines were at present being installed there. On the basis of these facilities the Houses of Parliament, including their Committees, could in anemergency be provided with an adequate service of essential papers,with possibly some initial disturbance at the outset. The machineswould be operated by clerical staff provided by private employment agencies; but consideration was being given to the possibility of usingmembers of the Armed Forces in this role if the agencies or their staff were dissuaded from taking the work by trade union action. In thelast resort, if physical interference with the Parliament Streetoperation prevented it from being maintained, plans were in trainfor the establishment of more limited emergency facilities within the palace of Westminster, which should ensure a minimum service of papers for both Houses of Parliament, although not for theirCommittees. The cost of operating the arrangements in anemergency would be borne on the Votes of the Houses of Parliament.The Lord President of the Council agreed that these proposalsrepresented the most effective arrangements which could be devisedas an insurance against the contingency in question.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the proposed emergency arrangements for printing Parliamentary papers.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.CONFIDENTIAL
CONFIDENTIALLondon 2.   The Prime Minister said that it had been agreed by theFares50&apos;&apos; Ministers principally concerned that a statement should be issuednot later than the following day on the Governments position inrelation to public indications by the London Transport Executivethat London Transport fares might have to be raised as a directconsequence of decimalisation. The statement should make it clearthat the Government did not regard decimalisation as, in itself, ajustification for price increases and that it would be inconsistent with government policy for the change to decimal currency to be used as a pretext for unnecessary increases in prices; that the faresstructure of London Transport Services was no longer a directGovernmental responsibility but was primarily a matter for theLondon Transport Executive, suoject to the approval of the greater london Council; that the Government therefore expected theExecutive and the Council to subject their intentions to close examination in the light of the Governments policy; but that theywould in any event reserve the right to arrange, as necessary, forfurther scrutiny of, and action on, any proposals for increases in fares which might subsequently be put forward.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange for the issue on the following day of a statement onthe lines proposed.commission for Industryand Manpower(previous reference:CC (69) 60thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity (C (70) 7) about the publication of a consultative document on the Governments proposals for the establishment of aCommission for Industry and Manpower (CIM).The First Secretary of State said that since the Cabinet had last considered her proposals for consultations on the scope and functionsof the Commission she had had informal discussions withrepresentatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI); andthe Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy (IPY) had examined the proposed machinery to deal with politically sensitive salaries.She hoped to be able to publish a revised version of the document on the following Tuesday after circulating it to the Cabinet for finalclearance over the weekend; this would allow a month for public discussion of its proposals without seriously delaying the introductionof the consequential Bill in Parliament. There were, however, anumber of issues which must first be decided.
outcome of theInformalConsultationswith theCBIThe First Secretary of State said that the CBI had reacted to the document strongly and on the expected lines. They had argued thatthe proposals represented a substantial extension of the Govern-menfs powers of intervention in industry and had particularlyobjected to the proposed price control powers. They had suggestedthat the Government were abandoning all attempts to control theactivities of the trades unions and were seeking, instead, greaterpowers to control prices, a course which could only lead to further reductions in industrial investment. They had maintained, therefore,that the proposals were bound to have an adverse effect on therelations between industry and the Government.This last suggestion could perhaps be discounted. But it mightbe possible to allay some of the fears expressed by the CBI byexplaining more fully in the opening paragraphs the reasons why theGovernment felt that the powers of enquiry should cover largercompanies and why it was necessary to retain, broadly, the powers in the existing monopolies legislation. But the more stringentconditions which would govern the exercise of those powers couldbe given further emphasis; and a clearer distinction could also bedrawn throughout the document between those enquiries whichwould be designed to lead to the implementation of the powers andthose which would be educative in character, in the sense that theywould be directed primarily to elucidating the facts in a givensituation and bringing the force of public opinion to bear in improving it. One other concession i.e. the omission of the requirement on the CIM to have regard not only to the publicinterest as defined and to the prices and incomes policy but also to&quot; other general considerations which would be set out from time totime in statutory orders made under the Act&quot; might cause little difficulty in practice, while allaying exaggerated fears about theGovernments intentions.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that thecircumstances in which firms might be referred to the CIM shouldbe both more limited and more closely defined. No adequate case had been made for extending the power of enquiry beyond theexisting criteria of technical monopoly situations, large mergers and prices and incomes policy. The criteria for references in the draftdiscussed with the CBI should therefore be amended in orderto make it clear that references would &quot; only &quot;, not &quot; normally &quot;, be related to the listed criteria, which should be limited to those under existing legislation. Even if large companies per se were to beincluded within the scope of the Commission, the circumstances inwhich they were liable to be referred should be clearly specified. Onthe other hand it was pointed out that the scope of enquiries by the
Top salaries in the PublicSectorCIM had been considered at length by the IPY Committee. TheCabinet had endorsed the Committee&apos;s conclusion that the new body should not simply inherit the existing powers of the monopolies commission and the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI),but should concentrate on ensuring, so far as possible, that the largerindustrial units remained subject to the normal pressures of competition, while limiting its intervention in relation to smallerfirms. Some Ministers had expressed concern that even the limitsnow proposed by the First Secretary were too restrictive. There waspublic anxiety about the implications of industrial restructuring; andit was important that its consequences should be kept under review.This might be ensured if the  10 million limit was maintained. Itwas difficult to specify any more precisely the circumstances in whichfirms might be referred to the CIM without unduly limiting theGovernments future freedom of action.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed that the document should be redrafted onthe lines proposed by the First Secretary of State in the hopeof allaying in some measure the anxieties of the CBI. In addition,however, she should give further thought to the possibility of amending the document in such a way that the circumstances in which firms might be referred to the CIM were made more precise.But the general principles governing the circumstances in whichreferences to the CIM should be made had already been agreed; andthese decisions of policy should stand.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up by the PrimeMinister of this part of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the draftconsultative document to be further amended on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up.The Lord Privy Seal said that the IPY Committee had agreedthat the legislation should make specific provision for the establish-ment of a self-reporting panel within the CIM, to review and advise on top salaries in the public sector in such groups as Ministers,Members of Parliament, the Boards of nationalised industries, senior civil servants, the most highly paid local authority officers and the judiciary although it would be undesirable to insist on this last point against the opposition of the judges. The absence of some such co-ordinating institution had created difficulties in the past in determining the salaries of politically sensitive groups of this kind.Following his informal discussions with the National Staff Side hethought that the Civil Service would now accept the proposals andthe consequential abolition of the Powden Committee, provided that
they were consulted on the appointment of one or more of themembers of the new panel, that they were given an opportunity tomake their own case to the panel and that the proposed four-yearreviews were supplemented by two-year interim reviews which would prevent salaries falling so far behind as to require embarrassinglylarge increases at one time. He supported the inclusion of both the nationalised industries and local authorities in the scope of the panel. It was regrettable, but inevitable, that the doctors and dentists could not be included at this stage. But the Governmentshould have the power to add or to subtract groups by direction. Inprinciple the judges should be included, since this would bothstrengthen the new machinery itself and would reduce the risk thatthe judges would be involved in political controversy. Moreover, itwould probably be to the advantage of the judges themselves.The Lord Chancellor said that his consultation had shown theEnglish judges to be opposed at present to the reference oftheir remuneration to the proposed panel, not least because they feared that this might involve them in public controversy. Thearrangement whereby the salaries of the lower judiciary were related to those of the higher Civil Service was satisfactory; and it wouldbe preferable to seek to establish a similar relationship between thoseof the High Court judges and Permanent Secretaries. Moreover,since the Act of Settlement the salaries of the judges had been dealtwith directly by the Government; and before any outside body was involved in their determination the judges would wish to know moreabout its scope, constitution and membership.The Lord Advocate said that the Scottish judges, on thecontrary, would be content to be brought within the scope of the panel, provided the English judges were also included.In discussion it was suggested that a distinction might be drawn between the salaries of Ministers, Members of Parliament, judges and the other groups. For the former, even four-yearly reviewsmight prove embarrassing. It might be preferable to refer their salaries to the panel on comparatively rare occasions in order toestablish a formula for relating them to the higher Civil Service;between such reviews increases would follow those of the analogues.On the other hand it was argued that such fixed relativities wereinappropriate and that it would be unsatisfactory for the panel, in considering the salaries of higher civil servants, to take decisions by implication on the salaries of other groups without considering whether such decisions were appropriate on merits.In further discussion it was argued that to include the judges in the scope of the panel would increase their independence in so
far as their salaries would no longer be solely dependent on theExecutive. Moreover, if proposed increases were the result of regular reviews conducted by an independent body, they were likelyto arouse less opposition in Parliament than the present infrequent,large and apparently arbitrary increases. If the judges were includedin the scope of the panel, it might even prove possible to eliminate the present need to obtain validation of the increases by affirmative resolution of both Houses of Parliament. These considerationssuggested that it might be possible to persuade the English judgesthat it would be desirable that their remuneration should be brought within the scope of the panel in view of the overall advantages ofthis course; and it would therefore be appropriate to make further efforts in this direction before any definite decision was reached.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The Government were already publicly committed to a review of the pay of Members of Parliament early in the new parliament; and this had been welcomed in the House of Commons.It might be inappropriate, therefore, to announce at this stage thatthese salaries would be reviewed at particular intervals, althoughfixed relativities were unlikely to be appropriate and there wereobvious advantages in including them in principle in general reviews of the politically sensitive groups as a whole.(b) Local authority Associations should be consulted about theproposal to include the most highly paid local government officials in the scope of the panel.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in general agreement with the proposals for a specialpanel to consider politically sensitive salaries. The Lord chancellor and the Lord Advocate might undertake further consultations withthe English and Scottish judges, preferably together, in order toascertain whether there was any likelihood that the former couldbe brought to agree to be included in the scope of the panel in thelight of the arguments put forward in the Cabinefs discussion. Inthe meantime no reference to the judges should be made in the consultative document; and any questioners should be told that thematter was still under consideration. So far as Members ofParliament were concerned it was important that the conduct of the review which the Government were already committed to initiateearly in the next Parliament should not be unduly prejudiced inadvance by the consultative document; and it would be desirablethat the First Secretary of State and the Lord President should give further consideration to the wording of the document on this pointin order to preserve the necessary freedom of action to decide how the remuneration of Members of Parliament might best bedetermined, Parliament by Parliament.
The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the summing up by the PrimeMinister of this part of their discussion.(4) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 10-14 of C (70) 7,subject to the points made in discussion.The First Secretary of State said that a difficulty had arisen overthe implementation of the Cabinefs earlier decision that reports fromthe CIM need not be unanimous but that their panels would haveto seek endorsement of their conclusions by the Commission as awhole. At present the powers in the Monopolies Legislation couldonly be invoked if the report was approved by a two-thirds majority.It would be possible to continue this provision, recognising that, asa result, there would be some cases where it would not be possibleto invoke the powers a course she would not recommend.Alternatively, the Government could refuse to renew the provision,thus straining their relations with the CBI still further. Or theCabinet might think it best to reconsider the decision to provide fordissenting views and to retain the practice of the NBPI.In discussion it was pointed out that the two-thirds rule had notin practice caused any significant difficulties in acting on reports ofthe Monopolies Commission. It was inapplicable to those referenceswhose purposes was mainly educative; and in other cases theGovernment would not be in a strong position to use the powers ifless than two-thirds of the Commission had found that the firm inquestion were acting against the public interest. Moreover, althoughit might be possible to dispense with a two-thirds majority where no more was involved than e.g. the short-term control of the price ofan individual commodity, it would be regarded as an importantsafeguard in cases where an industry might be required to make, orto refrain from, major structural changes or fundamentalmodifications of practice.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the two-thirds rule should apply before powers related to the basic structure of an industry could be invoked. The First Secretaryof State might consider, however, whether a distinction could bedrawn between cases of this kind and short-term references, to whichthe rule need not perhaps apply on the understanding that, if thereport on such a reference contained structural recommendations,these would have to be the subject of a further long-term reference and be made conditional on a two-thirds majority decision.
Treatment ofOverseasAssetsLocalAuthorityRentsConclusionThe Cabinet (5) Invited the First Secretary of State to consider the proposalsfurther in the light of the summing up of the discussion by the Prime Minister.The First Secretary of State reported that further consideration had been given to the proposal that, for the purposes of the assetslimit which would be included in the legislation, the assets of a group should include those held overseas (though the activities of a foreignparent company could not themselves be referred to the CIM).While there might be difficulties in such a definition, both in principle and in practice, officials of the Departments concerned had concluded, on balance, that its advantages outweighed itsdisadvantages.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that overseas assets should be included in the definition of capital employed on which the criteria for references to the CIM would be based.The First Secretary of State said that, unless local authorityrents were specifically excluded, they would be within the scope ofthe CIM, together with other local authority trading services. Aspecial provision to exclude them would be controversial.Moreover, although the powers would not be invoked so long as local authority rents could be dealt with under the new Rent Act,they might be required when the provisions of that Act expired. Itshould therefore suffice if the subject was not mentioned in the consultative document.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that local authority rents should not be excludedfrom the statutory definition of the scope of the CIM.The Cabinet (8) Invited First Secretary of State to circulate a further draftof the consultative document, revised in the light of thepoints made in discussion, for consideration at their next meeting.SECRETSalaries 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordHigher Chancellor about the salaries of the higher judiciary (C (70) 6).Judiciary jne  ora&apos; Chancellor said that there had been no increase inthe salaries of the higher judiciary since 1st April, 1966, i.e. for
almost four years. He was now proposing that these salaries shouldbe increased by amounts equivalent to the Stage 1 increase whichthe higher Civil Service had received in the previous July. Thiswould involve an increase of some  1,400 in the salaries of HighCourt judges and corresponding increases in the salaries of othermembers of the higher judiciary. This increase was equivalent to3-1- per cent per annum, which compared with an increase of over4 per cent per annum in the retail price index since April 1966, andwas within the incomes policy ceiling. Since 1919 the position of high Court judges had deteriorated in relation to, for example, thatof Permanent Secretaries. At that date the Permanent Secretary ofthe Treasury had received a salary amounting to 40 per cent of thatof a High Court judge: today the former was paid rather more thanthe latter. Moreover, the lower judiciary had received an increase at the same time as the higher Civil Service in the previous July; andthe differential between the lower and higher judiciary had beensignificantly constricted as a result.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposed increases would require to be validated by affirmative Resolutions of bothHouses of Parliament and that in 1966 there had been considerable opposition to the Resolutions introduced in relation to the increasesgranted on that occasion. This opposition had derived not merelyfrom the fact that the Resolutions had come before Parliamentduring the wage freeze but also from strongly held objections to very substantial increases in salaries which were already large. It wouldbe difficult for the Government to defend the increases nowproposed against criticism which would be liable to be revived allthe more actively because there had been no full examination of thecase by an impartial body. Moreover, it would be inopportune tomake these substantial increases in judges&apos; salaries at a time whenit was particularly important to avoid imparting further momentumto demands for excessive wage increases and the Government werecontinuously endeavouring to moderate the demands of bodies ofmore lowly-paid workers, e.g. teachers, large numbers of whom were receiving annual salaries which amounted to no more in totalthan the increases now proposed for High Court judges.On the other hand it was argued that salaries of the higher judiciary had not kept pace with other salaries over a long period;and it was impossible to maintain that the increases now proposed were not justified on merit and in equity.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itcould perhaps be agreed in principle that the salaries of the higher judiciary should be increased to the levels proposed by the Lord
Chancellor. Nevertheless, it was inopportune to make these increases effective at the present juncture; and the degreeof retrospection to be conceded would also require furtherconsideration. In accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decision on theprevious item the Lord Chancellor would be holding discussions withrepresentatives of the higher judiciary with the aim of persuadingthem, if possible, that their salaries should in future be subject to review by a panel of the Commission for Industry and Manpower;and the Cabinet might usefully give further consideration to theproposed salary increases when the outcome of these discussions was known. If the higher judiciary were prepared to accept that their salaries should henceforward be subject to review by the commission for Industry and Manpower, an announcement of this new arrange-ment at the same time as that of the salary increases might contributesignificantly to mitigating opposition to the latter.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (C (70) 8), the Secretary of State for Scotland(C(70) 10) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C (70) 9), on there organisation of the National Health Service (NHS).The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that the green paper, &quot; Administrative Structure of Medical and Allied Services inEngland and Wales &quot;, published in July 1968, had proposed that thehospital service, the general practitioner and dental services and thelocal authority health services should be integrated in a single service,which it was suggested might be administered by 40-50 area Boards.The possibility had been kept open that these Boards might in fact be reorganised local authorities. The proposal for an integratedservice had been generally welcomed; but the administrative structure proposed had been criticised on the grounds that the boards would be too remote. As a result of further discussion in the ministerial Committee on Social Services and consultations withthe local authority Associations and the professional interests concerned, he had evolved proposals for a different administrative structure, for which he sought the Cabinefs endorsement. decisions on the structure of the NHS were closely related to the decisions onthe reorganisation of local government and on the organisation ofthe personal social services which the Cabinet were in the course ofReorganisationof theNationalHealthService(previous reference:CC(68) 35thConclusions,Minute 4)
taking; and he proposed to publish his revised proposals in a green paper as soon as possible after the appearance of the White Paper on local Government in England.There were two points on which in his opinion the government must now announce firm decisions. The first was that the reorganised Health Service would not come under local authoritycontrol, as the Royal Commission on Local Government in england had envisaged. Had this course been practicable, it would have greatly simplified the problem of ensuring co-operation between themedical and social work services, as well as injecting a welcomeelement of local democracy into the arrangements. But the ministerial Committee were unanimous that it was ruled out by considerations of financial accountability and by the opposition ofthe medical profession. The second point on which a firm decision was needed was the precise division of functions between the reorganised Health Service under Government control and the social work and other services which would remain with local authorities.The division which he proposed, which was set out in detail to annex 2 to C (70) 8, was based on the principle that, where themedical element predominated, responsibility should rest with the nhs and, where social works skills were primarily needed,responsibility should rest with the local authorities. There were,however, some fields, particularly the care of the mentally handicapped, where responsibilities overlapped and concurrentpowers would be necessary. Here, too, his proposals had the unanimous approval of the Ministerial Committee, except that theSecretary of State for Education and Science had certain reservationsin relation to the care of children under five.Given that an integrated Health Service could not be brought under local authority control, it remained to consider how it could best be organised. The conclusion he had reached was that, in orderto facilitate co-operation with the local authority services, the health service should be administered by about 90 area health authorities,whose areas should be identical with those of the unitary authoritiesand metropolitan districts which would emerge from there organisation of local government. These area health authorities would be directly responsible to the Secretary of State and would operate within budgets fixed by him. There would also be regional health councils, who would have no executive function but wouldbe concerned with planning, hospital and specialist services, post-graduate education and other activities which required to be organised over wider areas. In most areas health authorities woulddevolve much of the day-to-day management to district sub-
committees with substantial local representation. This generalstructure had the unanimous approval of the Ministerial Committeeand was recognised as being a substantial improvement on earlier proposals. But differences of opinion persisted on the composition of the area health authorities.In discussion there was general agreement that in presentcircumstances it was not practicable to bring the NHS under localgovernment control and that the division of functions between that service and local authority services should be as proposed in annex 2 to C (70) 8. On both points the Green Paper should state firm decision, on the understanding that the question whether care of the under-fives should rest with the social service departments oflocal authorities or with their education departments could beconsidered subsequently. There was also general support for theproposal that the NHS should be administered by area health authorities, on the basis of areas coterminous with those proposed for unitary authorities and metropolitan districts. The composition of the proposed health authorities was reserved for subsequent consideration; but it was suggested that a possible way of reconciling the conflict between the managerial and representative functions ofthe authorities might be to distinguish an executive element within each authority, which might perhaps have a special responsibility forframing the authority&apos;s budget. Special arrangements were in anycase likely to be needed in Wales.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th January, 1970.
