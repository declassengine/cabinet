UnitedKingdomApplication forMembershipof the EECDraft white paper(previous reference :CC (70) 5thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 6 (70)SECRET*1. The Cabinet considered notes by the Secretary of the Cabinetcovering a draft White Paper on United Kingdom application for membership of the European Economic Community (C (70) 17) andrevisions of paragraphs 101 to 103 and 107 and 108 of that draft(C (70) 19).In discussion the following amendments were agreed:(a) Paragraph 55. To read as follows:&quot; It has also been argued that the requirements toharmonise the systems of indirect taxation of the member states would affect the cost of living here. It is not possible however to make any quantitative assessment of the effect in the UnitedKingdom, not least because the e.c. have not settled on acommon system of rates and coverage of value added tax.&quot;(b) Paragraph 101 as revised in C (70) 19.Line 10. Substitute &quot; the cost ignoring the dynamic benefits is likely to lie &quot; for &quot; any resulting overall estimate must thereforelie &quot;.Line 11. Substitute &quot; the &quot; for &quot; this &quot; at the end of the line.(c) Paragraph 102 as revised in C (70) 19.Line 7.  Substitute &quot; expected &quot; for &quot; anticipated &quot;.Line 13.

End the paragraph at &quot; Communities &quot; anddelete the half-sentence beginning &quot; the course of events . . .&quot;.(e) Paragraph 108 as revised in C (70) 19.Begin the paragraph with a new sentence:&quot; This White Paper demonstrates the need for negotiations to determine the conditions on which the opportunity for entrycould be seized.&quot;Line 1. Insert &quot; these &quot; before &quot; negotiations &quot; and delete &quot; for entry &quot;.Delete the final sentence of the paragraph.In further discussion it was the general view that the white paper should be presented to Parliament by the Prime Ministeralone, since it would be difficult to set a limit to the number ofMinisters who might suitably be associated with him in the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
presentation. The form of the statement to be made by the PrimeMinister to the House of Commons about the White Paper was also discussed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper as amended. In the lightof views expressed he would present it to Parliament. He would arrange for its publication on Tuesday, 10th February. As agreed at their previous meeting he had discussed the presentation of theWhite Paper on television with the Director-General of the BBC,who had agreed that it should be factual and educational and aim to avoid political controversy. If the Director-General of theIndependent Television Authority, whom he had not yet been ableto see, was of the same mind, he hoped that it would be possible toavoid the need for Ministers to take part in the presentation of theWhite Paper. He would take account of the points made in thediscussion of the form and content of his statement to the House andwould circulate a text which should, if at all possible, be clearedwithout a further meeting. The general view at present seemed infavour of a debate in the House of Commons on 25th-26th Februaryon a Motion to take note of the White Paper.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Approved the publication of the White Paper as amended in their discussion on that day and on 3rd February.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would(a) arrange for publication of the White Paper on tuesday, 10th February;(b) circulate to the Cabinet the text of his proposed statement on 10th February to the House ofCommons.ParliamentaryAffairsPrince ofWalesFutureBusinessCONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet were informed that His Royal Highness the prince of Wales would take his seat in the House of Lords on11th February.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. They noted that aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill to amend the law on abortion was likely tobe debated on 13th February. It would be most unfortunate if this bill were enacted. The Abortion Act, 1967 had been in force forless than two years and it was important, in the interests of the
The BudgetPrivateMembers&apos;Billsefficient administration of the National Health Service, that it shouldbe left unchanged for a reasonable period. It was agreed that aGovernment spokesman should make this clear in the debate; butit was recognised that, bearing in mind the deep convictions whichwere held on the subject of abortion, it should be left to Parliamentto decide on a free vote whether to give the Bill a Second Reading.The Cabinet noted that Parliament would be informed later in the day that the Chancellor proposed to introduce his Budget on tuesday, 14th April.It was agreed that in view of the widespread public support for its objectives, Government time should be provided for a debate in the House of Commons on the Second Reading of the DeerHunting and Hare Coursing Bill. It was the general view, however,that similar facilities should not be provided for the SundayEntertainments Bill which, though generally popular, especiallyamong young people, aroused intense opposition from certain sections of the community, notably in Wales.The Cabinet were informed that the shortage of currentbusiness in the House of Lords, for which delays in givinginstructions to Parliamentary draftsmen appeared to be mainly responsible, was giving rise to serious concern.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President of the Council to circulate amemorandum, for their consideration at an early meeting,on the progress of the current legislative programme.OverseaAffairsFrance:Visit of theFrenchMinisterfor ForeignAffairsSECRET3. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit of the French Minister for Foreign Affairs, M. Schumann, on22nd-23rd January, had been rewarding. The atmosphere in whichit had taken place was significant of the improvement in Anglo-French relations over the past year. In regard to european co-operation, M. Schumann had appeared confident that theEuropean Economic Community would achieve their target dateof 1st July, 1970, for the completion of their discussions on the admission of the United Kingdom to the Community; and that france would return to playing a full part in the Western european union (WEU). On the Middle East, there had been discussion ofthe French proposal that the Four Powers (United Kingdom, UnitedStates, France and the Soviet Union) should put forward a list of
LesothoSouth Africa(previous reference :CC (69) 47thConclusions,Minute 2)the points on which they had so far reached agreement as a basis for a renewed intervention by the Special Representative of theUnited Nations Secretary-General, Dr. Jarring. The difficulty from our point of view was that such a list would favour Soviet ratherthan United States views; and we did not wish to give the impression that we were attempting to erode the United States position, which already represented considerable concessions as compared with their earlier attitude. On Nigeria, both parties had agreed that the rebellion had underlined the necessity for more consultation betweenEuropean Powers on African affairs; and the need for this mightbe an incentive to France to renew her participation in the WEU.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the PrimeMinister of Lesotho, Chief Jonathan, had called off the elections andsuspended the Constitution, ostensibly because the Opposition hadallegedly threatened his life, but more probably because he fearedthe result of the elections would go against him. Chief Jonathanhad been more forthcoming than his opponents about co-operating with progressive opinion in South Africa. While this might colourthe attitude of the South Africans, it did not appear to have beena major issue in the election, in which his opponents had exploitedthe general lack of progress since independence. Chief Jonathanappeared to remain in control of the country: but his position hadbeen weakened by the fact that he had retained power by means ofwhat was in effect a coup d&apos;etat. The question of recognitionfaced us with difficult problems. Although Chief Jonathan^Administration was in effective control, thus satisfying at least oneof the accepted criteria for recognition, we should if we recognisedit be criticised for supporting an unconstitutional Government. Ifwe failed to recognise Chief Jonathan^ Administration, we mightbe accused of partiality in favour of the Opposition and of stirring upsedition. Efforts were being made to induce the President ofBotswana, Sir Seretse Khama, to persuade Chief Jonathan to invitethe Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr. Arnold Smith, to visitLesotho and mediate between Chief Jonathan and his opponents.The outcome of this was not yet known.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the SouthAfrican Ambassador had called on him to present an aide-memoirecomplaining of our refusal to supply the South African Governmentwith Wasp helicopters. The aide-memoire alleged that this was inconsistent with the agreements reached in 1965. The aide-memoire,taking up a statement made by a South African government spokesman, also cast doubt on British support for the simonstown agreement. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had told the South African Ambassador that he could not accept the allegations in regard to Simonstown. In regard to the Wasphelicopters the Ambassador would receive a considered reply later.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that hiscolleagues would be aware that the Soviet Prime Minister,Mr. Kosygin, had addressed messages to the President of the UnitedStates, Mr. Nixon, the French Prime Minister, M. Pompidou, andto the Prime Minister in similar terms expressing concern at therecent breaches of the cease-fire between Israel and the Arab States;blaming the United States and to a lesser extent the UnitedKingdom for failing to urge restraint on Israel; and implying thatif Israel continued in her present courses, the Soviet Union mightbe obliged to supply the Arab States with the means of retaliation.In his reply, the President had rejected the suggestion that the blame for breaches of the cease-fire lay all on one side and that the UnitedStates had encouraged Israel to violate the cease-fire; he had also expressed regret at the implied threat that the Soviet Union would increase arms supplies to the Arabs and had reaffirmed the UnitedStates&apos; willingness to discuss the limitation of arms supplies to theMiddle East. At the same time, President Nixon had made it clearthat the United States would not hesitate to supply arms to friendlyStates should the need arise. On receiving Mr. Kosygin&apos;s message,we had made the following points, orally, to the Soviet Ambassador.We deplored the breaches of the cease-fire, for which the blame didnot attach exclusively to one country. The threats of all-out waruttered by President Nasser of the United Arab Republic were unlikely to encourage Israel to adopt a policy of restraint; andfurther supplies of arms to the Middle East were likely to precipitatethe kind of situation which we and the Soviet Union were concerned to avoid. The Prime Ministers written reply, which would be despatched that day, would in general take a similar line to that adopted by President Nixon. It would also emphasise that theBritish Government had always supported a general limitation on supplies of arms to the Middle East; and enquire whether the SovietGovernment would be prepared to co-operate with us to that end.The Prime Minister said that in his discussions with PresidentNixon in Washington it had become clear that, although the UnitedStates Administration wished, if this were possible, to make a successof the Four Power talks, they considered that so far all the concessions had come from them. They were therefore unlikely tomove from the position they had taken up; and President Nixon&apos;sstatement that the United States Government were ready to supplyarms to friendly nations if the situation demanded was evidence ofthe firmness of their intentions. For the reasons mentioned earlierby the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, the United states were unenthusiastic about the French proposal for guidance to dr. Jarring based on those points on which the Four Powers were
already agreed. He had discussed with President Nixon, on thelines agreed with his colleagues before the visit, whether, byproposing new language for the proposed guidance to Dr. Jarringor in any other way, we could improve the chances of successfulnegotiation on the basis of the United States plan. It had been clear that, while the United States would not necessarily object toa reformulation of the guidance to Dr. Jarring, they would opposeany further concessions to the Arabs.Visit of the The Prime Minister said that the visit had been a successfulPrime Minister Qne   ft had received an excenent press in both Britain and theand theForeign and United States; and the general atmosphere had been greatly helpedCommonwealth by the increase in confidence in Britain&apos;s economic and financialWashington prospects which he had been able to allude to in his speech in new york to the Foundation on Automation and Employment. TheUnited States Administration clearly set considerable store by theadvice and information which British Ministers and Britishdiplomatic representatives abroad could give them; and the invitationwhich he and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary hadreceived to attend a meeting of the National Security Council in washington was evidence of this.Turning to specific points (other than the Middle East) whichhad been discussed during the visit, the Prime Minister said that hehad been impressed and reassured by President Nixon&apos;s evidentdetermination to persist in his policy of Vietnamisation, leading upto ultimate United States withdrawal. So far as economic affairs were concerned, he had thought it better to refrain from any detailedpublic comment which might have been misinterpreted. However,the United States Administration were clearly determined to prevent a recession and were relying on reductions in public expenditurerather than monetary policy in order to moderate the inflationarytendencies in the United States economy.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had discussed European security with the United States Secretary ofState, Mr. Rogers. In general, the United States were more cautiousin their approach than we were, possibly because they were not under the same pressure from public opinion. They had, however,agreed that it would be wrong to allow the Soviet Government to gain the propaganda advantages which might derive from proposing a European Security Conference; and had appreciated the importanceof ensuring that such a conference, if held, addressed itself to mattersof substance and was not allowed to become a propaganda platformfor the Soviet bloc. They also expressed interest in the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s idea of a Standing Commission on european Security. In the course of discussion, the United states secretary of State had referred to the difficulties the United States
were experiencing over their agreements with Spain on the use of bases in that country. Mr. Rogers had suggested that there mightbe advantage in trying to put these arrangements on a North atlantic treaty Organisation basis. The Foreign and commonwealth secretary had warned him that this could give rise to serious difficulties for us and probably other European countries.In a brief discussion, there was general agreement that the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary were to becongratulated on a highly successful visit.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th February, 1970.
