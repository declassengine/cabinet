ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessCONFIDENTIAL1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.OverseaAffairsVisit of theChancellor ofthe federal republic ofGermanyAustriaRhodesiaSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the visit of the Chancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany,Herr Willy Brandt, had been very successful. It had been clearthat Herr Brandt envisaged that negotiations for British entry intothe European Economic Community (e.c.) would open in July ofthis year. In discussion during the meetings on political unificationwithin the framework of the e.c., Herr Brandt had taken a sensibleand helpful line. There had been useful discussions on european defence, and these would be continued when the German defence minister, Herr Helmut Schmidt, visited London shortly. Meanwhile,it was satisfactory that negotiations with the Germans had beencompleted in time to enable our decision to return 6 Brigade toGermany to be conveyed to Herr Brandt and announced in theHouse of Commons during the visit.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theAustrian Socialist Party had achieved a small majority in the recentgeneral election. The outcome would probably be a &quot; GrandCoalition &quot; with the People&apos;s Party (Catholic); and the resultingGovernment was likely to be well disposed towards this country.These had been the first elections held since the lowering of the voting age in Austria to 19. This did not appear to have affected the outcome to any significant extent, though it was possible thatthe younger voters had been influenced by the prospect of a reductionin the length of military service under a Socialist-led Government.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, as hiscolleagues would be aware, he had made a statement in the Houseof Commons on 2nd March in connection with the purporteddeclaration of a &quot; republic &quot; by the regime in Rhodesia. With a viewto pre-empting action by the Afro-Asian bloc, the United kingdom permanent Representative at the United Nations, Lord Caradon,had requested a meeting of the Security Council and had tabled aResolution in moderate terms. The African representatives,however, were attempting to defer the holding of a Security council meeting; and the Secretary-General&apos;s decision was not yet known.Since the attitude of the United States Government was likely toexercise considerable influence on those friendly countries which still maintained consulates in Rhodesia, he intended once again to
Laos(previous reference:CC (70) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)GuatemalaItaly(previous reference:CC (70) 9thConclusions,Minute 2)stress to the United States Ambassador the importance which weattached to the termination of consular representation in Rhodesia.He did not intend to give any publicity to this approach and asked that his colleagues should not refer to it in public. If they werequestioned, they should say that the matter was still underconsideration and should, if necessary, emphasise that the fact thata country still had a consular representative in Rhodesia did not mean that it recognised or approved the illegal regime.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the PathetLao offensive had now slowed down. The Laotian Prime Minister,Prince Souvanna Phouma, had appealed to the Co-Chairmen of the geneva Commission; but it was unlikely that the Soviet union would agree to any effective action.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, since thenew President of Guatemala, General Arana, had not received an absolute majority as a result of the recent elections, the presentPresident was likely to remain in office until about July, when general Arana&apos;s election would have to be confirmed by Congress.The elections had been a disturbing factor from our point of view,since we had been making good progress with the outgoingGovernment in the delicate negotiations over Honduras. On theother hand the fact that the elections were now over would mean that there was less incentive for the parties to inflame public opinionon this subject or outbid each other.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the efforts of the outgoing Prime Minister, Signor Rumor, to form a Governmenthad now broken down; and President Saragat had now asked thepresent Foreign Minister, Signor Moro, to conduct soundings witha view to the formation of a new Administration.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.reorganisation of LocalGovernmentand the health service in Wales(previous reference:CC (69) 46thConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Wales on local government reorganisation in Wales and monmouthshire (C (70) 35) and the reorganisation of the health service in Wales (C (70) 32).The Secretary of State for Wales said that the draft white paper attached to C (70) 35 set out revised proposals forthe reorganisation of local government in Glamorgan and monmouthshire.  These proposals were based on a comprehensive
confidential. The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thaton 26th February the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomeshad agreed that the Management Panel of the Burnham Committeeshould have authority to offer an increase of  85 overall from 1st April, 1970, on the understanding that this would be treatedas a payment on account in advance of the restructuring settlement.During the negotiations in the Burnham Committee earlier in the study of socio-economic conditions in the two counties and took account of the view expressed by the Royal Commissions on LocalGovernment in England and Scotland that the division between townand country ought to be ended for local government purposes. Thedraft White Paper incorporated amendments suggested by the ministerial Committee on Local Government Reorganisation, whichhad approved his proposals as a basis for consultation with thelocal authorities concerned. The draft Green Paper attached toC (70) 32 had been amended in the light of discussion in the ministerial Committee on Social Services. It followed closely theproposals in the Green Paper on the Future Structure of theNational Health Service in England; the only important difference was that, in view of the small number of area boards in Wales, itwas not proposed to have a regional health council there. Thedraft White and Green Papers dealt with related problems in Wales;and there would be advantage in publishing them together. he proposed that this should be done on 17th March, when he wouldmake a statement in Parliament about both documents.In discussion the point was made that it was proposed to publish a Green Paper on local government finance later in the year.Consideration would need to be given in that context to the questionof responsibility for the rating function in Wales.The Cabinet (1) Approved the drafts attached to C (70) 32 and C (70) 35,subject to any drafting amendments received by theSecretary of State for Wales in the course of the day.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Wales, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council and the minister without Portfolio, to arrange for the White paper on local government reorganisation in Wales and monmouthshire and the Green Paper on there organisation of the Health Service in Wales to bepublished on or about 17th March, 1970.
week he had been asked to meet both the Teachers&apos; Panel andthe Management Panel, who had reached complete deadlock. Itwas clear that the teachers would not agree to settle on the basisof the offer authorised by the Prices and Incomes Committee. Hehad accordingly consulted the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whohad agreed that the Management Panel should be authorised toincrease the size of the interim award on condition that the totalcost of the new arrangement in 1970-71 would not exceed 42 million and that the payment in April would be regarded as a payment on account in relation to the restructuring settlement whichwas to be subsequently negotiated. As a result, the burnham committee had reached provisional agreement on the basis of an interim increase of  120 a year as an advance payment of part ofa new settlement based on restructuring, which would be partiallyimplemented from 1st January, 1971, but substantially so in April1971 and would be staged if necessary into 1972-73. This agreement was subject to ratification by the teachers&apos; associations; and discussions would begin as quickly as possible on the review of therestructuring of teachers&apos; salaries based on 1969 salary levels.Meanwhile, the teachers&apos; associations had undertaken to call offtheir strike action; and it was expected that all schools would be working normally in the following week.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had reluctantlyaccepted the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals on three conditions.These were that the cost in 1970-71 would not exceed  42 million;that the increase resulting from the final settlement, including the initial payment on 1st April, 1970, would not exceed 15 per cent;and that the final settlement would remain in operation until3.1st March, 1972.In discussion it was argued that the restructuring of teachers&apos;salaries should be carried out by the National Board for Prices and incomes rather than in the Burnham Committee. The general view,however, was that it would be unwise to seek to modify theagreement which had been provisionally reached after very great difficulties in the Burnham Committee. In further discussion it wassuggested that the agreement reached in the Burnham Committeewould seriously complicate the negotiations with the scottish teachers, whose attitude would undoubtedly be more militant as aresult of the increases which their counterparts in England had secured through strike action. When negotiations were resumed onthe following day, the Scottish teachers could be expected to press for an increase well above the 15 per cent which the managementside were authorised to offer.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted the terms of the settlement which had been reached in the Burnham Committee and the conditions on which the
Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for education and Science had given the Governments agreement to it. It was important to ensure that no misunderstanding about these conditionscould arise, now or in the future, with the teachers or theirrepresentatives. The Secretary of State for Education and Scienceshould accordingly circulate a note setting out the conditions onwhich he had given his agreement to the settlement reached in the burnham Committee and the manner in which these had been made known to the teachers&apos; representatives. He should also provide theSecretary of State for Scotland with any information which would help him to resist attempts by the Scottish teachers to use theagreement reached in the Burnham Committee as an excuse for increasing their own demands.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science (i) to circulate a note to members of the Cabinet aboutthe settlement reached in the Burnham Committeeon the lines indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up; and(ii) to provide the Secretary of State for Scotland withthe information referred to in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that on theprevious day the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes (PI)had considered a pay claim by hospital pharmacists in the national health Service (NHS) and had decided, against the advice of his representative, that the Governments offer should be limited to animmediate increase of 16 per cent, with no authority to concede18 per cent if this appeared to be necessary in order to secure asettlement. The Cabinet should be aware that this offer was unlikely to be accepted and that, in that event, the essential servicesperformed by the pharmacists might be withdrawn, with very serious effects on the NHS as a whole. It was for consideration, therefore,whether the Committee&apos;s decision should be modified.In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that it lay with theChairman of a Committee to invite the Prime Minister to considerwhether an appeal to the Cabinet against the Committee&apos;s decisions could be allowed and that, in so doing, the Chairman would tend tobe guided in the normal way by the general consensus emerging fromdiscusion among the members of the Committee who were directly concerned rather than by a mere numerical majority of the Ministers
who happened to be present on any particular occasion. Thediscussion in the PI Committee had been conducted on this basis;and it was important that a Committee dealing with such complex and interrelated issues should be seen to act with authority andconviction in discharging its essential task of maintaining theconsistency of Government policy. Although the right of any minister to appeal to the Cabinet must remain unimpaired, thisshould not become a means of seeking a reversal of a Committee&apos;scollective decision which happened to be not wholly compatible with individual Departmental interests.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that hewould consider whether further guidance should be provided to the chairmen of Cabinet Committees on these issues. Meanwhile, theSecretary of State for Social Services should proceed to offer a pay increase on the basis approved by the PI Committee and, if thatoffer were rejected, should seek further guidance from theCommittee, endeavouring to avoid a breakdown in the negotiationswhile he did so. He should also take such emergency measures as he might judge necessary against an interruption of the services provided by the pharmacists.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to be guided by the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion in his further negotiation of the hospitalpharmacists&apos; pay claim.commission for Industryand Manpower(previous reference:CC (70) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)Procedure ofthe CIMSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Employment and productivity (C (70) 38) about the proposed Commission for Industryand Manpower (CIM).The First Secretary of State said that she had now completeddiscussion with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and theTrades Union Congress (TUC). The reactions of both had beenalong the lines expected. She invited the Cabinet to consider certain changes which would go some way towards meeting the fearsexpressed and certain other points which had arisen in thepreparation of the Bill.The First Secretary said that the CBI were concerned that theprocedure of the CIM might not give sufficient protection to those under examination. To include detailed provisions in thelegislation would be difficult and might lead to legal disputes aboutwhether the procedure had been complied with.   She hoped,
however, to reach agreement with the CIM that the latter would inform the firms concerned of the issues with which they intended todeal in their consideration of the reference, thereby giving the firmsadequate opportunity to set out their case. If the CIM concluded that a firm&apos;s conduct had adverse effects on the public interest, theywould so inform the firm and give them a final, but limited,opportunity of rebutting the conclusion.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed with the proposals by the First Secretary.Coupled with her revised proposals for defining more closely in theBill the scope of references to the Commission, they should go a longway to meet the fears of the CBI. It was important, however, thatthe opportunity to provide additional evidence to rebut the adversefinding should not be allowed to reopen and unduly prolong theenquiry.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals in paragraph 7 of C (70) 38.The First Secretary of State said that the CBI feared that the extensive powers to be continued by the Bill might be invokedfollowing less considered and exhaustive enquiries than those by the monopolies Commission; in particular they were afraid that theproposed price control powers might be far more freely used than under the existing monopolies legislation. The proposals alreadyincluded a new safeguard under which the price control power could be used only where the CIM found that the firm was in effectabusing its market power. It might be appropriate, however, toprovide also that, where a reference was confined to whether a specific price increase was justified, the only power v/hich couldsubsequently be exercised would be that of price control within aperiod of 18 months following receipt of the report. The full powers would remain available in respect of other types of reference.The Cabinet (2) Endorsed the proposals in paragraph 8 of C (70) 38.The First Secretary of State said that the Cabinet had agreedpreviously that, while enquiries might be held by panels, reports should be made by the Commission as a whole; unanimity wouldnot be required, but those powers affecting the basic structure ofan industry should not be invoked unless two-thirds of the membersof the Commission subscribed to the relevant findings. The CBIdid not raise this point. Moreover, the two-thirds majority was now only required where a reference was dealt with by a panel of
the Monopolies Commission. As the reports would in future bemade by the Commission as a whole, there appeared to be no need to apply the rule to the CIM. However, if the point were pressedduring passage of the Bill through Parliament, the possibility mightbe considered of providing that the powers to require disinvestmentand to prohibit new acquisitions could not be exercised if a third ofthe Commission dissented from the conclusions of the report.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that the two-thirdsrule was a necessary safeguard in view of the extended field inwhich the powers would in future apply, and that lack of such aprovision might make passage of the Bill through Parliament moredifficult. On the other hand, it was argued that the powers in thenew Bill would be more limited than those in the existing monopolieslegislation, while the requirement that the Commission as a wholeshould submit the report would ensure consistency between the standards applied to particular references. In further discussionattention was drawn to the need for the Chairman to establish fromthe start that the full Commission would not go over the groundalready traversed by a panel.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet was that the two-thirds rule need notbe included in the Bill as presented to Parliament. The cabinet agreed, however, that, if there were pressure for its inclusion duringthe passage of the Bill, they would reconsider the matter.The Cabinet (3) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of thediscussion by the Prime Minister.(4) Agreed that the two-thirds rule should not be included inthe Bill as presented to Parliament.(5) Invited the First Secretary to report to the Cabinet if therewere pressure for the provision to be included during thepassage of the Bill.The First Secretary of State said that both the CBI and TUCdisliked the concept that the CIM should be required, by meansof a &quot; general consideration &quot; order, to have regard to the prices and incomes policy of the time as expressed in the current white paper. On the other hand the National Board for Prices and incomes had pressed her strongly to retain such a provision,arguing that, if the Government were seeking to implement anincomes policy, the Commission must work within that frameworkand could not be left free to develop an alternative framework oftheir own. She accepted this argument. Dropping the provisionmight give the impression that the Government were finallyabandoning the attempt to maintain a prices and incomes policy inMatters towhich theCIM shouldhave regard
The First Secretary of State said that the TUC were opposedto the application to pay claims and settlements of reserve provisions for prior notification, though they accepted that such provisions should cpply to price increases and dividends. The obligationwould, however, fall on the employers and not on the trade unions.This reserve power formed an essential background to any attemptto influence the course of pay negotiations and price increases. Sherecommended that it be included in the legislation.In discussion it was argued that it would be inappropriate toapply a requirement to notify claims, etc., to the public services;penalties should not be applicable to Whitley Councils ordepartmental employers.notification of paysettlementthe years ahead. Moreover, if the provision were dropped, it wouldbe necessary to redraft the definition of the public interest currentlyembodied in section 14 of the Monopolies and Restrictive Practices(Inquiry and Control) Act, 1948 in order to ensure that it covered the objectives of the Governmenfs prices and incomes policy. the annex to her paper illustrated the difficulty of such redrafting.In discussion it was argued that re-enacting the provisionenabling the Prices and Incomes White Paper to be scheduled to theBill would provoke opposition on both sides of Parliament. Itwould also lead to pressure for the Government to seekParliamentary endorsement of new White Papers as they appeared.Moreover, it was inappropriate to require the Commission, whichwould be undertaking major long-term enquiries into industrial structure, to have regard to changing Government policies in relationto one particular aspect of company behaviour.In further discussion it was urged that, even if the white paper were not to be scheduled to the Bill, only the minimumamendments beyond those necessary to include services should bemade to the definition of public interest in Section 14 of the 1948Act. There were serious deficiencies in the redraft annexed toC (70) 38, particularly in sub-paragraphs (c), id) and (e).The Cabinet-(6) Agreed that no provision should be made in the forthcomingBill for &quot; general considerations &quot; Orders.(7) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate to the ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy a draftdefinition of the public interest revised on the lines indicated in the discussion.
LegalRequirementto provideinformationTop SalariesPanel(previous reference:CC (70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)ForeignTakeoversThe Cabinet-(8) Endorsed the proposal to include in the forthcoming Billreserve provisions to enable the Government to requireprior notification of pay claims and settlements, price increases and dividends.(9) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Lord privy seal to give further consideration to the applicability ofsuch provisions to the public services.The First Secretary of State said that the only legal requirementfalling on trade unions in the Bill would be to provide informationif the Commission required it in connection with a reference.This was a standard provision already incorporated in thelegislation on both monopolies and prices and incomes. It was clearly essential; and no distinction could be drawn between tradeunions on the one hand and firms and all other organisations on theother.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that provisions for requiring attendance and thesupply of information to the Commission should be included in thelegislation. Care would, however, need to be taken in drafting the relevant clauses of the Bill; and the Legislation Committee should pay particular attention to this when the Bill came before them.The Cabinet (10) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.(11) Agreed that provisions for requiring attendance and thesupply of information to the Commission should beincluded in the legislation.The Cabinet (12) Agreed to defer consideration of whether the judiciaryshould be included within the scope of the proposedPanel until they considered C (70) 37.The Prime Minister said that he understood that the first secretary, after consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer,was not now proposing to include in the Bill any new provision to control foreign takeovers. In the past the Cabinet had been advised that the existing powers were inadequate in certain respectsand could only be invoked where adverse effects relevant to theExchange Control Act were anticipated. Provision should be madein the Bill unless it were clear that the existing powers would enablethe Government to prevent any undesirable foreign takeover.
confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatBank Rate was being reduced that day from 8 per cent to 1\ per cent.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.SECRET*7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal about a recent claim for a substantial central pay increasecovering the great majority of non-industrial civil servants (C (70) 39).The Lord Privy Seal said that a majority of the Prices and incomes Committee had not been prepared to agree to the proposalswhich he had put before them for settling the recent claim by theNational Staff Side (NSS) for a central pay increase. His proposalfor an offer of an increase of up to 8 per cent from 1st April, 1970,which would broadly bring rates of pay into line with those outsidethe Civil Service, should be considered against the background ofthe procedure for settling the pay of non-industrial civil servants and of the actual settlements made in recent years. Rates of paywere determined at regular intervals by comparison with the mediansof rates being paid for similar jobs outside the Civil Service andIn discussion it was argued that the doubts about the adequacy of the powers under the Exchange Control Act which had given riseto concern in 1966 and 1967 had since been resolved. If anytakeover would be disadvantageous to the United Kingdom economy,it could be argued that there were longer-term disadvantages to thebalance of payments outweighing any short-term benefits; and theuse of the Exchange Control Act could be justified accordingly.The matter had been examined by the Attorney-General, inconsultation with the Treasury officials; and, on the basis of theTreasury view that in all cases likely to arise it would be possible tofind balance of payments justification for the use of those powers,the Attorney-General had concluded that the doubts expressed onthat score could be discounted.The Cabinet (13) Agreed that no provision for additional controls on foreigntakeovers should be included in the forthcoming Bill.
between these determinations there had been &quot; topping-up&quot;increases. It followed from this procedure that the pay of civilservants in normal times only reached a par with outside pay atthe time when a new settlement operated and thereafter laggedprogressively behind. But in recent years with the pay freeze andthe subsequent staging of pay settlements, Civil Service pay had remained continuously below the levels for comparable outside jobs.Moreover, the decision to stage recent Civil Service pay increasesinvolved a unilateral breach by the Official Side of the Civil service pay agreements. In the light of these developments and of therecent large pay increases agreed for others in both the public and private sectors, civil servants v/ere becoming increasingly dissatisfiedand militant. He fully recognised the importance of preserving the rule that 12 months should elapse between one pay settlement andthe next. For the great majority of the staff covered by the claimthis would rule out any operative date before 1st July, 1970.However, in view of the breaches of the rule which had recentlyoccurred in relation to the pay of teachers, nurses and particularly of Post Office employees, who had until recently an identical payhistory with the Civil Service, there would be the greatest difficultyin attempting to preserve it now in the Civil Service. It could, inany event, be argued that a payment now would be only on accountof a full settlement next year and was not therefore in breach ofthe 12 months&apos; rule. Over the coming months the co-operation ofthe Civil Service was required in order to introduce changes instructure and new methods of working and this co-operation wouldnot be achieved in the absence of a reasonable settlement. Theleaders of the Civil Service unions were already facing serious difficulties with the more militant of their membership who hadnot failed to notice that in recent months militancy had paidhandsomely. If a settlement could be reached quickly, and was inoperation before the coming union conferences, there was a good chance of settling at a reasonable level. The experience withteachers had shown that delay and unrealistic offers could in theend lead to a more expensive settlement as well as a worsening of relations. He therefore asked for agreement that he should beauthorised to make an offer of up to 8 per cent effective from 1st April, 1970. He would, of course, seek to secure a settlement for a smaller increase; and, in particular, he would aim to settlefor less for those whose pay was last brought into line by faircomparison on 1st January, 1969, than for those whose pay was soadjusted on 1st January, 1968. Such a settlement would be more easily reached if it were agreed that there should in future be a two-year instead of a three-year pay research cycle, and that thenext central pay settlement should take effect from 1st January,1971.
The Prime Minister said that there were some signs that a newspirit of militancy was developing in the Civil Service. As Ministerfor the Civil Service he endorsed the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s views onthe need to ensure that Civil Service pay did not fall too far out of line with the levels for comparable outside posts.In discussion it was strongly urged that the Government shouldnot themselves act in breach of the generally accepted 12 months&apos;rule. If they did so the consequences for pay in the private sectorwould be extremely serious. The rule was not simply a generalpoint of principle, but a matter of the greatest practical significance.The increases granted in recent pay settlements presented a veryserious problem of demand management. But if, in addition, thosewho had accepted more modest settlements towards the end of lastyear were now to demand immediate further increases to bring them into line with recent levels the problem of managing the economy would become well nigh impossible. Fortunately, despite somebreaches the 12 months&apos; rule had broadly survived. It would bemuch better for the Government to pay a larger increase say10 per cent from 1st July next than to breach the rule.On the other hand it was argued that repetition of the recentteachers&apos; pay dispute in the Civil Service would have the most damaging consequences. If the Civil Service unions were preparedto take industrial action on a wide front the Government would be compelled to reach an early settlement. The Governmenfscapitulation in such circumstances would be far more damagingthan a breach of the 12 months&apos; rule. It would not be possible,given the present mood of the unions and the approach of theirconferences, to postpone negotiations until May, and it wasunrealistic to expect that the operation of a settlement agreed nowcould be postponed until July.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should have authority tosettle the claim by the National Staff Side with an increase of notmore than 8 per cent with effect from 1st April, 1970. The lord privy Seal would aim to settle below this limit if he could.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided by the PrimeMinisters summing up in his negotiations with the national staff Side on a central pay increase.
Rabies(previous reference:CC (69) 58thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgriculture on rabies (C (70) 42).The Minister of Agriculture said that the case of rabies in adog at Newmarket had shown how little was known about thisdisease, which was spreading rapidly in Europe. After the casesat Camberley and Folkestone in the previous year the period ofquarantine had been extended from six months to eight; but therecent case had occurred almost nine months after the dog concerned had arrived in this country from Pakistan. He therefore recommended that there should be a high level inquiry into ourdefences against rabies, with broad terms of reference covering bothpolicy and administration; he suggested that Mr. RonaldWaterhouse, qc, would be a suitable chairman. It was also forconsideration whether pending the results of the inquiry, whichmight take seven or eight months, we should strengthen our defencesagainst the disease by banning the import of dogs, cats and othersusceptible animals from countries where rabies was endemic or by extending the period of quarantine, preferably to one year, or bycombining both these measures. A complete ban would probablybe generally endorsed; but would cause hardship to people serving abroad who had taken pets with them; it might encouragesmuggling; and it would also bring considerable commercialhardship to quarantine kennels. Extending the period of quarantine,on the other hand, would strain the capacity of the kennels; and theGovernment would be expected to pay the additional costs therebyincurred. Moreover, since the incubation period of the disease wasnot known with certainty, there was the risk that any period chosenwould prove insufficient. Whatever conclusions were reached hewould propose to announce in the House of Commons at an earlydate, probably in reply to a Written Question.In discussion there was general acceptance of the proposal foran inquiry. Some concern was expressed about the hardship whichthe proposed interim measures might cause to animal lovers serving abroad; but the general view was that the seriousness of thesituation warranted a complete ban on imports of susceptible animalsfrom countries where rabies was endemic, coupled with an extensionof the quarantine period for animals now in quarantine to 12 monthspending the results of the inquiry. It was argued, however, thatthere was no reason why the cost of extended quarantine should fallon public funds.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposal for a high level inquiry by acommittee which should include a doctor or virologist of nationalrepute.  They also agreed that, pending the results of the inquiry,
