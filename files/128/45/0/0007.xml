CC 7(70)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council on the legislative programme 1969-70(C (70) 22).The Lord President said that he had drawn attention earlier inthe Session to the fact that instructions for main programme Billswere not being given soon enough and that the best use was notbeing being made of drafting resources. Because Bills had beencoming forward slowly both Houses of Parliament had been short of legislative business. But there had been some improvementrecently; and there was a good prospect that the problemsmentioned when the Cabinet last discussed the matter would shortly be resolved. Progress on some Bills in Standing Committee hadbeen very slow; but here, too, some improvement could be expected.There was a reasonable chance that all the Bills in the main programme could be passed by the Summer Recess except for thosewhich were both long and late in coming forward. The industrial relations Bill came into this category; and so would the CivilAviation Bill, unless it could be shortened.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that it was hoped to publish the Bill to establish the Commission on Industry and manpower before the end of the month and to arrange for it toreceive its Second Reading early in March. It should be possibleto introduce the Industrial Relations Bill before Easter and toarrange the Second Reading debate shortly after the Recess. Ashort Bill on Civil Aviation could be ready in March.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that atthis point in the Parliamentary year Departments were normallyinvited to submit initial bids for places in the legislative programme for the following Session. At this stage this request must necessarily be based on the assumption that the new Session would begin inthe autumn and would run its full length. The situation was complicated on this occasion by the fact that the present parliament was bound to end by the spring of 1971. For this reason theCabinet had approved in November a list of Supplementary Billsagainst the possibility that the 1969-70 Session might be prolongedor a short 1970-71 Session introduced.  It would be helpful if the
Lord President of the Council would circulate a memorandum, forconsideration at an early meeting of the Cabinet, on the organisationof the legislative programme for the next Session and theinformation which Departments should be asked to supply at thisstage. Further consideration might also be given in due course tothe problem of recruiting additional Parliamentary draftsmen.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (70) 22.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to circulate amemorandum on the organisation of the legislative programme for the next Session.DefenceDraft white paper(previous reference :CC (70) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the defence secretary covering a draft of the Statement on Defence Estimates1970 (C (70) 16) in the form in which it had been approved by theDefence and Oversea Policy Committee.In a brief discussion, it was noted that certain amendments hadbeen agreed in correspondence between the Defence Secretary andthe Ministers concerned; and the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes had endorsed a form of words on Service pay whichwould be applicable in principle, regardless of the Cabinefssubsequent discussion on this subject. The draft as consequentlyamended was now acceptable to all Departments concerned.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Statement on Defence Estimates, amended as  reported  in  discussion,  should  be  published  on19th February.SECRETPrices and 4.  The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor of incomes thg Exchequer (C (70) 25) and the Secretary of State for Defence(C (70) 26) about Service pay; by the Secretary of State for Education(C (70) 23) about the pay of school-teachers in England and Wales;and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C (70) 29) to which was attached a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Social Servicesabout nurses&apos; pay.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes (PI) had met on the previous day to consider a number of pay claims in the public sector whichraised important issues in themselves and for the economy as a whole.The Committee had not taken any decisions.  First, the Committeehad agreed to the recommendations of the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI) on Service pay; but there was disagreementabout  the phasing  of  their  implementation.    In  total these recommendations involved an increase of 25 per cent in the presentcost of Service pay. The Defence Secretary proposed that 20 per centshould be given with effect from 1st April, 1970, and the remaining5 per cent a year later.  The First Secretary of State, on the otherhand, had proposed that a 16 per cent increase should take effect from 1st April, 1970, and that 9 per cent should be postponed untilthe following April.   Secondly, the Social Services Secretary hadbeen authorised by the Committee at the end of the previous yearto offer an increase of 24-5 per cent in nurses&apos; pay in a two-yearsettlement involving the payment of 16-2 per cent on 1st April, 1970,and the remaining 8-3 per cent on 1st April, 1971. He had reported,however, that he was unable to reach a settlement on this basis andhad proposed that he should be authorised to improve the offer onthe lines set out in the memorandum attached to C (70) 29. Third,the Secretary of State for Education and Science had suggested thatthe teachers in England and Wales should be offered a full pay settlement, involving a general restructuring of teachers&apos; pay and increases overall of perhaps 15 per cent, from October of the current year a year in which in the normal course of events the teacherswould be offered no increase at all. Fourth, an offer of a 10 per cent increase to Post Office employees had been rejected; the Post office board now wished to make an improved offer and the Minister of posts and Telecommunications had supported this request and had advised that a general Post Office strike was likely if the further increase were not authorised. The Lord Privy Seal had pointed outthat a settlement in the Post Office above the level of the presentoffer, particularly if it included Post Office clerks, would have considerable repercussions on pay in the Civil Service and localauthorities.   Meanwhile, in the private sector it was understoodthat employers might be prepared to settle with the seamen for anincrease of 20 per cent; and there were other very large pay increases under negotiation, for example, in the Ford motor company.   He recognised that the cases for the public sectorincreases were strong; but, if settlements on this scale were made,proper management of the economy would become impossible.The consequences of allowing settlements in the public and private sector at or around 20 per cent-which was the rate of increase
involved in the cases under consideration would be most serious.First, our competitive position in world markets would soon beeroded if claims on this scale were accepted and our present healthybalance of payments position would rapidly deteriorate. Second,the consequential price increases would be very substantial. the forecast rate of price increases in 1970 had recently been adjustedupward from 2f per cent to 4 per cent but would clearly rise much higher on the basis of pay settlements involving increases at the rateof 20 per cent. It would be essential to allow prices to rise to thefull extent of the cost increases resulting from higher wages in orderto manage domestic demand. Any attempt to restrain price riseswould lead to a much faster increase in personal consumption than could be afforded, at the expense of the balance of payments and of investment. These excessive wage settlements would also aggravate the Budgetary problem and could well lead to an increase inconsumer spending, especially if public fears of an inflation of pricesencouraged the recrudescence of the movement out of money intogoods which had been experienced for a short period in 1968. he must accordingly warn the Cabinet that, if they accepted all theproposals now put before them by the Departmental ministers concerned, there was a serious risk that further disinflationary measures might subsequently be required. In his view theGovernment should stand firm, in all the cases now before them, ontheir present wage offers and make it plain that they would offer no more. As far as Service pay was concerned he recommendedthat a 16 per cent increase should be given on 1st April next andthe remaining 9 per cent proposed by the NBPI in the followingApril.In discussion it was argued that, while the current level of wage settlements gave cause for serious anxiety, the country&apos;s economic problems should not be solved at the expense of public servantsespecially those whose pay was low in relation to rewards in theprivate sector. The pay settlements now under consideration forthe Services, the nurses and the teachers would not involve a directincrease in industrial costs nor, therefore, affect our competitive position. The Civil Service had noted that employees elsewherewere being paid for so-called productivity bargains which, in effect,often amounted to no more than an undertaking to co-operate withthe management, whereas the Civil Service Staff Side had co-operatedfor many years past and had achieved increases in productivitywithout special payments of this sort. The Government should not take up an inflexible stand in relation to these public sector claims,unless they were equally prepared to use their powers, albeit nowattenuated, in the private sector. Incomes policy was in disarraybecause the Government had not been ready, when they had thenecessary powers, to stand firm against damaging settlements.  The
Service Pay(previous reference :CC (69) 27thConclusions,Minute 3)present situation should be met by a flexible response on the part ofthe Government with the objective of obtaining individualsettlements involving the minimum damage to both incomes policyand to the economy.On the other hand it was argued that the excessive pay demands were now coming mainly from the public sector. The latter had notfared as badly as had been suggested over recent years. Since thebeginning of 1966 the average annual increase in the weekly wagerate and earnings indices had been 5 - 2 and 6 - 3 per cent respectively.If in the negotiations under consideration settlements were made atthe levels already authorised by the Government, the average annual increase in pay over the same period for nurses (6 -1 per cent),postmen (5-2 per cent), the Services (7-2 per cent), teachers(4-3 per cent) would be comparable with the general indices.While the difference between the offers already authorised by theGovernment and the increases now requested were not very large,they would be significant in relation to public expenditure and inrelation to the coming Budget. Moreover, there would be serious consequences if the public reached the conclusion that theGovernment were not prepared to resist wage demands howeverextravagant. The Government should take more positive action inpublicising the dangers of excessive wage settlements for all sectionsof the community.The Cabinet then turned to examine the claims individually.The following main points were made.The Defence Secretary said that with Cabinet authority he had given an undertaking that the new proposals for Service pay, basedon the Prices and Incomes Board&apos;s recommendation that a militarysalary should be introduced, would be brought into force this year.He had also stated that the new arrangements would result insubstantial pay increases, as compared with what would have been awarded under the Grigg formula. Any proposal to &quot; stage &quot; the increases to a more substantial extent than this paper envisagedwould be widely regarded in the Services as a departure from the government&apos;s earlier undertaking. The Board&apos;s proposals could fairly be presented as a 15 per cent pay increase accompanied by changes which would remove the long-standing and costly anomalyin Service pay structure whereby single men were paid less than therate for the job. He was prepared for the anomaly to be remediedin two stages, on 1st April, 1970, and 1st April, 1971; but anyfurther deferment of this process or any delay in implementing theremainder of the proposals in the Board&apos;s report would createserious injustices between individuals.    The Board&apos;s proposed
restructuring of Service pay arrangements, which had been widelywelcomed by Ministers, had to be regarded as a whole. An attemptto modify the proposals in order to reduce the cost of the first stage would introduce serious problems and would generate widespread and justified grievances. It would be indefensible to penalise theServices, whose pay arrangements had undergone the full rigour ofa scrutiny by the Board, ostensibly in order to bring them into line with limits on pay rises now being laid down for pay settlementselsewhere in the public sector, if, as was only too likely, itsubsequently proved expedient to increase those limits in face of the threat of industrial action, thus destroying the income criterion towhich the pay of the Services had in theory been aligned. The Chiefsof Staff were very concerned about the likely effect on morale of any failure to give effect to recommendations which had emerged frommachinery which the Government had itself devised; and they hadexercised their rarely-used right of direct access to the Prime Ministerto register their anxieties. The Services had suffered seriousshortfalls in recruitment in recent years; but the ill effects had beenmitigated by a satisfactory rate of re-engagement. Many Servicemenwould make their decisions on re-engagement in the light of theBoard&apos;s report and the Governments action on it. If Servicemengenerally concluded that the Government had acted less than fairlyto them, the consequences could be far-reaching. There was noBudgetary reason for any staging beyond what was envisaged inhis own paper, which was sufficient to keep the 1970-71 defence budget within the limits which Ministers had agreed.In discussion, there was general agreement that the changes proposed should be implemented in stages and completed by 1st April, 1971. Some Ministers, however, argued that changes onthe lines the Defence Secretary proposed would be represented bythe Press as an immediate increase not of 15 per cent but of20 per cent, since the increase in the pay of single men would beregarded, with some justice, as an integral part of the award.Acceptance by the Government of a 20 per cent settlement would weaken the position of private employers who were seeking to restrain wage demands to a lower figure. It would be perfectlydefensible, while accepting the Board&apos;s report, to limit the initialphase of the award to about 16 per cent, the remainder, about  per cent, following 12 months later. Against this it was argued that, while the &quot; staging &quot; proposed by the Defence Secretary couldbe explained on the grounds that it was necessary to keep theDefence Budget within the Governments public expenditure targets,staging on a more extensive scale could only be defended on incomes policy grounds and could not well be defended on these grounds if, as appeared possible, the nurses were to be offered a20 per cent increase.  It would also entail, as part of the price of
reducing some of the major internal anomalies which would otherwise result, retaining the special Northern Ireland allowancebeyond the present expiry date of 31st March, 1970.In further discussion it was suggested that some of the disadvantages of each of the courses of action before the cabinet could be mitigated if increases amounting to about 16 per cent were put into effect on 1st April, 1970, and the remainder of the increases recommended by the Board was introduced in two approximately equal instalments on 1st October, 1970, and 1st April, 1971.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet favoured an arrangement under which the increases recommended by the Prices and Incomes Board would, ifpossible, be introduced in three stages. The first, to come intoeffect on 1st April, would amount to an overall increase of 16 percent on the basis of one of the formulae, or a combination thereof,set out in paragraph 6 (ii) of C (70) 25. The remainder of theincrease could then be awarded in approximately equal instalmentson 1st October, 1970, and 1st April, 1971. The Cabinet recognisedthat, if such an arrangement were made, it would be necessary, inorder to mitigate anomalies, to extend to 31st March, 1971, thespecial Northern Ireland allowance introduced in October 1969.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Defence Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord privy seal, the most appropriate means of implementing anarrangement on the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that allthe increases in pay received by teachers in recent years had beenfully consistent with the Governments incomes policy. Teacherswere now in a very militant mood and were planning to arrangestrikes of indefinite duration in selected areas at half-term. Hecould detect no sign of weakening in their attitude towards their pay claim. There were, however, some indications of a weakeningin the attitude of the local authorities, which had hitherto maintaineda united front, and a growing tendency to try to put the blame forthe deadlock with the teachers at the Governments door. Theemployers were currently studying two alternative methods of improving their offer.  Under variant A, which he himself did not
find attractive, there would be an interim settlement of  85 from 1st April, 1970, and a full-scale new settlement, based onrestructuring, from 1st January, 1971. Under variant B there wouldbe no increase at all in April 1970; but the restructuring, whichwould be done in the Burnham Committee, would take effect on1st October, 1970. He proposed that he should be authorised to direct his representatives on the Management Panel of the burnham committee not to object, on grounds of total cost, to either of thesevariants if the local authorities wished to propose either or bothof them to the teachers. He had some reason to believe that the teachers might be attracted by one or other of the two variants.If they accepted either of them, the strikes would be called off; ifthey rejected them, the Governments position in relation to publicopinion would be greatly strengthened.In discussion it was argued that it was unrealistic to expect that the teachers would be willing to forgo an interim increase until october 1970. There was a real danger that they would accept theproposal to introduce restructuring on 1st October, 1970, and thenseek by renewed strike action to obtain an interim payment of  85or more on 1st April, 1970. It was suggested that the right course was to increase the offer now to  100, which the teachers were likely in any event to receive if they accepted arbitration, and atthe same time to announce that the NBPI was being asked toundertake a general review of the structure of teachers&apos; pay andthat the resulting increases would come into effect on 1st April, 1971.On the other hand it was argued that this would grealty increasethe cost of restructuring and that it would in any case be unacceptable to the teachers. It was also suggested that localauthorities should be encouraged to pay an interim increase of  85now even though the teachers had rejected it. This might help toreduce the teachers&apos; militancy; on the other hand they might simplyaccept the increase and continue striking.In further discussion it was argued that a comprehensive review of the structure of teachers&apos; pay, which was long overdue,could only be properly carried out by the NBPI. As against this it was argued that practical considerations, in the context of thecurrent negotiations, pointed in favour of the review being undertaken in the Burnham Committee.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the right course was to make it clear that theexisting offer still stood but that the Government would raise noobjection to the local authorities offering the proposal described asvariant B in C (70) 23, on the clear understanding that under thisproposal there could be no question of their agreeing to an interim increase on 1st April, 1970.
The Cabinet (3) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science tobe guided in relation to the negotiations on the teachers&apos;pay claim by the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.The Secretary of Stale for Social Services said that in December1969 PI had authorised him to offer the nurses a pay increase of24-5 per cent in a two-year settlement under which 16-2 per cent would be paid on 1st April, 1970, and a further 8-3 per cent12 months later. In the course of negotiations he had varied theterms of the offer, with the agreement of the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First Secretary of State, to provide first and second stages of 15-3 and 9-2 per cent respectively. This offer hadbeen decisively rejected, as he had warned the Committee to expect;and it was now clear that no settlement was possible within thelimits approved by PI. In his view the Government could not afford to allow the negotiations, which had been adjourned until17th February, to break down. He accordingly proposed that heshould be authorised to offer the nurses either an 18-monthssettlement under which 15-3 per cent would be payable on 1st April,1970, and a further 9-2 per cent six months later or, as he would prefer, a one-year increase of 20 per cent payable on 1st April, 1970.In discussion there was general agreement that, as PI had recognised, it was right to treat the nurses as a special case. a breakdown in negotiations, while not necessarily leading to strike action, would have serious political consequences and there wouldbe great advantage in reaching a quick settlement. Of the two alternatives put forward by the Social Services Secretary, the first was open to the objection that it would involve paying the whole24-5 per cent increase during the first year. Under the second alternative it would be necessary to negotiate a new agreement tocome into effect on 1st April, 1971; and preliminary discussions onthis might begin towards the end of 1970.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the nurses should be treated as a special case and that the offer to them should be improved by one or other ofthe two alternative methods suggested by the Social ServicesSecretary. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider withthe Social Services Secretary and the First Secretary of State whichmethod was preferable; and, if they were unable to reach agreement,they should bring the matter before Cabinet at their next meeting.
Post Office :pay negotiations(previous reference :CC (70) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the nurses should be offered either (a) an 18-months settlement under which 15-3 per cent would be payable on 1st April, 1970, and a further9-2 per cent six months later; or(/;) a one-year increase of 20 per cent payable on1st April, 1970.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider withthe Secretary of State for Social Services and the first secretary of State which of the two alternatives at (4)above was preferable and, if they were unable to reach agreement, to bring the matter before the Cabinet attheir next meeting.(6) Invited the Social Services Secretary, subject to (5) above,to improve the terms of the offer to the nurses by either(a) or (b) of (4) above.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that on 3rd February the Cabinet had agreed that the Post Office should beauthorised to make an offer to their non-engineering staff givingincreases which ranged from 7 to 12J,- per cent. The unions had rejected this offer; but the Post Office considered that they could reach a settlement in the very near future if they were authorisedto improve the terms of their offer by an amount which would increase the total wage bill for the staff affected by a further-7 per cent. This would cost about  5 million; and there was reason to believe that it might be possible to absorb the whole ofthe increase through extra productivity. A decision to stand firm on the present offer, however, would have serious consequences;it might well provoke an official strike and would do lasting damage to the efforts which the Post Office Board were making to establishgood relations with their staff from the outset. He accordingly proposed that the Post Office should be given the authority theysought.In discussion there was general agreement that the amount involved was too small to warrant running the risk of an officialstrike. If, however, the new offer were rejected, there could be noquestion of any further improvement. The Post Office should beasked to limit the increases to clerical staff as far as possible inorder to reduce the risk of repercussions, especially in the CivilService.The Cabinet (7) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications toauthorise the Post Office to improve their offer to their non-engineering staff by an amount which would increase
UpperClydeShipbuilders(previous reference :CC (69) 29thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the paymaster general and the Attorney-General (C (70) 27 and C (70) 28) onUpper Clyde Shipbuilders (UCS) and a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C (70) 24), to which was attached a copy of the Opinionof the Attorney-General and Mr. J. P. F. E. Warner on BeagleAircraft Limited.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to havea report from the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in the following week on his visit to UCS. They would also need to have as soon aspossible a revised estimate, which should take account of the attorney-General&apos;s advice and of the information secured as aresult of the Chief Secretary&apos;s visit, of the likely cost of the decision which had been taken, following discussion in the ministerial steering Committee on Economic Policy, to prevent the liquidation of UCS.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (70) 24 and C (70) 28.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Paymaster General and the Attorney-General (i) To arrange for such sums as were necessary toprevent the liquidation of UCS to be madeavailable to the company.(ii) To inform the Cabinet of the outcome of his visit to UCS, of the steps taken in compliance with (i)above, and of the extent and cost of any government liability to the company&apos;s creditors.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1970.the total wage bill of the staff in question by no morethan 1 - 7 per cent, on the understanding that, if this offerwere rejected, there could be no question of any further improvement.
