ParliamentaryAffairsShipbuildingIndustryVickersShip-repairingYard HebburnCC 22 (70)confidential.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Whitsun Recess. TheyFuture Business noteci that the House of Lords had arranged to sit until 21st May.The Cabinet agreed that in the debate on Cambodia, which wasto be held in the House of Lords later that day, the government spokesman should be guided by the line taken by the Prime minister in winding up the debate on the same subject in the House ofCommons on 5th May and that he should not make any referenceto the question whether the British Government should dissociateitself from the military action now being undertaken by the UnitedStates in Cambodia.confidential. The Minister of Technology said that he had informed the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on the previous day ofhis discussions with Vickers Limited about the proposed closure of theHebburn ship-repairing yard at the end of June. This would put1,200 men out of work in an area on Tyneside where maleunemployment was already over 7 per cent; and the Committee had accordingly authorised him to pursue his negotiations with thecompany. He had since seen the Chairman of Vickers, Sir LeslieRowan, and had strongly urged him to keep the yard open until its long-term prospects could be better assessed; and he had explainedthat the Ministry of Defence might be able to divert the refit of a fleettanker to the Hebburn yard. Though he had agreed to consider thematter further, Sir Leslie&apos;s reaction had not been helpful. He had emphasised that Vickers had invested  5 million in modernising the yard and that they could not afford to sustain continuing losses which had already amounted to  100,000 during this year. TheMinister of Technology said that it would be easier to judge thefuture of the Hebburn yard when the Shipbuilding and Ship-repairingCouncils report on ship-repairing became available later in the summer; and there was some prospect that in the course of the next12 months the Hebburn yard might be taken over for use in shipconstruction by two successful shipbuilding companies acting in association. It would cost about  20,000 a month to keep the yardopen until its future could be assessed in the light of these prospectivedevelopments; and in his view the use of public funds for this purposecould be justified on employment grounds. He asked for authorityto work out a scheme on these lines, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, with a view to an announcement being made intime to avert the issue of redundancy notices on the following day.In discussion it was pointed out that in this instance the problem was not one of shortage of finance; Vickers could make the money
available to keep the yard open if they wished. Moreover, it was not clear under what powers the Government could give assistance tothe Hebburn yard; and it seemed likely that legislation would be needed. The general view of the Cabinet, however, was that in viewof the implications for employment on Tyneside every effort shouldbe made to keep the yard open until its long-term prospects couldbe assessed. It was noted that the use of public funds for thispurpose would not involve any question of the Governmenfsassuming liability to the yard&apos;s creditors since the yard was an administrative division and not a subsidiary company of VickersLimited.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Technology and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to examine urgently the position of the Hebburnyard, with a view to preparing a scheme which wouldenable an early announcement to be made that the yardwould be kept open until its long-term prospects could be assessed.CONFIDENTIALSocial Services 3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on 21st April the supplementary Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy had approved inBenefit principle an increase of 7s. in the basic rate of supplementary benefit,to take effect on 1st October. Since then there has been some upwardrevision in forecast price movements; and, after consultation with theSecretary of State for Social Services, he considered that an increaseof 8s. would be appropriate and that, as on the last occasion whenthe rate was increased, it should take effect from 1st November. Itwas proposed that the Secretary of State for Social Services should announce this and lay the necessary Order on the following day.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.FutureLegislativeProgramme(previous reference :CC (70) 9thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (70) 61) on the future legislative programme.The Lord President said that the provisional programme set outin his memorandum had been broadly agreed by the ministerial committee on Future Legislation. It was based on the assumptionthat the next Session of Parliament would be of normal length; andit would require reconsideration if that proved not to be the case.The programme was arranged in his memorandum under the usual
headings; but he had thought it useful to divide the Bills in the main programme into three groups. The first of these contained Bills inthis Session&apos;s programme which might not reach the Statute Bookbefore the Summer Recess; the second consisted of other Bills onwhich policy was broadly agreed; and the third comprised other Billson which policy remained to be settled. The size of the first group would depend very much on when the Session ended; and, if it wereforeshortened, there would be a number of other Bills from thecurrent Session with claims for inclusion, leaving less scope for other legislation. Among the Bills for which he had felt unable to findroom in the main programme the strongest claim seemed to be thatof Pesticides, at present in the Second Reading Committee list. Thiswas a long Bill, estimated at 70 clauses; and it might overload theprogramme to include it unless some other substantial Bill was to be deleted.In discussion the following points were made (a) If the Session ended early, priority would need to be givennext Session to reintroducing Bills which were lost as a result.(b) There was considerable support for the inclusion of Pesticidesin the Main Programme. The likelihood of this legislation hadalready been mentioned; and it would be a particularly appropriatemeasure in Conservation Year. It now appeared that the Bill couldbe shortened substantially.(c) Wild Creatures and Forest Laws was needed to clarify thelaw prior to consolidation; it would be suitable for the SecondReading Committee procedure.(d) It would probably be essential to legislate to increase the size of the Civil Contingencies Fund.(e) Some adjustment would be needed in the list of Bills forScottish Grand Committee to accommodate a short Education(Scotland) Bill; this could be arranged between the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Lord President.(/) British Research and Development Corporation was important because of the large number of workers affected.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved in principle the programme set out in C (70) 61,subject to the points which had been made. The priorities would need to be kept under review in the light of developments.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
CONFIDENTIALProposed New 5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First SecretaryPower for the   Qf state and Secretary of State for Employment and ProductivityfetostrTaDd10&apos; (C (70) 57) and tne President of the Board 01 Trade (c (70) 62) aboutManpower Bill a proposal to include in the Commission for Industry and Manpowerto Control      (CIM) Bill a power to enable Ministers to control the level ofExpenditure on eXpenditUre on advertising and sales promotion.Advertising and sales . The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Industrial Policy (IPY) had considered here proposal that theCIM Bill should be amended to enable Ministers to control the levelof expenditure by companies on advertising and sales promotion,following a report by the Commission which found that levels ofsuch expenditure were excessively high and against the publicinterest. IPY were generally in favour of such an amendment butfelt that the political implications of seeking the additional power atthe present time should be considered by the Cabinet. At present there was no power to restrict expenditure in this field, even if theCommission found it was excessive. The Monopolies commission had suggested a 40 per cent reduction in sales promotion expenditurein their report on household detergents in 1966; but in the absenceof an appropriate power the Government had only been able to takeless satisfactory indirect action. Similarly, the reports of the national board for Prices and Incomes on confectionery and on cosmetics had shown that excessive selling costs were used as an alternative to pricecompetition. A research project which the Board of Trade were about to initiate would provide helpful guidance for the use of thepower; but it would be wrong to forgo the opportunity provided bythe CIM Bill to take powers the need for which had emerged as long ago as 1966. When the relevant clause had been reached in committee earlier in the week the point had been raised in discussion;and the Governments spokesman had made a non-committal reply.She now proposed to initiate consultations with the Confederation ofBritish Industry and the Trades Union Congress with a view totabling an amendment to the Bill at the Reports Stage.The Minister of State, Board of Trade, said that high advertisingand promotion expenditure could constitute a barrier to entry intoa particular product market and hence contribute to monopoly andoligopoly situations; it could also rise beyond the point at which itwas economically advantageous to the consumer. But not enoughwas known about the relation between sales promotion expenditure,sales and market power or about the interaction between various forms of sales promotion to assess the effect of any control. It waspossible that competition would be diverted into forms, e.g. enhancedretail margins, which would be even more undesirable. It would,indeed, be difficult to define the expenditure to which the proposed new power would relate.  Following the 1966 report on household
LondonTransportFares(previous reference:CC (70) 21stConclusions,Minute 6)CONFIDENTIAL 7CC 22 (70)detergents the then President of the Board of Trade had announcedthat he would institute an independent research study; this was about to get under way. Until its results were available the Governmentwould find it embarrassingly difficult to explain in the House how itwas intended to operate the proposed control. Moreover, theproposal would arouse suspicions that the Government envisaged amore comprehensive attack on advertising than was in fact intended.The advertising industry might then withdraw their co-operation which was essential to the success of the proposed research project.It would be preferable to allow that project to be completed, probably in the summer of 1972, before attempting to draw up realisticlegislative proposals.In discussion there was general agreement that the existence ofthe proposed power would be helpful in negotiations with firms in aposition of market power, even if it would rarely be directly invoked.The difficulty of defining and implementing the control and the riskof adverse reactions from the interests concerned would be reduced if it were made clear that the power related to sales promotion as awhole and not exclusively to advertising and that it could only be invoked where the CIM had found that expenditure was excessiveand against the public interest.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that the CIM Bill should be amendedon the lines proposed by the First Secretary of State provided thatthe new power was expressed as applying to sales promotiongenerally. She should now arrange, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, for an appropriate provision to be drafted; butthe Cabinet agreed that further consideration would need to be givento the timing of the necessary announcement and of any consultationwith outside interests. The Board of Trade research project might,however, proceed as planned.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of thediscussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theother Ministers concerned, to arrange for a provision toi   be drafted on the lines proposed.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (70) 63) about the decision of the Greater london council (GLC) to approve increases in fares on London buses and the underground railway.The Minister of Transport said that on 12 May the GLC had approved proposals for increases in London Transport Underground
and bus fares, including a Is. Od. minimum on the Underground in central London. The increases would add about 14 per cent to the fares revenue of the London Transport Executive (LTE) and wouldprobably come into force in mid-August. The GLC Opposition hadargued strongly that at least some of the extra cost should be carriedon the rates, in order to avoid hardship to the travelling public andto reduce the risk of diverting more traffic from public to privatetransport; but the majority Party had refused to contemplate such a subsidy. The Government could refer the increases in London faresto the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI); but the GLCwould be able to challenge in the courts any attempt to apply to these increases the statutory powers to impose a standstill under the termsof Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966. They appearedalready to be arousing expectations of an NBPI reference, no doubt in the hope of imputing to the Government some responsibility forthe fares increases. The proposed Is. Od. minimum could not reasonably be represented as an abuse of the change to decimal currency, since the LTE were retaining 6d. fares for buses and for the underground outside the central area. There was, indeed, apossibility that the NBPI, which in its last investigation of the subject in 1969 had stimulated consideration of a higher minimum farein the central area, would endorse the Is. Od. minimum. TheBoard might also be unable to recommend changes acceptable to the public in the rest of the LTE&apos;s proposals, which provided,for example, that 75 per cent of all bus fares in central and outerLondon would remain unaltered. The write-off of  250 million of the capital debts of the LTE&apos;s predecessor, when responsibilityfor London&apos;s transport system was being transferred to the glc, had given rise to considerable resentment elsewhere inthe country; and the Government should avoid any appearance ofover-sensitivity to the needs of the London travelling public, such as might be implied in a reference to the NBPI, especially since a broadcomparison of the percentage increases in fares in urban areas since1965 suggested that London was near the lower end of the range.An NBPI reference on urban area transport charges more generally would mean an investigation of the activities of the new passenger transport Authorities before they had an opportunity of fully takingstock of their responsibilities and would in general be undesirable.For all these reasons it might be preferable that no reference shouldbe made to the NBPI on the proposed London fares increases andthat the responsibility for introducing these increases should restclearly with the GLC.The Cabinet, after a brief discussion of the Minister of transports proposals, decided to resume consideration of thesubject at a subsequent meeting.
CC 22 (70)SECRETStarting date 7.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary offor the State for Social Services (C (70) 60) on the starting date for the earnings-related . ,   ,        . ,Pensions        earnings-related pensions scheme.Scheme The Secretary of State for Social Services said that the targetdate for the introduction of the earnings-related pensions schemewas April 1972. It had always been recognised that this would present a tight timetable; and there was increasing pressure fromthose concerned with occupational pension schemes for a year&apos;spostponement. These schemes would be faced with formidablefinancial, administrative and legal problems; and it was beingstrongly represented to him that the necessary work on theirmodification could not be completed in time for the earnings-relatedscheme to start by 1972. For these reasons, April 1972 could nolonger be considered a realistic target date; and, since the new scheme must start at the beginning of a tax year, he invited the Cabinet toagree that its introduction should be deferred until April 1973. the timing of an announcement of the deferment could be settled later;and it would be important in the interim to avoid any premature disclosure of this change.In discussion it was pointed out that a decision to defer theintroduction of the scheme would be liable to cause disappointment,especially among those responsible for public sector pension schemes,although the introduction of the Armed Forces&apos; pension scheme would not be affected. Moreover, the proposed deferment wouldinvolve postponing desirable reforms in the taxation system. Thegeneral view of the Cabinet, however, was that deferment was inevitable; and it was agreed that officials should be asked to carryout an urgent review of its implications, with particular reference tothe possible need for an increase in contributions to meet the cost of introducing the attendance allowance and improving widows&apos;pensions in April 1972.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the introduction of the earnings-related pensions scheme should be deferred until April 1973.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toarrange for officials to undertake an immediate review ofthe implications of this deferment, on the lines indicatedin the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14 May, 1970.
