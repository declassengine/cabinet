SECRETSouth-East Asia *1. The Cabinet considered the attitude to be adopted by theGovernment spokesmen in the Adjournment Debate which was totake place that afternoon under Standing Order No. 9 on the UnitedStates intervention in Cambodia.Cambodia(previous reference:CC (70) 19thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary recalled that, in answer to a Parliamentary Question by Sir Alec Douglas-Home, m p,on 1 May, he had expressed the view that an international conference should be called in order to resolve the problem of South-East asia and had referred to the unwillingness of the Soviet Government tojoin with us, as co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, inreactivating that gathering. He had refused to condemn the UnitedStates intervention in Cambodia and had, instead, stressed theimportance of negotiations. He had since summoned both the soviet ambassador and the United States Charge d&apos;Affaires and had giventhe former a message to the Soviet Foreign Minister, pressing himto agree that the Geneva Conference should be reconvened. the motion put down by Mr. Michael Foot mp and his supporters inconnection with the forthcoming debate was in part acceptable inthat it urged the need for diplomatic action to resolve the present crisis. But the Government could not endorse the other part of the motion, which expressly condemned the action of the United StatesGovernment. He proposed to speak immediately after Mr. Foot inorder that the subsequent debate might take place against the background of an authoritative statement of the Governments policy.He would seek to give a balanced appreciation of the way in whichthe present situation had evolved and to remind the House of somefacts to which the sponsors of the Motion were unlikely to givemuch prominence, for instance that the areas now being reoccupiedby the United States and South Vietnamese forces had effectivelybeen under North Vietnamese, not Cambodian, control for several years and that the main purpose of Prince Sihanouk&apos;s recent visit to Moscow, during the course of which he had been ousted frompower, had been to persuade the Soviet authorities to use their influence to reduce the scale of North Vietnamese activities inCambodia. It was significant that even the French Governmenthad been cautious in its comments on the latest United Statesaction, while the Federal German Government had noted withconcern that the force withdrawals initiated by the United states had not resulted in a reduction in the scale of military activities astatement which we could, if necessary, endorse.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET.11441-3 a 2
In discussion it was suggested that during the past 2 years theAdministrations of President Johnson and President Nixon had succeeded in building up a consensus in favour of the withdrawal ofUnited States forces, the Vietnamisation of the conflict and an eventual political settlement. This was a development which hadbeen in some degree due to the influence which we ourselveshad been able to exert. Now, however, it seemed as though theUnited States Government might be reluctant to accept the blow to their prestige which further large-scale withdrawals of troops would represent; and, although President Nixon had said that the incursioninto Cambodia and the related operations would be of limited scope and duration, the possibility could not be excluded that the UnitedStates had reversed their policy, had abandoned hope of a negotiated settlement and had reverted to seeking a solution by military means,including a resumption of the bombing of North Vietnam. If therehad in fact been such a reorientation in United States policy, it was based on a fundamental misconception of the situation. We couldnot afford merely to repeat our earlier statements or to maintainthe detached attitude appropriate to a co-Chairman of the geneva conference; and it was both our duty and in our interests asEuropeans and allies of the United States to warn the United StatesGovernment of the consequences of the change in their policy andto dissociate ourselves publicly from an action which could prove to be a disastrous error. If we adopted this attitude and spoke ourmind frankly and freely, we should strengthen, rather than weaken,the Atlantic Alliance.In further discussion it was agreed that any action which involved the extension of the war and the resumption of bombing of north Vietnam could only be regarded with apprehension; and, ifUnited States policy had in fact been readjusted in this direction,the consequences would be very serious. But so far it did notnecessarily follow from the latest United States action that PresidentNixon had in fact abandoned his long-term objectives of withdrawal,Vietnamisation and a political settlement; and it was equally arguable that the United States Government were genuinely envisaging alimited operation with the objective of protecting their ownwithdrawal and demonstrating to the Government of North Vietnamthat, if they persisted in their refusal to negotiate, they could not expect the United States to maintain their recent policy unchanged.If this analysis was correct, it would be both premature and unwise to condemn the United States action, though clearly we could notendorse it. Those who wished to condemn the United States were themselves vulnerable to the criticism that they had not condemnedthe long-standing and recently intensified violations of Laotian andCambodian neutrality by the Government of North Vietnam.Moreover, the United States were our allies; and, as Europeans,
we had an overriding interest in the maintenance of the atlantic alliance and of a United States presence in Europe. But, if we andother European Powers who were not militarily involved in Vietnam,were to condemn the United States Government outright, we shouldrisk provoking a reaction in the United States in favour ofisolationism, which would be very damaging to our interests in the longer term. Finally, opinion in the United States itself wasprofoundly divided on the Vietnam issue, which was imposing onthe internal political structure of the country a degree of stress whichmight strain it almost to breaking point. The situation wasaggravated by the fact that the latest intervention in Cambodia had raised complex constitutional issues, relating to the respective powersof the President as Commander-in-Chief and of the Senate as regardsthe declaration of war, which had become the subject of intensecontroversy in the United States. We must be particularly careful to avoid giving the impression that we were purporting in any wayto intervene in this domestic dispute; and this was a furthercompelling reason for our refraining from either condemning orendorsing the latest United States action.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in the lightof the discussion he would propose to remind the House, in his speech in the debate, that the Government had consistently taken the line that no military solution of the Vietnam war was possible.He would recall the series of initiatives which we had taken to help to achieve a negotiated peace; and he would emphasise theimportance of President Johnson&apos;s decision to abandon the bombing of North Vietnam and to work for a settlement in thenegotiations in Paris. He would need to point out, however, that,despite this decision and President Nixon&apos;s subsequent endorsement of a policy of progressive withdrawal of United States forces fromVietnam, there had been no corresponding response by theGovernment of North Vietnam and the other Communist elements inSouth-East Asia, either at the conference table in Paris or in thewar theatre in Vietnam. Apart from this, however, he would not seek to explain or to justify the United States incursion into Cambodia;and he would avoid expressing either approval or condemnationof their action. He would repeat the Governments endorsement of the declared United States policy of seeking to reduce the scale of the war and ultimately withdrawing from Vietnam; and, whileavoiding any direct judgment on the political and military wisdom of the latest United States action or any implication that webelieved that there had necessarily been any change in the basicstrategy of the United States Government for ending theirinvolvement in Indo-China, he would emphasise our extreme concernif there were any departure from that strategy. For this purpose he
would seek to place the Vietnam war in the perspective of the world situation as a whole and would emphasise the importance of UnitedStates policy in South-East Asia not merely in relation to the areaitself but also in terms of the contribution which a strong and healthyUnited States could make to the cause of the free world.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that inthe light of the differing points of view which had been expressed,it was essential that the Cabinet should take particular care to preserve the confidential nature of the discussion and should alsomaintain public unity on the very sensitive issues involved. Hewould himself wind up the debate later that day and would seek todo justice to all the main considerations which the Cabinet hadreviewed. He would stress the deep apprehension which was felt,not only in this country but throughout the world, about recent developments in Indo-China, which had potential implicationsextending far beyond South-East Asia itself. He would reiterate ourconsistent view that no solution to the Vietnam problem could beachieved by military means, a view which President Nixon himself had endorsed. It was for this reason that we had welcomed thecourageous change of policy which had taken place in the UnitedStates over the last two years and had deplored the lack of anyresponse from the other side. Recent developments, however,suggested that the United States Government might have embarked,possibly without fully realising that they had done so, on a newcourse which would involve them in extending the war once again and perhaps even resuming their bombing of North Vietnam(although the position on this point was not clear). this interpretation of the latest United States action, however, was notnecessarily correct; and we must hope that that action did not infact imply that the United States Government had now discountedall prospects of a political settlement and were once more pinningtheir faith on an illusory military victory. In these circumstancesour attitude should be one of detachment; and in this spirit he would propose to refer to the possibility of our promoting action by theUnited Nations, to our position as co-Chairman of the geneva conference and to our determination to play an active role in continuing to seek a negotiated solution through these or any other appropriate channels. He might also need to refer to the factthat United States public opinion was itself deeply divided on the issues involved and that we should avoid any appearance ofintervening in the current internal debate in the United States, inwhich major questions of domestic politics and, indeed, basicconstitutional problems were at stake. Finally, he would express the sympathy which was felt in this country for the United StatesPresident in the heavy responsibilities which he carried and themomentous decisions which he faced; and he would emphasise our
Situation inthe Ship-buildingIndustryCammellLairds(previous reference:CC(70) 19thConclusions,Minute 6)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the future ofthe Cammell Laird Group.The Paymaster General said that he had explored further thepossibility of a rescue operation on the lines which he had indicated at the Cabinets previous discussion. The Shipbuilding industry board had confirmed that they would not be prepared to take a50 per cent shareholding in the new company to which the Group&apos;sshipbuilding interests would be hived off. It remained an essential part of the scheme that this shareholding should be taken up bysome outside interest; but, while he was investigating other possibilities, he might have to invite the Cabinet, in the last resort,to agree that the Government should take this half share as theonly alternative to the liquidation of Cammell Lairds. In order toenable any arrangements to be completed it might be necessaryfor the Government to accept responsibility for keeping the yard inoperation for the next two years or so until the vessels currentlyunder construction for the shipowners co-operating in the rescueoperation had been completed. Following the recent announcement by the management that the firm would have to cease trading unlessassistance were forthcoming in the next few days, final decisionsmight well have to be reached that week.In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that, if theGovernment were to provide assistance for the shipbuilding company,it might be more appropriate for them to do so by themselves taking a shareholding than by guaranteeing continuance of the shipyard.On the other hand, this might merely increase the Governmentstotal liabilities.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to resume the discussion at their next meeting. In the meantime the paymaster general, in close consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury,should continue his negotiations about the future of the Group,though without entering into any commitments.hope that the policy of the United States Government would be guided by an awareness of the supreme importance of the strengthand unity of their country to the whole world.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Paymaster General, in consultation with the chief secretary, Treasury, to continue the discussions on thefuture of the Cammell Laird Group and to report the outcome at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5 May, 1970.
