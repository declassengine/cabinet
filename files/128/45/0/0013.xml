ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessWhitsunRecessPortsBill(previous reference:CC(69) 5thConclusions,Minute 5)Welsh LocalGovernmentReorganisation(previous reference:CC(70) 11thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President explained that it was proposed to take the whitsun Recess during the week beginning Monday, 25th May; ifthe state of business permitted two weeks to be taken, the Recesswould begin on Monday, 18th May.The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the slow progressof the Ports Bill in Committee, it was necessary to impose atimetable. The Opposition had been consulted through the usual channels; but it was obvious that the Motion would be bitterlyopposed. The best course seemed to be to take this after the SecondReading of the Commission on Industry and Manpower Bill on 7th April.The Secretary of State for Wales said that he was expecting a motion to be tabled, deploring the proposals in the recent white paper on the Reorganisation of Local Government in Glamorganand Monmouthshire. Members of Parliament with constituencies inthe mining valleys had already tried to bring pressure to bear on ministers. The opposition had been sponsored by district councilsfacing extinction; and it might diminish when it was more widelyunderstood that further discussions with the local authorities wouldbe required and that there was no prospect of legislation during thepresent Parliament.CONFIDENTIALMotion for 2.   The Lord President reported to the Cabinet the discussion(Life *n Legislation Committee on Tuesday, 17th March, on the attitudeImprisonment) which the Government should adopt towards Mr. Eldon Griffiths&apos;Bi&apos;l Motion seeking leave to introduce a Murder (Life Imprisonment)Bill, which was to be taken on 24th March. There was no doubtthat the Bill which Mr. Griffiths had in mind would be unacceptable to the Government; and the only question for consideration was whether it would be better for the Government to organiseopposition to the Motion itself or to follow the normal practice of allowing the Motion and taking steps subsequently to ensure thatthe Bill did not obtain a Second Reading. It had been argued onbehalf of the Home Secretary that the better course would be toarrange for a prominent backbencher to oppose the Motion and to instruct the Whips to ensure that it was not carried.   But the
majority of the Committee had thought that it would be better, ifpossible, to avoid a division and that the Government should notbe seen to oppose the Motion, both because this would attractattention to it and because it was likely to enjoy considerable support in the country. If there were a division, however, theGovernment should seek to ensure that the Motion was defeated.The Home Secretary said that the proposed Bill, which wouldmake orders of the Home Secretary reducing sentences for murderto less than 30 years subject to Parliamentary approval, was certainly not one which could be accepted. It reflected the surprising degreeof public ignorance about the effect of a sentence to imprisonment for life and the way in which such sentences were reviewed; and hewas proposing to write a letter to the Police Federation, copies ofwhich he would circulate to his colleagues, explaining the true position. Even if further changes in present practice were called for,it should be for the Criminal Law Revision Committee whom he had invited to review the whole question of fixed sentences, torecommend them. In these circumstances it would be wrong to allowMr. Griffiths&apos; Motion to be carried, since there would then becontinual pressure on the Government to provide facilities for the resulting Bill.In discussion it was suggested that there was no real likelihood of the Motion&apos;s being carried without a division and that theGovernment should therefore make sure that their case against it was presented to the best advantage by putting forward a suitablespeaker and should do everything possible, short of a formal Whip,to see that the Motion was defeated. It was argued on the otherhand that the limited time available would not permit an adequatepresentation of the Governments case and that consideration shouldbe given to finding time for a Second Reading debate on the Bill inorder that that case could be deployed in its full strength. on balance, however, it was agreed that it would be undesirable to allow a full debate and that the substance of the Governments case could in fact be presented in the time available. It would assist in guidingpublic opinion if the Home Secretary&apos;s letter were given wide publicity in advance of the debate on the Motion.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government would be well advised toarrange for a suitable backbencher to explain their case against the motion. The Chief Whip should use his best endeavours to procurethe defeat of the Motion, although no formal Whip should be issued.The Home Secretary should arrange for the text of his letter to thePolice Federation to be published, by way of reply to a writtenParliamentary Question, before the Motion was debated.
DeerHuntingand HareCoursingAbolitionBill(previous reference:CC(70) 12thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Lord President said that, following the discussion in cabinet on 12th March, he had discussed with the ministers concerned how effect could best be given to the decision that theGovernment should adopt the Deer Hunting and Hare CoursingAbolition Bill. He had also met the Bill&apos;s leading sponsors, some ofwhom thought that the provisions about hare coursing were the moreimportant part of the Bill. There were three courses open to theGovernment. They could give facilities for the whole Bill as it nowstood; they could promote a Bill to prohibit hare coursing and thehunting of deer with hounds and so avoid the difficulties arising fromthe fact that the present Bill would prohibit deer-stalking; or theycould promote a Bill confined to the prohibition of hare coursing.He recommended the last of these courses.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the best course would be for the Governmentto promote a Bill dealing only with the prohibition of hare coursing;there was a good chance that this would be passed by the House ofLords. The Lord President should therefore inform the House ofCommons that the Government had decided in principle to legislateagainst hare coursing.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President to inform the House ofCommons that the Government had decided to legislateagainst hare coursing.CONFIDENTIALCivil 4.   The Cabinet&apos;s attention was drawn to the Motion in thePolkv0n        name of Mr. Russell Kerr and other Members of Parliament,Merger between deploring the Governmenfs decision to withhold approval of theBritish Overseas proposed merger between the British Overseas Airways CorporationAirways        (BOAC) and British United Airways (BUA).  This Motion reflectedCorporation and^g concern among the Governmenfs supporters about an apparentAirways        change of the Governmenfs policy for civil aviation.   In fact,however, the Governmenfs attitude had throughout been consistent with the policy described in the White Paper on Civil Aviation Policy(Cmnd.  4213).    The announcement approving the merger inThe Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
principle, which had been forced on the Government by premature disclosure in the Press, had been made on the understanding thatthere were no other prospective purchasers of BUA and thatthe company&apos;s merger with BOAC was the only alternative to itsextinction. When it became known that Caledonian Airways were interested in the possibility of merging with BUA, a new situation was created; and the Government had had to take this into account,as had been explained by the President of the Board of Trade in theHouse of Commons on the previous day. The President shouldelaborate this explanation to the Parliamentary Labour Party, andshould emphasise the consistency of his action with the policy laiddown in the White Paper.OverseaAffairsRhodesia:United Nations(previous reference:CC(70) 12thConclusions,Minute 4)Rhodesia:ConsularRepresentation(previous reference:CC (70) 12thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in theUnited Nations Security Council the Afro-Asian Group had presseda Resolution condemning the United Kingdom for failing to use force against the illegal regime in Rhodesia and calling for theextension of sanctions to South Africa and Portugal. They had subsequently come to an understanding with the Spanish permanent representative whereby the latter had agreed to vote for theirResolution in return for the dropping of the demand for sanctions against Portugal. The Afro-Asians had thus succeeded in musteringthe nine votes necessary to ensure that their Resolution could be defeated only by the use of the veto. In the circumstances we had reluctantly decided that we had no alternative to vetoing theResolution; and the United States had adopted the same course.The Afro-Asian Group had then fallen back on the draft Resolutiontabled by Finland. This had been more acceptable to us; and wehad been able to vote for it, subject to an explanation of our vote.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that belgium and Switzerland had now decided to close their consulates in salisbury and that Greece was likely to do so in the near future.This would leave South Africa and Portugal as the only remainingcountries with consular representation.In discussion satisfaction was expressed at the success of our efforts to induce friendly Powers to withdraw their consularrepresentation. South Africa and Portugal were now in a positionin which their continued membership of the United Nations mightbe at risk; and the prospect of virtual exclusion from theinternational community might exercise a sobering influence on them.We should take full account of this in our dealings with them.
The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the chief justice of Rhodesia, Sir Hugh Beadle, had continued to serve the regime in Salisbury after the illegal declaration of independence. Hehad not so far given any indication of his attitude towards thepurported declaration of a &quot; republic &quot;, which represented a furtherillegality. Lord Beaumont of Whitley had now tabled a Question inthe House of Lords, for reply that day, to ask the government whether they proposed to take any steps to remove from the roll ofHer Majesty&apos;s Privy Council the Chief Justice of the so-calledrepublic of Rhodesia. It was proposed that the reply should pointout that Sir Hugh Beadle had taken an oath of allegiance to the queen when he was admitted to the Privy Council; should remind the House of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement in the House of Commons on 2nd March that those who continuedto serve the illegal regime after the purported assumption ofrepublican status could no longer be regarded as serving the Crown;and should state that we were waiting to see whether Sir HughBeadle intended to take any step to resolve this contradiction. if sir Hugh, after a reasonable interval, did not either resign from the privy Council or actively dissociate himself from the illegal regime,it would be necessary to initiate action for his removal from theCouncil. This might revive pressure for the removal of the formerPresident of Ghana, Dr. Nkrumah, who was still a Privy Counsellor;and, if so, this further step might have to be taken.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theproblems involved in Sir Hugh Beadle&apos;s continuing membership ofthe Privy Council had for some time been under careful considerationby the Ministers concerned. The Cabinet agreed that if Sir HughBeadle subscribed to the illegal &quot; republic &quot;, whether directly or by implication, it might well be necessary to advise The Queen that heshould be removed from the Privy Council. Meanwhile, the replyto Lord Beaumonfs Question should be on the lines proposed by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that in therecent general elections in Finland, the representation in Parliamentof the alliance of the Social Democratic Party, the Communist party and the Social Democratic Union had been reduced from 103 seats to 87. It would probably be some time before a new coalition government could be formed. It was unlikely that there would beany major changes in policy; but it was unfortunate from our pointof view that the Minister of Industry, with whom we had been discussing the possible purchase by Finland of a British nuclearreactor, had lost his seat.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that as a resultof discussions which had been taking place over the past few monthsbetween the Shah of Iran, the Secretary-General of the united nations, U Thant, and ourselves, there was now a good prospect of disposing of the long-standing problem of the territorial claim of Iran to Bahrain, thus removing a major obstacle to the formationof the Union of Arab Emirates which we hoped to see established on our withdrawal from the Persian Gulf. These discussions werehighly confidential pending an announcement; and Ministers shouldtake particular care to prevent any premature disclosure. an opening for a settlement had been offered by the Shah&apos;s public statement in January 1969 that he renounced the use of force in pursuit of Iran&apos;s claim to Bahrain and that he would accept a &quot; legalexpression &quot; of the will of its inhabitants. The Shah realised that thedecision was unlikely to be in favour of incorporation in Iran,though he had not of course admitted this publicly. Delicate and complex contacts had followed between ourselves, the Iranians, theBahrainis and the Secretariat of the United Nations, with theIranians insisting, in order to justify themselves vis-a-vis their own people, on as comprehensive a sounding of Bahrain opinon as possible and the Ruler of Bahrain opposing partly froma dislike of any form of popular consultation but also froma more justified fear of inter-communal disturbances anything in the nature of a referendum or plebiscite. Eventually a compromise had been reached, whereby the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations would send a special representative to Bahrain to sound local opinion. On 9th March, the iranian Permanent Representative at the United Nations had madea formal request in this sense to the Secretary-General; and on20th March, we should be informing the Secretary-General that weconcurred in this request.   On 28th March the Secretary-General* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen further minor military gains by the Communists in Laos. TheSoviet Union had rejected the proposal for consultations betweenthe signatories of the Geneva agreements, which we had invited themto sponsor with us, as Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Commission; andwe had therefore circulated the text of the appeal by the LaotianPrime Minister, Prince Souvanna Phouma, to the Geneva Powersindependently.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that theassassination of Mr. Polykarpos Gheorghiadis had increased tensionwithin the Greek Cypriot community; but it did not appear so far tohave had any adverse effect on relations between Greeks and Turksin the island. Mr. Gheorghiadis had been closely connected with theNational Front, an organisation which stood politically to the Rightof the Government of Cyprus; and he had been suspected ofcomplicity in the recent attempt on the life of the President,Archbishop Makarios.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen Press reports of dissensions in the Soviet leadership. There was clearly considerable discontent about Soviet economic policy, someelements in the Government advocating greater centralisation andothers favouring more liberal methods. But there was no confirma-tion of the report that three members of the Presidium had circulatedwould announce his acceptance of the proposal, together with thename of his special representative who would be Signor Winspeare-Guicciardi, a senior member of the Italian Foreign Service at presentserving as Director-General of the United Nations Office in Geneva.Signor Winspeare-Guicciardi would arrive in Bahrain on 30th March.He would prepare a report to the Secretary-General, who would circulate this to the Security Council, probably in May. While thisoutcome was highly satisfactory to us, it was important, in order toavoid any possible charges of collusion between ourselves, the iranian Government and the United Nations Secretariat, to avoid any public allusion to the major part we had played in bringing itabout.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that during theabsence of the Cambodian Prime Minister, Prince Sihanouk, on a tour abroad a Right-wing group had taken over control of theGovernment.
Irish Republic(previous reference:CC(70) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)IndustrialAffairsIndustrialRelations atLondonAirporta paper to their colleagues attacking Mr. Brezhnev and Mr. Kosygin.If there were any substantial changes in the composition of the Sovietleadership, they would be likely to favour the more conservative andorthodox faction.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Prime Minister said that at a St. Patricks Day banquet in liverpool on 17th March which he had attended together with the deputy Prime Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr. Erskine Childers,the latter had pressed him to increase by 500 tons our offer to permitimports from the Republic not exceeding 31,000 tons for butter and17,000 tons for cheese. In reply, he had undertaken to report this request to his colleagues; but subsequent discussion with theMinisters concerned had indicated that it was too late to modify the aide-memoire embodying our proposals, which had to be delivered to the Irish Ambassador on 18th March in time for the meeting ofthe Irish Cabinet on the following day. He had gained the impressionfrom Mr. Childers that the Irish Government would in fact accept our offer, albeit reluctantly. If they did not, we might have toconsider making a small additional offer of perhaps 250 tons for onecommodity or the other.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.secret . The First Secretary of State said that, as she had alreadyreported to the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy,the situation at London Airport (Heathrow) was serious. Despiteprolonged discussions with officials of the trade unions concerned onthe previous day it had not been possible to reach agreement on theterms of reference for the inquiry which she had undertaken to setup. The trade union side of the National Joint Council for Civil air transport refused to take part in the inquiry unless the british airports Authority (BAA) abandoned their High Court action to restrain shop stewards at Heathrow from attempting to induce a breach of a commercial contract. The Chairman of the BAA,however, had made it clear that the Authority were not prepared toabandon the case completely. The legal position was complex; andthe situation was changing continuously. She therefore asked for authority, in consultation with the Prime Minister, the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Law Officers as necessary, to take suchaction as was required to deal with the situation as it developed.The Cabinet-Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with the
B 2Prime Minister, the President of the Board of Trade and theLaw Officers as necessary, to take such action as was required to deal with the situation at Heathrow Airport.SECRET7. The Secretary of State for Education and Science said thathe had discussed further with the parties concerned the unsatisfactory situation which had developed in connection with therecent settlement of the dispute on teachers&apos; pay. The statement which had been issued by the Burnham Committee on 3rd Marchhad been at fault in describing the cost of the settlement as &quot; not lessthan  42 million in 1970-71 &quot; and in omitting any reference to thecost in 1971-72, since there was no doubt in the minds of all whohad taken part in the negotiations that the amounts of  42 million and  84 million represented the upper limits of the cost in the twoyears 1970-71 and 1971-72 respectively. This was amply confirmed by the record of his subsequent discussion with Mr. Britton of theNational Union of Teachers (NUT). There was no justification,therefore, for the circular letter which the NUT had issued on 4th March, repeating the misleading interpretation of the agreement in the Burnham Committee&apos;s statement and committing the union toan attempt to ensure that the amounts agreed by the settlement would be substantially exceeded in the next round of negotiations.On the other hand it was not easy to devise a means by which thematter could be put right without endangering the settlement itselfwhen it came forward for ratification early in April. TheGovernment could seek to insist that at that point the text of theagreement, which would normally be confined to a simple statementof the increased salary scales, should incorporate the other provisions(including the maximum costs involved) which had formed part ofthe settlement with the NUT and had been made public in his statement in the House of Commons on 5th March. But the union,who had already refused to withdraw their circular letter, wouldprobably be equally reluctant to accept this alternative procedure;and if, as a result, the agreement were not ratified, the wholesettlement would fail, the teachers might revert to strike action andthe Government would incur considerable political odium. It mightbe preferable, therefore, for him to confine himself to sending aletter to both sides of the Burnham Committee, putting on recordbefore the agreement was ratified, the interpretation which theGovernment placed upon it; and this might then be repeated bySir Ronald Gould, the General-Secretary of the NUT, at the union&apos;forthcoming annual conference.In discussion there was general agreement that it must be made clear that the cost of the settlement was subject to a maximum of
not merely  42 million in 1970-71 but also  84 million in 1971-72;and the necessary statement to this effect should be expressed interms that the Government were committed to provide not morethan these amounts (rather than that they were not committed toprovide more). It was essential that Sir Ronald Gould shouldconfirm this understanding at the forthcoming conference of theNUT. For the rest it must be left to him to deal with his union andits members as he saw fit about the circumstances in which they had issued a misleading circular over his signature but without his knowledge; the Governments main concern was to ensure that thenext round of negotiations did not start on the basis of anymisunderstanding about the precise terms of the settlement. In orderto ensure this the Secretary of State for Education and Science mightbe well advised to send to Mr. Britton the record of their discussion and to confirm that he accepted it as a valid interpretation of theagreement. If he did so, the Government should be proof against any subsequent charge of bad faith; but, if he refused or was reluctant to endorse the record, it might then be necessary for theSecretary of State to adopt a more rigorous attitude and perhaps to insist that the full terms of the settlement should be incorporated in the text of the agreement to be ratified early in April. The matter would need to be further considered by the Cabinet at that juncture.The Cabinet-Took note that the Secretary of State for Education and science would send to Mr. Britton, representing theNational Union of Teachers, the record of their discussion on 13th March and would inform the Cabinet if he refusedto endorse it.BritishRailwaysBoard: PaySettlementThe Cabinet were informed that the pay claim on behalf of employees of the British Railways Board had been settled on thebasis recently approved by the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes.Salaries ofChairmen and members ofNationalisedIndustry boards and the higher civil Service(previous reference:CC(70) 12thConclusions,Minute 8)*7. The Lord Privy Seal said that the most appropriate meansof announcing the implementation of Stages 2 and 3 of the salary increases for members of the Boards of nationalised industries andfor the Higher Civil Service, which the Cabinet had approved inprinciple at their previous meeting, would be by way ofParliamentary Questions for written answer in the following week.In discussion this suggestion was endorsed. But it was agreedthat it would be preferable to confine the announcement ofimplementation to Stage 2 on 1st April and 1st July for the nationalised industries and the Higher Civil Service respectively, on
SECRET8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the paymaster general (C (70) 45) about the structure of the textile industry.The Paymaster General said that the President of the Board ofTrade had announced in June 1969 a standstill on further mergersbetween the large groups in the textile industry which had grownrapidly by amalgamation and acquisition but had not yet realised the full advantage of integration. Following the proposal by imperial Chemical Industries Ltd. (ICI) to bid for ViyellaInternational Ltd. and thereafter to effect an amalgamation between that firm and Carrington and Dewhurst Ltd., he had examined thesituation in the textile industry with the help of a small group whichhad included the Minister of State, Department of Employment and productivity and the Chairmen of the Industrial Reorganisationthe basis that the Stage 3 increase would be implemented at thecorresponding dates in the following year but that this decision should not be announced at the present juncture and that the question should be further considered in the light of the requirements of incomes policy at the time. The announcement of the salary increases envisaged for members of the judiciary should be reservedfor later consideration.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister without Portfolio and the Lord privy seal to arrange for written Questions to be answered in theHouse of Commons and the House of Lords respectively inthe following week about the implementation of furthersalary increases for members of the Boards of nationalised industries and for the Higher Civil Service in the termsagreed in their discussion.The Lord Privy Seal said that in the course of the negotiation of a central pay increase for the non-industrial Civil Service it hadbeen necessary, with the approval of the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the First Secretary of State, to offeran improvement on the proposed increase from 8 per cent to %\ percent from 1st April, 1970, for the clerical, executive andadministrative grades, coupled with an increase of 6 per cent for theworks group and technical classes from 1st January, 1970. Therewere grounds for hoping that a settlement could be achieved on this basis.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of this statement.
Corporation and the Textile Council. They had concluded that itwould not be satisfactory to allow the standstill to continueunchanged. While it had been intended to provide protection againstmajor extensions of vertical integration, in practice Courtaulds were able to grow organically from the position which they had already secured through massive forward integration; and a continuance ofthe standstill would now reduce, rather than maintain, competition.The standstill had not prevented ICI from becoming closely involvedin the operations of textile firms in ways other than acquisition but such moves had had unfortunate results. Carrington and Dewhurstand Viyella now needed assistance from ICI to strengthen both theirfinances and their management. He therefore proposed that theyshould be allowed to merge under a holding company formed byICI, provided that the latter reduced their shareholding to no morethan 35 per cent within a strictly limited period, that they establishedan independent Chairman and an independent Board with only oneICI director, and that they undertook not to use their shareholdingto influence the combined company in its choice of fibres or other materials. Any further integration into textile manufacture by fibreproducers, including takeovers by overseas firms, would be allowedonly on a similar basis. In addition, all fibre producers might beinvited to subscribe to a code of conduct designed to prevent tradingpractices which gave rise to concern; if this code were not complied with voluntarily, specific abuses of market power could be referredto the new Commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM).In addition, the Lancashire section of the textile industry neededhelp to undertake the re-equipment needed before the tariff on commonwealth imports came into force on 1st January, 1972.While detailed discussions would have to be held with the Treasuryabout the extent and nature of such assistance, it would be helpful if the announcement of the decision on ICFs proposals could indicatethat the Government recognised the need for re-equipment and were considering what action would be appropriate.In discussion it was suggested that these proposals were opento certain objections. The merger of Viyella and Carrington andDewhurst had few advantages and was opposed by most of thosewho had been consulted. While the fundamental problem was thestrength of Courtaulds, the proposals might reduce the ability ofICI to help other textile firms to remain competitive. Instability inthe industry would continue. Moreover, the Government could not now rely on powers flowing from the Monopolies Commission reporton cellulosic fibres; they would be dependent on the consent of the firms concerned, supplemented by reference to the CIM of mergersor of particular forms of abuse of market power. It would havebeen preferable to announce the maintenance of the standstill
immediately ICFs proposals became known. On the other hand, itwas argued that, since this had not been done, there was now no alternative to the course proposed by the Paymaster General.In further discussion it was suggested that there should be no commitment to assistance for the re-equipment of the textile industryuntil detailed proposals had been considered by the ministers concerned. It might also prove embarrassing if the intention topromulgate a code of conduct was announced before it was known whether an acceptable code could be drafted.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet might be prepared, on balance, to agree in principle to thecourse proposed by the Paymaster General in respect of ICFsproposals for Viyella and Carrington and Dewhurst; but furtherconsideration should be given to its implications by the ministerial steering Committee on Economic Policy before any public statement could be made. The Paymaster General should consider with theFirst Secretary of State the practicability of preparing a code of conduct on the lines proposed. He should also give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, tothe proposals for assistance towards the re-equipment of the textile industry. In the meantime nothing should be said to commit theGovernment, even in principle, to providing such assistance.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the issues involved to be considered further by the ministerial steering Committee on Economic Policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th March, 1970.
