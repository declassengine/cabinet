CC 18 (70)secret. The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet&apos;s attention to thestatement which he had made in the House of Commons on 21st Aprilrebutting an allegation that he had sought to prohibit contacts between Opposition leaders and senior members of the public serviceand reaffirming the normal conventions in this matter.In the course of a discussion of the implications of the PrimeMinisters statement there was general agreement on the importanceof ensuring that the principles which it had laid down were observedthroughout the public service. After reviewing certain specificinstances in which the issue had arisen, the Cabinet agreed that thedecision in individual cases must necessarily be left largely to the discretion of the Ministers and officials concerned. But in principlea clear distinction should be drawn between requests by Oppositionrepresentatives for information about the machinery of governmentand requests for information about developments of government policy. As regards the former there need be no objection to reasonable contacts between senior civil servants and opposition leaders if the Opposition wished to inform themselves on factualquestions of Departmental organisation and structure and to keepabreast of organisational changes which might be in contemplation.Similar arrangements could be permitted, for the same purpose andto the same extent as had applied in the reverse case before theGovernment came into office in 1964, if it was a question of ensuring that, in the event of an Opposition victory at the forthcomingGeneral Election, the transfer of authority and responsibility wouldbe effected as smoothly as possible. Requests for information aboutpolicy, however, fell into a wholly different category, particularly ifthey concerned such sensitive issues as, e.g. the details of theforthcoming negotiations for British accession to the european economic Communities. It should be clearly understood by allconcerned that any contacts between the Government and theOpposition on matters of this kind should be conducted at ministerial level and that, in so far as officials took part, they should do so onlyin support of their Ministers.In order to ensure consistency of practice in this field all ministers should supply the Prime Minister with details of theoccasions on which officials of their Departments had recently hadcontacts with representatives of the Opposition and should arrangefor him to be informed of any similar approaches in the future.confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.11441-1
whitsun recess(previous reference:CC (70) 13thConclusions,Minute 1)OverseaAffairsTrinidad:Black PowerDisturbancesThe Cabinet noted that a Private Member&apos;s Bill to abolish BritishStandard Time and authorise the resumption of Greenwich MeanTime from 1st October, 1970, was likely to be debated on 1st May.They agreed that the Bill was unacceptable and that the three-yearexperiment, for which the British Standard Time Act, 1968, provided,should be allowed to run its full course. They also agreed that itwould be appropriate for a back-bench supporter of the Governmentto table a reasoned amendment to Mr. Peter Fry&apos;s Motion onproblems of the permissive society which was to be debated on 4th May; and that a Home Office Minister should intervene in the debate to explain the Governments attitude to the problems listed in the Motion and the steps they had taken to deal with them.The Cabinet were informed that if the state of business permittedtwo weeks to be taken for the Whitsun Recess the House of lords would probably sit until 21st May and return on 8th June.secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that therehad been a series of disturbances in Trinidad instigated by the BlackPower movement. The immediate occasion of these had been the trial of Trinidadian students in Canada on charges of arson; butthere had been a long-standing background of economic discontent.On 21 April, the Prime Minister of Trinidad and Tobago,Dr. Eric Williams, had declared a state of emergency and had ordered the detention of 25 Black Power leaders: but 10 of these had sofar evaded arrest. The situation was complicated by the fact that atmuch the same time some 50 members of the Trinidad and TobagoRegiment, who sympathised with the Black Power movement, hadmutinied and had established themselves in the former United Statesbase at Chaguaramas, where they were holding 200 members of the regiment as hostages. At the outset Dr. Williams had asked usto transmit requests to the Head of the Federal Military Governmentof Nigeria, General Gowon, and to the President of Tanzania,Mr. Nyerere, for the despatch of troops to assist him in restoringorder. He had also sought British assistance in transporting these troops to Trinidad and had asked us to supply light weapons toreplace those seized by the mutineers. Dr. Williams had subsequently decided not to pursue his approach to Nigeria andTanzania: but urgent consideration had been given to our responseif he pursued his request for arms.Meanwhile, measures were being taken to ensure the safety ofthe 2,000 United Kingdom subjects in Trinidad. We had major economic interests in the island; and our investment there was estimated at about  150 million.   Moreover, Dr. Williams was a
strong and effective leader, who had considerable influence in the african Commonwealth countries; and it was therefore important that we should do what we could to maintain our relationship withhim and to avoid giving him any grounds of complaint as regardsour response to his appeal.The Defence Secretary said that one frigate, HMS Jupiter, hadbeen despatched to Trinidad, with orders to remain 30 miles off-shore, and would be in position that night. A second frigate,HMS Sirius, would reach the island within the next two days andwould also remain off-shore and out of sight. HMS Jupiter carrieda helicopter and could provide a naval landing party of two platoonstrained in riot control. The complement of HMS Sirius included a detachment of Royal Marines. The situation created by the mutinyin the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment was serious, since out of atotal strength of 700 men 50 were taking an active part in themutiny and 200 had been neutralised by the mutineers. The mutinyhad also left the loyal troops critically short of arms. The armswhich Dr. Williams needed could be despatched by midnight that night if he so requested: but he now seemed more likely to rely on supplies from the United States. He was also reported to have been promised reinforcements of 1,000 men from Venezuela. Guyanawas considering supplying some weapons; but the response fromJamaica, to which Dr. Williams had also appealed, was not yet known.In discussion it was suggested that, while the disturbances inTrinidad were on a small scale in terms of the forces involved, thepolitical issues involved could be far-reaching. If we were to become involved in the internal security problems of an independent memberof the Commonwealth, the consequences might be serious the more so in that Dr. Williams&apos; Government had already incurred localcriticism on the grounds of their alleged reliance on British and american support. The forces which could be provided by our twofrigates were too small to be able to exercise any decisive influence on the maintenance of internal security in Trinidad. If the situation were to deteriorate to a point at which it became necessary to intervene in force to save British lives, a battalion of parachutistscould be made available, which could reach Trinidad in two to four days. But it was clearly desirable to avoid such a degree ofinvolvement if possible; and British troops should be committed onlyin the last resort. Some concern was expressed whetherDr. Williams&apos; assessment of the istuation was over-optimistic. Therehad been some doubt whether he would in fact receive from theUnited States and elsewhere the supplies of arms and the assistance
on which he appeared to be counting but the latest indications were that some arms from United States sources could already havereached him.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on the importance of maintaining relations ofconfidence and sympathy with the Government of Trinidad andTobago. A successful Black Power revolt would have serious repercussions elsewhere in the Caribbean; and, if these extended tothe Associated States, it might prove impossible for us to avoidintervention. On the other hand we should clearly refrain from becoming directly involved in an internal security operation in anindependent country. The situation, especially as regards the supplyof arms to the Trinidad Government, would be closely watched;and, if immediate decisions were required, he himself would need to have discretion, in consultation with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Defence Secretary, to take the necessary action.Developments would also be reported, as appropriate, to the defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statements by theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the defence secretary and of the Prime Minister^ summing up oftheir discussion.(2) Agreed that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the defence secretary, should have discretion to take appropriate action, including the supply of arms, if developments inTrinidad made it necessary to do so at short notice.CONFIDENTIALPreservation of       4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretaryOccupational   0j.- for Social Services on the preservation of occupational pension Rights: . ,     ,n rft, r1.Retrospection    PenS10n n8hts (C (/0). 52).     .The Secretary of State for Social Services said that theGovernment were taking power in the National superannuation and Social Insurance Bill to require occupational pension schemes to offer deferred pensions to employees who left before retirementage. As at present drafted the Bill did not cover pensionable service before the appointed day on which the legislation came into effect.This was due to opposition from the Confederation of BritishIndustries to action which in their view could amount to the
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd April, 1970.retrospective alteration of the terms of existing pension contractsagainst the wishes of one of the parties. The exclusion of service before the appointed day, had, however, been strongly criticised bythe Trades Union Congress and by Members of Parliament of all parties; and with the support of the Social Services Committee he proposed that a Government amendment should now be tabledextending the scope of the Bill to pensions earned by service beforethe appointed day. The Law Officers had advised that such legislation would not be truly retrospective in that it would impose an obligation on employers only in respect of employees who left afterthe legislation came into operation. There would not be any special problems of enforcement and only a small minority of schemes,which were financed on very small margins, would be likely to suffersignificant damage. As regards cost, he was advised by theGovernment Actuary that the effect would be to bring forward thefull cost of preservation, which was estimated at between  20 million and  25 million a year, rather than to allow it to build up graduallyfrom an initial level of about  10 million a year.In discussion there was general agreement that pensionableservice before the appointed day should be covered in the legislation.It was, however, pointed out that the introduction of retrospectionmight well result in more people opting for preservation of their pensions rather than a refund of contributions, in which case theactual cost would be higher than the Government Actuary had estimated.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C (70) 52.
