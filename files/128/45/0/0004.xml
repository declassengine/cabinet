CabinetForwardProgrammeof Business11372A 2SECRET1. The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to thevarious White Papers which were due to be issued in the weeksimmediately ahead.The White Paper on the Reform of Local Government inEngland, which the Cabinet were to consider in draft under a subsequent item on the agenda, was due to be published on 4thFebruary.The Green Paper on the National Health Service should beconsidered by the Social Services Committee in the following week;and all Departmental Ministers who were likely to wish to take partin the discussion should make arrangements to attend the meeting,whether they were members of the Committee or not. thereafter the text would be circulated for formal approval by the Cabinet in whatever manner proved most appropriate; and the Green paper would be published on the 11th February. It was important thatit should appear not more than a week later than the White paper on the Reform of Local Government and should be followedimmediately by publication of the Bill to give effect to the government&apos;s decisions on the Report of the Committee on LocalAuthority Personal and Allied Services.A draft White Paper on our candidature for membership of theEuropean Economic Communities would be circulated to the Cabinetin the following week; and it was envisaged that, after discussion bythe Cabinet during the week beginning 2nd February it would,probably be published towards the middle of that month. It wouldbe important to secure the confidential nature of this document in theperiod before its publication; and Ministers receiving copies should therefore regard them as for their personal use only.The Defence White Paper was timed for publication on19th February. It had been approved by the Defence and overseas policy Committee on the previous day and would be circulated tothe Cabinet in the near future. Any outstanding points of substanceor suggested improvements of drafting should then be disposed of by direct discussion between the Ministers concerned and the Secretaryof State for Defence. The Cabinet would be invited to approve the text formally at the next convenient opportunity.About the middle of February the Agricultural Policy Committeewould need to consider this year&apos;s Farm Price Review; and the issues involved would probably reach the Cabinet towards the end of themonth, in time for publication of the Governmenfs decisions in theannual White Paper early in March.
ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessPrivacyIn the light of this programme all Ministers would need to payparticular attention to the timing and phasing of the publication ofthe various documents in which they were concerned and to maintainclose consultation with the Lord President of the Council, theMinister without Portfolio, the Parliamentary Secretary, treasury and the Chief Information Adviser.secret. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.SECRET*3. The Cabinet considered the attitude which the Governmentshould adopt towards a Private Member&apos;s Bill designed to preventunauthorised intrusions into personal privacy, which was sponsored by Mr. Walden, m p, and Mr. Lyons, m p, and was due to receive its second Reading on the following day.The Home Secretary said that, in the light of the increasingpublic concern on this subject, he had discussed the issues involved with the Lord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for Scotland.They had agreed that these issues were political, rather than legal, in character and that it would be preferable that Parliament shouldprescribe the basic definition of personal privacy than that thisshould be left to be settled by the courts in a series of rulings on individual cases. For this reason he proposed that in the debate onthe following day he should indicate that the Government intendedto constitute a broadly based inquiry, under Mr. Kenneth Youngeras chairman, &quot; To consider whether legislation is needed to give further protection to the individual citizen and to commercial andindustrial interests against intrusions into privacy by private persons or organisations, or by companies; and to make recommendations &quot;.On the basis of this assurance of the Government^ intentions hewould invite the sponsors of the Bill to withdraw it.In discussion there was general agreement that some action bythe Government in this field might well be required. But attentionwould undoubtedly be focused on the fact that the proposed termsof reference of the inquiry excluded those activities of the government itself which might be regarded as intrusions into personal privacy;and it was therefore arguable whether the Government would be well advised to seek to deny further passage to the Bill on the basis of sorestricted an inquiry or whether it would be preferable to leave theBill to a free vote of the House and to arrange for it to be halted atthe Committee stage. The argument was perhaps reinforced by the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
B*fact that it had been necessary to make special arrangements to securethe attendance of an adequate number of Government supporters,including Ministers, to ensure the Bill&apos;s defeat on Second Reading onthe following day; and this fact, which had become known and wasresented by the promoters of the Bill, would be liable to expose theGovernment to some embarrassment, which could be avoided if thearrangements were cancelled and the Bill were allowed to take itsnormal course.On the other hand the exclusion of the Governments ownactivities from the terms of reference could be defended on severalgrounds. Certain of those activities concerned the security of the realm; and as regards these it should suffice that they had been thesubject of successive inquiries by Privy Counsellors, which haddefined the necessary scope of a Governments powers in this respect.In so far as public concern extended more widely and reflected a growing uneasiness about the extent to which detailed information about individuals, which was collected by Departments concernedwith taxation, social security and so forth, might be put to improperuse as a result of the increasing use of computers, data banks, etc.,the House of Commons could be reminded that such information could be obtained by the Government only in accordance with strictstatutory requirements and could be used only for the purposesauthorised by the statutes in question. The Government observedthese limitations scrupulously; and a clear assurance to this effect should do much to allay anxiety on this score. The issues involved were different from those with which the proposed inquiry would be concerned; and it would be contrary to the inquiry&apos;s purpose toinclude them in its terms of reference.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed in principle that an inquiry into privacy, based on terms of reference as proposed, should be announced on the following day and that the Home Secretary should have discretion to decide,in the light of the debate, whether he should indicate that theGovernment were conscious that there were related areas of concernon which it might be desirable to consider the possibility of some form of action. On this basis it would be preferable to seek to preventthe further passage of the Private Membets Bill; and, if it was notpossible to talk the Bill out, the Home Secretary should be givenwhatever degree of Ministerial support was required to ensure itsdefeat. But the Parliamentary Secretary, Treasury, should have discretion to make the necessary arrangements in such a way as toentail the minimum embarrassment to the Government.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
secret. The Prime Minister said that, in view of the renewed press reports about distress and hunger in Nigeria, it would be desirablethat a further Parliamentary statement should be made that afternoon in order to put the situation in perspective. In particular, the Pressallegations, although sensationally presented, did not refute the morereassuring statements made by Lord Hunt and the Director-Generalof the Save the Children Fund, Sir Colin Thornley, after their recent visit to the reoccupied areas; and this should be made clear toParliament.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.*The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there hadbeen some indications that the former rebel leader, Colonel Ojukwu,might seek refuge in the United Kingdom. If we admitted him, weshould risk embarrassing our relations not only.:with, the FederalMilitary Government (FMG) but also with certain other commonwealth countries who would not understand why colonel ojukwu should be admitted to the United Kingdopi wljile their owncitizens were debarred from entry under the provisions of ourimmigration legislation. It would therefore be preferable to refuseadmission to Colonel Ojukwu and to justify this action, if no other grounds for it could be found, by reference to, considerations ofnational security, not least the risk to which British subjects in nigeria might be exposed if we offended the FMG.The Home Secretary said that, constitutionally, the decision inmatters of this kind rested with him. He.&apos; would certainly seek toavoid involving the Government in political embarrassment, so faras possible. But he was advised that he could not legally excludeColonel Ojukwu on grounds of national security; and there weremajor difficulties in the way of refusing a Commonwealth citizenentry to the United Kingdom on other grounds (although the position might be different if Colonel Ojukwu were deprived of his Nigeriancitizenship and thus became.,a stateless person). If Colonel Ojukwuin fact attempted to enter this country, he would be closely questionedby the immigration authorities about his intentions; and.it might bepossible to extract from him a,n assurance that, if he remained here for a time, he would abstain from any kind of political activity.In discussion the following points were made (a) The Head of the FMG, General Gowon, had indicatedprivately that, if rebel resistance collapsed and Colonel Ojukwuthereafter made no attempt to continue his subversive activities, he* Previously recorded, in a Confidential Annex.SECRET),
secret. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Secretary of State for local Government and Regional Planning (C (70) 13), to which was annexed a draft White Paper on the Reform of Local Governmentin England. They also had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C (70) 14) on the disqualification of local government employees for membership of their authorities.The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning recalled that at their meeting on 11th December, 1969 theCabinet had approved his proposals for the new structure of localgovernment and at their meeting on 13th January, 1970, had takendecisions on a number of related issues. These decisions formed thebasis of the draft White Paper, which had been examined in detail by the Ministerial Committee on Local Government reorganisation and would be published on 4th February.In discussion several textual amendments were agreed; and thefollowing main points were madeLocalGovernmentReformDraft white paper(previous references :CC(69) 60thConclusions,Minute 5 and cc(70) 1stConclusions,Minute 7)would be disposed to let him escape capture and punishment. Buthe might be less willing to do so if Colonel Ojukwu, instead of goingto one of the many other countries which were open to him, came to the United Kingdom with the manifest intention of enlisting freshsupport. If in these circumstances the FMG asked for his extradition,we should be faced with a difficult situation.(b) Colonel Ojukwu, however, might not realise the full extentof our difficulties; and it would be wise to leave him in uncertainty about the action which we might take if he sought refuge here.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was perhaps unlikely that Colonel Ojukwu would in fact seek to enter the United Kingdom. He might be deterred by the fear ofextradition; by the fact that the circumstances of his departure fromNigeria were not to his credit; and by financial considerations towhich the Treasury should perhaps give some thought. The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Home Secretary should,however, continue to keep the possibility of his seeking asylum hereunder close review.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
(a) It would be better to avoid any reference to 1974 inparagraphs 13 and 87, where the timetable of reorganisation was discussed. No reference to any particular year was necessary in theformer context; and paragraph 87 should be confined to indicating that the new local authorities would be elected in 1973 and would assume their duties as soon thereafter as proved practicable andconvenient.(b) In paragraph 14 it would be better to suggest that futureregional plans would be firmer rather than more detailed.(c) Paragraph 29 announced the Governmenfs decision not toplace the new integrated health service under local control; but itgave no reasons for this decision. The reasons would in fact be givenin the Green Paper on the structure of the health services; but thiswould not be published until some days afterwards. This position might be eased if the Secretary of State for Social Services arranged to answer a Written Question on the forthcoming Green Paper onthe day on which the White Paper itself was published.(d) There was strong feeling in the Labour Party that the presentrule prohibiting local authority employees from serving on the localauthority which employed them should be relaxed; and this feelingwould be reinforced by the fact that reorganisation on the lines nowproposed would substantially increase the numbers of those sodebarred. On the other hand any new principle in this context whichthe White Paper prescribed for local government might haveimplications for the Civil Service. Civil servants could not stand for parliament; and the extent to which they could participate in localgovernment had been determined by the report in 1949 of theCommittee on political activities of civil servants (the MastermanCommittee). It would be undesirable that, in relation to localauthority employees, the White Paper should depart so markedlyfrom the principle involved as to generate pressure for relaxation ofthe rules in relation to civil servants. The second alternativeparagraph 77 was therefore to be preferred; but its third sentencemight be redrafted on the lines suggested by the Lord Privy seal in C (70) 14 and the word &quot; major &quot; should be omitted from the last sentence. The revised wording should be settled by the Secretary ofState for Local Government and Regional Planning in consultationwith the Lord Privy Seal.(e) Paragraph 91 contemplated early discussions with localauthority interests on the boundaries of the proposed new authorities.But these could provoke unnecessary political controversy unless they were correctly timed; and it might be better to defer the start of consultations on this matter until discussions on other issues were well advanced. The opening words of paragraph 91 should be redrafted in this sense.
Cabinet Office, S.W.I.22nd January, 1970.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper, subject to the points madein discussion, and authorised the Secretary of State for LocalGovernment and Regional Planning to make further drafting amendments at his discretion. Members of the Cabinet who hadamendments to suggest should send them to the Secretary of state as soon as possible. The Cabinet agreed that the White Paper shouldbe published on 4th February. There would probably be a demandfor a Parliamentary debate on its proposals; and the subsequentGreen Paper on the health services might also be the occasion for a debate. The Lord President should consider, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Social Services, the Home Secretary and theParliamentary Secretary, Treasury, how much time should be allowed for this purpose: and whether it would be more appropriate toarrange separate debates or a joint debate, which might also cover the Governments proposals to integrate the personal social services.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Approved the dralft White Paper annexed to C (70) 13,subject to the points made in discussion and to any furtherdrafting amendments.(3) Invited the Lord President to consider, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, the form of parlimentary debates on the White Paper and the forthcoming green paper on the health services.
