The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Subject to the viewsof the First Secretary of State, who was unable to be present, it wasagreed that the debate on the Second Reading of the industrial relations Bill should be held after the Whitsun Recess so as toallow the Governments supporters more time to study its provisions.The date on which the debate would be held should, however, be announced before the Recess, if possible.The Cabinet were informed that, subject to the progress ofbusiness, it was proposed that the House should rise for the whitsun recess on Friday, 15 May and return on Monday, 1 June.OverseaAffairsCambodia(previous reference :CC (70) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that south vietnamese forces had crossed into Cambodia with the object of destroying the North Vietnamese and Vietcong bases which hadbeen established there under the regime of Prince Sihanouk, in violation of Cambodian neutrality. Since Prince Sihanouk had beenoverthrown, attacks on South Vietnam from these bases had been intensified; and it was not yet clear whether the South Vietnameseaction would be a once-for-all operation or whether it would continue. Meanwhile, categorical statements on the matter shouldbe avoided. In any public statement which might have to be madewe should take the line that these developments emphasised theimportance of a political settlement and of the re-establishment of genuine Cambodian neutrality. To this end, it would be desirableto reactivate the International Control Commission and reconvenethe Geneva Conference. The President of the United States,Mr. Nixon, had decided to support the South Vietnamese action,and was likely to make a public statement to this effect in the nearfuture. While we should avoid dissociating ourselves from theUnited States, we should be equally careful not to endorse the action they had taken, especially in view of our position as Co-Chairmanof the Geneva Conference.In discussion it was suggested that President Nixon&apos;s decision might have far-reaching consequences in terms of renewed UnitedStates involvement in Indo-China. If it were to lead to an increasedUnited States commitment, a slowing down in the rate of withdrawalof United States troops and a setback to the policy of Vietnamisationof the conflict, there would be liable to be widespread adverse11441-2A 2
Middle East(previous reference :CC (70) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)Visit by theForeign andCommonwealthSecretary tothe Far Eastreactions both in the United States itself and elsewhere. In thesecircumstances, it was arguable that we should seek to exert a positive influence on the United States in order to prevent anextension of the war and to secure the continuance of a policy of withdrawl of United States troops. On the other hand the extent and scope of operations in Cambodia were as yet unknown; andmore suitable opportunities for urging our viewpoint on the americans might arise after President Nixon had made his expectedstatement.The Cabinet 1. Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the israeli government had issued an announcement on 29 April to the effectthat Soviet pilots were now flying operational missions from military installations in the United Arab Republic (UAR) under Sovietcontrol. A Private Notice Question had been put down in theHouse of Commons on this subject for reply that day; but theQuestion might not be allowed. Our information was that therewere Soviet pilots in the UAR, that they had been engaged intraining activities but that they had not so far been used over Israelor Israeli-occupied territory or for interception of Israeli aircraft over the UAR itself. In making this announcement, the Israeliauthorities may have hoped to strengthen their case for increased supplies of military aircraft from the United States.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had visited Japan to attend the 1970 Exposition and hold the usualannual talks with the Japanese Government. Our participation inthe Exposition was showing satisfactory results. Though we hadspent less on our pavilion than the United States or the soviet union, or indeed France or Germany, it appeared to have achievedits objective of presenting Britain as a country with an advancedmodern industry and technology as well as historic traditions. TheJapanese Government had appeared to be impressed by the recovery in our economic position. They had expressed concern aboutdevelopments in the Far East and regret at the impendingwithdrawal of our forces from East of Suez; but they seemed to envisage their own role as being restricted to the provision ofeconomic aid and the encouragement of economic and technical co-operation in the area, and were evidently reluctant to become involved in its defence by military means.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had also visitedHong Kong.  The economy of the Colony was flourishing and was
The Caribbean(previous reference :CC (70) 18thConclusions,Minute 3)Malta(previous reference :CC (70) 12thConclusions,Minute 5)now supporting a population of some 4 million. But in the face ofthe threat from China, increasing prosperity had brought with it nodemand for increased participation by elected members in the processes of government.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thesituation had eased over the past few days. In Trinidad the mutinyin the Trinidad and Tobago Regiment had been virtually broughtto an end as a result of the negotiations with the mutineersconducted by the former commander of the Regiment, ColonelSerrette: but some mutineers had disappeared, taking their armswith them, and were still unaccounted for. Meanwhile HMS Jupiterremained off Port of Spain. In Grand Cayman, demonstrations hadbeen instigated by land speculators, who had hoped to frustrate theGovernments attempts to control their activities. There was some danger that Black Power agitators might attempt to take part in the agitation; but the authorities appeared to have the situation under control and HMS Sirius remained in the vicinity of the island. InAntigua the threat of disturbances associated with the strikes ofdock workers and civil servants appeared to be receding.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, followingour refusal to modify our offer of aid covering the five years from1 April, 1969, on the basis of 50 per cent loan and 50 per cent grant,the Maltese Government had defaulted on the servicing of the loanswhich we had made to them. The United Kingdom HighCommissioner had protested. The Maltese Prime Minister Dr. BorgOlivier, had not laid undue stress on the dispute with the UnitedKingdom over aid in his Budget speech: and it was possible that discussions might be resumed. But the situation was unsatisfactory;and it might prove necessary for him to invite the Cabinet to reconsider the earlier decision on aid.The Cabinet 2.  Took  note  of the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.SECRETThreatened *3.   The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the african General  Secretary of  the  Nigerian  National  Sports  Council,boycott o t e ^ Ordia, who was also President of the Supreme Council for SportCommonwealth r *i. .Games *n Africa, had recently informed the United Kingdom high commission in Lagos of his intention, in the latter capacity, to announce that no African team would attend the Commonwealth
Games to be held in Edinburgh later this year unless the CricketCouncils decision to invite a South African cricket team to visitEngland was reversed. Information from African commonwealth countries suggested that not all of them would be in favour of aboycott of the Commonwealth Games if the South African tourtook place: but few were likely to be willing to face the criticismthey would incur by opposing it.The Prime Minister said that the Cricket CounciTs decision to persist with the South African tour had created a difficult situation.Expenditure of some  2-f- million, of which  f million was from public funds, had been incurred in Scotland on preparations for theCommonwealth Games. Though some African commonwealth countries might be unenthusiastic about a boycott, they were unlikely to oppose it. On the contrary, support for the boycottmight spread to other non-white Commonwealth members; and thefinal outcome might be a Commonwealth Games meeting at whichrepresentation would be preponderantly from the white members ofthe Commonwealth. This raised implications which went beyondthe sphere of sport. He had accordingly directed that developmentsshould be kept under the close review by the Departmentsconcerned; and an interdepartmental committee under thechairmanship of the Minister of State, Ministry of Housing andLocal Government, had already considered certain aspects of theproblem, in particular ways and means of applying indirect pressure to the Cricket Council with a view to persuading them to reconsider the South African tour.The Home Secretary said that he had already had a discussion on this subject with the Opposition spokesman on home affairs,Mr. Hogg. In the course of this he had been at pains to make clear to Mr. Hogg that the difficulties which had arisen stemmedfrom the Cricket Council&apos;s decision to let the tour proceed and not from any action by the Government. The Council were nowattempting to blame the Government for the consequences of theirown obduracy; but this should be resisted. The Commissioner ofPolice for the Metropolis was confident that the MetropolitanPolice could deal with any demonstrations against the south africans arising out of matches played in London. But this mightbe too optimistic a forecast, since, although the main organisationsopposing the South African tour had disclaimed any intention of violence, demonstrations initiated by them might be exploited by others who were less scrupulous. At Lord&apos;s, a charge would be madeto the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) only in respect of thosepolice who were actually on duty inside the ground. Themaintenance of order outside the ground was a normal policecommitment and chargeable to public funds. The charge would be
at the full rate of   11- 12 per man per day; and, since some 100police would be required inside the ground, this would represent astrain on the resources of the MCC and of other cricket clubs,which might induce them to reconsider the desirability of proceeding with the matches which were envisaged. Some police forces outside london had indicated that they would charge less than the fullscale; but the Commissioner for the Metropolis would discuss thematter with the Chief Constables concerned with a view to securingthe maximum of uniformity of practice with London. It would be legally and administratively possible to ban the tour. But thenecessary amendments to the instructions to Immigration Officers,though they would not require the formal approval of Parliament,would have to be laid before the House of Commons; and it wouldbe difficult to avoid a major debate, with unpredictableconsequences. Meanwhile, he had received from the organiser ofthe &quot; Stop the 70 Tour Campaign &quot;, Mr. Peter Hain, a letter asking for assurances that the police would not adopt discriminatorymethods in dealing with any demonstrations. He proposed toreturn a firm reply, pointing out that police policy for the controlof demonstrations was well known and that no such assurances were necessary.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be inadvisable to take direct Government action with a view to stopping the South African cricket tour. Although it was perhaps unlikelythat the Cricket Council would now cancel the tour, public opinionseemed to be moving against it. The police, however, would havea difficult task; and it was important that insinuations such as those contained in Mr. Peter Hain&apos;s letter to the Home Secretary shouldbe firmly rebutted. It was suggested that, if evidence came to lightsuggesting that the Stop the 70 Tour organisation or other bodiesopposed to the South African tour were concerting plans to interferewith cricket matches against the South Africans, this might laythem open to prosecution for conspiracy, even before such planshad actually been put into operation. It was therefore important that nothing should be said in correspondence with Mr. Hain orany of the other parties concerned which might prejudice this possibility. On the other hand a prosecution for conspiracy was less likely to be effective than one based on an actual breach of thepeace.In further discussion reference was made to the employment by the MCC and other cricket clubs of personnel and guard dogsfrom private security agencies. While there was no objection tosuch measures for the protection of grounds and premises whichwere the property of the clubs, the control of crowds and the
maintenance of order at matches should be enforced by, or underthe direction of, the police and there should be no question of their being supplanted for these purposes by private agencies.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister, theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the HomeSecretary and of the points made in discussion.CONFIDENTIALClosure of 4.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theGlyncorrwg Cabinet (C (70) 56) to which was attached a memorandum by the colliery Minister of Defence for Equipment on the closure of Glyncorrwgcolliery.The Prime Minister said that he had received representations from the Minister of Defence for Equipment about the proposedclosure of the Glyncorrwg colliery. The Minister had noDepartmental interest in the colliery which was situated in his constituency. While there could be no question of allowingdecisions to be reopened in Cabinet on purely constituency grounds,this particular case appeared to involve wider considerations whichhad not so far been collectively considered by Ministers. In theordinary way he would have arranged for the matter to be referred,in accordance with precedent, to the appropriate CabinetCommittee; but as the colliery was due to be closed on the following day this had not been possible. He had accordingly thought it right,exceptionally, to bring the matter to the attention of the Cabinet.The Paymaster General said that, following the meeting of the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy (SEP) on 8 April,he had asked the Chairman of the National Coal Board (NCB),Lord Robens, to reconsider his decision to close the colliery. LordRobens had, however, advised him very strongly that this wouldbe a mistake. Working conditions at Glyncorrwg were bad andunpleasant for the men; and this had led to feelings of frustrationamong both men and management, with the result that the collierysuffered from a continuous spate of disputes and high absenteeism.Lord Robens had assured him that the men concerned recognisedthat the natural conditions were insurmountable and that the collieryhad to close; and that the NCB would be able to offer virtually allthe men under 55 years old jobs at other collieries where they were urgently needed. In these circumstances, he did not feel justifiedin making a specific offer to cover losses under the Coal industry act in order to keep the pit open.The Secretary of State for Wales said that he had been in close touch with the Paymaster General throughout and accepted his
secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of technology (C (70) 53) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury (C (70) 55)about financial assistance to private industry.The Minister of Technology said that on 12 January the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy (SEP) had invited him, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, andthe Minister of State, Board of Trade, to give further considerationto the implications of the decision to meet the liabilities of BeagleAircraft Limited in the light of the Attorney GeneraFs advice.While the Government were not legally bound by the provisions ofthe Companies Acts relating to fraudulent trading, they were undera political, if not a moral, obligation to refrain from acting in ways which, if indulged in by others, might be held to be in breach ofFinancialassistanceto privateindustry11441-23ECEETDdecision. Glyncorrwg was an inaccessible and isolated village; andLord Robens&apos; view that, given the bad physical conditions, it wasin the men&apos;s best interest that the pit should close would be generally accepted locally. There was no disposition on the partof the National Union of Mineworkers to try to save the colliery,though their attitude had radically altered when they learned thatthe NCB proposed to import smokeless briquettes from France.In discussion it was agreed that there were no grounds for seeking to halt the closure of the colliery. The decision to importbriquettes could, however, damage the Governmenfs relations withthe miners which were at present generally good, and its implicationsshould be fully examined. Further consideration should also begiven to the effect of the NCB&apos;s failure to provide adequate suppliesof smokeless fuel on the Governmenfs attempts to combatpollution; and to the wider problems arising from the use of north sea gas and the growing pressure for clean air.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the action taken by the Paymaster General and agreed that the decision to allow the colliery to be closed should stand. Ministers should consult the Paymaster General before making any public reference to the closure or to the NCB&apos;sbehaviour in relation to the Glyncorrwg colliery or the supply ofsmokeless fuel. He would arrange for SEP to consider urgentlythe wider problems which had been raised in the discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
them. Where the Government intervened in the private sector, themost important factor affecting their indirect liability to the creditorsof the company concerned was the extent to which their activitiesmight have created a legitimate presumption that they stood behind the company. The entire circumstances of the Governmentsinvolvement rather than the particular form of their interest werecrucial. There were great difficulties in limiting the Governmentspotential liabilities. In some cases, the purpose of government intervention was to restore confidence; and this could not beachieved unless they were seen to stand behind the companyconcerned. If financial assistance were provided and its use by aweak management were left unsupervised, there was a risk of themoney being lost and matters going from bad to worse; but if theGovernment supervised the management of the firm there was a riskof their acquiring a responsibility towards the company&apos;s creditors.Moreover, although it might be desirable for assistance to beprovided through an outside body wherever possible, this couldonly be done where independent statutory bodies such as theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation and the Shipping industry board were prepared to co-operate. If the Government decided to intervene, they must be prepared to meet the costs of doing so; butthey should not enter into such commitments without a fullawareness of the implications. Further consideration should begiven to the possibility of drawing up a code of conduct on the lines suggested by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, but taking full accountof the difficulties likely to be encountered in practice.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while there was a longestablished code of conduct (partly enshrined in company legislation)to govern the actions of private industry, there was no establishedphilosophy or practice governing intervention by the Governmentin individual private firms. It was not generally appropriate to claim the protection of Crown exemption from statutory requirements. If, however, the advice of the Law Officers on thecircumstances which might amount to fraudulent trading were accepted though the standards indicated were much stricter thanthose actually applied in commercial life it might not be possiblefor the Government to intervene where the public interestreasonably required it to do so except at an undetermined andpotentially prohibitive cost. Satisfactory control of public expenditure could not be maintained in these circumstances. In thelight of experience and of the legal advice received, he suggestedthat the Ministers concerned might be invited to draw up a code of conduct on the lines indicated in his memorandum. This should both ensure that the full potential liabilities were taken into accountbefore the Government intervened in the affairs of a company; andthat the form of the intervention was such as to minimise the risk of
incurring additional liabilities. In the meantime, no impliedcommitments should be made to the managements of firms whichthe Government had assisted or were considering assisting.In discussion it was emphasised that where the Governmentacted in such a way as to create a legitimate expectation that it stoodbehind a company they would become liable, in terms of politicalreality, to meet its debts. The Government could hardly continueto enforce the Companies Acts if they were themselves acting in breach of the spirit of their provisions. In spite of the difficulties,it would be helpful if a code of conduct were drawn up; and alldecisions to intervene in a company&apos;s affairs should be taken only inthe light of legal advice as to the extent of any liabilities which mightbe implicitly assumed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister of technology and the Attorney General, might be invited to arrangeurgently for a group of senior officials to consider the problemfurther in the light of the discussion and to draw up a code of conduct on the broad lines suggested by the Chief Secretary. this might cover, inter alia, the need for a standard system ofmonitoring the performance of companies to which the Governmenthad given selective financial assistance so as to provide early warning of any deterioration in the company&apos;s prospects; the need to ensurethat, when the possibility of assisting a particular company was firstconsidered, as much information as possible was available about the potential long term liabilities so that they might be taken intoaccount before decisions were taken on the extent or form ofassistance; the information which should be sought from an assistedcompany when it had ceased to be financially viable on its own andthe amount and type of information which Government couldrequire a company to supply without becoming involved in itsmanagement; and the relative disadvantages of grants, loans andshareholding as a means of assisting companies which were in financial difficulty. In the meantime, it was important to ensurethat Ministers had adequate advance warning of, and time toconsider, any further proposals to assist companies in difficulty.The Minister of Technology should report to SEP as soon as possible on the complex of problems involving Rolls-Royce, the RB-211engine and the A. 300B and BAC-311 aircraft projects. It wouldalso be helpful if he informed SEP about the problems of ShortBrothers &amp; Harland and the likely nature and timing of any decisions which might be required, particularly in view of the widerimplications for Northern Ireland.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister of Technology and the attorney general, to arrange for officials to examine the possibilityof drawing up a code of conduct on the lines indicated inthe Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion;and to report the outcome to the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology to report to SEP assoon as possible the latest position in resect of Rolls-Royce and the associated aircraft projects on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in summing up.Situationin theshipbuildingindustry(previous reference :CC (66) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the paymaster general (C (70) 54) about the shipbuilding industry. They also had before them his memorandum (SEP (70) 50) about the future of theCammell Laird Group.The Paymaster General said that the assistance which theGovernment had given to the shipbuilding industry following thereport of the Shipbuilding Inquiry Committee under Mr. R. M.Geddes and the Shipbuilding Industry Act 1967 had enabled theindustry to obtain a larger share of an increasing world total oforders for new ships. Most firms had full order books. Manyorders had, however, been taken at prices which made insufficientallowance for cost escalation; even the better managements hadbooked vessels at such low prices that they were faced with losses on current contracts. A number of firms were already in difficulty and clearly had no reserves to meet the problem. These includedUpper Clyde Shipbuilders, Harland &amp; Wolff and the CammellLaird Group. A number of other firms were expected to run intocash flow problems arising from current unprofitable contracts.The industry had a long history of instability, and government assistance would be required for some years yet unless they wereprepared to see forced liquidations with massive redundancies in areas already suffering from unemployment and damaging consequences for the balance of payments. In the immediate future,it would be unrealistic to expect full viability from the shipbuildingfirms and he hoped that the Committee would agree that theMinister of Technology should use his powers under the 1967 Actto prolong the life of the Shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) for oneyear from the end of 1970; this might be conveniently announcedthat afternoon in the course of the Second Reading Debate on the shipbuilding Industry Bill.
The Cammell Laird Group had serious financial problems. Thefailure of their shipbuilding activities, which employed some 8,000people, might lead to the failure of the Group as a whole which hada further 12,000 employees. He considered that it would be wrong to allow the Group to collapse in disorder. At his request, theIndustrial Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) had reviewed theposition urgently; and they had put forward constructive proposalsdesigned to mobilise the assets of the Group as a whole and to enlist the help of the shipyards principal customers. Under this scheme,the Group&apos;s shipbuilding interests would have been hived off and a50 per cent interest in them sold to the SIB. The 1958-59 would thenlend the Group  4- 5 million secured on its non-shipbuildingassets; and the shipowners would make available another  4 million or so through increased prices or loans. The parent company would pass these sums on to the shipbuilding company, leaving it free of loss and with enough assets to enable it to raise working capital tosee it through its current shipbuilding commitments. However, theSIB were unwilling to subscribe for any shares in the shipbuildingcompany, though they were prepared to assist in the reorganisation of the yard. The 1958-59, on the other hand, were not prepared to go ahead with the scheme as a whole unless a 50 per cent shareholdingcould be sold either to the SIB or to some other shipbuilding group,so making it clear that the 1958-59 themselves were associated only withthe management of the non-shipbuilding sector of the Group.Discussions were continuing. He invited the Cabinet to agree thathe should continue exploring the possibility of a rescue operation on the lines indicated, but without entering into any commitments.It should, however, be appreciated that the shipbuilding company would continue to make losses for, say, the next two years. Theshipping companies would not be prepared to put in large sumsunless they obtained some assurances from the Government that the yard would continue until the vessels they had ordered were completed. The losses in the meantime might be quite considerable and it was not possible to put a realistic value on the assets of the yard if there were to be an eventual liquidation.In discussion it was suggested that if a large continuingcommitment to the shipbuilding industry were foreseen, theGovernment should undertake an urgent internal review of its policy towards the industry. The key to the industry&apos;s problems layin the slow improvement of productivity which was substantially below that of other European countries as well as Japan.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposal to extend the life of the SIB for afurther year.   The Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic
Policy might resume discussion of the problems of the shipbuilding industry the following week. In the meantime, the paymaster general, in consultation with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, might continue his discussions about the future of the Cammell LairdGroup, though without entering into commitments.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed that the life of the Shipbuilding Industry board should be extended by one year from the end of 1970.(3) Invited the Paymaster General, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to continue his discussions onthe future of the Cammell Laird Group.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30 April, 1970.
