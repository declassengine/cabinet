Reference :CC (70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 5)State for Scotland (C (70) 10) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C (70) 9) on the Reorganisation of the National Health Service(NHS).The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that at their previous meeting the Cabinet had agreed that it was impracticable to bring the new integrated health service under local control andthat the division of functions between that service and localauthorities should be as set out in Annex 2 of C (70) 8. But theyhad not decided whether responsibility for children under five should rest with the social services committee, or with the education committee, of a local authority. The Committee on Local authority and Allied Personal Social Services (the Seebohm Committee) had unanimously recommended that the responsibility for the day care of children under five and for day nurseries should attach to the newsocial services committees. This was probably the right solution,although there would clearly be a need for the closest co-operationbetween the two committees if the educational interests of thechildren, about which the Secretary of State for Education and science was concerned, were to be safeguarded. It was not essential,however, that the matter should be decided at this juncture; and he proposed that it should be further considered in the ministerial committee on Social Services.The main issue before the Cabinet was the composition of thearea health authorities which he was proposing should be set up withareas coterminous (outside London) with those of the mainauthorities which would emerge from the reorganisation of localgovernment. These area health authorities would have executivecontrol of the integrated service and would be responsible directly to the Secretary of State; but there would be administrative devolution to district sub-committees with strong local representation.There would also be regional health councils for the planning of hospital services, post-graduate education and other activitiesrequiring to be organised over wider areas. These would be mainlyadvisory bodies, although they might be given executive responsibility in limited fields. Given that the Government were responsible toParliament for the administration of the NHS and provided almost all of its revenue, it seemed natural that the Secretary of State should appoint, if not the whole of the members of the authorities, then atany rate a majority; and with the approval of the ministerial committee on Social Services he had consulted the local authority associations and professional and other bodies on the basis of11367A 2SECRETReorganisation 1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda by of the National the Secretary of State for Social Services (C (70) 8), the Secretary ofHealth Service(Previous
proposals which would give his appointees a bare majority. It was clear, however, that the local authorities wanted substantially greater representation on the area health authorities than waspossible on this basis; and, taking account of the views expressed bythe Royal Commission on Local Government in England and of thefact that the NHS would be assuming responsibility for a substantialblock of services at present operated by local authorities, it was politically difficult to deny them this. Moreover, the necessaryco-operation between the new health service and the social workservices of local authorities could not be secured unless the latterbelieved that they were genuinely participating in the operation ofthe service. He had therefore considered whether the Governmenfsresponsibility for the NHS was compatible with his appointees being in a minority on the area health authorities and had concluded thatit was, provided that the Secretary of State had adequate control overthe expenditure of the authorities. It was not the case that control could only be exercised through the power of appointment; indeed the present NHS, for all that the regional hospital boards were wholly appointed by him, had not in practice shown itself veryresponsive to Government control. What was essential was thatthere should be control over the budgets of the area health authoritiesand that the Secretary of State should be supported by an organisation adequate to achieve this. He accordingly proposed that each local health authority should have its block allocation of financebut that there should also be control over important sectors of capitalexpenditure such as hospital building. Given this apparatus offinancial control, reinforced by the appointment of a paid chairmanto each authority, he believed that the proportion of the members appointed by the Secretary of State was not particularly significant;and he proposed that he should be content to appoint only one-thirdof the members, the local authorities appointing another third andthe professions and staff associations the remainder. This would not wholly satisfy the local authorities; but in his judgment it wouldgive them a sufficiently large stake in the service to ensure their co-operation.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that, while he accepted thatappointees did not necessarily reflect the views of those whoappointed them, the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals raised a majorpoint of principle. The Government were answerable to parliament for the NHS; and the Accounting Officers concerned had to answer to the Public Accounts Committee for the expenditure involved.Could they effectively discharge that responsibility if the Secretaryof State nominated only the chairman and one-third of the membersof each area health authority? Improved financial control on thelines proposed by the Secretary of State was not in itself an adequate
answer to that question; and it was difficult to argue that theGovernment would be seen to be discharging their responsibility toParliament unless the Secretary of State appointed at least a majorityof the members.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, despite the accepted differences in the present organisation of the health services in England and Scotland, he could not support the proposals of theSecretary of State for Social Services. The present organisation ofthe NHS in Scotland gave the Secretary of State effective control;and in putting forward proposals for reorganisation he had beencareful not to be too specific on the composition of the new health authorities. In his judgment it was important that the responsible minister should be seen to have effective control of the service andthat there should be no risk of its becoming dominated by representatives of the professions. It would therefore be undesirable that the Government, by announcing specific proposals for the composition of area health authorities in England, should riskprejudicing forthcoming consultations in Scotland and so make itimpossible to adopt a solution suited to the needs of that country,especially since the professions were organised on a Great Britainbasis and whatever was said in the English Green Paper would bethe starting point for negotiations in Scotland. Moreover, it was doubtful whether, if chairmen of area health authorities were paid, itwould be possible to secure men of as high a calibre as those who atpresent gave their services in Scotland on a voluntary basis.In discussion it was accepted that the proposals put forward bythe Secretary of State for Social Services represented an acceptablecompromise in circumstances in which no ideal solution was available. There was strong political pressure for a greater degreeof democracy in the administration of the NHS; equally, however,it could not be denied that the Government were responsible for theservice and were accountable for its expenditure. But localauthorities were responsible in their own right for spending even greater sums than were involved in the running of the NHS; and experience provided no grounds for thinking that elected local representatives were necessarily less responsible than Governmentappointees. Even if the Secretary of State appointed a majority ofthe members of every health authority, the individuals concerned,once appointed, would develop a loyalty to the authority on whichthey served and there was no way of ensuring that they would alwayscomply with the Governments wishes. In so far as the courseadvocated by the Secretary of State for Social Services proved to beless appropriate in Scotland, and possibly in Wales, it should be
possible for the Secretaries of State for those countries to justify the discrepancy by reference to the specifically Scottish and Welshfactors which explained the existing differences between the health services concerned.At the same time financial control limited to the total budgets of area health authorities was not likely to prove adequate in itself.Previous attempts to reduce expenditure on the NHS had shown thatthe Secretary of State had neither the knowledge nor the powers to insist on savings being made where they would do least damage tothe service; and, while it was desirable that every area authority should be given a block allocation of finance and that there shouldbe no interference with their judgment on minor matters, careful thought should be given to working out arrangements which wouldgive the Secretary of State adequate control over major items of current expenditure as well as over capital expenditure.Efficient management would be of critical importance; and itwas therefore essential that the staffs of area health authorities should include individuals whose training and experience comprised bothmedical and managerial skills. Further thought also needed to begiven to defining the functions of the proposed regional healthcouncils and district sub-committees and to the manpowerimplications of the proposed changes.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that it was impracticable to bring the new integratedhealth service under local control and that the division of functions between that service and local authorities should be as proposed bythe Secretary of State for Social Services. The Secretary of Statefor Education and Science should bring before the ministerial committee on Social Services the question whether responsibility for children under five should rest with the social service committees oflocal authorities or with the education committees. The Cabinet also agreed that the integrated health service should be administered byarea, health authorities with areas matching those of the unitaryauthorities and metropolitan districts proposed by the RoyalCommission on Local Government in England, with administrative devolution to district sub-committees and with regional healthcouncils exercising predominantly advisory functions. As regardsthe composition of the area health authorities they accepted theproposal that the Secretary of State should appoint the chairman ofeach authority and one-third of the members, a further third beingnominated by the local authorities and the remainder by the professions concerned. The question of the basis of payment of thechairman would need to be further considered, in the light of theviews of the Treasury and the Civil Service Department; and more detailed thought must be given to the powers which the Secretary of
Pay ofSchoolTeachersin Englandand Wales(previous reference :CC(70) 1stConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The First Secretary of State said that officials of theDepartment of Employment and Productivity had met the TeachersPanel of the Burnham Committee on 16th January in order to try to persuade them to accept arbitration. The teachers had maintained their refusal to co-operate in a reference to arbitration; but therehad perhaps been some signs of a weakening in their attitude.Together with the Secretary of State for Education and Science shetherefore intended to meet the Teachers Panel later in the week inorder to urge them once again to accept a reference to arbitration.At this meeting they would not make any further offer of a pay increase but would repeat the assurances authorised by the cabinet and already given by officials, namely that there would be anindependent chairman for the arbitration panel and that theGovernment would not seek to override any arbitration award onthis occasion by making use of the appropriate provisions under the remuneration of Teachers Act. They would add a further assurance that the Secretary of State for Education and Science would beprepared to consider with the teachers&apos; representatives the questionof new machinery for settling pay and conditions of service and thata reference would be made to the National Board for Prices and incomes on the structure of teachers&apos; pay with a view to the Board&apos;sreport being available to be taken into account in the negotiationsfor pay from April 1971. In the light of the teachers&apos; reaction tothese assurances it would be necessary to consider what further action might be required.State would need in order to maintain adequate control over theexpenditure of area health authorities on the lines agreed by theCabinet during their discussion. These issues, together with such other matters as the appointment of a Health Commissioner, couldbe further discussed, if necessary, in the course of the drafting of theproposed Green Paper.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of Statefor Social Services to arrange for the Green Paper onthe National Health Service to be drafted accordingly.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science tobring the question of responsibility for children underfive before the Ministerial Committee on Social Services.
The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet endorsed these proposals. The extremist attitude which some of the teachers&apos; representatives were advocating was perhapsbeginning to evoke a reaction on the part of the more moderateelements, who were not indifferent to the effect of their action onthe welfare of their pupils; and discreet steps might be taken tosecure greater publicity for the essentially reasonable character ofthe Government^ policy and the weaknesses in the teachers&apos; case.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.commission for Industryand Manpower(previous reference :CC(70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (70) 12), to which was attached a revised version of the consultative document on the Governmenfs proposals for theestablishment of a Commission for Industry and Manpower (CIM).The First Secretary of State said that in accordance withthe decisions of the Cabinet at their previous meeting the consultative document had been redrafted to include the points of Clarificationwhioh had been suggested. The introductory section had beenexpanded to set out more fully the reasons for the government&apos;s proposals. She had given further thought to the possibility of amending the document in such a way that the circumstances inwhich firms might be referred to the CIM were made more precise.If, however, the criteria for reference were to be specified in full inthe document and in the legislation, it would be necessary to addthree additional factors of this kind, as set out in paragraph 6 ofC (70) 12, to the illustrative list. Two of them were already includedin the definition of public interest in the Monopolies Legislation; andthe third had been specifically proposed in Cmnd. 4237. Butdifficulties might be expected at the Committee stage of the proposed bill in ensuring the passage of such a detailed list of the circumstances in which references might be made. Moreover, the fears of the confederation of British Industry (CBI) could only be allayed, asthey had been in relation to both the existing Monopolies legislation and the Industrial Expansion Act, when they saw how it wasadministered in practice. She was reinforced in her view by theadvice of the Chairman of the Monopolies Commission that to departfrom the existing practice and to specify the criteria for reference indetail would lead to undesirable rigidities of practice without allayingin advance the fears of industry.
11367BThere was one substantive change in the redrafted document.It now referred to the prior notification of price increases and pay settlements without specifying a period of notice; this contrasted withthe earlier drafts and the White Paper on Prices and Incomes after1969 (Cmnd. 4237), which referred to the continuation of the early warning system. The decision not to continue stand stills on wage settlements implied that early warning of such settlements could notbe provided for in its present form, since this would have to include&quot; penal provisions &quot; for unions which tried to coerce employers to implement a pay settlement during the early warning period. prices could not be treated differently. A form of notification, however,would still be valuable and would provide some degree of statutorybacking for the voluntary arrangements which production department would seek to continue.In discussion it was argued on the one hand that, while thepresent wide powers to investigate situations where a firm held a technical monopoly in a particular product should continue, the newpower to enquire into the behaviour of large firms generally shouldbe tightly limited to particular circumstances; and these should be specified in detail in the consultative document, whether or not theywere so listed in the legislation. The references in paragraph 6 ofthe revised draft document to the retention of powers under the monopolies Legislation should be strengthened and the word&quot;normally&quot; should be deleted from the first line of paragraph 13.There was no evidence that this would not cover all the circumstances in which it would be desirable to make a reference to the CIM. Onthe other hand it was argued that to draw such a distinction betweenthe circumstances in which a technical monopoly and a major firmwithout a monopoly might be referred to the CIM would run counter to the policy which had already been agreed and was thebasis of the whole of the draft document. The increasedconcentration of industrial power made it desirable to ensure thatthe public interest was adequately considered where the domination of so many industries by a small number of firms meant that it was increasingly difficult to rely on traditional competitive market forcesalone; and a measure of accountability should be accepted by bothTMiKlir*   onrl   n-ni-woto   nn^Ar^oVinftc   wVlftr/a   tli^CA  \X7 *TA  to f\f*arf*f*protected from market forces. Such circumstances could arise wherethere was no technical monopoly in one particular product; and itwas right therefore to adhere as closely as possible to the existingframework of the Monopolies legislation, while extending its application to cover all the largest firms. If the list of criteria for reference was set out in the document, it would not be possible to resist pressure to include it in the Bill, thereby complicating its
passage and introducing undesirable rigidities into its administration.It would be wrong to omit the word &quot; normally &quot; if it were theintention to cover the points set out in paragraph 6 of C (70) 12.In further discussion the following points were made (a) Paragraph 6 of the draft document should be amended tomake it clear that the scope of references to the CIM would coverall the various matters which had in the past been covered by, orbeen liable to be dealt with by, the two existing bodies, not only those with which they had in practice dealt.(b) If it were now announced that the early warning system wasto be replaced by a simple process of notification with no time limit,the food industries might not be prepared to renegotiate the voluntaryearly warning arrangements on the basis which had been anticipated.Moreover, if notification were no longer required 28 days beforeprices were increased, the opportunity for discussion which hadfrequently resulted in the withdrawal or reduction of proposed price increases would be lost. It would also be more difficult to deal withcomplaints about food prices and to maintain a watch on pricetrends. The change proposed was probably inevitable; but furtherconsideration should be given to its implications.(c) It might be desirable in the draft legislation to take powerto require individual companies to publish financial information about the various sections of their undertakings. This would giveeffect to suggestions made by the Monopolies Commission in their general Observations on Mergers. It would be helpful if this additional proposal could be agreed by the time the consultative document was published.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the problem of defining the circumstances inwhich reference would be made to the CIM might best be dealt withby omitting the word &quot; normally &quot; from the first line of paragraph 13of the draft document and amending sub-paragraph 13 (Mi) to read&quot; the use made of the dominating position held . . .&quot;, on theunderstanding that in this context the concept of dominance includedlarge firms as well as those with a technical monopoly. On this basis the phrase would cover the three additional criteria for reference towhich the First Secretary had referred. The Cabinet also agreed thata notification procedure should replace the existing early warning system for wage and price increases, and that paragraph 36 should stand. But officials should give further consideration to the implications of the change. The document amended on the lines indicated and to meet the point at (a) above might now be issued onthe basis proposed by the First Secretary of State in C (70) 7.Arrangements should be made to clear the proposal at (c) above by
confidential. The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that since January 1968 the Greater London Council(GLC) had been preparing proposals for the protection of Londonagainst tidal flooding under the supervision of a broadly basedcommittee, of which the Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of housing (Lord Kennet) was Chairman. The GLC were publishingtheir report that day. It made it clear that the risk of serious tidalflooding in London and on Lower Thamesside was substantially greater than had previously been thought. The report therefore proposed that a movable barrier should be constructed across the thames and that the banks of the river downstream should be raised.Further experimental work was needed, however, before the precisesite of the barrier could be settled; nor had the Government had anopportunity to study the technical and financial implications of thereport. In the circumstances the Ministers directly concerned had agreed the terms of a Parliamentary statement to be made duringthe afternoon. This made it clear that the Government agreed thatLondon and Lower Thamesside must be defended against tidal floodsand that the remaining studies should be completed as soon asdirect discussion between the Ministers concerned, if possible beforethe proposed Press Conference which was now scheduled for22nd January.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State:(i) To arrange for the consultative document to be amendedon the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(ii) To arrange for the consultative document to be issued asproposed in C (70) 7.(iii) To arrange for the Ministers concerned to be furtherconsulted about the proposal to take a new power torequire publication of additional information following areport by the CIM.(iv) To arrange, in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food and other Ministers concerned, forfurther consideration to be given to the implications of theproposal to replace the early warning system by aprovision for prior notification of price and wage increases.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th January, 1970.possible. It was not possible at this stage, however, to make adefinite commitment to undertake particular works to a particulartimescale.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for local Government and Regional Planning.(2) Agreed that a Parliamentary statement on the lines proposed should be made later that day.
