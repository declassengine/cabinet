ParliamentaryAffairsFuture BusinessSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. It was agreed thatthe debate on the Second Reading of the Industrial Relations Billshould be held on 1 June and that the Committee stage should beginas soon as possible thereafter. The exact timing would necessarily depend on progress made with the Commission for Industry and manpower (CIM) Bill which had so far been disappointingly slow.The Cabinet agreed that urgent discussions should be arrangedthrough the usual channels with a view to agreeing withthe Opposition a voluntary timetable for the remaining stages of theCIM Bill; but that if this proved impossible the Prime minister should be authorised, in consultation with the First Secretary ofState, the Lord President of the Council and the Chief Whip, todecide whether a timetable Motion should be introduced and, if so,when it should be announced and debated.National The Secretary of State for Social Services said that there was aSuperannuation stTong case for postponing the introduction of the earnings relatedA pension scheme until 1 April, 1973, so as to allow more time for thelarge number of occupational pension schemes which would beaffected to make the necessary adjustments. If the introduction ofthe scheme were to be postponed it would be desirable to make anearly announcement about it. A convenient opportunity to do thiswould arise on 12 May when the relevant clause of theNational Superannuation Bill would be considered in StandingCommittee; alternatively an announcement could be made duringthe Report stage of the Bill after the Whitsun Recess.In discussion it was agreed that further consideration would need to be given to the implications of postponing the introductionof the scheme and that no announcement should be made before the whitsun Recess.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to circulate for consideration at their next meeting a memorandum onthe implications of postponing the introduction of the earnings related pension scheme until April 1973.industrial action atHMSO(previous reference:CC (70) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1)11441-4The Lord Privy Seal said that, in consultation with the group ofMinisters mainly concerned, he had recently reviewed the emergency arrangements for the production of essential Parliamentary papers in the event of industrial action at Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office(HMSO).   The main outstanding problems, which the group were a 2
pursuing, related to financial responsibility for the emergency arrangements and the need to obtain the agreement of the Houseauthorities that they would be willing to activate them in the eventof printing difficulties at HMSO.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Lord Privy Seal.OverseaAffairsCambodia(previous reference:CC(70) 20thConclusions,Minute 1)FijiSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thePresident of the United States, Mr. Nixon, had reiterated his statement that the United States intervention in Cambodia was limited in scope and duration and had been undertaken to protect the withdrawal of United States forces from Vietnam. TheSecretary-General of the United Nations, U Thant, had appealedpublicly for an international conference on Cambodia; and we shouldactively follow up this suggestion. The People&apos;s Republic of Chinaand the Government of North Korea had now, as had been expected, withdrawn their diplomatic representatives from theCambodian capital.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, thanks in large measure to the efforts of the Minister of State for Foreign and commonwealth Affairs, Lord Shepherd, the Fijian constitutional conference recently held in London had reached a successful conclusion. It had not been necessary for the British Governmentto impose a solution; and it had been clearly understood by allconcerned and there would be no British defence commitment toFiji after independence. Fiji would now proceed to independence on 10 October, 1970.Uganda: The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that Mr. Lea,Mr. Brian Lea pjrst Secretary at the United Kingdom High Commission, Kampala,who had recently been kidnapped, had now been released. Advicehad been sent to other diplomatic missions in Africa on measureswhich could be taken to guard against similar incidents.The Uganda authorities appeared to have done all they could to secure Mr. Lea&apos;s release: but the motives for his kidnapping and subsequent return remained obscure. The President of Uganda,Dr. Obote, had said that he had evidence that the kidnapping was ahoax organised by Mr. Lea and his wife; and he had asked for an assurance that the British Government were not involved.Dr. Obote&apos;s motives in promoting this inherently improbableexplanation of the incident were not clear. But it might be advisable to adopt a suggestion by our High Commissioner in uganda that we should send a legal expert to Kampala who could
examine, together with a Ugandan lawyer and a British official withSpecial Branch experience who had been sent to Uganda to help inthe search for Mr. Lea, any evidence which President Obote might produce in support of his allegation.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.Irish The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the PrimeRepublic Minister of the Irish Republic, Mr. Lynch, had just dismissed two members of his Cabinet, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Haughey, andthe Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries, Mr. Blaney. The Ministerfor Local Government, Mr. Boland, and the latter&apos;s parliamentary secretary, Mr. Brennan, had resigned in sympathy. The grounds forthe dismissals were the alleged involvement of the two Ministers inan attempt to import arms unlawfully into the Republic. This crisishad been developing for some time; but it appeared to have come toa head very suddenly, as was evidenced by the fact that the irish minister for Foreign Affairs, on hearing the news of the dismissals,had cancelled discussions in London at very short notice and had returned abruptly to Dublin.Although Mr. Lynch had received a unanimous vote of confi-dence at the subsequent meeting of the Deputies of the GovernmentParty (Fianna Fail), his position had clearly been badly shaken. Thedismissed Ministers had been leading advocates of a more extremepolicy in relation to Northern Ireland. So long as they were still inthe Cabinet, Mr. Lynch had been able to exercise some degree ofcontrol over them, in conformity with the relatively moderate policywhich we had succeeded in persuading him to adopt. It must nowbe doubtful, however, whether he would be able to continue tocontrol the situation as we should wish. The Irish Embassy hadalready indicated that the Government of the Republic would welcome a public statement by the British Government that theywould not rule out discussion of changes in the constitutionalrelationship between the Republic and Northern Ireland. But the overriding consideration so far as we were concerned must remain the importance of refraining from any action which would weaken the position of the Northern Ireland Prime Minister, MajorChichester Clark. With unstable Governments on both sides of the border the outlook gave cause for anxiety.The Home Secretary said that allegations in the Press that theaction which had been taken against the two Irish Ministers had beenstimulated by the British Government had no basis in fact, apart
from the normal exchanges of information between the countries concerned about illicit arms trading. Major Chichester Clarkintended to make a statement in the Northern Ireland House ofCommons that afternoon, which he hoped would lead to a resolution of support for the Government, to which all Parties could subscribe.He had undertaken to consult us about the wording of this statement.Meanwhile, a Private Notice Question had been put down in theHouse of Commons at Westminster by Mr. Philip Goodhart, mp.He proposed to emphasise in his reply the seriousness with which we regarded the allegations of gun-running, if these were substantiated,and our conviction that a settlement in Ireland was possible only onthe basis of the policies of co-operation and the rejection of violenceadvocated by Mr. Lynch in his recent speech at Tralee. He wouldalso make it clear once again that the Border was not in question.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was important to dispose of allegations of British intervention in the dismissal of the two Irish Ministers and to rebut the unfoundedreports of secret meetings between British and Irish Ministers todiscuss a federal solution of the Irish problem.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statements by the Home Secretary and theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and of the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion.ThreatenedAfricanBoycott ofCommonwealthGames(previous reference:CC(70) 19thConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET*3. The Prime Minister said that, following the previous discussion in Cabinet and his television interview of 30 April, he had asked the Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, Mr. Ho well, to hold a further meeting of his inter-departmental committee. As a result, the Minister of State had senthim a report, copies of which had been supplied to the Cabinet,reinforcing the earlier conclusion that the Government should not take direct action to stop the South African cricket tour.Consideration had been given to the desirability of a formal appeal by the Government to the Cricket Council to cancel the tour; butthe arguments set out in the Minister of State&apos;s report and the risks of a rebuff from the Council suggested that this course also would be inadvisable. It would be wiser to continue to encourage pressure on the Council by appropriate individuals and organisations, who might usefully emphasise that to persist with the tour might put at risk future Test series with the West Indians and other non-whitecricketing countries.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
The Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, said that his committee were still of the opinion thatthe Government should not, at this stage at any rate, go beyond what the Prime Minister had said in his television interview of30 April. Several helpful private initiatives were in hand. Inparticular an approach by the Bishop of Woolwich had made someimpact on the Cricket Council by bringing to their attention,apparently for the first time, the damage which might be done to race relations in this country if the South African tour proceeded. TheCouncil had indicated their readiness to consider this point if theywere approached by the &quot;proper persons&quot;; and subsequently thePresident of the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) had undertaken to re-examine the race relations aspect of the tour. The ScottishCommonwealth Games Committee had now become concerned thatparticipation in the Commonwealth Games at Edinburgh bynon-white Commonwealth countries might be drastically reduced asa result of the Indian Governments instruction to its sportsauthorities not to take part in the Games if the South African tourtook place and the possibility of similar action by some CaribbeanGovernments. It seemed likely that the Scottish Games Committee,possibly in conjunction with the Scottish Sports Council who weremeeting that day, would make a public statement calling on theCricket Council to consider the implications of their present attitudefor other sports. The Chairman of the Commonwealth GamesFederation, Mr. Ross, who had until now refused to intervenedirectly, had indicated that, if the Scottish Games authorities made such a statement, he would regard it as his duty to approach theCricket Council.The Home Secretary said that he had some time ago suggested to the Community Relations Commission that they should approach the Cricket Council about the adverse effects of the South Africantour on race relations in this country. They had not done so, as aresult of opposition by some members of the Commission. But theChairman of the Commission, Mr. Cousins, had now written to theCricket Council; and this might exert some useful influence.Meanwhile, police arrangements were proceeding on the assumptionthat the cricket tour would take place. Press reports that he had informed the MCC that the police would welcome the assistance ofvolunteer stewards were not correct. But the police had, with his approval, formulated a code of advice on the conduct of stewardsat the matches against the South African team; and this advicewould be widely publicised in the hope that it might serve as a warning to potential demonstrators. As a result of a discussion which he had had with Sir Edward Boyle, mp, the moderate
opponents of the tour intended to draw up a code of conduct fordemonstrators. This, too, would be widely publicised; and itshould help to separate the moderate faction from the more radicalelements associated with the &quot; Stop the 70 Tour &quot; committee, whowere believed to have been in touch with extremist colouredorganisations. Within the next week he would review with theCommissioner of Police for the Metropolis the latter&apos;s operationalplans for maintaining public order during the cricket tour. Therewas no doubt that some degree of disorder must be expected if the tour proceeded. But there was at present no reason to suppose thatthe situation could not be contained, as similar situations had beenin the past.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the former LordProvost of Edinburgh had made an unhelpful intervention bycriticising the alleged blackmailing tactics of the Africans. On theother hand a potentially useful Parliamentary initiative was being undertaken by Mr. W.W. Hamilton, m p, who had tabled a Motionappealing to the Cricket Council to change their attitude. This mighthave a useful effect, especially if Opposition Members could be persuaded to support it.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the report and recommendations by the Ministerof State, Ministry of Housing and Local Government, who should keep the matter under review in his interdepartmental committee.If, in the light of developments, it seemed desirable to bring thematter before the Cabinet again, the Home Secretary, the Ministerof State, Ministry of Housing and Local Government or he himself would take the initiative in doing so.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Situationin theShipbuildingIndustryCammellLairds(previous reference:CC(70) 20thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the future of theCammell Laird Group.The Paymaster General said that the Cammell Laird Groupwere expected to go into liquidation that day unless substantial additional cash resources were made available to them. The most economical and effective way of keeping the whole Group inoperation would be to arrange for a joint rescue operation on linesnow agreed between  the parties  concerned.    The Industrial
Reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) would lend the Cammell Lairdparent company up to  6 million at 10 per cent interest, secured onthe non-shipbuilding assets of the Group. The parent company would transfer this money, together with  2 million of their own, toa new company to which the Cammell Laird shipbuilding assetswould be transferred. The principal shipowner customers would contribute by cancelling certain onerous contracts, by renegotiatingothers, and by making an interest-free loan to the shipyard. the shipbuilding Industry Board (SIB) would contribute to the modernisation of the yard. The Government in turn would have totake a 50 per cent shareholding in the new shipbuilding company ata price to be negotiated but likely to be between &amp;\ million and 1 million; to accept responsibility for any losses made in the nextyear or two while vessels now under construction were completed;and to guarantee the refund of their progress payments to the shipowners should the yard nevertheless close before their vessels were completed. No rescue operation was possible unless theGovernment committed itself to meet future creditors; and theproposed 50 per cent shareholding would not increase their liabilitiesor provide a safety net for slack management. It would be acondition of the financial assistance to be provided to the companythat there should be a fundamental reconstruction of the Board; andthere should be no question of the Exchequer^ contribution being used to compensate Directors who were required to resign. Othershipbuilding firms were unlikely lightly to seek government assistance on such terms. The possibility of transferring the 50 percent shareholding to trustees for the workers might be explored asa way of impressing on them their responsibility for the yard&apos;future. It would, in any event, be necessary to run down the manpower in the yard substantially after the end of the current year.There was no practical alternative to these proposals, for which legislation would be required, if the liquidation of the group as awhole was to be avoided. Liquidation would involve the immediateloss of 8,000 jobs on Merseyside and would put in jeopardy afurther 12,000 jobs. There might be difficulties over completing thesubmarine now under construction. The collapse of the group would also undermine the credit of the shipbuilding industry generally. He invited the Cabinet to endorse the proposals for providing assistance to Cammell Lairds and to agree that he should announce them that afternoon.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he agreed that measures should be taken to prevent the collapse of the Cammell Laird Group.He was also prepared to agree to payment by the Government tothe new shipbuilding company of a sum of the order of that required
for the proposed share purchase and to the proposals for assistance by the 1958-59. He was, however, concerned that if the government undertook commitments whether by way of a shareholding, ofliabilities to future creditors, or of refund guarantees other ship-building firms who were also in difficulties through takingunremunerative orders would expect Government assistance. the eventual cost of such a commitment might be of the order of 50 million. It would be preferable to arrange for the 50 per centshareholding to be held by trustees on behalf of the employees; forthe refunds to shipowners to be guaranteed by some suitablestatutory body such as the 1958-59 or the Export Credit GuaranteesDepartment; and for the shipbuilding company to be made to rely on its own resources once it had been made viable by the proposedinjection of liquidity.In discussion it was argued that not enough attention had been paid to the relative advantages of maintaining employment inuneconomic shipyards on the one hand and transferring the resourcesinvolved to more profitable industrial activities on the other. Therewas, however, general agreement that assistance should be provided to Cammell Lairds with the aim of giving them a year or so in which to prove whether or not they could become viable. If this were madepublicly known it should, combined with the managementreorganisation, disabuse shipbuilders of any belief that assistancefrom the Government would be automatically forthcomingto companies which were in difficulty. On the other hand it was argued that to announce a limitation on the period for which theGovernment were committed would mean that the company couldnot obtain commercial credit and would thus vitiate the entireoperation. It was generally agreed that every effort should be madeto limit the Governmenfs commitments as far as possible forexample by transferring the 50 per cent shareholding to trustees forthe employees and by finding another guarantor of the refunds. Itshould also be possible to ensure that the bulk of any losses on the yard&apos;s future operations were covered by the  8 million assets whichwere being, in effect, transferred from the rest of the Cammell LairdGroup.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were grateful to the Paymaster General and the chief secretary for the skilful way in which they had handled this difficultoperation. They agreed that the Government should co-operate inthe proposals for solving the liquidity crisis at Cammell Lairds, onthe basis that their commitment would not be open-ended and couldbe brought to an end within a year or so if the company showed no signs of becoming viable. The Cabinet agreed that the paymaster general should announce their decision that afternoon.   For the
confidential. The Cabinet took note, with satisfaction, that the dispute in the newspaper industry had been resolved. Ministers might findoccasion in their public speeches to emphasise that this had been achieved by the mediation of the Secretary-General of the TradesUnion Congress, Mr. Victor Feather, without direct intervention bythe Government.reasons given in the discussion he should not refer to the period forwhich Government assistance would be available. He should,however, make it clear that, as a necessary condition of providingassistance, there would be a fundamental reconstruction of themanagement of the Cammell Laird Group as a whole, as well as ofthe shipbuilding company. He should also indicate that theGovernment would explore the possibility of transferring the 50 percent shareholding to trustees for the employees; and should leaveopen the possibility that provision for refunds of progress payments to the shipowners might be made otherwise than by direct government guarantee.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Paymaster General to make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the Paymaster General, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, to give further consideration (i) to   the  transfer  of  the  proposed   50  per centshareholding in the shipbuilding company totrustees for the employees;(ii) to the possibility of arranging for the progresspayment refunds to be provided for otherwise than by direct Government guarantees;(iii) to the provision which might be necessary by way oflegislation and supplementary estimates to enablethe proposals to be implemented.
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (70) 59) on a proposal by the London transport executive (LTE) for increases in fares on London buses and the underground railway.The Minister of Transport said that the LTE had recentlyapplied to the Greater London Council (GLC) for authority toincrease fares in the late summer or early autumn by amounts whichwould bring in some  14-5 million in a full year and add about14 per cent to fares revenue. The Policy and Resources Committeeof the GLC had decided on 5 May to recommend approval of theLTE&apos;s proposals; and a final decision was expected from the GLCon 12 May. The proposals included: on the Underground, a Is.minimum fare, differentials of Is. in ticket prices and a general increase of 6d. in fares in the central area, with a 6d. minimum anda general increase of 6d. or Is. outside that area; on the buses, anincrease of 6d. in fares above Is. 6d. in the central area and above is. outside that area; increases of up to 20 per cent on Undergroundseason tickets for distances over one mile; and increases from 6d. to9d. in Red Arrow and suburban flat fares. Since the beginning of1970, the GLC had assumed final responsibility for London fares,with no requirement for Government approval and no Governmentpower of veto. Although the Government could refer increases inthese fares to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI), itwas doubtful if they had the statutory power to impose a standstill on the increases under the terms of Part II of the Prices and incomes act 1966.The LTE proposals (which he had not had an opportunity of examining in detail) probably did no more than cover increased costs, including those from recent wages settlements. If so, the increases could be avoided or moderated only by a subsidy fromthe rates; and the GLC were known to be opposed to this course.Assuming that this was ruled out, the NBPI, if the subject were referred to them, would have no alternative but to approve the LTE&apos;sproposals. A reference to the NBPI also involved a risk of transferring to the Government, in the minds of the public,responsibility for the fares increase, whereas reactions so farsuggested that the GLCs responsibility for accepting the Londonfares increases had been generally understood. Action by theGovernment in favour of London&apos;s transport system would be criticised by those in other urban areas, where fares increases inrecent years had been much higher than in London and where thetransport authorities had not benefited, as LTE had done, from alarge write-off of capital debts. He recommended that theGovernment should not commit itself immediately to an NBPILondonTransportFaresIncreases
reference on the new LTE fares proposals, but should take a decisionon the subject in the light of the GLCs conclusions and publicreactions to them.In discussion, it was argued on the one hand that theGovernment had declared its intention of not accepting the change to decimal currency as a reason in itself for price increases. TheLTE, however, was proposing to set Is. as the minimum priceinterval even in advance of decimalisation; and their example mightwell be followed by others. As for the alleged favouritism shown toLondon&apos;s transport system, it had been generally recognised that thecity&apos;s transport problems were greater than those in other urban areas and deserved special attention. An NBPI reference would permit consideration of the LTE proposal to raise charges especially on short journeys and of other aspects of the new fares pattern, aswell as the question of the total extra amount of revenue needed tocover costs. It was argued on the other hand that having devolvedupon local authorities the responsibility for the transport problemsof their own areas, in London and elsewhere, with the aim of making them the subject of political debate locally rather than nationally,the Government should in this instance allow the Labour Party inthe GLC to conduct its own fight for rate-subsidised transport, and leave the GLC with the odium for putting up fares. A reference tothe NBPI might not produce any new proposals on LTE&apos;s costs and charges, since these had been examined as recently as last year.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to defer a decision on a reference to the NBPI of theLTE&apos;s new proposals for a fares increase; and they would considerthe suggestion further after the GLC had reached their conclusions on the proposals. The Minister of Transport should provide fortheir further discussion information on the GLCs conclusions andon the relative rate of increase in commuter fares in London and inother urban areas over the last three years or more.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate amemorandum about the Greater London CounciFsdecision on the proposals for increases in london transport Underground and bus fares, together with information on the relative rate of increase in commuterfares in London and in other urban areas, on the lines indicated in the summing up by the Prime Minister.
Inter-UrbanRoad Strategy(previous reference:CC(69) 12thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (70) 58) covering a draft White Paper on thedevelopment of the strategic network of inter-urban roads inEngland.The Minister of Transport said that the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy had endorsed his proposals for a revised strategic network of inter-urban roads in England to be constructed over the next 15 to 20 years at a cost at current pricesof some  2,000 million, with a further  1,400 million forcomplementary roads. These proposals were set out in the draft white Paper which had been revised to take account of points madein the course of earlier Ministerial discussions. He proposed to publish the White Paper at the beginning of June; but the precisedate might be settled later.The Cabinet Approved the publication of the draft White Paper annexed to C (70) 58, subject to consideration by the Minister ofTransport of any drafting amendments which might be suggested to him in the course of the day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7 May, 1970.
