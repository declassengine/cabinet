ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessOverseaAffairsVisit of theSwedishPrime Minister11440-3CONFIDENTIAL2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Prime Minister said that the visit of the Swedish PrimeMinister, Mr. Olof Palme, had been extremely successful. Therewere no major bilateral questions at issue between the UnitedKingdom and Sweden. There had been a brief discussion onAtlantic salmon fishing, in which it had become clear that botha 2SECRETMinisterial 1.   The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to anariicie jn that morning&apos;s Daily Mail which purported to derive froma forthcoming book on Cabinet government by Mr. Patrick gordon walker, mp. The article suggested that during the war betweenIsrael and the United Arab Republic (UAR) in the summer of 1967the Cabinet had over-ruled the Prime Minister and the then foreign secretary, Mr. George Brown, by rejecting a plan, which they werealleged to have sponsored, whereby British naval forces would be despatched to separate the combatants and the Government of the uar would be informed that, unless the war stopped, British forces would start a bombardment. The essence of this alleged disclosurewas clearly false; and, in view of the damage which its disseminationmight cause, it should be promptly denied.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal. Itwas possible, however, that the alleged disclosure resulted from aconfusion between the Governmenfs attitude once the war had broken out, when there had been no question of any Britishintervention, and a proposal at an earlier stage, before the war had started, that British forces might contribute, together with thoseof the United States and other maritime Powers, to an internationalattempt to establish freedom of passage in the Straits of Tiran andthe Gulf of Aqaba. Our intentions on that earlier occasion hadbeen made clear in various Parliamentary statements; and anyrebuttal of the article in the Daily Mail which might now be issuedshould recall those statements in order to distinguish between thetwo stages in the development of the situation and to make it clearthat such contingent action as we had contemplated had been in acontext and for a purpose wholly different from those mentionedin the article.
The Securityof DiplomatsOverseas andin the UnitedKingdomcountries had a common interest in protecting their coastal and riverfisheries from depletion by deep-sea salmon fishing; and we had agreed to work together for a compromise solution. discussion had concentrated largely on international affairs. Here again therewas no major divergence of view. The Swedes were strongly infavour of British membership of the European Economic Community(e.c.). So far as their own position was concerned, they wishedto be associated with the e.c. on whatever terms would be consistent with their policy of neutrality. They did not necessarily excludefull membership, if this could be achieved consistently with themaintenance of their neutral status. The Swedish Prime minister had made it clear that he stood by the terms of his 1967 declaration on Swedish relations with the e.c.. In general Mr. Palme, despitesome initial misgivings on the part of his party and public opinion in Sweden, seemed to have made a good start. He was clearlyanxious to improve relations with the United States; and it was likely that the United States Ambassador would return to Stockholmbefore long. There had been widespread commendation ofMr. Palme&apos;s handling of the Nordek negotiations, although theFinnish Government had subsequently decided that they could notsign or ratify the agreement resulting from these.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the recentmurder of the German Ambassador to Guatemala, Count von Spreti,by his kidnappers, had given fresh urgency to the problem of ensuring the protection against similar outrages of British diplomatic missions and High Commissions overseas. Last November our Missionsabroad had been given guidance and advice on precautions. these had now been urgently reviewed. British Missions in Latin America,which might be assumed to be more exposed than others to suchthreats, had been offered further assistance and had been askedwhether they considered the measures taken for their protection bythe local authorities were sufficient. A senior security officer wasstanding by to visit posts in Latin America. Special consideration had been given to the position of the British Mission in Guatemalawhere, owing to the current state of Anglo-Guatemalan relations,we were represented not by an Ambassador but by a Consul. TheGuatemalan authorities, however, had made arrangements toprovide personal protection for HM Consul and to place armedguards on the Embassy.In the international field, we were consulting the commonwealth and our North Atlantic Treaty Organisation allies. There might also be discussion in the Western European Union. The latin american States had a long-standing tradition of political asylum;
but, if it were possible, through action in the Organisation of american States, to obtain agreement that states would not grantasylum to detainees whose freedom had been secured as the resultof a kidnapping, this might reduce the incentive to kidnap.If a British diplomat were kidnapped, it could be maintained that the prime consideration must be the safety and survival of the victim and that, whatever our long-term objective in regard to thegeneral problem might be, we should be prepared in the last resort to accede to the demands of the kidnappers or, where the releaseof prisoners was involved, to press the local authorities to do so,rather than run the risk of a murder.In discussion it was agreed that the saving of life must clearly have high priority. But this consideration had to be weighed againstthe argument that our long-term objective of putting an end tokidnapping might not be best served by a blanket commitment toa policy which could involve yielding to blackmail. There couldbe no hard and fast rule; and individual cases would have to bedealt with as they arose. So far as our attitude towards otherGovernments was concerned, there were certain countries in whichwe presumably need not feel compunction in pressing the local administration to release its political prisoners. As against this, oneof the objects of kidnapping, particularly of diplomats, was preciselyto mobilise pressure from other countries against the country inwhich the kidnapping took place. To the extent, therefore, that weyielded to this pressure we might merely encourage further attempts.Alternatively, in appropriate cases we might make token withdrawalsof the staffs of our Missions where we thought that the protection afforded had been inadequate.Attention was drawn to the possibility that attempts might bemade to kidnap diplomats accredited to this country; and it wassuggested that the Departments concerned should give further examination to this problem.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and of the points made in discussion.(3) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theHome Secretary to give further examination to theproblem of the protection from kidnapping of membersof foreign and Commonwealth Missions in this country.
IndustrialRelationsBill(previous reference:CC (69) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First Secretaryof State and Secretary of State for Employment and Productivity(C (70) 48) and by the Lord Privy Seal (C (70) 49) about the industrial relations Bill.The First Secretary of State said that the Industrial relations committee (IR) had reviewed the proposed provisions of the Billin the light of the consultations which she had been holding withthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) and the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI). The CBI were opposed to the Bill which they regarded as one-sided and in the main offering advantage only tothe trade unions. Her discussions with the Finance and general purposes Committee of the TUC had been constructive. The latterwelcomed the Bill in general and had continued to press for onlyone change of any substance: the extension of the protection afforded by the Trade Disputes Act 1906 to cover persons inducing a breach of a commercial contract in the course of an industrial dispute. she had firmly resisted any such extension against which the cabinet had, of course, already decided. With the agreement of IR shewas now proposing two modifications to the proposals originallyagreed by the Cabinet in their discussion last October. First, IRhad reached the conclusion that it would be inadvisable to seek to restrict the immunity enjoyed by trade unions, under Section 4 ofthe Trade Disputes Act, 1906, from actions in tort to those tortscommitted in pursuance of trade disputes. Such a restriction wouldrequire &quot; trade disputes &quot; to be defined sufficiently widely in the new legislation to avoid serious difficulties with the TUC. But the same,wider, definition would also apply to Section 3 of the same Act andthus perhaps increase the protection afforded by the latter section to &quot; secondary boycotts &quot;. For this reason IR had concluded thatit would be wiser not to amend Section 4 as originally agreed bythe Cabinet. Secondly, IR had decided that the Bill should preventFriendly Societies from having rules which debarred trade unionistsfrom membership or benefits. There was a further point which had arisen in her discussions with the TUC and about which she had consulted the Lord Chancellor. The unions were concerned thatex parte injunctions could be granted to an employer without any previous notice having been given to the union or its officials thatthe plaintiff was taking legal action. The TUC had suggested thatit should in future be provided that the plaintiff should at least notify the Department of Employment and Productivity of his applicationbefore an ex parte injunction could be granted. While she wouldnot advocate such a solution she had asked the Lord Chancellor
whether some means might be found of ensuring that trade unionsreceived some notice of an application for an injunction before an ex parte injunction was granted.The Lord Chancellor said that he would be opposed to an amendment of the law so that trade unions and trade union officials were placed in a more favourable position in relation to ex parteinjunctions against them than anyone else. Such injunctions were only given on very rare occasions where the Court considered thatin the absence of an injunction action might be taken to the detriment of the plaintiff which would cause him damage which would beirrecoverable later. Where an ex parte injunction was granted and as far as he could ascertain there had only been a single casein recent times the unions in common with any other defendantwould be informed immediately and could argue before the courts for discharge of the injunction within 24 hours at most if they sowished.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet approved the conclusions of the industrial relations Committee set out in Annex II of C (70) 48. They also agreed that in the light of the further consideration given to thematter by the Industrial Relations Committee it would be inadvisable to seek to restrict the immunity from actions in tort enjoyed by trade unions under Section 4 of the Trade Disputes Act of 1906.The First Secretary of State should ensure that the Scottish legalauthorities were consulted about the application of the Bill as awhole in Scotland.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of this partof their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the Scottishlegal authorities to be consulted about the application ofthe Industrial Relations Bill in Scotland.The Cabinet then considered the outstanding issues referred toin C (70) 48.The First Secretary of State said that the intention to introduceprovisions requiring employers to disclose to recognised unionsinformation necessary and relevant to negotiations had been mostbitterly resisted by the CBI. If it were decided, as the Lord privy seal proposed, to exempt the Crown from any statutory requirement in this field, the objections of the CBI would be redoubled. TheLord Privy Seal was apparently ready to agree that the Governmentshould give a voluntary undertaking to provide information to the
trade unions to the same extent as private employers would berequired to do by the Bill. So there was no dispute about thepractice which should be followed. Nor was it proposed that theBill should require a Minister to disclose information which he considered should not be disclosed. Moreover the Bill itself wouldprovide safeguards against any requirement to disclose information relating to, for example, national security, to individuals and toconfidential information from or about third parties. She therefore asked for agreement that statutory provisions, relating to disclosure of information by the Crown, should be included on the lines indicated in paragraph 9 of her paper. These provisions would notapply in respect of the personal employees of The Queen.The Lord Privy Seal said that the purpose of the First Secretary&apos;proposal appeared to be wholly presentational since it was already the practice for Government Departments to make available full information in consultations and negotiations under the Whitleysystem. Circumstances could however arise, which could not nowbe foreseen, in which a Minister decided that he could not providecertain information which was requested by the unions and wasnot excluded in terms by the Bill. In present circumstances if a refusal to provide information became a serious issue it would inthe last resort be decided by the Cabinet. Under the First Secretaryof State&apos;s proposals a ruling would be given by the Industrial Courtwhich would, however, have no power to enforce it. If the minister concerned continued his refusal to disclose information both he andthe Industrial Court would be placed in a most difficult position.The acceptance of independent arbitration in respect of pay awardswas a totally different matter. He urged that the disclosureprovisions of the Bill should not apply to the Crown but that theGovernment should give an undertaking to observe the spirit of theprovisions in their relations with their own employees.In discussion it was the general view that it would make verylittle difference in practice whether statutory provisions relating todisclosure of information applied to the Crown or not. However,as in the case of the Race Relations Act 1968, the Government wouldin practice find it difficult to resist the application of such provisions to the Crown and it might therefore be wiser to include such provisions in the Bill from the start.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of their discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that the requirements relating todisclosure of information should apply to the Crown on the lines indicated by the First Secretary in paragraph 9 of C (70) 48.The Cabinet-(3) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of this partof their discussion by the Prime Minister.
Statutory Rightto belong to a trade union the Cabinet (4) Agreed that the First Secretary of State should have discretion, in the light of her further discussions with the tuc on the matter, to follow either of the coursesdescribed in paragraph 12 of C (70) 48.The Work-load on IndustrialTribunalsThe Cabinet (5) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord Chancellor and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, towork out as soon as practicable a solution to the problemsposed by the very substantial additional load of work tobe placed on the Industrial Tribunals as a consequenceof the enactment of the Bill.(6) Agreed that until satisfactory administrative arrangements had been devised the extension of the Industrial Tribunalsjurisdiction to disputes arising from individual contracts of employment would have to be delayed.TheCommissionon IndustrialRelationsThe First Secretary of State recalled that the Cabinet had previously decided that, in the Commission for Industry and manpower Bill, trade unions would not be made liable forproceedings and penalties for failure to provide information: in that bill the liability was confined to corporate bodies and individuals,including of course trade union officials. IR had decided that in thepresent Bill it would be advisable to provide the Commission on industrial Relations (CIR), which would be established as a statutorybody, with powers similar to those given to the National Board for prices and Incomes under the legislation on prices and incomes sothat the CIR could take action against trade unions too for failure to provide information. The CIR would be more involved than theCommission for Industry and Manpower in obtaining information from trade unions and employers&apos; associations and would require a sanction against a refusal to produce it.The Cabinet-(7) Agreed that the Industrial Relations Bill should provide theCommission on Industrial Relations with powers to takeproceedings against trade unions and employers&apos;associations, as well as against corporate bodies and individuals, for failure to provide information.11440-3
Purchase of10-ton Trucksfor the Army(previous reference:CC (70) 14thConclusions,Minute 6JCONFIDENTIAL5. In a resumed discussion on the purchase of 10-ton trucksfor the Army the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C (70) 47) about the price quoted for theVolvo truck.The Minister of State, Board of Trade, said that the Board ofTrade would not normally investigate an allegation of dumpingunless they received an application from the industry supported byprima facie evidence of dumping and material injury. The available evidence did not suggest that there was any Considerable element of dumping in the Volvo price; and it Would be very difficult toshow, as we would be required to do under the terms of the anti-dilmping code of which we and Sweden were signatories, that the damage to the British industry&apos;s export prospects, which would arise from the award of the contract to Volvo, constituted a clear andimminent threat of material injury. Nevertheless, he was not satisfiedthat the case for awarding the contract to Volvo on technical groundswas anything like so strong as had been suggested. Since the testswhich had been carried out in 1967* the AEC engine had been greatly improved. The AEC truck had a stronger chassis than the Volvo;its engine was larger and required less frequent overhauls; and itcould use any type of water for cooling. Over 8,000 AEC engineshad been sold abroad and were operating satisfactorily in conditionscomparable with those which had been cited for the Volvo. In his view the Ministry of Defence had not given sufficient weight to these factors or to the risks involved in relying on a foreign company forspares. Bearing in mind the damage which the award of the contract to Volvo could do to the reputation of the British industry in thirdmarkets, he proposed that an independent appraisal should beundertaken urgently to determine the relative technical merits of theAEC and Volvo trucks.The Secretary of Slate for Defence said that the Ministry ofDefence had arranged for a very thorough technical assessment byengineers,, users and maintainers taking account of information fromfirms which had made extensive use of the rival trucks. This placed the Volvo truck well ahead of all others in technical excellence,reliability, durability and performance. To reject the Volvo tenderdespite the results of this evaluation would give rise to serious difficulties with the Swedish Government and the European free trade Association (EFTA). He Was satisfied that the right course was to award the contract to Volvo and it would be helpful to announce at the same time the award of a more valuable contract%i tracked vehicles to a British company.
In discussion it was urged that to reject the Volvo tender would represent a serious breach of the EFTA Convention. The general view, however, was that, bearing in mind the damage which theaward of the contract to Volvo could do to the reputation of Britishexporters, there should be an independent and objective technicalappraisal of the relative merits of the AEC and Volvo trucks before a final decision was taken.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that there should be an independentappraisal on the lines proposed in discussion before a decision wastaken. The Secretary of State for Defence should agree with theMinister of Technology and the Chief Secretary the scope and natureof this appraisal and the person or persons who should carry it out,and should circulate a memorandum on the outcome to membersof the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Defence, in consultationwith the Minister of Technology and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to arrange for an appraisal to be carried out onthe lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up; andto report the outcome to members of the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9 April, 1970.
