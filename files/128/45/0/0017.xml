EuropeanEconomicCommunities(previous reference:CC (70) 14thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet were reminded that, in accordance withestablished procedure, Ministers wishing to make public speechesreferring to foreign or economic policy should first consult theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer respectively. The text of speeches relating to our negotiations with the European Economic Community should be cleared in advance with the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and should be shown at the same time to the Chairman of theOfficial Committee on the Approach to Europe.Publicationsby FormerMinisters(previous reference:CC(70) 15thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet noted that Mr. Patrick Gordon Walker&apos;s bookon &quot; The Cabinet &quot; had been seen in advance by the authorities who made certain suggestions on the normal grounds of propriety,convention and so forth. Speculation about the nature of anyresulting excisions and about discussions in the Cabinet, to whichthe book might be thought to refer, should be firmly discouraged.Enquiry fromStudents ofGovernment(previous reference:CC (69) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet were informed that several Ministers had been approached by Mr. Bruce Heady, who was undertaking an academicstudy of government in conjunction with Professor Richard Rose ofthe University of Strathclyde. Mr. Heady had asked to be provided with copies of old appointments diaries (with the actual names ofCabinet Committees erased) in order to give him some idea of theway in which different Ministers organised their time and therelative proportions of effort which they devoted to Committees,visits, receiving deputations and so on. The general view of theCabinet was that it would not be appropriate to provide Mr. Headywith diaries for this purpose.ParliamentaryAffairsFutureBusinessCONFIDENTIAL4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. They agreed that a motion should be introduced on 22 April to recommit the education bill. This was necessary because, owing to a series of accidents, theGovernment had been defeated in Standing Committee on Clause 1,which was fundamental to the whole purpose of the Bill.11440-5a 2
OverseaAffairsRhodesia(previous reference:CC (70) 13thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that in therecent elections in Rhodesia the electorate, consisting of about80,000 Europeans and 8,000 Africans in a total population of some5 million, had given the expected overwhelming majority toMr. Ian Smith&apos;s Rhodesia Front Party, which had won all of the50 European seats. The multiracial Centre Party had, however,obtained some 12 per cent of the total European vote. Just over50 per cent of the African electors had voted, which indicated thatthe boycott advocated by African nationalist organisations had had some effect. The Centre Party had however attracted a significantshare of the African vote.Greece(previous reference:CC (69) 60thConclusions,Minute 3)The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that it was satisfactory that the Council of Europe at its meeting at Strasbourgon 15 April had decided by 15 votes to nil, with 2 abstentions, to publish the Report of the Human Rights Commission referring to recent violations of the European Convention on Human Rights in greece. Although the Greek Government had recently sanctionedthe release of some 360 political prisoners, possibly in an attemptto influence the atmosphere at Strasbourg, about 1,300 suchprisoners still remained in custody. Moreover, the Greek authorities had recently staged a series of political trials. No death sentenceshad been imposed in these, but in one instance a sentence of lifeimprisonment had been passed on an academic with no Communistaffiliations. There were few grounds for optimism about the domestic policy of the Greek military regime.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.commonwealth immigration:colonel ojukwu(previous reference:CC(70) 14thConclusions,Minute 3)*The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C (70) 50).The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 26 march the Cabinet had discussed the problems which would arise if theformer rebel leader of &quot; Biafra &quot;, Colonel Ojukwu, were to attemptto come to this country. They had decided to discuss the matter further after the Easter Recess in the light of the views of the attorney-General, with particular reference to the position whichwould obtain if, despite our best endeavours to exclude him,Colonel Ojukwu were to succeed in securing admission to thiscountry: and they had agreed that, if Colonel Ojukwu were toattempt to enter Britain in the interim, he should be refused
admission on security grounds. The Prime Minister drew attentionto the extremely sensitive nature of the question. Any premature disclosure would be extremely damaging both domestically and interms of relations with the Federal Military Government of Nigeria.The matter should not be discussed with junior Ministers orParliamentary Private Secretaries: nor should it be discussed with officials unless it was absolutely necessary for them to know.The Home Secretary said that his memorandum had been drafted in the light of the views of the Attorney-General. It waspossible that Colonel Ojukwu might seek to leave the Ivory Coast,where he had been granted political asylum, for the Republic ofIreland, Switzerland or France. The possibility that he might subsequently attempt to enter Britain could not therefore be discounted. A difficult situation would arise if Colonel Ojukwugained admission to the Republic of Ireland: but the Governmentof that country had indicated that they would not be prepared to let him enter the Republic. The Swiss Government were apparentlywilling to admit him. The French Government had not expressedany opinion. The Home Secretary said that he was prepared torefuse admission to Colonel Ojukwu on security grounds and tomaintain the instructions to the Immigration Service set out inparagraph 6 of his paper if, in the light of the internationalconsiderations involved, his colleagues considered that this was theright course to adopt. But such action would be criticised in thiscountry and elsewhere as high-handed; and the Cabinet should be fully aware of this. The statutory immigration appeal system hadnot yet been introduced. But its introduction could not be delayedindefinitely; and once it had been brought into force it wouldconsiderably limit his freedom of action in that, if Colonel Ojukwudecided to invoke the rights of appeal which this procedure wouldgive him, there would be no alternative to allowing him to remainin this country until his appeal had been heard. While there were considerable problems involved in refusing Colonel Ojukwuadmission to this country, much greater difficulties would arise ifhe were to succeed in gaining entry through a failure by the immigration authorities to recognise him or by deception on his part or if (as we had no means of preventing him from doing) he were to enter Great Britain from the Republic of Ireland, either directly or via Northern Ireland. In that event our prospects of ensuring his departure from the country would be slight: and weshould be under no illusions about this.In discussion there was general agreement that the decision torefuse admission to Colonel Ojukwu on security grounds should bemaintained.   It was noted that difficult and delicate legal andSECRET11440-5 b*
political problems would arise if Colonel Ojukwu were to succeed in gaining admission to this country despite our efforts to excludehim. But these had to be weighed against the extremely serious consequences for our relations with the Federal Military Governmentof Nigeria and for our interests in Nigeria if Colonel Ojukwu were allowed to remain in this country.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that at alater stage it might be necessary to give further consideration to theproblems which might arise if, despite our best endeavours,Colonel Ojukwu succeeded in entering Britain. Meanwhile, theCabinet approved the Home Secretary&apos;s paper and confirmed thedecision to refuse admission to Colonel Ojukwu on grounds of security.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (70) 50.(2) Agreed that the decision to refuse admission to colonel ojukwu on grounds of security should be maintained.(3) Took note that, at a later stage, it might be necessary toconsider further the problems which might arise shouldColonel Ojukwu nevertheless succeed in entering thiscountry.Lesotho(previous reference:CC (70) 14thConclusions,Minute 2)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (C (70) 51).The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that at their meeting on 26 March the Cabinet had agreed to give furtherconsideration to the questions of recognition of the present regime in Lesotho and the resumption of aid after the Easter Recess.Lesotho was a small poor country entirely surrounded by SouthAfrican territory and largely dependent for its economic survival onexporting labour for the South African mining industry. It was alsoheavily dependent on aid from the United Kingdom, which lastyear constituted 44 per cent of the Lesotho Budget. Since the coupundertaken by Chief Jonathan when he realised that the electionswere going against him, there had been some disturbances; butChief Jonathan remained in effective control of the country, thusmeeting our normal criteria for recognition. Since Chief Jonathan^suspension of the Constitution we had been bringing discreet pressure to bear with a view to bringing about a return to constitutional rule.But attempts to induce Chief Jonathan and the Opposition to make use of the good offices of the President of Botswana, Sir Seretse
Khama, and the Commonwealth Secretary-General, Mr. ArnoldSmith, had been unsuccessful. It had not so far been possible to enlist the interest of the Organisation of African Unity (OAU); and since the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s paper had beenprepared, the talks between Chief Jonathan and the Oppositionreferred to in paragraph 3 had run into difficulties, with theOpposition proposing a British military presence in Lesotho and a commonwealth Commission to supervise a return to constitutional government, and Chief Jonathan rejecting any outside intervention.This latter development however did not affect the basic situation,which was that we could not indefinitely defer recognition of aregime which was manifestly in effective control; that suspension of aid would inevitably cause considerable hardship; and that to withhold British recognition for Chief Jonathan would leave him with no alternative but to fall back on the support of South Africa.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had accordingly soughthis colleagues&apos; agreement that we should now take the necessary preliminary measures to clear the way for a decision on the resumption of normal relations with Lesotho, possibly at short notice,according to developments. As part of these measures, we should inform the President of Botswana confidentially of our views, leavinghim time to comment before any action was taken. This might bedone in a personal message from the Prime Minister. The questionof the resumption of aid could be considered in the light of thecircumstances in which recognition was accorded.The Minister of Overseas Development said that she agreed with the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s paper. any decision on the resumption of aid would have to be taken in thelight of developments following recognition. One important factorwould be the capacity of the Government to make effective use of aid, since this had been adversely affected by Chief Jonathan^wholesale dismissals of experienced civil servants. The effects ofthe suspension of British aid had begun to be felt in Lesotho withthe ending of the old financial year: it was perhaps no accident thatthe initiative of talks between the regime and the Opposition hadcoincided with this. Though as yet there was no sign of serioushardship, the pressure we had brought to bear was possibly beginning to have some effect.In discussion there was general agreement that no action shouldbe taken with a view to recognition until Sir Seretse Khama had beeninformed of our intentions. The considerations in favour of earlyrecognition had to be balanced against the desirability of usingrecognition and the resumption of aid as a lever to secure a returnto constitutional government. The point was made that there was
still a possibility, albeit a remote one, of intervention by the OAUand that it might be preferable to have some clear indication of theOrganisation^ intentions before a decision to grant recognition wastaken.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in favour of giving the Foreign and commonwealth secretary the discretion for which he asked. In making use of this,he would be guided by the points made in discussion. The PrimeMinister and Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would bring thematter back to the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee or theCabinet, as appropriate, if there were any developments either inregard to an intervention by the OAU or in any other directionwhich affected the general conclusions reached in discussion.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.confidential . The Minister without Portfolio said that he had been approached by Mr. Adam Fergusson of The Times who wanted to publish a series of articles based on interviews with Ministers aboutmajor aspects of Government policy. The purpose of the articleswould not be to subject the policies to critical analysis but to providea platform for an objective, non-partisan assessment of theGovernments policy. They would be broadly similar to thearticles on the Conservative Party&apos;s policies which had appeared inThe Times in 1969 and might cover such fields as economic affairs,social and education policy, the environment, regional policy and external affairs.In discussion some doubts were expressed about the value ofsuch articles and attention was drawn to the difficulty of providinginformation of the kind requested on economic, and especiallyfiscal, policy. The general view, however, was that the articleswould provide a useful means of putting Government policy acrossto the public and that, on the understanding that Ministers werefree to conduct the interviews in their own way, there was no reasonto reject Mr. Fergusson&apos;s proposal. The subjects to be coveredwould have to be carefully selected; in the field of economic policy the balance of payments would be the most appropriate topic fordiscussion.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that a series of articles on the lines proposed would be useful.    Departmental Ministers should inform theArticles onGovernmentPolicy
Cabinet Office,16 April, 1970Minister without Portfolio, who would co-ordinate the arrangements,which subjects they considered should be covered and which avoided.When giving interviews to Mr. Fergusson, Ministers should speakas members of the Government and should normally be accompaniedby their Information Officers.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
