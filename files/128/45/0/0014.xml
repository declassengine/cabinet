CC 14 (70)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week beginning 6th April. the timetable motion relating to the Ports Bill would be taken on 6th April after the Second Reading of the Electricity Bill.The Prime Minister said that he had received a letter from the welsh Parliamentary Labour Group about the White Paper on localGovernment reorganisation in Glamorgan and Monmouthshire(Cmnd. 4310). The Group, which had discussed the White Paperwith the Secretary of State for Wales, maintained that some of the guiding principles laid down in the White Paper conflicted with therequirements of good local government in Wales. They urged thatthe fresh consultations with local authorities which the Secretaryof State for Wales had proposed should embrace the general principles involved as well as the details; and that no further action should be taken to implement any local government proposals untilthe representations of the people directly affected had been fullyheard and assessed. The Group had asked that their views shouldbe made known to the Cabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.secret. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that CaptainMay, the master of the s.s. Anchises who had been detained in shanghai, had now been released as had the chief officer of thes.s. Glenfalloch. This tended to confirm our earlier impression thatthe local authorities in Shanghai tended on occasion to outrun thelimits of discretion as interpreted by the Government in Peking andin this instance had been overruled by the latter. Eight Britishsubjects, however, were still under detention in China. We continuedto make representations to the Chinese Government on four of thesecases; the rest were sympathisers with the Chinese regime, aboutwhom we had no firm information.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that, since hehad last reported to the Cabinet about the Middle East, the soviet union had made surface-to-air missiles, manned by Soviettechnicians, available to the United Arab Republic. This actiondid not significantly alter the military balance between the arab states and Israel; but it increased the dangers of the situation owingto the possibility of Soviet casualties if these installations were attacked by Israel. The other main development had been the UnitedStates&apos; decision not to supply more aircraft to Israel for the present,
although this decision was subject to review. The Israeli reactionhad been temperate, although some disappointment had been expressed with the offer of aid which the United States had made atthe same time. In the Four Power discussions at the United nations on the Arab-Israel dispute, there was now some prospect that itmight prove possible to begin drafting a progress report which might serve as a basis for a renewed attempt at mediation by the united nations Secretary-General&apos;s Special Representative, Dr. Jarring.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the formerPrime Minister of Cambodia, Prince Sihanouk, who had been oustedby the recent coup d&apos;etat, had now purported to establish a rivalAdministration in exile. The new Government in Phnom Penh,however, seemed to be becoming more firmly established. TheCambodian Ambassador in London had declared that it was essentialto secure the expulsion of the Communist forces from Cambodia;but he had seemed doubtful whether this could be done without theuse of force. The new Cambodian Government had asked for thereturn of the International Control Commission. We supported thisproposal; and we had so informed the Indian Co-Chairman of theCommission. We were also consulting the Soviet Government onthe matter. For the present we were conducting day-to-day business with the new Cambodian regime; and the question of formal recognition had not yet arisen.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that thediscussions between the Chancellor of the Federal Republic ofGermany, Herr Brandt, and the Prime Minister of the german democratic Republic, Herr Stoph, at Erfurt on 19 March had achieved little except a decision to hold a further meeting. HerrBrandt had had a striking popular welcome in East Germany;,butthe enthusiasm with which he had been received might well havealarmed the East German authorities and might in itself endanger the prospects of success in further exchanges.In the Four Power discussions on Berlin a formal opening sessionhad been held. This would be followed by a further meeting in amonth&apos;s time. Our immediate objective would be to secure whatimprovements we could in access to West Berlin and in living conditions in the city.The Cabinet-(1) Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that we were still withholding recognition of Chief Jonathan^ Administration andhad not yet given any indication of our intentions as regards the resumption of aid. As a result the more responsible elements in theGovernment might bring pressure to bear on Chief Jonathan to
SECRET*3. The Cabinet considered the action which it might benecessary to take if the former rebel leader, Colonel Ojukwu, sought to enter the United Kingdom.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there wasa possibility that the former rebel leader, Colonel Ojukwu, who hadbeen granted political asylum by the Ivory Coast, might attempt tocome to this country. If he were to do so, it would undoubtedly be his purpose to seek to enlist popular sympathy here and to makemischief between ourselves and the Nigerian Federal military government, who would strongly resent his being allowed to take up residence in Britain. They had, indeed, intimated that they would immediately break off diplomatic relations if this were to occur;and this had, unfortunately, become known to the Press in Lagos.In view of the grave damage to our political and economic relationswith Nigeria which would certainly result if Colonel Ojukwu wasto come here, he considered that we should refuse to admit him tothe United Kingdom if this were legally possible. Asylum couldnot be claimed as of right: it lay at the discretion of the country which the refugee sought to enter. And it could not seriously bemaintained that Colonel Ojukwu had any moral claim on ourhospitality.The Home Secretary said that, although it would be difficult torefuse Colonel Ojukwu admission to this country, it should not be legally impossible to do so, even if only on grounds of security. Adecision in this sense, however, would entail the issue of specificinstructions to Immigration Officers that, if Colonel Ojukwu arrived,* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETliberalise his regime. The other African countries, however, were showing an unexpected lack of interest in the situation; and at a recent meeting of the Organisation for African Unity, ChiefJonathan^ representatives had been received and representatives ofthe Opposition had been ignored. Matters could continue as theywere for a short time longer; but in all probability we could notindefinitely postpone recognition of Chief Jonathan^ regime.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Cabinet would wish to give further consideration to the questionsof recognition and the resumption of aid after the ParliamentaryRecess.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
he should be refused access to legal advice and should be ejectedfrom the country by the first available means. The outcome might provoke a strong reaction on the part of public opinion both in thiscountry and elsewhere; and, if he were to authorise such action,therefore, he would need to be assured that he had the full supportof his colleagues. The position would be even more difficult ifColonel Ojukwu were to succeed in entering this country undetected,since he could then be removed only by an application to the court,which would not necessarily succeed.In discussion it was pointed out that to refuse Colonel Ojukwuentry to the United Kingdom or to expel him once he had gainedadmission, would be a grave step for which there was no exactprecedent. It might therefore become a precedent, to be quoted insupport of the expulsion of other refugees whom some particularsections of public opinion regarded as undesirable on general grounds, despite their Commonwealth citizenship. We should therefore need to be very sure of our ground before taking suchdrastic action against Colonel Ojukwu. It was suggested that he might be deterred from attempting to enter this country if the nigerian Government indicated that they would ask for hisextradition from the United Kingdom on the grounds of some non-political offence and Colonel Ojukwu were made aware of this risk.On the other hand it must be accepted that, whatever the natureof the formal charge against him, public opinion would accept hisextradition only if it was reasonably certain that he would enjoy afair trial on his return to Nigeria; and it was unlikely that many people would be satisfied that this would be the case. Alternatively,the Nigerian Government might perhaps deprive Colonel Ojukwuof his Nigerian nationality; and in that event we could treat him as an alien for purposes of immigration legislation (although this might be frustrated if another African member of the Commonwealthwere prepared to grant him citizenship). It was unlikely in any event that he could claim the status of a political refugee; several other countries, including the Ivory Coast, were open to him, inwhich he could settle without objection on the part of the nigerian government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that we should seek to prevent Colonel Ojukwufrom entering this country. They also agreed that it would bedesirable to ensure his departure if, despite our best endeavours to exclude him, he succeeded in securing admission to the UnitedKingdom. The legal position, however, was not altogether clear,particularly as regards the latter hypothesis. The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Home Secretary should therefore seek the views of the Attorney-General; and the Cabinet should
SECRET*4. The Cabinet considered the Governments policy towardsaccession to the European Economic Communities in the light of apublic speech by the Minister without Portfolio on the previous date.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that he had informed the Minister without Portfolio, before the Cabinetsmeeting, that he would have to refer to a public speech which theMinister had made on the previous day about the Governmentsapplication to join the European Economic Communities (e.c.).The speech had carried an implication that the Government no longerwished, or intended to make a real effort, to join the e.c.; and this,which was at variance with the Governments official policy asexpounded in the recent Parliamentary debate, would create an unfortunate impression of divided counsel within the Government,which could not be other than damaging to the prospects of success in the forthcoming negotiations for our accession to the Communities.The Minister without Portfolio said that he regretted that he hadnot consulted the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary before making his speech. But he could not accept that it would necessarily have damaging results. Its most critical passage, dealing with the impact on our balance of payments of the new commitments whichentry into the e.c. would entail, had been agreed in principle withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Office some time before; and, forthe rest, the speech merely drew attention to the undeniable factthat the e.c. was not simply an enlarged free trade area but wasa community which involved its members in a commitment to a closer and more intimate relationship with fellow members than withoutside countries as regards many aspects of policy. It could notbe maintained that it was wrong to remind public opinion of thisessential fact.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRETconsider the matter again when these had been obtained.   they agreed, however, that, if Colonel Ojukwu were to attempt to enterBritain in the interim, he should be refused admission on the basis indicated by the Home Secretary.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and theHome Secretary to seek the views of the Attorney-general on the legal issues involved.(3) Took note that the Cabinet would discuss the matter further in the light of the comments of the Attorney-General.
In discussion the Cabinet were reminded that they had agreedthat, whatever differences of view or emphasis might exist between individual Ministers on particular aspects of our application to join the e.c., the Government would speak with one voice in public inendorsement of the policy which had been authoritatively explained by the Prime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary in the recent Parliamentary debate. It was now essential that theyshould avoid any appearance of disunity on the subject or allow theimpression to be created that they were prepared to treat a major issue of national policy as the subject of mere Party political controversy in the period before the forthcoming General Election.It would therefore be desirable that the Governments policy shouldbe reaffirmed in the terms already approved by the Cabinetcollectively and that the Minister without Portfolio should seek an early public opportunity to put his speech in better perspective,making it clear that it remained the Governments declared purpose to join the e.c. if acceptable terms could be obtained.IndustrialAffairsIndustrialRelationsat london airport(previous reference:CC (70) 13thConclusions,Minute 6)Teachers&apos; Pay(previous reference:CC (70) 13thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential. The First Secretary of State said that the unofficial strike of firemen at London Airport (Heathrow) had ended and the airportwas now working normally. With the help of the Attorney-General,the legal problems relating to the British Airports Authority&apos;s HighCourt action had been overcome and agreement had been reached on the terms of reference for the inquiry, which she hoped to establishlater in the day.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the first secretary of State.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the negotiationswith the Scottish teachers would be resumed on 17 April. the teachers had so far made no real effort to negotiate a new settlement;and the marking of papers for the school examinations, which were due to start on 21 April, was therefore still at some risk. the teachers&apos; attitude might become clearer in the next few days; andhe would keep in touch with the First Secretary of State as thesituation developed.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that hehad sent Mr. Britton, the General Secretary-designate of the NationalUnion of Teachers (NUT), a note of their discussion on 13 March;and Mr. Britton had endorsed it as an accurate record. He had had further discussions with representatives of the NUT but hadbeen unable to secure any undertaking from them that they would regard the sum of  84 million as the maximum available for salary
confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Defence (SEP (70) 33) and the Minister of Technology(SEP (70) 37) on the purchase of 10-ton trucks for the Army.The Secretary of State for Defence said that the Army had a requirement for up to 900 new 10-ton trucks. Following a recommendation by the Public Accounts Committee that the army should in future buy vehicles of normal commercial design, nineBritish firms had been invited early in 1969 to a presentation of theArmy&apos;s requirements. The agents of the Swedish firm, Volvo, hadnot been invited; but after they had made representations underArticle 14 of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)Convention they had been added to the list. In the event, four british firms and Volvo had submitted tenders. Volvo had out-distanced all its British competitors on quality, performance and price. The Volvo truck was the cheapest in terms of capital cost;and, with a life expectation of 15 years, it would be much lessexpensive in terms of annual cost. The Board of Trade were satisfiedthat Volvo were not basing their tender on a dumping price.The Chairman of the British Leyland Motor Corporation(BLMC), Lord Stokes, had represented that a decision to buy Volvotrucks would have serious repercussions on the British industry&apos;sexports. The total cost of 900 vehicles and spare parts, however,was about  7 million over 12 years; and this had to be comparedwith Army expenditure of nearly  50 million a year on vehicles andspare parts, virtually all of which accrued to the benefit of the Britishincreases for teachers in England and Wales in 1971-72. He had subsequently written to the NUT, therefore, reaffirming theconditions on which the Government had agreed to the settlementprovisionally reached in the Burnham Committee on 3 March; andSir Ronald Gould, the General Secretary of the NUT, had undertaken to bring his letter to the notice of the union&apos;forthcoming annual conference.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statements by the Secretaries of State forScotland and for Education and Science.The Cabinefs attention was drawn to speculation in the press that in a report to be published shortly after Easter the national board for Prices and Incomes would recommend an increase in breadprices. The Minister of Agriculture was at present considering theBoard&apos;s report; and the premature disclosure of its contents, whichwas most unfortunate, would complicate the handling of its recommendations.
industry. It also compared with Swedish imports from the UnitedKingdom of vehicles and spares worth over  42 million and withimports of vehicle components from the United Kingdom by Volvoof over  20 million in 1968. Volvo and BLMC were also competingfor the provision of one-ton trucks for the Army; and there was agood prospect that, provided that BLMC quoted a competitive price for the Rover truck, they would secure the order. In the case of10-ton trucks, however, the Army&apos;s operational requirements,considerations of public expenditure and our obligations to EFTAall pointed the award of the contract to Volvo.The Minister of Technology said that the award of this contract to a foreign supplier would cause serious damage to BLMC and tothe British commercial vehicle industry as a whole. The industryexported 40 per cent of its output, worth at least  200 million ayear; and BLMC, which was virtually the only major British-ownedcompany remaining in the industry, exported some 90,000commercial vehicles in 1969. The grounds for assuming that theVolvo truck would have a much longer life than its Britishcompetitors were not clear; and there was some evidence that theprice quoted for it, which was nearly 40 per cent below the price atwhich it would be sold in other countries, was a dumping price. Inview of the technical complexities of the case and the implications for British exports, a full-scale review should be carried out underthe supervision of a non-departmental Minister before any firm order was placed abroad.In discussion it was pointed out that there was no evidencethat the Volvo truck was in fact being offered at a dumping price and that, even if the price were increased to cover the alleged margin of dumping, the Swedish vehicle would still be the most competitive.In these circumstances to award the contract to a British company would be a clear breach of the EFTA Convention. Moreover, itwas not in our interest to follow a protectionist policy in the field of public purchasing now that our balance of payments had sosubstantially improved.On the other hand it was argued that to award such an importantdefence contract to a foreign supplier would represent a major rebuffto the British motor industry, which would have damagingrepercussions on our exports and on employment in the development areas. In view of the uncertainty about the basis of the price quoted by the Swedish company and about the length of life assumed forthe competing vehicles, there was a clear case for holding an inquirybefore a decision was reached.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that opinion in the Cabinet appeared to be evenly divided between thosewho supported the proposal for an inquiry and those who considered
that enough information was already available to enable a decisionto be taken. The Cabinet would resume their discussion after Easter.In the meantime the President of the Board of Trade should seek to establish whether the Volvo truck was being offered at a&quot; dumping &quot; price.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion after Easter.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to circulate amemorandum on the basis of the price quoted for theVolvo truck, for consideration by the Cabinet after easter.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.26th March, 1970.
