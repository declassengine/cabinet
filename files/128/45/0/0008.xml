CC 8 (70)confidential. The Defence Secretary said that the proposal to increaseService pay in three stages, which the Cabinet had favoured at their previous meeting, had proved on closer examination to be opento serious objection on practical grounds. The introduction of thenew Forces Pay Code on 1st April would impose a considerablestrain at all working levels and this would be greatly increased,to the point of possible breakdown, if new scales had to beintroduced twice in six months. Moreover, the changeover was bound to throw up a large number of difficult problems affectingindividual Servicemen; and these would be accentuated by dualstaging this year. After consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the First Secretary of State, he proposed that theincrease should be paid in two stages. The first stage would involve an average increase of about 18 per cent and would be paid on1st April, 1970; the balance of the increase would be paid 12 months later. From 1st April, 1970, the special Northern Ireland allowance would no longer be paid to married men. These modificationswould not involve any increase in cost.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the increases in Service pay should be paid intwo stages in accordance with the arrangement proposedby the Defence Secretary.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that, atthe meeting of the Burnham Committee on 13th February, themanagement side had proposed that there should be no pay increasein April 1970, but that a settlement based on restructuring shouldtake effect from 1st October, 1970. The teachers&apos; representatives had agreed to consider this; and another meeting of the Committeehad been arranged for 11th March. This would involve an undulylong delay and he hoped it would be possible to get the date of themeeting advanced. In the meantime, the teachers refused to calloff their strike action. He accordingly proposed to make a statement in the House of Commons on the following day emphasising thevalue of the offer made to the teachers and appealing to them tosettle the dispute.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that progress in thenegotiations with the Scottish teachers had been held up bydevelopments in England. With the approval of the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes he had made an offer of 11 percent; but it seemed clear that he would need to go beyond this perhaps to as much as 14 per cent in order to reach a settlement.B*
The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the statement by the Secretary of State for education and Science.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the ministerial  Committee  on  Prices  and  Incomes  toconsider whether the offer to the Scottish teachers shouldbe increased.The Secretary of State for Social Services said that, in the lightof the discussion at their previous meeting, he had considered withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the First Secretary of Statewhat offer should be made to the nurses at the next meeting of the whitley Council. They had agreed that an attempt should be madeto secure a settlement by advancing the date on which the second stage of the pay increase would be paid; and that the offer of a one-year increase of 20 per cent should be made only if this attempt was unsuccessful.The Cabinet-(4) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the social services Secretary.Ford Motor The Cabinet were informed that there was a reasonableCompany: Pay p,-0Spect that the men who were on strike at the Ford MotorNegotiations    Company&apos;s plant in Swansea might soon decide to return to work.It was hoped that the company might conclude a formal agreementwith the unions shortly thereafter.The Cabinet (5) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would arrange for the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes to consider the terms of the Ford motor company&apos;s agreement with the unions when they were reported to the Government.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (70) 21) on the LondonAuthorities (Transfer of Housing Estates, etc.) Order, 1970.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theLondon Government Act, 1963, required the Greater london council (GLC) to submit to the Minister of Housing not later than April, 1970, a programme of transfers of GLC housing to London boroughs. Where the GLC and any borough were in agreement inrequesting an Order for a transfer, the Minister had no option butto lay one. The GLC had now agreed with 25 London boroughsfor the transfer of 46,000 out of a total of 210,000 GLC houses inNurses&apos; Pay(previous reference:CC (70) 7thConclusions,Minute 4)HousingPolicyThe LondonAuthorities(Transfer ofHousingEstates, etc.)Order, 1970
Greater London. He had made the requisite Order on 5th february and proposed to lay it that afternoon. The GLCs proposals were open to strong objection. London&apos;s housing problems could never be properly tackled unless they were treated as a whole; and anyfragmenting of the GLCs strategic housing role would be in conflict with this principle. For this reason, the South-East economic planning Council had recommended that all London&apos;s housingproblems should be handed over to the GLC. In several cases, theproposed transfers would involve splitting single estates, which cutright across the principles of good housing management. As against this, it must be recognised that under the local authorities&apos; proposalselaborate arrangements would be made to maintain nominationrights for the GLC in the transferred estates; and there were obviousdifficulties in rejecting proposals for transfer on which both the GLCand the boroughs concerned were agreed. There was strong opposition to the proposed transfer in the Labour group on the GLCand among Labour Members of Parliament representing Londonconstituencies. It could be assumed that when the Order was published a number of Government backbenchers would pray against it and since he could hardly adopt a neutral attitude to such a Prayerhe proposed that he should advise the House to accept it.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government had decided after very careful consideration that, under the arrangementsset out in the White Paper on the Reform of Local Government inEngland, housing management in the new metropolitan areas shouldbe given to the second-tier authorities. Conditions in these areas were broadly similar to those in London; and it would be difficultto defend a decision to make housing management a function ofthe upper tier only in the capital. On the other hand it was argued that London&apos;s housing problems were unique and that there was noreason why they should be treated in the same way as those of theproposed new metropolitan areas. Historically there were considerable differences between London and the other conurbationsin matters of housing policy, not least because of the strategic roleplayed by the former London County Council over many years. Theneed to cater for large-scale movements of population between the boroughs and at the same time to maintain reasonable consistencyin the level of rents throughout Greater London created very special problems. Too little thought had been given in the past to these problems and to the respective roles of the GLC and the boroughsin tackling them.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentshould lay the Order forthwith.   As soon as was convenient after
it had been published he should arrange for the Press to be informed of the Governmenfs view that, in the light of the views expressedby the South-East Economic Planning Council, further consideration should be given to the respective roles of the GLC and the London boroughs in the field of housing management; and that for thisreason, while he was obliged under the terms of the Act to lay theOrder, he proposed to advise the House to vote against it.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government-(i) to lay the London Authorities (Transfer of HousingEstates, etc.) Order, 1970, forthwith;(ii) to arrange for the Press to be informed of the government&apos;s views on the lines indicated in thePrime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.17th February, 1970.
