OverseaAffairsNigeria(previous reference:CC (69) 61stConclusions,Minute 2)1. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said thatresistance in the rebel enclave was now at an end and that theimmediate task was the organisation of relief supplies. It was clearthat all who wished to help in this respect would have to work inco-operation with the Federal Military Government (FMG) and the nigerian Red Cross. In view of past difficulties, both might reactwith suspicion or impatience to some offers. He hoped that thiswould not apply in our own case, although there had already beendelay in securing clearance for the Hercules aircraft of RAF SupportCommand which was standing by to transport medical supplies toNigeria. This might be due to the FMG&apos;s preference that reliefoperations should be conducted on a civilian, rather than on amilitary, basis. In order to deal with developments of this kind andto co-ordinate interdepartmental action in relation to the reliefoperation, a working group of officials from the Departments directly concerned had been established, and for the present would meetdaily.The Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State, foreign and Commonwealth Office, Mr. Maurice Foley, had gone to Lagosand would seek to clarify the situation in discussion with the Headof the FMG, General Gowon. In the light of his report a clearerpicture would not doubt emerge of the nature of the relief supplies which were most urgently required and the manner in which wecould most effectively contribute to the operation. The populationof the former enclave was about 4 million, of whom about one-thirdwere in areas which had now been taken over by Federal troops.Access to these areas would be comparatively easy; and now thatMajor-General Efflong, who had been left in command of the remnants of the &quot; Biafran &quot; forces, had instructed them to lay down their arms, Federal troops would presumably be able to take overthe whole enclave.It was the more unfortunate that we had been involved ina serious breach of security as a result of the publication, in the sunday Telegraph of 11th January, of a report by the DefenceAdviser to the United Kingdom High Commission in Lagos,Colonel R. E. Scott. The incident was being investigated, but,although it was bound to have an adverse effect on Anglo-Nigerianrelations to some extent, its impact had probably been less damagingthan if it had occurred at an earlier stage.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the developmentsover the week-end, he had been in touch by telephone with thePresident of the United States, Mr. Nixon, and had also discussed the situation with the Ministers concerned.   As a result, we had11366A 2
taken all the immediate action open to us at the moment; and wemust now seek to ascertain, in consultation with the authorities ofthe FMG, how further aid would best be co-ordinated and directed towards the real requirements, which were not yet fully known. LordHunt, who would shortly be arriving in Lagos, should be particularlyhelpful in this respect. The problem of relief would be greatlysimplified if land routes could now be used; and if, as seemed likely,transport still constituted a problem, we could supply furthervehicles. A major civil engineering firm, engaged on a project in nigeria, had offered to place their resources at the disposal of theFMG. This would be invaluable especially if the FMG were to insist on relief activities by other countries being carried out onan exclusively civilian basis. General Gowon himself appeared to wish to treat his defeated adversaries with magnanimity; and it wasto be hoped that he would be able to make his intentions effective.But there was some danger that the Nigerians, having achieved their military objectives and eliminated &quot; Biafra&quot;, might turn in onthemselves: and this tendency might be encouraged by the soviet union. Attempts would undoubtedly be made to attribute to usa share of the blame for the further starvation and hardship whichwould then result: and it was all the more important, therefore,that our offer of aid should be prompt, generous and effective. TheUnited States Government had already indicated their readiness to contribute a large sum to the relief operation; and we shouldmake a corresponding gesture, even though it might not be possiblefor practical reasons to expend the whole of any sum which weoffered, at any rate immediately. It would be advisable for astatement of the Governments proposals to be made in the Houseof Commons at an early date by himself or by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary, probably on 19th January.In the course of a brief discussion it was suggested that the events of the past few days had completely vindicated the policywhich the Government had pursued since the outbreak of the rebellion. It would be undesirable, however, to be concerned to claim credit for this at a time when it would be important to seek to heal the wounds of the war and to look to the future rather than to the past.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary and of the points made in discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for astatement on the Nigerian situation to be made at anearly date in the House of Commons.
secret. The Paymaster General said that, in response to a claimfrom the trade unions concerned for a pay increase of 17 per cent for manual workers in the gas supply industry, the Gas council had (as authorised by the Government) made an offer of a 10 per cent increase. This was rejected on 22nd December, 1969; and theSub-Committee on Prices and Incomes of the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes had subsequently decided not to authorise the gas Council to make an improved offer. This decision wasreviewed on 12th January by the Steering Committee on economic policy (SEP), at which he had informed the Committee that the gas Council had indicated that, because of the risk of hardship anddanger to the public if the workers had recourse to unofficial strike action, they intended that day to make an offer of an increase of up toIs. O^-d. an hour for craftsmen (a 14 per cent increase), even though they were not authorised to do so by the Government. Inaccordance with SEP&apos;s conclusions he had told Sir Henry Jones,the Chairman of the Gas Council, that Ministers thought itunacceptable to concede a 14 per cent pay increase withoutproductivity improvements and had said that the Cabinet might notThe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at themeeting of the Western European Union (WEU) on 9th and10th January he had obtained from the six members of the WEUwho constituted the European Economic Community (e.c.) an assurance that they would keep us informed of their discussions about the future form of political co-operation in Europe, and thatthere would be no question of final decisions being taken in ourabsence.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that theEuropean Commission had attended the economic discussions atthe meeting. There had been a good deal of declared support forthe view that we should not have to bear more than our fair shareof the cost of support of the Common Agricultural Policy of the eec.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster.
approve any price increase for gas resulting from a wage settlementabove the authorised 10 per cent level. On the evening of12th January, Sir Henry Jones had sent him a further letter recordingagreement with the trade unions on a 14 per cent pay increase,which would entail an increase in costs of  20 million a year.Productivity savings in the gas industry were currently worth 6-2 million a year; and the pay settlement would be accompanied by an extension of productivity schemes (with a review by both sides of progress in a year&apos;s time). By 1971-72 therewould be further savings on this account of  6-9 million a year.Nevertheless, the industry would need to recover  15-7 million ayear through price increases, implying a A\ per cent rise in the gasbills of domestic consumers.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would recognise thatthe physical risk of explosions if industrial action led to seriousreduction in gas pressures meant that in such circumstances therewas no alternative to shutting down supplies completely over a wide area, with very serious economic effects. Even so, the Gas council had reacted to this threat by a disturbing disregard for the government&apos;s prices and incomes policy. This would strengthen the impression that in the public sector there were two versionsof the policy one more rigorously applied to government employees, where a direct financial sanction could be invoked; theother a more independent line adopted by the nationalised industries,who judged that they could afford to allow unjustified wage increases on the basis of a tacit assumption that they could recoup the costat the expense of the consumer by means of price increases. the government&apos;s counter to an inconsiderate action of this kind in thepublic sector could be to refuse agreement to such price increases;and in the present case pressure might be brought to bear on the gas Council through control of their prices to adopt in future a more realistic approach to wage increases and to seek ways of reducing, orcompensating for, the costs of the settlement.In discussion it was argued that, if the Gas Council and theGovernment had presented a united front in the pay negotiations onthe 10 per cent offer, the threats of industrial action might well nothave been realised. But to seek to subject the pay increase whichhad now been agreed to a standstill direction, pending an enquiry bythe National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI), would be likelyto provoke industrial action. The alternatives accordingly were either to concentrate pressure on the consequential price increases by making these the subject of an NBPI reference or, possibly, toallow payment of a 10 per cent increase and to make the remaining4 per cent the subject of a standstill direction and a reference to the nbpi. The exact character of the reference to the NBPI under thefirst alternative would need to be carefully considered. It might be
limited to the price consequences of the immediate wage settlement;or, preferably, it might be a full efficiency audit, covering among other things the price structure of the industry and its costs, togetherwith the possibilities of reducing expenditure in order to compensate for increased costs, either by means of higher labour productivity or as a result of a reduction in the industry&apos;s capital investment programme and promotional outlay. A reduction in the investment programme of the gas industry might be made with little damage tothe economy, since the prospects of price reductions from natural gas following the pay settlement might be much less than the gas council had so far claimed. On the other hand it was argued thatthe reference to the NBPI should be so framed as not to expose theGovernment to criticism for having been prepared to authorise a10 per cent increase, which was itself above the norm set out inthe White Paper on Productivity, Prices and Incomes after 1969(Cmnd. 4237). Moreover, a reduction in investment programmes in an attempt to prevent price increases would not merely entailfor the nationalised industries a reduction in profit and a failure to achieve their financial targets but would also create for the economy as a whole serious problems of demand management if wage increases were not restrained at the same time.In further discussion it was argued that excessive settlementswell above the norm had recently been approved because of the alleged dangers of strike action. But in the water supply industry,for example, the employers had volunteered the pay offer, and hadnot been forced to concede it during the negotiations; and it was thisirresponsibility on the part of the employers which must, if possible,be checked. In any event the Government now faced a situationwhich compelled them to review their incomes policy and to considerwhether in present circumstances they could realistically maintain itor whether they must be prepared to yield whenever employers facedthe threat of industrial action. In the latter event there could be nostandstill directions or NBPI references in respect of the current gasand building industry agreements or of such forthcoming settlementsas those in the Post Office and the motor industry. Nor would it bepossible to give effect, in the case of the building industry, to thedecision of the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes, namely,that the parties to the agreement should be required to give a firm commitment on introducing a job evaluation system for determiningpay, under the threat of a standstill direction if this were not forthcoming. Equally, it would be difficult to resist on any groundsfurther pay claims at the level of 10-15 per cent increases. On theother hand it was argued that a more searching interdepartmentalanalysis was required before it could be assumed that pay claims and settlements had reached a level at which the economy was
seriously at risk by comparison with our foreign competitors; andwe should be on our guard against talking ourselves into renewal of wage inflation. Moreover, it should be possible to impose a standstill on the building industry settlement, even if this was not practicable in relation to the gas industry agreement. In the latter case, pressurecould be exerted upon the employers through the price-controllingmachinery, whereas this was not feasible as regards the numerousseparate building employers; and a strike in the building industry would in any event have less serious effects than one in the gas industry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that no standstill should be imposed on the pay increases under the recent agreement on the pay of manual workersin the gas supply industry. The First Secretary of State and the paymaster General should, however, express to the Chairman of the gas Council the Governments serious concern that the council should have seen fit to agree, without adequate authority, asettlement which entailed so large a wage increase and which wasnot based on any special justification as regards productivity orother grounds. There should then be a reference to the NBPI,designed among other things to impress on employers generally thatconcessions on wages could not automatically be passed on in highercharges to customers. The exact terms of this reference should besettled by the Ministers most closely concerned in the light of the outcome of the discussion with the Gas Council; but it might extend to an efficiency audit as well as to an examination of the industry&apos;spricing structure and costs and to the various possibilities of reducingcosts, e.g. through labour productivity or a reduction in the industry&apos;scapital expenditure programme without prejudice to its achieving its financial targets. As regards the building industry pay settlement,the First Secretary of State must be free to adopt whatever attitudeshe thought necessary in the light of the Governments decision ongas industry pay. Ministers would need to consider at an early dateproposals from the First Secretary of State on the strategy which theGovernment should adopt on future incomes policy issues.The Cabinet-CD Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State:(i) In consultation with the Paymaster General toexpress to the Chairman of the Gas Council theGovernments concern about the current wagesettlement, as indicated in the summing up by thePrime Minister.
confidnetial cabinet 3.   The Prime Minister said that, before inviting the CabinetSecurity of to consider the substance of the next item on their agenda, the pay ofDiscussion school-teachers in England and Wales, he must draw their attentionto a serious breach in the security of earlier Ministerial discussionof this subject at a particularly sensitive point in the negotiationswith the teachers. On 31st December, 1969, the Prices and IncomesCommittee had considered the teachers&apos; claim and had reachedcertain conclusions about the Governments attitude towards it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer, as Chairman of the Committee,had given a specific warning about the importance of maintainingstrict security about these conclusions; and the discussion had beenseparately recorded in a Confidential Annex to the minutes, whichhad been given only a limited distribution. Nevertheless, it was clear that the gist of it had been obtained by the Press; and thepremature disclosure which had resulted had caused considerableembarrassment to those responsible for the negotiations. He had therefore decided that further steps must be taken to reinforce thesecurity of collective discussion of delicate issues; in particular,the Chairmen of Cabinet Committees would henceforward have discretion to stipulate that, when a particularly important or sensitiveitem was included in a Committee&apos;s agenda, attendance at themeeting -should be restricted to the Ministers responsible for theDepartments directly concerned, who would be expected to attend the discussion in person.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science (C (70 5) about the pay of school-teachers in England and Wales.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that,invoking the discretion given to him by the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes, he had told the Management Panel of the burnham Committee that no objection would be raised to an offerPay of school-teachers in Englandand Wales(previous reference :CC (69) 61stConclusions,Minute 4)11366(ii) In consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Paymaster General to make a reference tothe National Board for Prices and Incomes on costs and prices in the gas industry, as indicatedin the summing up by the Prime Minister.(iii) To circulate a memorandum on the strategy whichthe Government should adopt on future incomes policy issues.
to the teachers of, or equivalent to,  85 per annum overall. the panel had made such an offer in the form of increases tapering from 100 to  80. The teachers had rejected this offer and had said thatthey would take no part in arbitration. Strikes were now takingplace in some 500 schools; a further similar group of two-week-longstrikes would follow; and these might be succeeded by area strikes.Members of the Associations of Assistant Masters and AssistantMistresses might also strike, disrupting the preparation of pupils forthe General Certificate of Education and the conduct of theexaminations themselves. Officials of the Department ofEmployment and Productivity (DEP) were meeting the teachers&apos;representatives shortly. The latter might be persuaded to co-operate in arbitration if the Chairman of the Panel were to be a retired HighCourt Judge and if the teachers were given assurances that theGovernment would not seek to over-ride the arbitration award underthe provisions of the Remuneration of Teachers Act; that theGovernment were willing to consider further the machinery for settling teachers&apos; pay and their conditions of service; and that thereport of the proposed reference to the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI) on the structure of teachers&apos; pay would be madeavailable to the Burnham Committee in time to be taken into account in the negotiations for a new settlement from April 1971. If the teachers still rejected arbitration, the principal courses open to theGovernment would be either to make an immediate reference tothe NBPI of the proposed interim increase which might havepresentational advantages, although the recommendations of theBoard might be below the  85 already offered and could not be implemented unless endorsed by the Burnham Committee; or to adhere to the current offers and to face the consequent strikes; orto appoint an arbitral panel in spite of lack of co-operation by the teachers. It might also be possible, though he would not recommendthese courses, to impose an award by legislation; to make sufficientadditional finance available to enable the local authorities to make an increased offer; or to seek a writ of mandamus directing the teachers to co-operate in the arbitration procedures. In all thecircumstances, which had not been eased by the substantial awardsmade to other workers, he invited the Cabinet to agree that the assurances which he had suggested might be given to the teachers;that an early structural and comparability reference to the NBPIshould be made in preparation for the negotiation of a settlementfrom April 1971; and that, if arbitration were frustrated, theproposed interim increase from April 1970 might be referred to the nbpi for an urgent report.In discussion it was argued that there were considerabledisadvantages in any reference to the NBPI of proposals for an interim increase.   No decision on this point needed to be taken,
Civil service non-industrialManpower,1970-71(previous reference:CC (68) 7thConclusions)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C (70) 1) about the proposed ceilings for Civil service non-industrial manpower up to April 1971.The Lord Privy Seal said that, following a decision of theCabinet in January 1968 an overall ceiling had been imposed on civil Service non-industrial manpower in each of the years 1968-69and 1969-70. These ceilings had been announced beforehand inParliament and subsequently adhered to; and they provided a usefulsupplement to the normal system of financial control. Officials were considering whether a more flexible system of manpower planningmight be developed in the long run; but. the present system shouldbe maintained for the coming year in view of its value as a means for keeping non-industrial staff numbers under control and as a demonstration of the Government^ determination to do so. Theexisting ceiling provided for a maximum of 496,500 staff by 1st April, 1970, which would allow an increase of 8,700 during11366B 2however, before the outcome of the discussions between the teachers&apos;representatives and DEP officials was known. It was also suggestedthat it would be of doubtful propriety to give an advance guarantee that the statutory procedure for over-riding an arbitral award wouldnot be used, more especially since, although it was unlikely that theprocedure would in fact be invoked, it would be wrong to allow the award to be implemented if the teachers maintained theirdisruptive tactics after it had been announced. On the other hand,it was argued that such an assurance was essential if there were tobe any hope of securing the co-operation of the teachers in recourse to arbitration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that the First Secretary of State and theSecretary of State for Education and Science should have discretion to offer the proposed assurances to the representatives of the teachers in the hope that they would then co-operate in arbitration andabandon strike action. The Cabinet would resume their discussionearly in the following week in the light of developments.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion in the week beginning19th January.
CONFIDENTIAL1969-70. After discussion with the Civil Service Department thebids made by Departments for 1970-71 amounted to 506,000. Itmight be possible, however, to reduce this figure to 504,000, givenprobable delays in recruitment, the build-up of new work and the continuation of studies (such as that of the panel under thechairmanship of Sir Robert Bellinger) of ways of achieving savings in Civil Service manpower. The increase in the ceiling next year would then be comparable to that for 1969-70 whose announcementhad aroused little opposition. It was generally appreciated that thedemands of Departments were increasing and that Civil Servicenumbers must be related to the workload imposed on the Service by government and Parliament. He invited the Cabinet to agree thata ceiling of 504,000 should be applied up to April 1971; that departments should continue to seek further manpower savings; andthat so far as possible any additional work arising during the year should be absorbed within the proposed ceilings.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposals inC (70) 1. It was suggested, however, that consideration might begiven to making special provision in future years for those staff engaged in work which was fully paid for by outside organisations,for example, research staff engaged on work commissioned by industry.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The proposed ceiling for the Ministry of Defence wouldinvolve a real saving of 2,000 posts after allowance had been madefor the transfer of industrial staff to non-industrial status and for additional work. The ceiling might only be attainable by delaying the change of status, though this should be avoided if possible.(b) Changes in manpower limits were complicating the extensionof the work of the Land Registry. It would be helpful if a three-year forward programme could be agreed, even if the change to the compulsory registration of land had to be slower than originallyplanned.(c) The Inland Revenue were under heavy pressure; and their position should be kept under review. But it was suggested thatit would be realistic to reduce the proposed increase of 2,620 by 100.(d) While the reductions proposed in the staff increases sought by the Home Office were accepted, the position would be kept underreview, since additional staff might be essential if there were an exceptional increase in the prison population or the workload in theLaw Courts became unmanageable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the proposals by the Lord Privy Seal for a ceiling of 504,000 on non-industrial Civil Service manpower up to April1971. Estimates for 1970-71 should be prepared on the basis of the confidential
confidential. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that the Decembertrade returns, which were being published that morning, woulddisclose a zero balance of visible trade on a seasonally adjustedbasis. This was only slightly less favourable than in November; andour exports were continuing to do well.SECRET7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Local Government and Regional Planning (C (70) 2) onoutstanding issues in the field of local government reorganisation.The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that the purpose of his memorandum was to resolveoutstanding points affecting the drafting of the White Paper whichit was planned that the Cabinet should consider on Thursday,22nd January. There were four main points or groups of points,concerning the treatment in the White Paper of local governmenttaxation and financial relationships with Central Government;allowances and salaries for members of local authorities; aldermen;and various electoral issues. In addition there was the questionwhether Central Lancashire and Derby/Nottingham should bemetropolitan areas, which the Cabinet had agreed at their meetingon 11th December, 1969, should be considered at a later stage.In preliminary discussion emphasis was laid on the importanceof ensuring that the White Paper on Local Government in England,the proposed Green Paper on the structure of the National Healthtargets set out in Annex B to C (70) 1, although the cabinet recognised that this might cause difficulties and delays in implementing new policies and improving existing services. the search for further savings in the Departments should continue. TheLord Privy Seal should arrange to take account of the points madein discussion in the consideration now being given to the developmentof a more flexible system of manpower planning.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed that a ceiling of 504,000 should be set for CivilService manpower up to 1st April, 1971.
Service and the.Bill to reorganise the personal social services were published with the minimum of interval between them, since the issues involved interlocked with one another. The Cabinet thenconsidered in turn the matters arising from the Secretary of State&apos;smemorandum.The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that the Ministerial Committee on Local government reorganisation had commissioned a number of studies from officials on this subject. But there was still a considerable amount of workto be done; and there had been no opportunity as yet for consultation on these matters with local authorities or other interests. It wouldnot be practicable, therefore, to deal with the subject of local taxation and financial relationships in the forthcoming White paper in any detail; and the Ministerial Committee had agreed that itwould be preferable to confine the reference in the White Paper to astatement that the Government shared the Royal Commission^ viewthat rates must remain the principal local tax and to promisepublication of a Green Paper on local government finance at a later stage. A suggested form of words was set out in Annex I to his memorandum.In discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in arranging joint studies of local finance with the Labour Party,with due regard to the need to maintain confidentiality.LocalGovernmentTaxation andFinancialRelationshipswith CentralGovernmentThe Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the White Paper on Local Government inEngland should treat the subject of local taxation andfinancial relationships on the lines proposed by theSecretary of State for Local Government and regional planning.Allowances and The Secretary of State for Local Government and RegionalSalaries for Planning said that the Ministerial Committee had agreed that theWhite Paper should acknowledge the need for substantial improvements in allowances to encourage individuals from differentsocial backgrounds to take part in local government, with a viewto discussions with the local authority associations being conductedduring the next 12 months. On salaries they had concluded thatthe White Paper should say that the matter would be further considered when there had been experience of the working of the improved allowances and perhaps also of the burden placed uponcouncillors by a reorganised local government. On furtherconsideration he had himself come to the conclusion that, given the wide division of opinion on whether councillors should be paid,the White Paper should not go beyond saying that the Government
The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the White Paper on Local Government inEngland should deal with the question of allowances and salaries for members as proposed by the Secretaryof State for Local Government and Regional Planning.The Cabinet Aldermen (3) Agreed that the White Paper on Local Government inEngland should state that there would be no aldermenon the new local authorities outside Greater London andthat the question of aldermen in Greater London wouldbe discussed with the authorities concerned.Electoral The Secretary of State for Local Government and RegionalIssues Planning said that a number of questions arose affecting the membership and election of local authorities, on some of which theRoyal Commission on Local Government in England and the earlierCommittee on the Management of Local Government had made recommendations. The Ministerial Committee had agreed that theWhite Paper should merely contain a general reference to theGovernment^ intention to pursue consultations on these matters with the political parties, the Local Authority Associations and the associations of local government officers concerned. The questionwhether there should be a limit on the number of members of themain authorities, as proposed by both the Royal Commission andthe Management Committee, presented special difficulty in view ofthe strong feeling in the Labour Party; and he proposed that theWhite Paper should merely say that the varying needs of the newwould take steps to ascertain the opinions of all concerned with aview to reaching conclusions before the time came to presentlegislation.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be a mistake to take a positive line on salaries in the White Paper, whichmight indeed refer to the need to know more about the burden which would remain on councillors after there had been greaterdevolution to officials. The point was made that in the interestsof efficiency it would be essential to pay the chairman of the proposedarea health authorities and, preferably, two or three members inaddition. There were, however, grounds for distinguishing paymentof members of such authorities from payment of councillors; andthe Cabinet would have the opportunity to consider the point further in the context of the proposed reorganisation of the National health service.
authorities would be discussed with local government bodies. the disqualification of local government employees from membership ofthe council which employed them was another point of difficulty;but he suggested that this might be better considered in discussion on the White Paper, when the views of the Ministerial Committeewould be known.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the White Paper on Local Government inEngland should deal with electoral issues as proposed bythe Secretary of State for Local Government and regional Planning.Additional The Secretary of State for Local Government and RegionalMetropolitan planning said that in his view there was a strong case on planninggrounds for establishing a metropolitan authority in CentralLancashire, comprehending the areas of the unitary authorities whichthe Royal Commission had proposed should be centred onBlackburn, Burnley, Preston and Blackpool. The development ofthe proposed New Town at Leyland/Chorley made it additionallydesirable that the area should be planned as a whole.In discussion it was pointed out that the Cabinet had already agreed that metropolitan authorities should be established for WestYorkshire and South Hampshire in addition to those recommendedby the Royal Commission. To establish a further metropolitanauthority for Central Lancashire would represent a furtherderogation from the unitary principle favoured by the RoyalCommission in the direction of two-tier local government, whichwould be the more anomalous in that it was proposed to reorganisethe National Health Service on a unitary basis. Moreover, themore metropolitan authorities that were established, the widerwould be the area over which responsibility for education wouldbe divorced from that for the personal social services, contraryto the recommendation of the Committee on Local Authority and allied Personal Social Services (the Seebohm Committee). The case for a metropolitan authority for Central Lancashire was also opento question on merits. Blackburn and Burnley had much in commonand might, indeed, be eventually combined as a single unitaryauthority. But Blackpool had little connection with the rest of thearea; and the development of the Preston area was related mainly tothe needs of Manchester. It was suggested that Blackburn andBurnley might be reassured by the prospect of having some influence in the planning of the New Town; but the general view was that thecreation of a metropolitan authority would be more likely to revivefears that the New Town would drain North-East Lancashire of population and prosperity.   The area had at present none of the

The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Social Services (C (70) 3) and the Secretary of State for LocalGovernment and Regional Planning (C (70) 4) about implementation of the report of the Committee on Local Authority and AlliedPersonal Social Services (the Seebohm Report).The Secretary of State for Social Services recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had approved a statement accepting the proposed integration in a single family service of the localauthority children&apos;s and welfare services and certain other service as recommended by the Seebohm Committee; and they had authorised consultations with a view to early legislation. In theevent, the proposed statement had not been made, but The Queen&apos;sSpeech had subsequently promised legislation for the current Session.Drafting of the Bill was in progress; but there were certain pointsoutstanding on which the view of the Cabinet was required. One ofthese, the precise division of functions between the new localauthority social service and a reorganised National Health Service,could be more appropriately considered in the context of theproposed new structure for the National Health Service, which theCabinet were to discuss later in the week.As for the scope of the Bill, the Ministerial Committee on social Services had agreed that the Bill should be limited toorganisational changes and should not attempt to extend the powers or duties of local authorities as the Social Work (Scotland) Act 1968had done. They had also agreed that there should be a statutorysocial services committee supported by a statutory officer, whose11366characteristics of a conurbation; it would be time enough toconsider the establishment of a metropolitan authority when the need arose.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet was that there should not be ametropolitan authority for Central Lancashire. They also agreedthat, on this basis, there could be no question of establishing such an authority for Derby/Nottingham.The Cabinet (5) Rejected the proposal to establish metropolitan authorities for Central Lancashire and Derby/Nottingham.
appointment would be subject to a measure of Ministerial control.This proposal ran counter to the view of the Committee onManagement, which had been endorsed by the Royal Commissionon Local Government in England, that local authorities should beleft free to organise their own affairs as they wished; but theCommittee regarded provision of this sort as vital for the efficiency of the personal social services at this stage of their development. he intended, however, to make it clear during the Second reading debate that the requirement for a statutory committee was notenvisaged as being permanent; following the example of the social work (Scotland) Act 1968, provision would be made for ministerial control over the principal officers appointment to lapse as soon asit was possible to prescribe qualifications for the post. It had beensuggested in the Ministerial Committee that the statutory requirement to maintain a committee should expire after a specified period; butthe majority of the Committee had taken the view that a time limit,to be of any presentational value, would have to be so short as toimperil the satisfactory establishment of the new service. He invited the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions of the Ministerial Committeeon these points.The main point in dispute was whether all local authoritiesshould be required to integrate their relevant services from acommon date, with provision for limited exceptions, or whether theBill should empower Ministers to impose the requirement on differentauthorities at different times. The majority of the ministerial committee, including himself, had favoured the former course,principally on the grounds that further delay would be detrimental to the services concerned and would result in the authorities whichreorganised first securing the best of the available staff.The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that he differed from the majority view of the ministerial Committee that the obligation to integrate should be imposed on all local authorities from a common date. In his view to proceed in this way would stimulate the maximum opposition from local authorities, many of whom would face a double upheavalwithin a very short period first, when they reorganised their social services and, second, when they had to face the general reorganisation of i local government. He therefore favoured the alternative of selective implementation at Ministers discretion, which would enableaccount to be taken of the effect of prospective reorganisation on individual authorities. The proposal by the Secretary of State for social Services, by allowing for exceptions to the general rule, wouldin practice lead to the development of a selective system; and itwould therefore be preferable to proceed selectively from the outset.As regards the question whether the Bill should set a term to the new
statutory requirements, he would prefer a specific time limit of, say,five or seven years, for the reasons set out in C (70) 4; but he wouldbe content if a clear statement were made that the statutoryrequirement would be abolished as soon as the development of thenew service permitted. He suggested that, in order to forestallcriticism of the new requirements, the Government should announce their intention to repeal certain other statutory requirements affectinglocal authorities&apos; internal organisation by including in the white paper on Local Government Reorganisation a paragraph on the linesof the Annex to his memorandum.In discussion there was acceptance of the conclusions reached by the Ministerial Committee on the scope of the Bill and theproposed requirement as regards a statutory social services committee and chief officer. On the question whether establishmentof an integrated service should be imposed selectively or &quot; across theboard &quot;, there was support for both the views expressed. It was argued that the local authorities who opposed immediate integrationwere opposed to the Seebohm recommendation itself rather than toany particular method of implementing it and that, once theGovernment made it clear that reorganisation was to proceed, many local authorities would be anxious to press ahead with it in order not to lose the best staff. It was also pointed out that the social workprofession were generally in favour of general implementation.In further discussion it was agreed that a term should notbe set to the new statutory requirements. The proposal by theSecretary of State for Local Government and Regional planning for a passage in the White Paper on Local government reorganisation was acceptable in principle; but the wording wouldrequire further consideration in the light of the respective publicationdates of the White Paper and the Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Bill on Local Authority and Allied personal social Services should not attempt to extend the powers or duties oflocal authorities. On balance, they accepted the majority view ofthe Social Services Committee that local authorities should be made subject to a general requirement to integrate their social services from a common date, with provision for exceptions on the basis ofcriteria to be agreed. They considered that no time limit should beset to the provisions requiring a statutory social services committee;but they agreed that it should be made clear during the SecondReading debate that the requirement was not intended to be permanent. The Secretaries of State for Social Services and LocalGovernment and Regional Planning should agree the terms of a
statement to this effect. The suggestion by the Secretary of Statefor Local Government and Regional Planning that a passage shouldbe included in the White Paper on Local Government Reorganisationstating the Governments intentions towards existing statutory requirements was accepted in principle; but its wording wouldrequire further consideration.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th January, 1970.
