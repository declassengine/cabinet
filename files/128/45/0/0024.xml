The Cabinet were informed of the progress of parliamentary business during the current week. It was expected that parliament would be prorogued soon after 11 a.m. on Friday, 29 May, after theRoyal Assent had been signified to Bills which had passed bothHouses.The Cabinet approved the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament (C (70) 68), subject to the deletion of thewords &quot; and increasing the security of occupants of tied cottages &quot;at the end of paragraph 31.11470-2SECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that at therecent Ministerial meeting in Rome of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO) there had been agreement on the need for amore positive approach to the proposal, made by the Soviet union and its Warsaw Pact allies in 1969, for a European SecurityConference. This agreement was reflected in a declaration on mutualbalanced force reductions, which had been published with the communique at the end of the meeting. It was now proposed to seek the views of all European countries, including both the neutralPowers and the members of the Warsaw Pact, on the possibility ofmaking progress on these lines; and, if their replies were favourableand there were no adverse developments in any other East-Westcontext (e.g. the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks in Vienna), we might hope to promote a conference of Ambassadors in a neutralcapital in order to decide on the best means of arranging further international negotiations on European security, not excluding ourown proposal for a Standing Commission for this purpose.In the course of a brief discussion there was a general welcomefor the more positive approach which, thanks in large measure tothe efforts of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, NATOwas now adopting towards the political aspects of European security.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that recent oilprospecting operations in the area of Buraimi by the Abu DhabiPetroleum Company had aroused the hostility of King Feisal ofSaudi Arabia, who had territorial claims there. These particularoperations had been ended. But the company might renew drilling;and the possibility of further tension between Saudi Arabia and thePersian Gulf States which still looked to us for protection could notbe wholly dismissed. Recent oil prospecting elsewhere had alsocaused some deterioration in relations between Iran and the smallerGulf States. We were using our influence on the side of restraint;and we must hope that it would prove possible to contain theproblem.A 2
Mr. Bobby The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that there seemed to be reasonable prospects that Mr. Bobby Moore, the captain of the side representing England in the Association FootballWorld Cup Competition in Mexico, who had been arrested in Bogotaon a charge of theft, would be released during the course of the day.Otherwise, a potentially delicate situation might develop; and weshould have to consider carefully the form of our further representations to the Government of Colombia.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the british council of the European Movement, which had been in receipt since1963 of an annual grant-in-aid from the Exchequer, appeared to bepreparing to play some part in the forthcoming General Election.In particular, they had established an information centre and hadpublished a speakers&apos; guide to provide information during theElection campaign on questions connected with our application tojoin the European Communities. It was for consideration whetherthe Government should indicate any disapproval of this action,e.g. by withholding the grant-in-aid. On the other hand the  7,500which the Council were due to receive from the Government in1970-71 in general support of the movement (of which  2,500 hadalready been paid) represented only a very small part of their income and was designed primarily to meet the expenses of british representatives at meetings in Europe and of entertaining Europeanvisitors to this country. These and related activities financed by thegrant-in-aid were agreed with the Government in advance; and thegrant was not available to finance propaganda in this country. Inthese circumstances any pressure which we were seen to put on theCouncil at the present juncture might be interpreted abroad as a weakening of the Governmenfs resolve that the forthcoming negotiations with the European Communities should, if possible,succeed.In discussion there was general agreement that the grant-in-aid should not be suspended. In any public discussions we should emphasise that it had been paid continuously since 1963 and thatthis relatively small contribution to the Councils funds did not mean that the Government were responsible for their policy. There v/ould be no objection, however, to reminding the Council that any undueintervention in the General Election would be difficult to reconcilewith grant-aided status; and it would be advisable to find an early opportunity of making this clear to them.The Cabinet-Took  note  of  the  statements  by  the Foreign  and commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and of the points made in discussion.British Councilof theEuropeanMovement:Grant-in-Aid
IndustrialAffairsDockworkers(previous reference:CC (69) 55thConclusions,Minute 3)GranadaTelevisionCompanyIndustrialCivilServiceCONFIDENTIAL3. The First Secretary of State said that the trade unions whowere recognised by the port employers for the purposes of nationalwage negotiations had presented a demand for an increase in thenational minimum time rate for dockworkers and had called for industrial action if the employers made no offer by 1 June. the pay increase, however, would not be matched by any concessions on productivity on the part of the dockworkers; and, if it were granted,settlements under Stage II of the recommendations of the DevlinCommittee on the Port Transport Industry were likely to be at ahigher level than had so far been contemplated. The port employersintended to try to maintain negotiations; but the deadline of 1 june was unrealistic. Mr. 0&apos;Leary, the National Docks Group Secretaryof the leading trade union in question, the Transport and general works Union, also intended to deal with the issue at a deliberatepace; but there might well be unofficial action in support of theclaim. The Government should not exert any pressure on theemployers to arrive at a settlement which would have a significantinflationary effect. Nor was the case one which Mr. Feather, theGeneral Secretary of the Trades Union Congress (TUC), could beexpected at this stage to help to resolve. But she would keep intouch with both parties to the negotiations.The First Secretary of State said that the Association ofCinematograph, Television and Allied Technicians had claimed apay increase from the Granada Television Company (GTC) on theground that the change to a 625-line television transmission system had entailed an increase in productivity which entitled their members to higher pay. After invoking the normal constitutional procedure,the union had now called an official strike. They had no doubtselected the GTC for attack in the hope of breaking the united frontpresented by the independent television companies as a whole in pay negotiations. This also was an instance where the services ofthe TUC General Secretary could not be called upon. But she would keep in touch with him and would suggest to the GTC thatthey might ask for the help of Lord Goodman, who had assisted inresolving the 1964 strike of the staff of the independent televisioncompanies and in averting a strike at the British broadcasting corporation in the previous year.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the First Secretary of State.The Lord Privy Seal said that he had not finally succeeded in reaching a pay settlement on Wednesday, 27 May for the industrial civil Service within the limits authorised by the Ministerial11470-2
CivilServicePhotoprintersCommittee on Prices and Incomes but that he hoped to do so onFriday, 29 May. Failing a settlement, however, he might need to consult his colleagues as a matter of urgency.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Civil Service Union (CSU),acting on behalf of 2,000 photoprinters who were employed mainly in the Ministries of Defence and Technology and the Department ofHealth and Social Security, were seeking to abandon the existing arrangements for Pay Research Unit (PRU) surveys for theseemployees and to link the pay of photoprinters with that of grades in the general service classes. They were claiming a 12 per centpay increase against a PRU finding that their pay was alreadyequivalent to that in comparable employment elsewhere. TheGovernment offer had been limited to a 9 per cent increase; butthe photoprinters had threatened that, in the absence of a further concession, they would resume their &quot; go-slow &quot; on Tuesday, 2 June,and Ministers should consider before then whether to stand firm.This might entail taking disciplinary action (for example, bysuspending photoprinters from work) or, at the least, dispensing witha large part of the output of the photoprinters while the &quot; go-slow &quot;lasted.MuseumWardersThe Lord Privy Seal said that the CSU were also pressing a claim for a 25 per cent pay increase for museum warders. This, too,might lead to a &quot; go-slow &quot;, which would have the effect of closingsome museums at weekends.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Lord Privy Seal on pay negotiations for industrial civil servants, Civil Servicephotoprinters and museum warders.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange, so faras possible, for the Ministers principally concerned to beavailable to give urgent consideration to proposals forthe further conduct of the negotiations in connectionwith the pay of Civil Service photoprinters, etc.BOAC The President of the Board of Trade said that the British AirlinePilots Pilots Association had just presented to the British Overseas airways corporation a new claim for increases in the pay of pilots. It was unlikely, however, that the resultant negotiations would reach acritical point in the next few weeks.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.
Prices andIncomesPolicyDoctors&apos; and dentists&apos;RemunerationMotorInsuranceand RepairsCONFIDENTIAL4. The Prime Minister said that, at a meeting which he andthe Secretary of State for Social Services had just concluded,representatives of the British Medical Association (BMA) and theBritish Dental Association (BDA) had sought an assurance that,when the Report of the Review Body on Doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos;Remuneration was published, its recommendations (which included a proposal for a very substantial pay increase) would be implemented in full. He had, of course, refused to give such an assurance; andit was therefore likely that, unless more moderate counsels prevailed,members of the BMA might now carry out their threat of militantaction within the National Health Service by withholding sicknesscertificates. If they did so, however, they would risk losing a greatdeal of public sympathy.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement.The Prime Minister recalled that the Ministers concerned hadbeen invited to examine the desirability of early references to theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) on the costs of motorinsurance and costs and charges in the motor repair and servicingindustry. The Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes,however, had recommended that the potential disadvantages of anearly reference on motor insurance costs, particularly in terms ofthe possible effect on international confidence in the Britishinsurance market, would outweigh the advantages. In thesecircumstances the reference would be confined to costs and charges for motor servicing and repairs; but it would serve to bring intorelief a main element in motor insurance costs.The Minister of Technology said that the Society of MotorManufacturers and Traders and the Motor Agents&apos; Association had represented to him that the terms of the reference on motor servicingand repairs should not be settled until he had received, in thefollowing week, the report of the Steering Committee which he had established, with the trade, to examine the NBPFs earlierrecommendations. This request was not unreasonable; and it might therefore be preferable at this stage merely to inform Parliamentof the intended reference and to settle its precise terms during thefollowing week after further discussion with the trade.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the reference to the NBPI should be confined tothe costs and charges of the motor repair and servicing industry and
EnvironmentalPollutionDraft white paper(previous reference:CC (70) 23rdConclusions)confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Local Government and Regional Planning(C (70) 67), to which was attached a proposed White Paper &quot; TheProtection of the Environment: The Fight Against Pollution &quot;.The Secretary of State for Local Government and regional planning said that an ad hoc meeting of Ministers had consideredthe proposed White Paper in draft; and, subject to the approval ofthe Cabinet, he proposed to present it, jointly with the Secretaries ofState for Scotland and Wales, to Parliament that afternoon.In discussion, the following points were made:(a) Commitments (for example, in paragraph 62) to raise grantexpenditure beyond presently approved levels were on the basis that,save as Ministers might otherwise later decide in the annual survey of public expenditure, compensating reductions would be made within the fields of expenditure concerned.(b) Paragraph 46, which stated the Governmenfs intention to publish, with a view to consultation with those concerned, draftproposals for banning commercial supersonic flights which couldcause a boom to be heard on the ground, would put us in the same position on this issue as the United States Government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the draft White Paper, subject to the points madein discussion, and agreed to its presentation as proposed.The Cabinet Approved C (70) 67.AircraftIndustryConcorde(previous reference:CC (69) 60thConclusionsMinute 4)  &apos;secret . The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of technology (C (70) 65) proposing a one-month deferment, untilmid-July, of his meeting with M. Mondon, the French Minister ofTransport, to review the Concorde project.The Minister of Technology said that the letter which he proposed to send to M. Mondon had been agreed with the Attorney-General and raised no point of principle.  The need to defer theSECEETshould be arranged on the lines proposed by the Minister of technology.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
SECRET7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (C (70) 66) proposing changes in the system for increases in public service pensions.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Government were already committed to improving the present system for increasing publicservice pensions; and he had intended to bring proposals for thispurpose before the Cabinet in the coming months. But the advent of the General Election and the publication of specific proposals bythe Conservative Party made it desirable to define the governments position without further delay. The Conservative Party were proposing that the pensions of individuals who retired before 1956should be brought up to the same level as if they had retired in thatyear, with the appropriate increases thereafter; that the purchasingpower of pensions should be protected for the future by regulartwo-yearly reviews; and that pension increases should be payablefrom the age of 55 (instead of 60) for those retiring before that age.The cost could be estimated at  16 million, apart from subsequentincreases. By comparison, the proposals in C (70) 66, which were both fairer and technically simpler, would restore the real value of past pensions awarded before a base date, probably April 1969, and thereafter would preserve the purchasing power of all pensions byregular biennial reviews. There would be no change, however, inthe practice whereby pension increases did not apply below the ageof 60. The once-for-all updating of past pensions would cost about 25 to  30 million; and thereafter the annual cost might be about 35 million. But, since these adjustments would be of the nature of pay and price increases, they would not represent new expenditure for the purposes of the public expenditure survey. The proposals might be criticised as not going far enough on the grounds that,unlike the Governments Earnings-Related Pension Scheme, theywould give the pensioner no share in the nation&apos;s rising living standards. But this would be defensible in view of the fact thatoccupational pensions would be supplementary to pensions underthe State scheme.meeting arose simply from the impending General Election; andthe date which he now envisaged for the meeting would allow timethereafter for the Cabinet to give full consideration to the substantiveissues involved. At that juncture difficult decisions would have tobe taken; and it would therefore be desirable for the Governmentto avoid any precise commitment about the future of the projectduring the Election campaign.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C (70) 65.
In discussion it was recognised that the proposals neededfurther examination in detail and might create new anomalies whileremoving old ones. Nevertheless, they commanded general support,particularly as regards the limitation of the purpose of the biennialreviews to maintaining the purchasing power of pensions. doubts were expressed, however, about tie desirability of making any formal statement of policy at this stage, particularly arentresponse to the publication of the proposals in the conservative party Manifesto for the forthcoming General Election. Moreover,any announcement might prejudice the pending negotiations withthe interests concerned in the adjustments to public service pension schemes made necessary by the Governmenfs Earnings-RelatedPension Scheme. Nor would there be any time for the consultations with representatives of employers and employees which would normally have preceded the announcement of a new policy.On the other hand the issue was bound to be raised during theElection campaign; and it was therefore necessary to give guidance to Labour Party candidates about the Governmenfs policy. Ifthere were objections to a formal and public statement for thispurpose, it might be possible to make the Governmenfs intentionsknown by means of a reply to one of the letters on the subject which ministers were currently receiving.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet broadly approved the proposals put forward by the lord privy Seal, although they would need to be the subject of furtherconsideration and consultation with the interests concerned. Asregards the necessary announcement, a direct statement of policy might be inadvisable; and the Lord Privy Seal should consider, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, how the proposals might best be given rather less obtrusive publicity, possibly by meansof published correspondence with one or more of the variousassociations concerned.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministefs summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to consider, in consultation withother Ministers responsible for public service pension schemes, how the Governmenfs proposals could best bemade known.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28 May, 1970.
