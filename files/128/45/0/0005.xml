SocialServicesReorganisationof the national health Service :Draft green paper(previous references :CC (70) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1 and cc (70) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Social Services on the reorganisation of theNational Health Service and a printers proof of a Green Paper onthe same subject (C(70) 18).The Secretary of State for Social Services said that following thediscussion in Cabinet on 20th January the Ministerial Committee on social Services had considered a draft Green Paper at a meeting which all interested Departmental Ministers were invited to attend.The draft proof incorporated all the changes which the Committeehad agreed and took account of other points which had been raised in correspondence. It would not be possible to estimate the net increase in manpower which would be involved until the consultationson the Green Paper had been completed.The Cabinet Approved the draft Green Paper attached to C (70) 18.UnitedKingdomApplication forMembershipof the EECDraft white paper(previous reference :CC (70) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)SECRET*2. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet to which was attached the draft of a White Paper on theUnited Kingdom application for membership of the european economic Communities (C(70) 17).The Prime Minister said that the draft had been prepared by theDepartments most closely concerned the Treasury, the Foreign and commonwealth Office, the Ministry of Technology, the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Board of Trade and he himself had been kept informed at various stages in its preparation.The substance of the White Paper was summarised in Chapter V.Estimates had been made on the widest possible range of assumptions about the effects of joining an enlarged Community. It was notpossible to make any estimate of the effect of membership on UnitedKingdom capital movements or invisible trade, though he believedthat membership would lead to an inflow of capital as well as animprovement in invisible earnings. It had not proved possible toquantify the beneficial effects of entry the dynamic effects on our balance of payments or rate of economic growth. Thus the estimatesinevitably presented a distorted picture since the size of the adverse effects only had been found capable of estimation. The addition of* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.11373A 2
these quantifiable and adverse effects on agriculture and visible tradeproduced a theoretical range of cost to the balance of payments of between  100 million and  1,100 million annually. But neither the top nor the bottom of this range represented a realistic estimate ofthe overall cost to our balance of payments of the adverse effects of membership. He thought it might be reasonable to assume that thiseventual cost might at the end of a transitional period be of the orderof  700 million a year. This compared with a similar estimate of 500 million a year which had been indicated to Parliament in 1967.The increase since 1967 was partly due to sterling devaluation andpartly to the escalation of the cost of the Comm unity&apos;s common agricultural policy. It was however reasonable to expect now thatwe could obtain a longer transitional period than could reasonably have been expected in 1967, taking account in particular of the factthat the Six had recently agreed for themselves a transitional period to 1977 for the full implementation of their new arrangements for financing Community expenditure. It was only necessary to assumed very small increase in the annual rate of growth of gross domestic product (gdp) as a result of entry into an enlarged Community inorder to provide the additional resources required to meet the costof membership over a long transitional period. The draft white paper was not, of course, intended as a statement of policy thepolicy decision to apply for membership had long since been made but a statement of facts and of the best assessment which theGovernment could provide of the economic consequences of membership. He proposed that the White Paper should be presented to Parliament and debated on a motion to take note of it. TheWhite Paper deliberately avoided setting out the political and otherarguments for and against membership. The introduction of sucharguments would undermine the objective even pessimistic assessment contained in the draft. He proposed to make a statement in the House on the day the White Paper was published and he would shortly circulate a draft of his statement for consideration.In discussion the contents and structure of the White paper were generally approved except for the concluding paragraphs 107and 108. The key to the cost of membership would be the outcome of the negotiations on agriculture and whether or not we could affordthis cost depended upon the effect of membership on the UnitedKingdom growth rate. In this connection the table on page 30 of thedraft was rather discouraging: the United Kingdom growth rate hadbeen low for many years not only in relation to existing member states of the e.c. but also to other countries in Western europe which were not members. It could well be the case that we shouldnot be able in the end to afford the cost which was demanded. Itwas important therefore not to over-emphasise the political and other advantages of membership.   The position which the Government
took in the Debate in the House on the White Paper needed carefulconsideration. Nevertheless the situation was more favourable now than in 1967. The e.c. had now unanimously agreed that UnitedKingdom membership of the Communities was desirable; and our economic, and thus our bargaining, position was much stronger now than in 1967. It must be made clear in the Debate on the white paper that the Government was certainly not prepared to join on terms which involved a cost of anything like the maximum estimates in the White Paper. The White Paper, by demonstrating that wecould not afford to join on any terms offered, might help us in negotiations but on the other hand, the upper figures of the estimates of cost would be taken by many in this country as an indication thatwe simply could not afford to join the e.c. in any circumstances.The range of  100 million to  1,100 million given in paragraph 101had been obtained by adding together the maxima and minima ofdifferent sets of ranges each based on different assumptions. It wasnot, in practice, possible for all the maxima (or minima) to be operative simultaneously. The White Paper dealt, very cursorily withthe consequences of membership for regional development and thedevelopment areas themselves and it would therefore be important for the Government to emphasise in the Debate on the White paper that it would pay the closest attention to the interests of regional development in negotiations.In further discussion it was agreed that the following changes should be made to the draft White Paper:(a) Paragraph 11: six lines from the bottom of the paragraphsubstitute &quot; the Seventies &quot; for &quot; this decade &quot;.(b) Paragraph 28: last two lines. It should be made clear hereas elsewhere that the increases in the price of food and the cost-of-living index would be spread over a number of years.(c) Paragraph 30: line 1, insert &quot;food&quot; between &quot;retail&quot; and&quot; prices &quot;.id) Paragraph 33: amend the final sentence to make clear thatwhile the net income of the farming community as a whole would be higher, the incomes of some farmers would go up and others down.(e) Paragraph 55: delete the second sentence and amend thethird sentence on the following lines:&quot; It is not possible however to make any quantitative assessment of the effect in the United Kingdom, not least because the e.c. havenot settled on a common system of rates and coverage of value added tax and this therefore is a matter which can only be clarified in thecourse of negotiations&quot;.(/) Paragraph 65: line 2, insert &quot; now &quot; after &quot; more workers &quot;.
(g) Paragraph 75: amend the third sentence from the end ofthe paragraph to read &quot; within an enlarged Community, the position with regard to monopolies would be different&quot;. Delete the last sentence of the paragraph.(h) Paragraph 96: penultimate line: substitute &quot;be spread&quot;for &quot; take place progressively &quot;.(/) Paragraph 98: last sentence; substitute &quot;there is very littleinformation &quot; for &quot; there are very little data &quot;.(;) Paragraph 101: the existing draft placed too much openingemphasis on the range of  100 million to  1,100 million and onlysubsequently explained that it was quite unrealistic to take theseextremes. The opening sentences of the paragraph should be redraftedto make clear from the start that the extremes were unrealistic, and why.(k) Paragraph 102: line 2: substitute &quot; include &quot; for &quot; involve &quot;.The final sentence of this paragraph relating to the unquantifiabledynamic effects should be expanded, if possible by reference to therecent appraisal published by the Confederation of British Industryentitled: &quot; Britain in Europe: A Second Industrial Appraisal &quot;.(/) Paragraph 103: line 19: substitute &quot;  39,000 &quot; for &quot;  35,000 &quot;.(m) Paragraph 104: line 8: delete &quot; All &quot;. Line 9: substitute&quot; weight&quot; for &quot; consensus &quot;.(ft) Paragraph 105: line 2: substitute: &quot;the government&apos;s decision to apply &quot; for &quot; question &quot;. Line 4: substitute &quot; It was recognised too&quot; for &quot; Parliament accepted then&quot;. Line 6:substitute: &quot; could be &quot; for &quot; were &quot;. Line 8: substitute: &quot; negotiatefor &quot; for &quot; seek &apos;.(o) Paragraph 107: this should be redrafted to make the points that the White Paper was concerned with assessing the economic consequences of changes in Community policy since 1967. Butsubstantial changes had also taken place elsewhere. For example,Britain&apos;s economic position had been greatly strengthened; the Sixhad now declared unanimously in favour of United Kingdom entry;and the case for closer political unity of the United Kingdom andthe countries of Western Europe was stronger now than before.(p) Paragraph 108: line 1: insert &quot; necessarily &quot; after &quot; not&quot;.Line 3 : substitute: &quot; another &quot; for &quot; this &quot;. Line 7: substitute:&quot; separately &quot; for &quot; alone &quot;. Replace last sentence by the following:&quot; This White Paper demonstrates the need for negotiations to achieveterms on which this opportunity can be seized &quot;.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, emphasised theimportance of maintaining security, not only on the contents of theWhite Paper, but also on their discussion of it. Subject to a numberof amendments which had been agreed in discussion and further
IndustrialAffairsPosi Office :PayNegotiationsand financial objective(previous reference :CC (69) 36thConclusions,Minute 4(24))confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes had considered proposals for increases in pay of Post Office non-engineering staff below middlemanagement level, mainly on the postal side but including sometelecommunications workers. The increases proposed ranged from to \2% per cent and would cost  30 million a year. Some membersof the Committee had argued that these proposals would have unfortunate repercussions on negotiations with the Civil Service and,perhaps, with the teachers; but the majority considered that the PostOffice should be authorised to make the offer and that there shouldconsideration at their next meeting of redrafts of paragraphs 107 and108 revised on the lines indicated in discussion, the Cabinet approvedpublication of the White Paper under the title &quot; Britain and theEuropean Communities An Economic Assessment&quot;. There was,however, an important meeting of the Council of Ministers of the eec on 5th-6th February and the outcome of this meeting mightnecessitate some amendments to the text: if so, he would arrange forthis in consultation with the other Ministers directly concerned. Hewould circulate, for early consideration by the Cabinet, a draft of thestatement which he proposed to make to the House of Commons onthe day of publication of the White Paper. It would be muchpreferable if at all possible, that Ministers should not publicly discussthe contents of the White Paper whether with the Press, on televisionor radio after publication and before the debate in Parliament.He would arrange to see Mr. C. J. Curran, Director General of the bbc, and Sir Robert Fraser, Director General of the independent television Authority, and explain to them that the Government didnot consider it appropriate for this important issue to be made thesubject of a confrontation on television between the advocates andopponents of United Kingdom membership of the e.c.; and further that it would be difficult for Ministers to take part in any public debate on the White Paper in advance of the Parliamentary debate. Hewould report the outcome of these discussions and the Cabinet wouldthen be able to take a final decision on whether it would prove necessary for Ministers to be involved in public discussion of theWhite Paper in advance of the debate in Parliament.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.
be no reference to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI)either on the proposed increases in pay or on the prospects forabsorbing the extra costs without increasing tariffs. The Committeehad also considered the Post Office&apos;s financial objective and tariffchanges in the telecommunications sector. When reviewing the nationalised industries&apos; investment programme in July, 1969 theCabinet had agreed that there was a strong case for raising the PostOffice&apos;s financial objective for telecommunications from 8^ to 9\ or10 per cent. The Prices and Incomes Committee now consideredthat it should be raised to 10 per cent in October, 1970. This would entail an increase in telecommunications charges of about  50 million a year which it would be important to announce, after consultationwith the Post Office Users&apos; National Council, before the Budget. he invited the Cabinet to endorse the conclusions reached by the majorityof the Prices and Incomes Committee on these matters. There was aseparate problem relating to postal charges on which he hoped to beable to report to the Cabinet shortly, following its examination by thePrices and Incomes Committee.The Prime Minister, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Post Office should be authorised to make theproposed offer to their non-engineering workers, as agreed by thePrices and Incomes Committee. They wanted more time to considerwhether any reference should be made to the National Board for prices and Incomes in respect of the proposed increases in pay or their implications for tariffs. They also wished to consider further the general question of the Post Office&apos;s financial objectives, withparticular reference to the possibility of introducing some cross-subsidisation of the postal services by the rapidly growingtelecommunications sector; and also the timing and justification forprospective increases in tariffs in both sectors. The Minister of posts and Telecommunications should circulate a memorandum onthese matters for consideration at an early meeting.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe First Secretary of State, to circulate a memorandumon the lines indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,3rd February, 1970.
