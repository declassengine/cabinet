ParliamentaryAffairsTelevisionand RadioInterviews ofMinistersSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were informed that the British broadcasting corporation (BBC) had approached several Ministers asking to begranted an exclusive interview in their constituencies after thedeclaration of the poll at the forthcoming General Election. ministers should refuse to entertain overtures of this kind, whether from the bbc or from the Independent Television authorities, and should indicate that they must reserve their decision until the occasion arose.OverseaAffairsVisit of theYugoslavPrimeMinisterLaosActs ofViolenceAgainst CivilAircraftSECRET2. The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the yugoslav Prime Minister, Mr. Mitja Ribicic, had visited London from23rd to 26th February. Our main objectives during this visit had been to establish contact with the new Yugoslav Administration; to exchange views on the international situation; and to discuss problemsof trade, economic and technical co-operation, together with defencesales. The visit had gone well. In discussion on the international situation the main theme had been East-West relations, on whichYugoslav views were closely in line with our own. The yugoslav government, for obvious reasons, were strongly opposed to anygeneral acceptance of the Brezhnev doctrine; and this had largelydetermined their attitude towards the Soviet proposal for a european security Conference.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that the PathetLao had regained control of the Plain of Jars and that, in consequence,the military situation was once again as it had been a year ago. Weshould need to take account of the persistent violations by north vietnam of Laotian neutrality whenever we had occasion to considerthe United States policy of refusing to contemplate withdrawal from south Vietnam unless a political settlement had been achieved.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that it was notyet possible to say who was responsible for the recent air disasterin which a Swissair aircraft had exploded in the air over Switzerland,causing the death of all passengers and crew. In their public statement the Swiss Government had spoken only of an &quot; explosion &quot;;but there was a strong presumption of sabotage.    An Arab
organisation which had broken away from the Palestine LiberationFront had claimed responsibility; but other guerilla movements haddisclaimed any connection with the incident. For the present, theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British european airways (BEA) had suspended shipments of freight to Israel; but these might be resumed shortly. We had expressed to the IsraeliAmbassador in London our regret and distress at the incidents whichhad occurred; but we had made it clear that it was difficult to take further action until the responsibility for them had been established.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in reply to aPrivate Notice Question in the House of Commons on 23rd February,he had emphasised that the safety of passengers and crew must be the airlines&apos; first concern. But the BOAC and BEA ban on air freight to Israel, while it might diminish the risk to passengers and crew in theair, inevitably involved some corresponding increase in risk to thestaff dealing with such freight on the ground; and they were tending to refuse to handle it. If satisfactory understandings on security precautions could be reached, however, it should be possible shortly to resume air freight shipments to Israel. In all other respects, BOACand BEA services to Israel were continuing to operate normally.In discussion, it was pointed out that the frequency of acts of violence against civil aircraft in recent weeks and the fact that these were directed exclusively against Israeli or Israel-bound aircraftsuggested that these incidents were due to sabotage. But the available evidence was not yet strong enough to warrant the attribution of specific responsibility. While, therefore, we should continue toexpress publicly our abhorrence of such crimes, and should take suchaction as we could, particularly in the International Civil AviationOrganisation, to prevent their recurrence, we should be careful, in theabsence of further evidence, to refrain from imputing blame to anyparticular country, organisation or individual.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretary and the President of the Board of Trade;and of the points made in discussion.Germany: The Secretary of State for Defence said that 6 Brigade and itsReturn of associated units had been withdrawn from Germany in 1968 in the Brigade and ... . .Associated context or negotiations tor a satisfactory offset agreement coveringUnits our forces in Germany as a whole.   Subsequently, the canadian government had decided to withdraw their armoured brigade fromGermany: and we and the Federal Republic of Germany had beenasked by the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) to remedy the resulting deficiency in NATO defences. The Federal Government,for their part, had already agreed to provide the additional force
contributions for which NATO had asked them; and, as had been indicated in the Statement on the Defence Estimates, 1970, we hadbeen discussing with the Federal Government means by which the extra foreign exchange costs involved in the return of 6 Brigade andits associated units could be satisfactorily offset. The federal government had now made proposals providing for 80 per centoffset; and, despite their strong objection to any measure whichmight be represented as a reversion to the principle of occupation costs, they had made an unprecedented offer of DM13 million towardsthe settling-in costs of the Brigade. Under the arrangements nowproposed the net increase in expenditure across the exchange wouldbe of the order of only  500,000; and there would be a majorbudgetary saving in respect of the cost of the accommodation in theUnited Kingdom which would not be required. In view of these considerations and of the major military and political benefits whichwould result in terms of relations with Germany, the United Statesand NATO as a whole, the Defence and Oversea Policy Committeehad unanimously agreed that the Brigade should be returned toGermany on the terms proposed.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that ithad been accepted at an earlier stage that 6 Brigade should returnto Germany if appropriate financial arrangements could be agreed with the Federal Government. While the Defence and overseas policy Committee had considered that some features of the Germanoffer were still not fully satisfactory, they had agreed that on balance the arrangements proposed should be accepted. In the expectation that we would do so, the Federal Government had been taking acommendably robust line with the United States Government asregards the implementation of the civil aviation provisions of ouroffset agreement, to which we attached importance. He would inform the Federal Chancellor, Herr Brandt, of our decision duringthe latter&apos;s visit to London the following week; and the defence secretary would make the necessary statement in the House ofCommons during the forthcoming defence debate.The Cabinet-(3) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the federal chancellor of the decision to return 6 Brigade and itsassociated units to Germany during Her Brandfs visit to London.(5) Took note that the Defence Secretary would make astatement at the appropriate moment in the House ofCommons.
Irish The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, althoughRepublic we ^one our best to meet the Irish point of view, the Governmentof the Irish Republic had rejected the proposals regarding butter and cheese imports which we had made to them in the recent trade negotiations. As a result we might have to impose countervailingduties; and our relations with the Republic over Northern Irelandmight also be adversely affected. He would be reporting further tothe Prime Minister and the other Ministers concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussion, said that weshould adhere to the attitude which we had adopted and should makeit clear to the Irish Government that we intended to do so, whileallowing them time for second thoughts.The Cabinet (6) Took note of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster&apos;sstatement.(7) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Local Government and Regional Planning (C (70) 33) on making proposals for improvements in land compensation and including a scheme dealing with compensation for injurious affection.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theHome Affairs Committee had approved proposals for a number of improvements in the provisions governing compensation on the compulsory acquisition of land; but they had not been able to reach agreement on the most important of the proposals, which was concerned with the compensation payable for depreciation in thevalue of land resulting from the carrying out of public development on adjacent land. As the law stood, and had stood for more than a century, an owner some of whose land was compulsorily acquired by a public authority was entitled to compensation for any loss causedby severance of his land or injurious affection thereto; but an ownernone of whose land was taken by a public authority had only themost limited rights to compensation if the value of his land wasdepreciated by the public development. In this respect public authorities carrying out development enjoyed a privileged position ascompared with private developers, since owners adversely affectedby private development would in some cases be able to recoverdamages in a common law action in nuisance. This privileged position was a source of embarrassment to local authorities; and the presentCompensationfor InjuriousAffection
state of the law had attracted criticism from the professionalorganisations concerned. He therefore proposed to put public authorities in a position broadly similar to that of private developersby giving owners from whom no land was acquired an entitlement to compensation if the value of their land was damaged by publicdevelopment. This right to compensation should be limited in threeways. First, compensation should only be payable when an action for nuisance would have lain; and in order to make the position clear the types of development which would attract it should be specified in the legislation. Second, no compensation should be payable unless the depreciation exceeded 10 per cent of the value ofthe land. Third, compensation should be assessed two years afterthe development was completed in order to exclude purely temporaryloss of value. The proposals would inevitably involve an increase in public expenditure, which was estimated at between  7-^ million and 15 million a year; but the full impact would not be felt until1973-74 and subsequent years. The subject was one of much public concern; and the House of Commons would the following day bedebating Mr. Walter Clegg&apos;s Planning Blight and Worsenment Bill,which would confer greatly extended rights to compensation in these and other circumstances. He therefore sought the Cabinefs authorityto make a statement in the course of the debate on the lines of thedraft in the Annex to the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the present law on compensation for injurious affection had stood the test of more thana century; and there was no good reason to change it now. Therewas no substance in the argument that public development should betreated on the same basis as private development, because in aggregatethe effect of public development was to increase the value of privately owned land. If some owners lost as a result of public development,others undoubtedly gained; the ownership of property carried with itboth risks and advantages and there was no reason why the state should feel under any obligation to those who lost. The limitationswhich it was proposed to attach to the new right to compensationwere based on no principle and could not be defended; there was noreason why the right to compensation should depend on such factors as the timing and extent of the damage or on an artificial distinctionbetween the consequences of new development and the more intensiveuse of existing buildings and works. The proposals would causeeven more discontent than the present state of affairs, as a result ofthe new distinction between those who qualified for compensation and those who did not; and the final result would be that theproposed limitations would have to be abandoned, at a cost to theExchequer very much heavier than that estimated by the Secretary ofState.
In discussion two main points of view emerged. On the one hand it was argued that the present state of affairs could not be allowedto continue. The scale of public development was now far greaterthan it had been a century ago; and many owners of property were suffering serious hardship as a result of depreciation caused by workssuch as new motorways and urban redevelopment. Owners of smallproperties tended to suffer even more than owners of large propertiesbecause the chances of a part of their land being taken were the less.There was increasing public concern about the problem, particularlyin relation to the London Motorway Box; and, even though it mightnot be possible to confine entitlement to compensation strictly withinthe limits proposed by the Secretary of State, it was politicallyimportant that the Government should indicate a willingness to dealwith the issues involved.On the other hand it was suggested that the Government couldnot afford to become committed to any particular remedy withoutmore thorough consideration of its implications. The cost of theproposals was considerable; and there were many other claims onany resources which might become available, particularly for improvements in the social services. It was likely to prove impracticable to maintain the proposed limitations on the right to compensation, in which case the cost would be much increased andthe prejudice to the Governmenfs other policies so much the greater.Moreover, a selective scheme, such as that proposed, might result inan even greater sense of grievance among those who did not benefitthereby than existed at present. For all these reasons theGovernment should avoid reaching a premature decision. Hardshipwas greatest amongst owner-occupiers of houses and small businesses;and, if any right to compensation was to.be granted, it might need to be restricted to these classes of owner, as was the present right toserve &quot; blight &quot; notices.In further discussion it was suggested that, since the effect ofpublic development was to increase the value of some properties andto diminish that of others, a redistribution of risk and benefit amongproperty owners would be more appropriate than payment ofcompensation by public authorities. This might perhaps be achieved by application of the insurance principle, as had been done in thecase of flood damage.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a general acceptance of the desirability of affording some relief to owners of properties depreciated by public development,particularly owner-occupiers of houses and small businesses, providedthat the cost was not too high. Nevertheless, the Government would clearly be ill-advised to commit themselves in the course of thefollowing day&apos;s debate to the particular proposals put forward by the
secret. The Cabinet were informed that an agreement had beenreached in the Police Council on the previous day for an interim pay increase of 8  per cent for policemen, with effect from 1st January,1970. This settlement was within the limits authorised by the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes.The Cabinet were informed that a pay settlement for the FordMotor Company&apos;s manual workers had now been reached on thebasis of an 18 per cent increase. But the settlement did not commit the management as regards the claim to parity between the Company&apos;sworkers and comparable workers in the Midland motor-car industry;and this issue had been reserved for further consideration. the outcome of the dispute could therefore be regarded as not unsatisfactory. But its effect on the general climate of industrial relations had been somewhat marred by a public statement on theprevious day by Lord Stokes, Chairman of the British LeylandCompany, in which he had accused motor-car workers of deliberatelydisrupting the industry. It was perhaps for consideration whetherthe Government should seek an occasion to rebut the implication that responsibility for industrial unrest lay with the trade unions and,therefore, at one remove with the Government themselves.  But itSecretary of State, especially since the other proposed improvements in the compensation code, which the Home Affairs Committee had recommended and the Cabinet endorsed, should provide sufficient evidence for the time being of the Government^ awareness of theproblems in this area. As regards injurious affection, any statement should not do more than indicate that the Government recognised the existence of a serious issue and were exploring ways and meansof dealing with it. One possible approach, which they proposed to investigate, was the institution of some scheme of insurance, whichwould enable the increase in the value of some properties caused by public development to be set off against the depreciation in the valueof others.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for local Government and Regional Planning to be guided by it in any statement made during the course of theforthcoming debate on the Planning Blight and WorsenmentBill.
could not be denied that the motor-car industry was in fact beingconsiderably affected by widespread industrial disaffection in factoriesproducing components; and, in so far as unofficial action of thiskind was in breach of the undertaking which the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) had given the Government during the discussions on industrial relations in the pervious summer, it might be wiser to refrain from any direct reply to Lord Stokes&apos; allegations and to concentrate on trying to ensure that the TUC implemented their undertaking to intervene effectively in the case of unofficial strikes.SECRETMisuse oi 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeDrugs Bill      Secretary on the Misuse of Drugs Bill (C (70) 34).The Home Secretary said that the Home Affairs Committee had recently considered the range of penalties to be provided in theforthcoming Misuse of Drugs Bill. Existing legislation on thissubject distinguished in principle between the offences of simplepossession of controlled drugs and trafficking in them. But, underthe Dangerous Drugs Act, 1965, which dealt with heroin, cocaine,morphine and cannabis, the two offences had been treated on thesame basis and the same penalty of ten years&apos; imprisonment appliedto each. Under the Drugs (Prevention of Misuse) Act, 1964, which dealt with amphetamines, LSD and other hallucinogens, possessionwas punishable by two years&apos; imprisonment; and there was no separate offence of trafficking. The Committee had agreed that thenew Bill should continue to distinguish between the offences ofpossession and trafficking; but they had also approved a division of drugs into three categories, each of which would attract a separate and appropriate penalty. But if as was clearly right the penalties for trafficking should be increased (e.g. in the case of the most dangerous drugs, from the existing limit of ten years&apos; imprisonmentto a new limit of 14 years), it followed that the penalties for simplepossession of the less serious drugs should be reduced; and theCommittee had recommended that on this basis the penalty forpossession of cannabis might be curtailed from ten years to threeyears. Further reflection, however, had suggested that public opinion might well regard a change of this kind as indicating too lenient an attitude on the part of the Government towards the potentiallydangerous practice of drug-taking; and the Cabinet would wish toconsider whether the political damage which the Government mightsuffer if this impression gained ground was sufficiently serious tojustify a modification of the terms of the Bill before it was introduced.
If so, one of two courses could be adopted. The first would preserve the three categories of controlled drugs but would increase the penalties for simple possession of drugs in the two most seriouscategories from three years&apos; imprisonment to five years in the caseof cannabis and from five years to seven years in the case of heroin,cocaine, etc. The second approach, which on the whole he advised,would be to abandon the distinction between categories of drugsentirely and to provide single maximum penalties for possession andtrafficking respectively. The former might be either ten years orseven years&apos; imprisonment; the latter would be 14 years in all cases.In discussion, there was general agreement that it would be rightto maintain the distinction between the offences of possession andtrafficking and to establish a more flexible and discriminatingclassification of the various categories of drugs. But the proposed reduction of the penalty for simple possession of cannabis from tenyears&apos; imprisonment to three years would be liable to be severely criticised by public opinion, especially by parents and teachers. the impact of this apparent concession to the permissive tendencies insociety would not be offset by the increase in the penalty forpossession in the case of other drugs (e.g. LSD); and the government might be at considerable political risk as a result. It would be veryunwise to underestimate the degree of public concern on this subject and the ease with which the Governments intentions might be misinterpreted.On the other hand, the proposals as approved by the HomeAffairs Committee were the result of very careful consideration andreflected the considered judgment of expert opinion. Of the two alternative courses which the Home Secretary had suggested thesecond would entail a maximum penalty of seven years&apos; imprisonment for simple possession of cannabis; and a sentence of such severity was wholly unrealistic in relation to the offence as committed by, forexample, a schoolchild. Moreover, the penalty actually imposedwould lie at the discretion of the court; and, since it was most unlikelythat the court would in fact deal so harshly with an offence of thiskind, the law itself would be liable to fall into disuse and disrepute.The political risks of proceeding with the proposals as approved bythe Home Affairs Committee could be exaggerated; and in any event it would be wrong, in a matter of this kind, to subordinate therequirements of humanity and equity to political considerations.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared that the Cabinet were in favour, by a small majority, of proceeding with the proposals recommended by the Home AffairsCommittee. But it might help to allay public disquiet if the proposedpenalties for possession of controlled drugs were increased to some
extent e.g. to seven years (instead of five years) for the most seriousdrugs and to five years (instead of three years) for drugs in the secondcategory, including cannabis. The Cabinet agreed that the Bill should go forward on this basis.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the early introduction of the Misuse of Drugs Bill on the basis indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.Post OfficeFinances(previous references:CC(69) 36thConclusions,Minute 4,Conclusion (24)and cc (70) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of posts and Telecommunications (C (70) 20) about Post Office finances.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications said that in theprevious summer the Cabinet had invited him to consider thepossibility of an increase in the financial objective for Post Officetelecommunications. In the light of current interest rates, of the10 per cent Government test discount rate for low-risk investment projects and of the 15 per cent return now sought in the private sector, the existing 8  per cent target was clearly too low. The strong demand stimulated by low charges put an excessive strain on resources; and only 46 per cent of the funds for the very largeinvestment programme over the next five years would be generatedinternally. He therefore proposed that the financial objective shouldbe increased to 10 per cent, which would raise the rate of internalfinancing to 56 per cent. The increases in charges which the PostOffice proposed to introduce from 1st October, 1970, to enable themto meet the new objective would raise an additional  65 million in afull year, and about  30 million in 1970-71. When the issue hadbeen discussed in the previous July it had been thought that asubstantial increase in connection charges might be the major source of finance for the increased target. After further consideration,however, the Post Office had concluded that they should rely mainly on increased rental charges. If the proposals were agreed in principle,he would discuss further with the Post Office the possibility of relyingproportionately more on increased connection charges.The Post Office had also proposed in the previous October certain increases in postal charges from August 1970. He had asked them to reconsider these in the light of expected wage increases and of theprospects for increasing efficiency. The had now proposed that thecharges for the first and second-class letter services should beincreased to 7d. and 6d. respectively from 1st January, 1971, becoming
3p and 2^p on decimalisation in the following month. these increases were excessive. He therefore recommended that the cabinet should approve increases in these charges to 6d. and 5d. respectivelyin January 1971, to be rounded down subsequently to 2^p and 2p.These charges would enable the Post Office services to pay their way,provided that every effort was made to increase efficiency.In discussion it was pointed out that, as a result of the generalagreement reached in the previous July that the financial objectivefor telecommunications should be increased, the forward public expenditure estimates had taken into account the prospective increasein revenue from 1st October. It was not clear, however, why the target could not be raised and the charges increased from 1st July,which would provide an additional  15 million in 1970-71. Moreover,the means by which it was proposed to raise the extra revenue weredifferent from those discussed earlier; and the preference of thePost Office for increases in rental charges rather than connectioncharges had not been clearly justified. It was accepted as appropriate,however, that any increases in rentals should fall more heavily on business lines than on private telephones.In further discussion it was noted that the proposed increases inpostal charges would raise an additional  4 million a month from thedate of introduction and that some change in these charges wouldbe inevitable on decimalisation. Nevertheless, the Governmentshould not condone the behaviour of the Post Office Board in allowingtheir application for increased charges to become known. Moreover,if additional revenue were raised by increasing the telecommunicationscharges from 1st July, an increase in postal charges would be lessurgent.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the financial objective for telecommunicationsshould be increased to 10 per cent from 1st July, 1970, and that thenecessary increases in charges should take effect from that date.The Minister of Posts and Telecommunications should discuss further with the other Ministers concerned and subsequently with the PostOffice Board the extent to which the proposed charges might be revised to include rather larger increases in connection charges and rather lower increases for telephone rentals. He should also discuss with the Lord President and the Minister without Portfolio the precisetiming of the announcement of the changes, which should be made before the forthcoming Budget.The Post Office Board should be informed that the Governmentwere not prepared to approve the proposed increases in postal charges and that the adjustment of rates to be made on decimalisation
would be considered at a later date. It should also be made clear tothe Board that the Government were seriously concerned about themanner in which they had allowed their application for higher postal charges to become known.The Cabinet-(1) Approved an increase in the financial objective for PostOffice telecommunications from 8^ per cent to 10 percent from 1st July, 1970.(2) Agreed not to approve the increases in postal charges from january 1971, currently proposed by the Post Office butto consider the charges to be applied on decimalisationat a later date.(3) Invited the Minister of Posts and Telecommunications (i) to arrange, in consultation with the other ministers concerned, for further consideration to be givento the details of the proposed changes in the telecommunications tariff on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister and thereafter to discuss themwith the Post Office Board;(ii) to arrange, in consultation with the Lord president and the Minister without Portfolio, for the revisedtelecommunications charges and the increase in thefinancial objective to be announced before theforthcoming Budget;(iii) to inform the Post Office Board that the proposed increases in postal charges had not been approved and that the Government viewed with concern the publicity given to the Post Office&apos;s application forsuch increases.Cabinet Office, S.W.1.26th February, 1970.
