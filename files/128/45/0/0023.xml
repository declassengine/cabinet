SubjectParliamentDissolution of Parliament
secret parliament The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had decidedDissolution of to ask The Queen on the following day to proclaim the DissolutionParliament of Parliament. If Her Majesty acceded to this request, the dissolution would take effect on Friday, 29 May; a General Electionwould be held on Thursday, 18 June; the new Parliament would be summoned at the end of June (when the first business would be theelection of the Speaker and the swearing-in of Members) and wouldbe opened at the beginning of July. A public statement to this effect would be made at 5.45 p.m. on the following day.In reaching his decision to seek a Dissolution he had endeavoured to take account of all the relevant factors, both politicaland economic, and of the views of his colleagues who bore the mainresponsibility for the Governments policies in the months ahead.One of the most important considerations was the uncertainty ofthe international prospect in relation to such issues as european security, Northern Ireland, etc., and the need for the Governmentto be able to speak for the United Kingdom with authority in theforthcoming negotiations for entry into the European Communities.Moreover, public opinion was now expecting a General Election inthe near future; and, if the Government deferred seeking a renewal of their mandate, they would find it progressively more difficultto control events and would increasingly lose the power of initiative.It was mainly for these reasons that he had concluded that thiswould be an appropriate moment for the Government to seek once again the endorsement of the electorate.Instructions would shortly be issued about the use of officialtransport and the granting of Press interviews by Ministers duringthe Election. Ministers would also be advised of certainarrangements to be made in connection with the conduct of public business during the campaign. An Election Business Committeewould be established in the usual way; and the Minister without portfolio would provide the necessary channel of communication between the Committee and Labour Party Headquarters. ministers would remain fully responsible for the work of their Departmentsduring this period; and it was important that they should be seen to be so. But, while they should continue to discharge their normal duties, they should observe reasonable discretion in relationto the initiation of any action of a continuing or longer-term nature,e.g. discussions with both sides of industry on future policies andsuch consultations as would normally take place in the national economic Development Council. The same principle should applyas regards any further published statements of Government policy,whether in the form of White Papers or otherwise.   It would be
desirable, however, to publish the proposed White Paper on environmental Pollution before the Dissolution. Its text would therefore be decided as far as possible by an ad hoc committee under his chairmanship: and the Cabinet would be asked for theirformal approval at their meeting in the week beginning 26 May.In discharging public engagements during the period of theElection Ministers should seek to avoid creating any impression that they were using these occasions for Party political purposes:and they should also consider, before undertaking to fulfil any international commitments, whether the nature of the subject matterinvolved would enable them to speak with the authority proper to arepresentative of Her Majesty&apos;s Government. It would, of course,be right that the United Kingdom should continue to be represented at important international conferences, e.g. the forthcoming meetingof the Ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.But Ministers contemplating individual visits abroad shouldreconsider whether to proceed with them.As regards the completion of essential Parliamentary businessthe House of Lords would remain in Session during the remainingtwo weeks to Dissolution and the House of Commons would be recalled on Tuesday, 26 May. An ad hoc Committee, consistingof the Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal, a Treasury Minister andthe Chief Whips of both Houses of Parliament, would be established to supervise the negotiation of business during this period and to draft The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament. Therewould be no Parliamentary Questions in the House of commons in the week beginning 26 May; but it would be possible for ministerial statements to be made in that week, if necessary.The Cabinet were then informed of the basis on which it was hoped to complete essential Parliamentary business in the remainder of the Session.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement on the Dissolution of Parliament and of the arrangements to be made in connection therewith.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forconsideration to be given to the White Paper on environmental Pollution with a view to its publicationbefore the Dissolution.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18 May, 1970.
