CONFIDENTIALCopy No \ of 7 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(83) 21st ConclusionsThursday 30 June 1983-PARLIAMENTARY   THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB), in theirPAY AND Report No 20 on Parliamentary Pay and Allowances, had proposed that theALLOWANCES salary of Members of Parliament should be increased by 31 per cent, from 14,510 to  19,000.    The Report contained proposals on pensions, includingPrevious an increase in the accrual rate from  /60th  to   /50th  and an increase inReference: the contribution rate from 6 per cent to 8 per cent.    It also proposedCC(83) 17th       increases in allowances for Members of Parliament and Peers, and largeConclusions,     increases in the salaries of Ministers.    She had already made clear theMinute 2 Government&apos;s general attitude to the recommendations for Ministers; it wasnow necessary to consider those relating to Members of Parliament. Theproposals on allowances and pensions were very generous and, together withprevious pay increases, could justify a much smaller salary increase thanthe TSRB recommended.    The 31 per cent proposed by the TSRB was quiteunacceptable and would have a disastrous effect on other pay settlements.There were two options: to reject the Report altogether and suggest afigure similar to recent public sector settlements; or to propose as acompromise an increase of, say, 15 per cent, in which case the pensionscontribution rate might be set at 9 per cent.In discussion the following main points were made -a. A proposal by the Government that the salaries of Members ofParliament should be increased by 15 per cent would contrastunfavourably with the 3.7 per cent increase in the old age pensionand with other pay settlements in the public sector, which had beenin the region of 5 per cent and were expected to be even lower in theforthcoming pay round.    From that point of view it might be better forthe Government to propose a low increase, accept the risk of a defeatin the House of Commons, and be prepared to distance itself from theHouse&apos;s decision.    It was by no means certain that such a proposalwould in fact be defeated.b. If a low offer were made, emphasis could be placed on the otherproposals in the TSRB Report, especially those on pensions, which werevery favourable.    It was also relevant that in the previousParliament Members&apos; pay had risen from  6,900 to  14,510.c. If the Government proposed a low figure and was defeated, theauthority of the Leader of the House and the Chief Whip could bedamaged.    Some of the Government&apos;s supporters had no additionalsources of income, and Members of Parliament, unlike other publicservants, had no security of tenure.    There was substantial supportfor the TSRB recommendations.    From that point of view it might bepreferable for the Government to propose the lowest figure that waslikely to be accepted by Parliament.CONFIDENTIAL
I    . CONFIDENTIAL Id. Whatever proposal the Government made, it was not clear how farit could distance itself from the final decision of the House ofCommons.    The size of the Government&apos;s majority could lead the publicto associate the Government with whatever decision the House made.e. The Government&apos;s attitude to the TSRB&apos;s recommendations onMinisterial salaries would be discussed in the following week. Therewould be difficulties, particularly for Parliamentary Secretaries, ifthe House approved a high increase for Members and if Ministerialsalaries were not increased.   A Member lost substantial tax allowanceson becoming a Minister.f. It was recognised that the question of Ministerial salaries inthe House of Lords raised separate issues.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it would benecessary for the Chief Whip to take further soundings of opinion among theGovernment&apos;s supporters before a decision could be taken.   An attemptshould be made to influence them towards acceptance of a figure around4 per cent, by pointing out the level of awards to pensioners and to othersin the public sector, and of a pension contribution of 9 per cent (theequivalent of the 8 per cent effectively in force in the Civil Service).The value of the recommendations on pensions and allowances should also bestressed.    It was clear that a high increase in the salaries of Members ofParliament could have an adverse effect on the Government&apos;s economicstrategy.The Cabinet -1. Invited the Chief Whip to take further soundingsof opinion among the Government&apos;s supporters, as indicatedby the Prime Minister in her summing up of the discussion.2. Agreed to resume their consideration of Reports No 19and 20 by the Top Salaries Review Body at their meeting on7 July 1983.2
