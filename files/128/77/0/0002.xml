SECRET AND PERSONALft (Until 16 March 1983, then made CONFIDENTIAL)Copy No  |   of 5 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(83) 7th Conclusions, Minute 5Thursday 3 March 1983OTHER THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet&apos;had previously endorsed     . &apos;BUSINESS the principle of recovering the excess provision for inflation in the--- November 1982 uprating of social security benefits, up to a maximumPublic of 2{ per cent.    The need to recover an excess had once againExpenditure:     demonstrated the unsatisfactoriness of the method of uprating based onUprating of       forecasts of inflation.    That method had been introduced by the previousPensions and     Labour Administration in order to produce a once-for-all saving inBenefits public expenditure at a time of temporarily declining inflation.    In theevent, outturn had rarely coincided with forecasts.    When the outturnPrevious exceeded the forecast, the Government was expected to make good theReference: shortfall; when outturn fell short of forecast, it was politicallyCC(82) 6th        difficult for the Government to recover excess provision.    She and theConclusions,     Ministers most closely concerned had therefore agreed, subject to theMinute 2 approval of the Cabinet, that future upratings should be based on theactual increase in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) in the twelve-monthperiod ending in the May before each November uprating.    This increasewas announced in June.    It was the latest figure which it was feasibleto use both because of administrative constraints and because of theneed to allow time for Parliamentary debate on the statutory instrumentsgiving effect to the uprating.    The necessary legislation would beannounced in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s Budget Statement andintroduced immediately thereafter.    The present year was a favourabletime for making the change from forecasts to actual figures as the basisof upratings.    Although it was likely that the increase in the RPIbetween May 1982 and May 1983 would be less than the forecast increasebetween November 1982 and November 1983, it was no longer proposed thatany part of the excess provision for inflation in the November 1982uprating should be recovered.    The use of actual figures, unadjustedfor the past excess provision, was likely to be more favourable tobeneficiaries than the use of a forecast with full or near-full adjust-ment.    It was proposed that increases in public service pensions, whichwere linked by statute to increases in State retirement pensions, shouldbe dealt with in the same way.    This made it unnecessary to pursue thepossibility, raised in the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, of breakingthe statutory link between increases in public service pensions andincreases in State pensions: the problem of excess provision forinflation, and consequent unintended increases in the real value ofpensions, which had been the cause of the Cabinet&apos;s previous concern,could no longer arise if pensions increase were based on actual increasesin the RPI rather than forecasts.Although the proposals were entirely logical, they would need carefulpresentation both in the Budget Statement and subsequently. TheGovernment would be criticised for changing from forecasts to actualfigures as the basis of upratings at a time when this change, in isolation,seemed likely to be less favourable to beneficiaries; but such criticismcould be rebutted if, as was proposed, no adjustment was made in November1983 for the excess provision for inflation in November 1982.    It wasSECRET AND PERSONAL
SECRET AND PERSONALhelpful that several organisations representing pensioners, includingthe influential National Federation of Old Age Pensioners Associations,had pressed for the change.In discussion, there was general agreement with the proposals outlinedby the Prime Minister.    The following main points were also made -a. Using actual increases in the RPI rather than forecastsas the basis of uprating social security benefits would reducethe attention given to the forecasts of inflation which had tobe published at the time of the Budget by virtue of theprovisions of the Industry Act 1975.    It was particularlyundesirable in the context of pay bargaining to draw excessiveattention to such forecasts.b. Although there were persuasive administrative and otherreasons for using the May RPI figures as the basis of upratings,it would be desirable for the proposed legislation not toprevent the use of later figures if that should at some stageprove feasible.c. The proposals were fully consistent with the Government&apos;spledge to maintain the real value of State retirement pensionsduring the lifetime of the present Parliament;.it was, however,likely that the Government would be pressed during the Budgetdebate to make clear its policy towards maintaining the realvalue of pensions and other benefits after expiry of thepresent pledges.The Cabinet -1. Approved the proposals described by the Prime Ministerrelating to the future uprating of social security benefitsand public service pensions, and in particular agreed:i. that the excess provision for inflation in theNovember 1982 uprating of State retirement pensionsand other social security benefits should not berecovered;ii. that legislation should be introduced toprovide that the November 1983 uprating andsubsequent upratings should be based on the actualincrease in the Retail Prices Index in the twelve-month period ending in the previous May;iii. that public service pensions should be treatedin the same way as State retirement pensions.2. Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services toconsider whether the legislation to give effect to theproposals should permit the use of increases in the RetailPrices Index over a twelve-month period ending in a monthlater than May as the basis of future upratings of socialsecurity benefits and public service pensions, if thatshould in due course prove to be administratively andpolitically feasible.2SECRET AND PERSONAL _I
