Copy No I  of 4 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(83) 33rd ConclusionsThursday 10 November 1983ECONOMIC THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he would be making hisSITUATION Autumn Statement on Thursday 17 November.    This would include the outlineAND public expenditure programmes for 1984-85, reflecting the decisionsPROSPECTS taken by the Cabinet in their earlier discussion.    It would also dealwith National Insurance contributions (NICs) and the economic forecastsrequired by the provisions of the Industry Act.    He had agreed withthe Secretary of State for Social Services that there would be nochange in the rate of either employers&apos; or employees&apos; NICs in1984-85.    The lower earnings limit, below which NICs were not charged,would be increased in line with the State Retirement Pension to 34 a week; the upper earnings limit, income above which was not subjectto NICs, would be increased in line with earnings to  250 a week. TheExchequer supplement would be reduced from 13 per cent to 11 per cent.As a result of these changes, the surplus in the National InsuranceFund would be reduced; but it would still be well above the level whichthe Government Actuary had advised was necessary.    The budgetaryprospect which would be revealed in the Industry Act forecasts was notcomfortable.    The public sector borrowing requirement in 1983-84 wasabove the forecast made at the time of the Budget.    This would increasethe burden on debt interest in 1984-85.    It also seemed that therewould be little shortfall in that year in cash-limited expenditureprogrammes.    Forecasts of revenue from North Sea oil were higher thanbefore; and there was little change in the forecast yield of otherInland Revenue taxes; but because of lower inflation the forecast yieldof Customs and Excise duties was lower.    The net effect was that asmall negative fiscal adjustment (that is, an increase in the realburden of taxation) would probably be required instead of the smallpositive adjustment forecast at the 1983 Budget.    Such forecasts were,however, necessarily uncertain, since they depended on the differencebetween very large flows of revenue and expenditure.    At the presentstage the fiscal adjustment was an assessment of the prospect based onexisting policies and assumptions and on the best available figures;it was not a budget judgment.Inflation was forecast to be under 5 per cent by the end of 1984.The economy was expected to grow by up to 3 per cent in both 1983-84and 1984-85.   Much of this growth in 1983-84 was due to higherconsumption.    But in 1984-85 a higher proportion would come from growthin investment and exports, as our main export markets, such asWest Germany, recovered:    growth in exports was also being forecast bythe Confederation of British Industry.    The balance of payments wasexpected to be neutral.The Cabinet -Took note.SECRET
