Recovery had been delayed in 1982, partly because of thedifficulties experienced by the United States and West German economiesand partly because of retrenchment by major debtor countries such asNigeria and Mexico.    Inflation and interest rates were, however, declining;and real demand was likely to expand in 1983.    There were two main uncer-tainties.    First, the scale and speed of recovery would depend ondevelopments in the United States economy: it would be necessary for theAdministration to tackle convincingly the problem of the mounting federalbudget deficit in order to improve confidence and allow scope for reductionsin interest rates.    Secondly, the future movement of oil prices wasuncertain.    A moderate decline in the price of oil would be broadly helpfulto world economic activity and inflation, and had little effect on theUnited Kingdom&apos;s balance of payments and public revenue.    A sharp declinecould however have adverse effects.The 1982 Budget had envisaged a Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR)in 1982-83 of about  9.5 billion; the outturn was likely toibe less. For1983-84, the Medium Term Financial Strategy suggested a PSBR of about 8 billion.    A higher figure would have little effect on activity andemployment in the short term, but could seriously impair confidence,especially in the present state of uncertainty in the markets. Hispreliminary view was that it would be a mistake to publish a forecast PSBRfor 1983-84 of higher than  8 billion.    A figure of  8 billion would allowsome scope for tax reductions besides the revalorisation of allowances andbands assumed in the economic forecasts.    On indirect taxes, he would bereluctant to forgo a substantial measure of revalorisation. Fullrevalorisation would yield some  600 million a year but add only about0.5 per cent to the Retail Price Index.    There might, however, be a casefor limiting the increase in petrol tax in order to protect rural areas.To the extent that direct taxes were reduced, it would be necessary todecide between the claims of industry and the personal sector. TheConfederation of British Industry (CBI) were pressing strongly for reliefthrough the abolition of the National Insurance Surcharge (NIS).    It wasundoubtedly desirable to encourage improvements in competitiveness and therebuilding of companies&apos; profit margins.    Companies were, however, alreadybenefiting from the previous reductions in NIS, and from falls in interestrates and the exchange rate.    There was a stronger case for increasingincome tax thresholds beyond the amount needed for revalorisation. Thiswould be welcome to many of the Government&apos;s supporters, and would beappropriate in view of the Government&apos;s inability to reduce the burden ofSECRET
?SECRETHdirect taxation to the extent that it had hoped to be able to do when ittook office.    A significant increase in the thresholds could well bringbenefits in wage bargaining, and would help alleviate the poverty andunemployment traps.Finally, he hoped that the Budget could include, as in 1982, packages ofsmaller measures targeted to help particular areas of the industry ordeserving groups.   He would be in touch separately with the Ministersconcerned.The following main points were made in discussion -a. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was to be congratulated on thesteadiness with which he had maintained the course of the Government&apos;sfinancial and economic strategy.    This was the main reason why theGovernment now had useful freedom of fiscal manoeuvre.    It would bepolitically and economically disastrous if the Government appeared tobe departing now from the course which had been set.b. It could be argued that, without departing from the Government&apos;sunderlying policies, it would be possible to allow the PSBR in 1983-84to be rather higher than the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested.A PSBR of  8 billion would be low in comparison with the average ofindustrialised countries; and the previous forecasts which hadincluded it had assumed a rather higher level of economic activity thannow seemed likely.    It was improbable that the markets would reactadversely if the PSBR were kept below  9 billion.    On the other hand,there were great uncertainties, as C(83) 5 brought out, in theeconomic forecasts and in the current economic situation.    These andother considerations argued for erring on the side of caution in theBudget.    It would be better to be cautious in the spring and relax ifappropriate later, than to relax too far in the spring and be obligedto retrench later.   A further consideration was that real interestrates were at an exceptionally high level.    Reductions in them wouldencourage industrial investment and new housebuilding, which were thekeys to sound economic growth.    The level of mortgage interest rateswas also of central importance to many families.    All these argumentstold in favour of a cautious policy in respect of the PSBR.c. A few members of the Cabinet took the view that any reduction intaxation should mainly benefit industry.    The United Kingdom&apos;s indus-trial base was still weak.    Strengthening it, and improvingcompetitiveness, was the only satisfactory long-term solution to theproblem of unemployment, which was bound to assume increasing politicaland social importance.    One possibility would be to make a furtherreduction in the rate of NIS, as an earnest of the Government&apos;sintention ultimately to abolish it.    But there were grounds forbelieving that the CBI&apos;s arguments in favour of this course reflectedtheir difficulties in reaching agreement among their members ratherthan the true needs and wishes of individual companies.    Moreover thefall in the exchange rate was now helping to make industry morecompetitive.    It might be better to devise schemes of increasingcapital investment, particularly in the West Midlands and other partsof the country which had been particularly hard hit by unemployment.I__SECRET_I
H SECRETAn alternative way of helping businesses, which could have somepresentational advantage at relatively small cost, would be to reducecorporation tax.d. Most members of the Cabinet, however, took the view that priorityshould be given to reductions in personal taxation, and to increasingincome tax thresholds, rather than to reducing tax rates. Manyworkers on relatively low earnings paid surprisingly large amounts ofincome tax.   Unless early action was taken to put this right theproblem could become intractable for a long time.    Raising taxthresholds would help to alleviate the problems of the poverty trap andthe lack of incentive to take a job rather than rely on social securitybenefits.    If possible, it would similarly be desirable to make asubstantial increaase in the rate of child benefit.e. On this occasion it would be desirable to make a striking improve-ment in one major area of the tax system rather than dissipate theeffect by spreading the reductions over several areas.    It would alsobe important, however, to supplement the major measures with animaginative package of minor measures such as had featured in the 1982Budget.    These need not cost much, but could have a stimulating effectout of all proportion to their cost.    Attractive possibilities weredevelopments of the Enterprise Allowance Scheme and the SmallEngineering Firms Investment Scheme.    The latter could be particularlyhelpful to firms in areas such as the West Midlands, which hadsuffered an extremely sharp decline in comparison to their previoushistory.    It might also be desirable to devote resources toalleviating unemployment, which was certain to continue to increasefor some time to come, through such measures as the Temporary Short-Time Working Compensation Scheme, the Job Release Scheme, and improvedyouth training.    There should also be a more imaginative and helpfulattitude to fiscal measures, such as stock-option schemes, designedto encourage entrepreneurship.f. It was open to doubt whether it would be possible to mount ascheme to increase public investment, as had been suggested indiscussion, which would be economically justified and have sufficientlyearly effects to be useful.    It was however regrettable that theundershoot in the PSBR for 1982-83 was partly the result of anunintended shortfall in capital expenditure in the public sector.Every effort should be made to prevent this from happening again in1983-84.g. The reduction in the oil price might have serious effects on theprofitability of marginal fields on the United Kingdom ContinentalShelf.    It might be necessary to adjust the relevant financial regimein order to ensure that marginal fields continued to be exploited anddeveloped.h. There was some concern about the price of petrol, particularly inrural areas, and this should be borne in mind in considering therevalorisation of the relevant duties.    Limiting the increase in theduty on DERV could in particular have beneficial consequences forindustrial and agricultural costs.    On the other hand rural areas hadbenefited from the greater prosperity of agriculture, as compared withindustry.3I_SECRET_H
i.     Much attention had been given in the media to complaints about therating of empty industrial and commercial premises.    There were, forexample, reports of roofs being removed from new buildings in order toavoid the payment of local rates.    There might be scope for fiscalreliefs in this area.   However, the factual basis for the reports wasdoubtful.    The matter was under examination by the Secretary of State forthe Environment and the other Ministers concerned.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there was generalagreement on the assessment of the situation, on the outlook for the futureand on the course to be followed.The Cabinet -Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account ofthe discussion in preparing his forthcoming Budget.Cabinet Office7 February 19834SECRET
