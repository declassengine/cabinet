Copy No   I   of 3 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECOPJ)TOCC(83) 8th Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 10 March 1983FOREIGN THE PRIME MINISTER said that during her visit to Peking in SeptemberAFFAIRS 1982 Chairman Deng Xiaoping and the then Prime Minister of the Chinese--- People&apos;s Republic had agreed a communique, issued jointly with her,Hong Kong which committed the two sides to hold talks through diplomatic channelsabout ways of maintaining the future stability and prosperity ofHong Kong.    Despite repeated approaches from the British side, thesetalks had not yet taken place.    Instead, the Chinese were seeking tomake cession of sovereignty over Hong Kong by the British Government aprecondition for starting the talks; and there was evidence to suggestthat the Chinese Government was intending to use the occasion of ameeting of the Chinese People&apos;s Congress in June 1983 to announce thatits intentions for Hong Kong were to assume full sovereignty over thewhole colony, which would thereafter be administered as a specialautonomous region of China.    This would be disastrous for confidence inHong Kong.    Unless satisfactory arrangements could be negotiated withChina for maintaining British administration along with the present legaland economic system in Hong Kong, the economy of the colony wouldcollapse.    Sovereignty over 92 per cent of its territory would in anycase revert to China in 1997 with the expiry of the lease of the NewTerritories - without which Hong Kong would cease to be viable.    It wastherefore vital to get talks with China started soon. Accordingly,after consultation with the Governor of Hong Kong, Sir Edward Youde,and HM Ambassador at Peking, Sir Percy Cradock, she proposed, subject tothe agreement of the Cabinet, to write to Chairman Deng Xiaoping. Herletter, the proposed text of which the Prime Minister read to the Cabinet,would be delivered by HM Ambassador on his return to Peking within thenext few days.    It would express disappointment that talks had notstarted on the basis of the joint communique of last September, andwould propose that they should start at once.    The letter would go onto say, that provided that formal agreement could be reached onarrangements for maintaining the stability and prosperity of the colonywhich were satisfactory to the people of Hong Kong and to the BritishGovernment as well as to the Government of China, she would be prepared,subject to the agreement of the Cabinet, to recommend to Parliament thatsovereignty over the whole of Hong Kong should be transferred to China.This would involve going one step further than the formula she had usedwith the Chinese Government in September 1982, when she had said that,in the circumstances described,  she would be prepared to &quot;consider&quot;making such a recommendation to Parliament.The Cabinet -Agreed that the Prime Minister should write to ChairmanDeng Xiaoping in the terms proposed.H_top secset m
