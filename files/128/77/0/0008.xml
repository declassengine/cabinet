SECRETCopy No   I   of 3 CopiesMOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORDTOCC(83) 28th ConclusionsThursday 22 September 1983FOREIGN THE PRIME MINISTER said that the next round of talks with the ChineseAFFAIRS Government about the future of Hong Kong, which were beginning that--- week, would be crucial and difficult.    The United Kingdom was fortunateHong Kong to have a skilful and experienced negotiator in Sir Percy Cradock. TheChinese were insisting not only on Chinese sovereignty but also onPrevious   I        Chinese administration of the whole Colony from 1997 and had so farReference: refused to take any account of the British contention that the linkCC(83) 19th       with the United Kingdom was essential to confidence and hence toConclusions,     Hong Kong&apos;s continued prosperity.    Despite the confidential characterMinute 2 of the talks, the Chinese were making their own position and intentionspublic, and this had precipitated serious falls in the value of theHong Kong dollar and on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange.    There was likelyto be growing Parliamentary concern about how far the Government wastaking account of the wishes of the population of Hong Kong, fourmillion of whom were refugees from China for whom Britain had aparticular moral responsibility.    The Government was in fact in closetouch with the Executive Council, the Legislative Council and with theelected   District Councils in Hong Kong, as well as with otherrepresentative organisations in the Colony.    A referendum would be ableto be exploited by the Chinese in a way which would make a freeexpression of opinion impossible.    The overwhelming majority of thepopulation wanted the status quo maintained, but unfortunately seniormembers of the Hong Kong Chinese community were frightened to make thisclear to the Chinese Government when they visited Peking.    The Chineseauthorities preferred to believe that Hong Kong would continue as beforefollowing a complete Chinese takeover.    It was unclear how far, if atall, they understood the importance of the confidence factor (and henceof a continued administrative link with Britain) for Hong Kong&apos;s futureprosperity: but Chinese national pride, combined with Communist non-comprehension of how a capitalist system worked, made it difficult forthem to accept that Britain should have any rights in Hong Kong after1997, whatever the economic consequences.    Unfortunately British publicopinion tended to over estimate British power and the extent of Britishleverage with the Chinese.    The task of the British negotiators in thecoming round would be to keep the Chinese in play on the question ofconfidence and continue to put across the British case without promptingthem to break off the talks.The Cabinet -Took note.SECRET
