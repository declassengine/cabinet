The Cabinet \yere iniprrned of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was necessary that the House should pass that week a motionwelcoming -the- decision -pf/the. .&apos;IJpt^TKmgdpm: Government to join with other Commonweal tji countries in extending financial asssistancetoBurma. The Leader, of the Opposition had insisted that full oppor-tunity should be given tp debate, this motion: it was likely that hewould himself speak in the debate, and would divide the House on the motion.; The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances the PrimeMinister, as well as the Minister of State, should speak in support ofthe motion; and they invited the Chief Whip to arrange for the debateto be held on a day when it would be convenient for the PrimeMinister to speak. ;The Cabinefs attention was drawn to difficulties which had arisen over the CoaUMihing(Subsidence) Bill.Mr. W. H. Main-waring, M.P., had spoken against the Bill on second reading on theground that it made no provision for subsidence damage which occurred before 1st January, 1947, and would be of no assistance tothe Rhondda Valley, where a great deal of subsidence had occurred during the war years; and he had indicated that he intended to main-tain his opposition to the Bill. In the current Parliamentary situation it would be impossible to carry this Bill if any division of opinionabout it developed among Government supporters. Moreover, thesupport of Labour members representing other mining areas wouldbe alienated if any concession were now made in response to these representations by Mr. Mainwaring. It was the general view ofMinisters that Mr. Mainwaring would not succeed in persuadingother Government supporters to join him in opposition to the Bill;and the Cabinet agreed that no attempt should be made to apply theprovisions of the Bill to damage Occurring before 1st January, 1947.i- The Cabinet were informed that on 9th May a Prayer was tobe moved in the House of Lords for the annulment of the CoalIndustry Nationalisation (Superannuation) Regulations, 1950. Itwould be alleged in the debate that these Regulations failed to giveeffect to certain pledges given by the Lord Chancellor in the pro-ceedings on the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act, 1946, regardingthe circumstances in which compensation would be paid for loss ofprospects. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that it was unlikelythat this Prayer would be pressed to a division. Steps had now beentaken to remove the grievances felt in the two particular cases whichhad occasioned most of the criticism of these Regulations. And theannulment of the Regulations would have the effect of denying com-pensatipn to all who would otherwise have received it. In further discussion the suggestion was made that workers in some of the socialised industries were aggrieved by the large sums which had been paid in compensation to persons who had held salaried positions inthose industries.ion Act.ina-Schools.&apos;USace:50) 27thsions,3.)2. The Minister of Education said that he had now ascertained that the Opposition did not favour the introduction of amending legislation to enable a denominational school to be given provisionalaided status when it could not finally be decided whether the churchauthorities would be able to meet their share of the cost of necessaryimprovements to the school.&apos; In these circumstances he did not pro-pose to refer to the possibility of amending legislation, in the answerwhich he was to give to a;Parliamentary Question that afternoon;and, in the debate which was to follow, he would confine himself tothe administrative measures by which he was seeking to overcome thedifficulties experienced by the church authorities in satisfying therequirements of section 15 of the Education Act, 1944.The Attorney-General said that he had not had time to go fully into the legality of these administrative measures, which the minister had described to the Cabinet at their meeting on 1st May. He was,38724-2 b 2
however, doubtful whether the Minister would be well-advised tostate publicly that hew^si proposing to exercise his: discretion undersection 15 of the Act by Reference to hard-and-fast rules prescribingthe percentage Of the capitial sums required which the school managersmust have in hand at the date of their application. Section 15 (2) ofthe Act required the Minister to satisfy himself that the managerswould be able and Willing, when the time came, to meet the expendi-ture which would fall to be borne by them under section 15 (3) (a);ahid it was doubtful&apos;whether he Was; entitled to rule that managersWould not be able to discharge that obligation in the future merely because they could not command at the time of their applicationmore than a specified proportion of the estimated sum which was likely then to be required.The Lord Chancellor agreed that, if the Minister found it neces-sary to make any,public reference to, the percentage figures which hehad. mentioned in the; Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, he should presentthese as general criteria which influenced him in exercising his dis-cretion under the section, and not as absolute conditions which schoolmanagers had to satisfy before the Minister was willing to give a direction under the section;;^ ^; , (       &apos; ^The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the proposal for amending legislation outlined inparagraph 8 of CP. (50) 87 should not be pursued; andthat the Minister of Education should continue to administer section 15 of the Education Act, 1944, on thelines Which he had indicated to the Cabinet in their earlier discussion on 1st May.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to take into account theadvice offered by the Attorney-General and the LordChancellor in any public explanation of the basis onwhich he proposed to administer this section of the Act.South-west 3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of africa. State for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for Commonwealth(Previous Relations and the Minister of State (CP. (50) 88) on the forthcomingReference: proceedings before the International^ Court of Justice on certain legalCM.(46)88th aspects of the question whether South-West Africa should be placedConclusions.)   under trusteeship.Proceedings the Secretary of State for the Colonies said that these proceed-before the ings were due to commence on 16th May, and the Registrar of theInternational Court had asked to be notified by 6th May whether the United King-Court, dom Government intended to participate in them. The arguments for and against participation were nicely balanced. The Court wouldbe asked to pronounce upon the international status of South-WestAfrica and the international obligations of the Union government towards it. If it were to decide that South-West Africa had thestatus of a &quot; non-self-governing territory,&quot; it was most important,from the point of view of our general interests as a Colonial Power,that we should have an opportunity of putting before the Court our views regarding the obligations of Colonial Powers under Article 73of the United Nations Charter. In particular, it would be greatly toour advantage that the Court should endorse our view that colonial powers were not obliged by that Article to transmit to the united nations information on political and constitutional developments independent territories. The Court would also be called upon todetermine the second question whether the Union Governmentwere Competent to modify the international status of South-WestAfrica. If it should decide that this power did not rest solely withthe Union Government, it would be of great importance to us thatthis opinion should related to the status of the territory as a formermandated territory; for it would be highly inconvenient to the
United Kingdom Government if the Court should give an opinionimplying that the international status of a non-self-governing territorycould not be modified by the metropolitan country without the con-currence of the United Nations Assembly. If the Court were likelyto make pronouncements on either of these questions which wouldembarrass us in our future dealings with the United Nations in respectj of our own dependent territories, it was desirable that our views. should be placed before the Court.  On the other hand, there was&apos; undoubtedly a risk that any intervention on our part would be con-strued as support for the policy of the South African Governmenti in respect of South-West Africa, or even for the native policy of thepresent Government of the Union.The Secretary of State said that, on balance, he was inclined tothe view that the United Kingdom Government should be preparedto intervene in the proceedings in order to safeguard their own interests. He therefore recommended that the Government shouldbe represented in the proceedings, but that their representative should ask leave to reserve his right to speak later in the proceedings if anygeneral points were raised which affected this country&apos;s interests. He -also recommended that the Government should take an appropriateopportunity to make it clear that their appearance before the Courtdid not imply support for the native policy of the South african government.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that theUnion Government would take it amiss if, having supported theUnited Nations resolution referring these issues to the Court, we nowfailed to intervene in the proceedings before the Court. He agreed,however, that the question now before the Cabinet should bedetermined by reference solely to United Kingdom interests, and with-out regard to the feelings of the Union Government. On these grounds he supported the recommendations made by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies. He had just received a summary of the sub-missions which the United States Government were proposing to put before the Court; and it was clear from these that the general issuesmentioned in paragraph 3 of CP. (50) 88 would in fact be raised inthe arguments before the Court. This confirmed his view that theUnited Kingdom Government should be represented in the pro-ceedings in order to protect their interests. He was, however, doubtfulwhether the Court would agree that our representative should holda watching brief: he would be expected to express his views early inthe proceedings.The Minister of State said that the arguments were very evenly balanced, but he supported the proposals in CP. (50) 88 on the under-standing tfiat our representative would speak with great discretionand that we should do our best to make it clear that our appearancein the proceedings did not imply support of the policy of the UnionGovernment.In discussion there was general agreement that, if the UnitedKingdom Government were represented in these proceedings, itwould be difficult for their representative to refrain from speakinguntil it appeared that the Court was likely to give an opinion adverselyaffecting the general interests of the United Kingdom as a ColonialPower. As representing one of the main Colonial Powers, he wouldbe expected to assist the Court in general argument and would be pressed to speak at an early stage. Such intervention was bound tobe represented, in political circles, as implying support of the SouthAfrican case. Thus, we should certainly incur political odium by-intervening in these proceedings. What hope was there that weshould be able to persuade the Court to give a ruling favourable toour own interpretation of Article 73 of the United Nations Charter?The Court was most unlikely to be sympathetic towards the SouthAfrican claim; and the particular issue of South-West Africa was,surely, a most unfavourable one on which to argue the general-2 b 3
questions set out in paragraph 3 of CP. (50) 88. By our interventionwe should be inviting the Court to pronounce, upon those general questions, in a context most unfavourable to our case. And, havingentered an appearance arid deployed our arguments, we should find itthe more difficult to dissociate ourselves from art unfavourabledecisiori. We were riot ourselves directly concerned in the particularissue which had been referred to the Court, and were under no obliga-tion to be represented in the proceedings. Would it not be better,therefore, to refrain from sending a representative, so that we mightbe the more free thereafter to argue that the Courfs opinion wasrelated to the special circumstances of this particular case, viz. a former mandated territory, and was not of general application to therelations between a metropolitan Power and its non-self-governingterritories^ We had already been forced to take the line that wecould not accept, in relation to our dependent territories, the interpre-tation placed by the United Nations Assembly upon Article 73 ofthe Charter; and it would not be very much more difficult for us totake the line, if need be, that we were equally unable to accept, inrelation to our dependent territories, the implications of an advisoryopinion given by the International Court in respect of South-WestAfrica. There was undoubtedly a grave risk that the Court might give ail opinion in terms which might be embarrassing to us in our future dealings with the United Nations ift respect of our dependent territories; but it was the general view of the Cabinet that theseembarrassments would probably be increased if the United KingdomGovernment had been represented in the proceedings before theCourt.The Cabinet Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should notbe represented in the forthcoming proceedings before theInternational Court of Justice on certain legal aspects of thequestion whether South-West Africa should be placed under trusteeship.Housing. 4.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of licences for Health (CP. (50) 90) covering the draft of a statement which he pro-Erectioh of posed to make regarding the grant of licences for the building ofNew Houses,   nouses on behalf of owner-occupiers.(Previous The Minister of Health reminded the Cabinet that, at their meet-Reference :      ing on 9th March, he had proposed a scheme under which those atCM. (50) 9th &apos; the top of the local authorities&apos; lists of applicants for houses would,Conclusions,    within limits, have been allowed to choose whether to rent a CouncilMinute 4.)      house or to receive a licence to build. On reflection he was satisfiedthat the disadvantages of that scheme outweighed its advantages. he now proposed that all local authorities should have discretion to issuelicences up to a maximum of one-fifth of their allocation, and that heshould, exceptiorially, allow a higher ratio in certain areas, e.g., sea-side towns, where the demand for owner-occupation was particularlystrorig. He also proposed that an applicant who obtained a licenceshould be allowed, with the consent of the local authority grantingit, to build his house outside the area of that authority. Local authori-ties would be ready to give such consent^ for the house vacated wouldbecome available for local housing needs.The Secretary of State for Scotland explained that, while he wasnot in disagreemerit with the Minister of Health&apos;s proposal^ he had setout his policy in answer to a Parliamentary Question on 29th March,and he did not feel that he could change that policy after so short an interval.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Health to make a statement onthe Unes of the draft attached to CP.

The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP, (50) 86) covering a report on the economic situation.The following points were made in discussion: -The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Ministers should notbe misled by the temporarily favbwable;,si^tidn-&apos;into thinking thatour balance of payments difficulties had been overcome. There wereseasonal reasons for a favourable trend during the summer months.The growth in our dollar reserves was, however, likely to be embarras-sing in the forthcoming proceedings in Congress oh the next appro-priation for the Economic Cooperation Administration. On theother hand, publicity for this development was the best method ofcountering the attack on sterling which appeared to be developingin certain quarters in the United States.. It was suggested that the high cost of supplies from non-dollarareas might be reduced if purchases were made, for stock, from dollar sources. Some such purchases of iiihbjer -and. wheat were now beingmade from Canada.The output of deep-mined coal had not increased to the extent that had been hoped, although output in the first quarter of the year. was 1 -1; per cent, greater than in the first quarter of 1949. Output inScotland and some other regions had been less than last year. Thefigures of absenteeism were disquieting, although they reflectedprimarily an increase in involuntary absenteeism which tended to occur in all industries at this time of year. For a valid comparisonwith pre-war conditions, absenteeism should be calculated on thebasis of shifts worked rather than by the week. Although the numberof workers on the colliery books and the number at the coal-facecontinued to decline, the long-term prospects were not discouragingbecause of the steady progress of mechanisation. The placing ofworkers in the more productive pits would be greatly assisted if morehouses could be made available nearer the pits. Opencast production could be increased if more dollars could be provided for buyingtractors and other equipment.The long-term prospects of merchant shipbuilding were notencouraging. Costs were very high; and this discouraged the order-ing of new ships and led to orders being placed with our overseascompetitors. The Production Committee were about to review theprospects of the shipbuilding industry: it was desirable that this review should be undertaken without delay. The prospects of areasdependent on ship-repairing also required urgent examination.Under the present capital investment policy, little new factorydevelopment was taking place in the development areas. It mightbe necessary to make special arrangements to transfer units of heavyindustry into these areas.Attention was drawn to the unsatisfactory level of productivity in the building industry. A committee under the chairmanship ofthe Minister Of Health was considering the position in the light ofrecent reports and hoped shortly to submit proposals to the Produc-tiori Committee.Deliveries of yarn and fabrics showed a considerable increase and in the cotton industry there appeared to be a new willingnessamong the workers to co-operate in schemes of redeployment and modernisation.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (50) 86 and of the points made in dis-cussion. &apos;Nationalisation       6.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofof Public       Health (CP. (50) 54), the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (50)Water Supplies. 62) and the Lord President (CP. (50) 64) on the question whether public water supplies should be brought under State ownership.
The Minister of Health said that technical investigations had shown that, to ensure the efficient collection and distribution of water supplies, the country should be divided into between fifty and sixtyareas, which would have little relation to local authority areas. he proposed,&quot;therefore; that there should be fifty to sixty water supplydistricts, with technical officers at this level, and that the wholeseirvice should come under a division of the Ministry of Health, forwhich he would be directly responsible to Parliament. If it werepreferred that the central authority should take the form of a boardlike the Forestry Commission or the Central Land Board, he would raise no serious 6bjection provided that the Ministers direct responsi-bility was unimpaired. He saw no case for setting up independentboards on the lines of those established for some industries which hadalready been nationalised. He did hot /believe that it would be practicable to organise the service on the basis of joint boards oflocal authorities, since the larger local authorities, who were prOudof their water organisations and their low water rates, would resenthaving to share responsibility with large numbers of authorities forrural areas where the extensive distribution of water supplies would raise the general level of water rates. Moreover, joint boards were an unsatisfactory form of organisation and had frequently been con-demned as wasteful and lacking in a sense of local responsibility. Hethought it would be useful to employ local authorities to collect water rates. 1; In the course of subsequent discussion, the following points weremade:  (a) The Government had put forward the proposal that water supplies should become a public responsibility because of the inadequacy of piped water supplies in rural areas. It was difficultto see how the needs of rural areas could be adequately met through a system of joint boards! Rural development would require the impetus of State ownership and direction.(b) Some doubt was expressed Whether the public would be content to see the manner in which local development took placedetermined by a technical officer of the Ministry of Health. Questionsof the relative priority to be given to different parts of an area would arise, and these were best dealt&apos;with by a locally elected body.(c) Whatever the technical merits of national ownership, it was clear that the larger local authorities would offer the most strenuousopposition to the transfer of water undertakings to the Ministry ofHealth. Local authorities resented the loss of the public utilities andother services of which they had already been deprived, particularly as some of them had made profits which had helped to reduce thelocal rates. The opposition to any further transfer of local authorities&apos;services to the State was much stronger now than it had been in1945. Moreover, it was essential to leave the local authorities with sufficient services to maintain a healthy local government. Thearguments adduced in favour of the State ownership of water supplies could be used to justify the transfer of all highway responsibilities tothe Minister of Transport. The suggestion that the local authoritiesshould be left with the task of collecting water rates would cause greatannoyance.(d) While it would be desirable to equalise water rates through-out the country, and while the equalisation of rates on a national basis would eliminate many existing differences, it seemed doubtful whethera national flat rate could be obtained in the foreseeable future. a town like Norwich would object strongly to its water rates being raised in order to finance the provision of piped water supplies in the surrounding rural areas.(e) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that in Scotland thelocal authorities had operated the Act of 1944 in a satisfactoryfashion, and the existing arrangements were quite efficient. It wouldbe difficult, therefore, to aduce technical reasons in favour of bringingpublic water supplies in Scotland under national ownership and the
local authorities would raise the strongest opposition. While, there-fore, he was anxious to secure further powers to effect amalgamationsof water areas, where this was desirable, he hoped that it would bepossible to maintain the present organisation in Scotland withoutundesirable repercussions in England and Wales.(/) The Labour Party had said in their Election manifesto thatwater supplies should become a wholly public responsibility, and theKing&apos;s Speech at the opening of the Session had referred to the im-provement of water supplies, particularly in rural areas. TheGovernment were not therefore committed to State ownership.The general view of the Cabinet was that there should be further and more detailed consideration of this matter in the light of addi-tional information which the Minister of Health undertook to supply,namely, a map indicating the fifty to sixty areas in which the country would be divided; an indication of the way in which these areas mightbe organised (i) under the Ministry of Health and (ii) by means of joint local authority boards; and a statement of the financial effects of a joint board structure.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Health to supply them with this additional information, with a view to further discussion ofthe proposals in CP.
