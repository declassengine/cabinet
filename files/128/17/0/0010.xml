1. The Minister of Health said that the Debate on the Addresshad reflected a widespread dissatisfaction with the current rate of house-building, and this would be brought to a head in the discussion in the House of Commons that afternoon of the Conservative amend-ment expressing regret that the King&apos;s Speech contained no indication that the Government intended to take more effective measures to deal with the housing situation. There was evidencethat, in addition to the private distress which it caused, the housingshortage was also damaging the national economy by increasing theimmobility of labour. The Minister said that it would be helpful if, when he spoke in the debate later that day, he could announce that the Government intended to restore their former target of200,000 houses a year, and would like to see the programme run proportionate that level for some time to come. In that event he would also propose to give local authorities a discretion to license the building of houses for sale up to a limit of one in five of their total allocation of houses. No local authority would be allowed to exceed that limitexcept with special permission granted after a full investigation into the housing needs of the area.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he presumed thatScotland would receive its proportionate share of the increase in thetotal programme which the Minister proposed. As regards the licensing of houses to be built for sale, the solution proposed by theMinister could not appropriately be applied in Scotland.In discussion it was recognised that there was widespreaddissatisfaction with the current rate of house-building; and therewas some support for the view that, in a further review of the investment programme, there should be room for some adjustment of priorities which would enable a larger proportion of building resources to be allocated to the housing programmes of the localauthorities.On the other hand it was pointed out that public dissatisfactionwould not be removed by the relatively small increase which wouldresult from reverting to the earlier target of 200,000 houses a year.Moreover, it would be difficult to find sound economic reasons forreversing in March the decision taken in the previous October, whenthe Government had made a detailed review of the investment programme and decided that housing must make its contribution towards the general reduction in the programme which the general economic situation of the country demanded. The economic reasonsfor imposing this cut on the housing programme had been fully statedin the debate in the House of Commons on the economic situation on26th-27th October; and the Government would appear to be yieldingto political pressure unless they could show equally sound economic reasons for reversing that decision.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that no immediate change should be made in thetotal size of the housing programme.(2) Invited the Investment Programmes Committee, inreviewing the investment programme for 1951 and 1952,to consider whether within the total resources availablefor investment the priorities could be so adjusted as toallow some increase in the current rate of house-building.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (50) 28) to which were attached reports from theTransport Tribunal on the application of the British transport commission for authority to increase railway freight charges anddock and canal charges. The Minister sought authority to make thenecessary regulations under section 82 of the Transport Act, giving3 b 2
(previous reference:CM. (49) 68thConclusions,Minute 5.)effect to the increases of charges proposed by the British transport commission and supported by the Transport Tribunal.The Minister of Transport said that he accepted the recom-mendation of the Transport Tribunal that railway freight charges and dock and canal charges should be increased, because there was noother source of revenue to which the Commission could turn to meet their deficit. As regards the closer integration of road and rail transport, the Commission would in a month&apos;s time have completed their acquisition of the long-distance road-haulage undertakings and would then be in control of all long-distance road transport otherthan vehicles operated under &quot; C licences. As regards road passenger services, the Transport Act provided a somewhat elaborateprocedure for the approval of schemes, and he doubted whether thefirst scheme, relating to the north-eastern area, would obtain Par-liamentary approval in present circumstances. There might,therefore, be considerable delay in the further co-ordination of road passenger transport services. In accordance with the cabinets decision of November last, he had asked the Transport commission for their plans for co-ordinating road and rail transport over thenext three years. While he recognised that the considerations towhich he had already referred made co-ordination difficult in presentcircumstances, he was not altogether satisfied with the reply whichhe had received from the Transport Commission, and he proposed todiscuss further with them the directions in which costs might bereduced. For the present, however, he saw no alternative to theimposition of the increases in railway freight charges and in dock and canal charges which the Transport Tribunal had supported.Apart from other considerations, it was desirable to maintain theauthority of the Tribunal, which would shortly be considering, underthe normal machinery provided by the Transport Act, an applicationfrom the Commission for the fixing of passenger charges in theLondon area and, thereafter, charges covering the whole field oftransport.In discussion serious doubts were expressed about the expediency of authorising these increases in charges. There was general agree-ment that the Transport Tribunal had not made a sufficientlysearching enquiry into the possibility of securing greater economy in the administration of the railways. &quot; Indeed, it appeared fromthe final paragraph on page 13 of their report that they had beencontent to accept, without making any investigation of their own,the evidence given to them on this point on behalf of the british transport Commission. Ministers were, however, reluctant to acceptthe Commission^ estimates of future savings in running costs.These assumed increased productivity at a rate of less than per cent., as compared with the average figure of 2^ per cent, whichthe Government were assuming for industry generally. Ministersbelieved that there was scope for much larger economies in theadministration of the railways; and the suggestion was made thatthe Prime Minister might call on representatives of the railway unions to put forward proposals for increased efficiency and more economical administration. Secondly, it was felt that the Tribunalhad failed to give sufficient weight to the consequences which theseincreased charges would have on other industries. The Cabinet were informed that they would result in an average increase of Is. Qd.per ton in the price of coal, and additional costs to gas and electricity undertakings of  2 million and  If million respectively, which wouldhave to be met by increased charges to the consumer. It had also been estimated that the increases would add something between  4 and  8to the average export price of a motor vehicle. The increases would therefore have the most serious repercussions throughout industry:they would increase the difficulties of the general economic situation,and would result in a further rise in the cost of living. Thirdly,these increased freight charges would aggravate still further themal-distribution of traffic as between road and rail transport.  The
economic difficulties of the railways were largely due to the diversion of traffic to the roads; and an increase in railway freight charges would tend to make this situation even worse, by driving still moretraffic away from the railways. The Tribunal had themselvesestimated that  10 million of traffic would be lost to the railways asa result of these increases.In these circumstances the Cabinet felt obliged to postponetaking a final decision on this application by the British transport commission. They recognised that in the forthcoming debate on transport in the House of Commons on 15th March there might becriticism, of their delay in reaching a decision on this application.It would, however, be reasonable for the Minister to say in reply thatthe report of the Transport Tribunal had only recently been received,and that the Government were still considering the effect of the tribunals recommendations on the national economy.In further discussion questions were raised about the relationsbetween Ministers and the Boards of socialised industries. Thus, ifthe Government were held accountable in the last resort, by Parlia-ment and by the electorate, for the standard of efficiency in the socialised industries, was it satisfactory that the Boards should regard this as a matter of day-to-day administration falling mainly,if not wholly, within their jurisdiction ? Further, was it not desirable that Ministers should be given an opportunity of expressing their views, however informally, on proposals of the boards which might have political repercussions ? Thus, should notMinisters have been made aware of the intention of the british transport Commission to submit to the Transport Tribunal a charges scheme for the London area involving adjustments in passenger fares, including a modification of the existing system of workmen&apos;sfares ?The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport to formulate, in the lightof the Cabinet;s discussion, fresh proposals designed toreduce railway costs, to secure a better balance of traffic between rail and road and generally to secure that, over aa number of years the Transport Commission^ under-takings, taken as a whole, would be self-supporting.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP. (50) 31)submitted by the Minister of Health in response to their request of9th March, setting out the existing financial structure of the national health Service in England and Wales and the modifications whichwould be required if the Government were to be enabled to exercisecloser control over expenditure on this Service.The Minister of Health said that, in an expanding service atan early stage of its development, it was inevitable that expendi-ture should increase and that some of this increase should be reflected in Supplementary Estimates. In present circumstances he could not favour the imposition of any rigid ceiling on expen-diture in 1950-51. As regards the extent to which past expenditurehad exceeded the annual Estimates, he thought there was littlesubstance in allegations of extravagance or deliberate overspending.He had, however, appointed a financial expert, Sir Cyril Jones, toundertake an independent examination of the financial administra-tion of the Service as a whole. The Central Health ServicesCouncil had set up a special committee to consider the administra-tive structure of the hospital service; and the Nuffield Trust hadinstituted an investigation into hospital finances. From these enquiries the proposal was likely to emerge that a representativeof the Minister should sit on the hospital management committees.
If closer financial control was achieved by way of suggestionsemanating from an independent enquiry, rather than by an instruc-tion imposed by the Government, he believed that the advantages of the present organisation could be retained while securing greatercentral supervision. He was opposed to the imposition of charges,either for hospital treatment or for the supply of drugs orappliances, at such an early stage in the development of the Service.The Chancellor of the exchequer said that a supplementary estimate amounting to almost half the total of the original Estimatelaid the Government open to the serious criticism that they could noteffectively control the expenditure of public money. The Govern-ment would be seriously weakened if they did not put themselves ina position to rebut that criticism. In his view the least that hecould say in the debate on the following day was (i) that the amountof the Estimates for the National Health Service in 1950-51 wouldbe a fixed ceiling, which would not be exceeded; and (ii) that,whatever the outcome of the current enquiries into the financialadministration of the National Health Service, the Government were determined to enforce effective control on behalf of the responsible minister in the various stages of hospital expenditure. He wouldnot need to say at this stage precisely how this would be done: themost effective and convenient methods could be disoussed in detail with regional hospital boards and hospital management committees:but it was in his view essential to assert at once the principle of central financial control without awaiting the results of the currentenquiries to which the Minister had referred.In discussion there was general agreement that theGovernment must be in a position to balance the claims on theBudget of expenditure on the, National Health Service and expendi-ture on education, defence and other services. One service couldnot be allowed to incur expenditure without limit, while the othersremained subject to strict financial control. Hospital committeeshad in the past been accustomed to operating within financial limits and subject to financial checks; and there was reason to believe thatthe more responsible members of regional hospital boards and hospital management committees would welcome the imposition of closer financial control on behalf of the Minister. The scheme approved by the Cabinet in 1946 had contemplated that each regional hospital board would have an accounting officer responsible to theMinister of Health, and the placing of officers of the Ministry ofHealth in key positions need not interfere with the smooth running of the Service.Some doubt was expressed whether it would in practice bepossible to adhere to a rigid limit on expenditure in 1950-51; but itwas pointed out that other services had to keep within their estimates, despite changes in costs, and that in Votes as large as thoseof the National Health Service it should be possible to balanceunexpected expenditure in one field by savings in another, providedthere was adequate financial control from the centre.The future safeguards which the Chancellor of the Exchequerwished to announce need not imply any admission that the service in the past had been out of control, since there had inevitably beendifficulties in making precise financial estimates of expenditure inthe early stages.The Cabinet agreed that it was not necessary to decide, beforethe debate on the following day, whether charges should be madefor any of the facilities provided under the Service. Some Ministersthought that a rigid control of expenditure would provide all the savings that need be sought, and that a system of charges was undesirable. It was suggested, however, that the public might reasonably be required to buy their own supplies of things like cottonwool and aspirin.
It was also suggested that further consideration should be givento the remuneration of specialists, especially in the junior grades.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in the debate on the Supplementary Estimates for the National health service on the following day, should announce that therewould be a ceiling on expenditure on this Service in1950-51, and that the Government would take appro-priate steps to enforce effective financial control, on behalfof the responsible Minister, over the expenditure of regional hospital boards and hospital management committees.(2) Agreed to resume at a later date their discussion of the finances of the National Health Service.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th March, 1950.
