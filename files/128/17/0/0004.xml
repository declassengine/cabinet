(50) 17from circulation.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary, th^e Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Agriculture (CP. (50) 17) oh the main questions of policy arising in connection with the annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in accordance; with previous practice, it was proposed to hold in February the statutoryannual review of the agricultural industry required by/Section 2of the Agriculture Act, 1947. On this occasion the review&apos; raiseddifficult and controversial issues which were largeiy due &apos;,to thfcGovernment^ decision, in October last, to eliminate the exchequer subsidy on animal feeding-ituislAIn OP. (50) 17 the agriculture ministers had raised the main questions of policy on which they required the guidance of the Cabinet before they could begin their negotiations^&apos; with the representatives of the; industry. Thesequestions iarose under three headsprodu6tion&quot;targets, the reviewof agricultural prices and the de-rationing of animal feeding-stuffs.The Cabinet first considered the proposals in CP. (50) 17 for future production targets; and the following points were raised in discussion:  &apos;,\&apos;*) ia) Would it be expedient to reduce -the ftaisget for wheatproduction to. 2^500,000 acres ? While it might not be practicable. to i-^hieve a higher &quot;acreage, was there hot a risk that sp; large a- rWdVcti6nih!tfe&apos;target might live  fee impression that there liadbeen a significant change of policy in respect of wheat production ?The Minister of Agriculture agreed that this target, should-he setat 2,550,000 acres. , ^&quot; t - - f(6) As a result of abnormal weather conditions in 1949 therewould be a shortage of potatoes for some weeks next summer. Inthese circumstances was it advisable to reduce the potato acreagetarget for 1950 ? In reply, it was pointed out that productiontargets; wuld not usef ully be based on the exceptional conditions of1949. In a normal year the existing target, would result in over-production involving heavy loss to the Exchequer. The productionof potatoes inevitably fluctuated widely: in a bad year a deficit in home production could not normally m made good by imports, butthis was less serious now that bread Was no longer rationed.&apos; &apos;t    The Cabinet-^    &apos;&apos;(i) Subject to the modification recorded in paragraph (a) above,approved the proposals for revised production targetsput forward In CP. t50) 17.The Cabinet next &apos;considered whether it was expedient to open,before the Election, the jnegotiatoions with representatives of theNational Farmers&apos; Unions for the review of agricultural prices.In discussion it was pointed out that a Government engagedin an Election campaign was :notin a strong position to make a goodbargain with the farmers over, future agricultural prices; that thefinal decisions should be left to the new Administration which would come into office after the Election; and that it would be undesirable for the present Government to do anything in this matter at thepresent stage which would involve a commitment for the new administration. For these reasons the Cabinet agreed that furtherconsideration of CP. (50.) 17 should be postponed, and that nodiscussions, even of a preliminary character, should be undertaken with the National Farmers&apos; Unions before the General Election.The Cabinet-
BeohoanalandProtectorate,chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe. :(previous reference: !C.M.(50)3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat Seretse Khama had accepted the Governments invitation toreturn to London, with his wife, for consultations about the chief-tainship of the Bamangwato Tribe. He was expected to reachLondon by air early in the following week. According to newspaperreports he had told his followers that he would not be away for more than three weeks.The Secretary of State said that he would see Seretse as soonas he arrived in London and would try to persuade him voluntarilyto relinquish the chieftainship of the tribe. If he was unwilling to dp this, he would be informed that the Cabinet would have toconsider the position and could no$ do so until after the Election.Meanwhile every effort would be made to dissuade Seretse and his wife from giving interviews to the press.;;i    The Cabinet- KTook note of this statement.Germany.Situation inBerlin.(previous reference:CM. (49) 46thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of recent developments in Germany. The Russians had recently shown signsof resuming their interference with the free flow of road traffic from western Germany to Berlin. At the same time Eastern germany had been falling behind in the delivery of supplies in compensationfor the goods which they were receiving from the West under theexisting barter agreement, and the West German Government hadbeen authorised to suspend on that account further deliveries of ironand steel to the East. United States officials in Germany hadunfortunately represented this as the first step in a counter-blockadein retaliation for Russian interference with road traffic from western Germany to Berlin; and ill-considered references had alsobeen made to the possibility of reinstituting the air-lift to Berlin.The Foreign Secretary said that it wOufd be his aim to avoid anyfurther action or statements which might increase the tension; andhe had invited the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germanyto return to London for consultations. He would keep in touch withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer on these matters.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.Indo China.383494. The Foreign Secretary said that of the two nationalist move-ments in Viet Nam that led by Ho Chi Minn was being exploited bythe Communists; and he was satisfied that the objective of checkingCommunist encroachment in Indo-China would best be served byfostering the emergence of a genuinely independent Government inViet Nam under the leadership of Bao Dai. Before he went to the colombo Conference the Foreign Secretary had hoped that he wouldbe able there to concert a common policy by which all commonwealth governments would accord recognition to the Bao Dai regime. Inthe event, however, he had been unable to secure such a commonagreement at Colombo partly because the French Government haddelayed securing final parliamentary ratification of the agreement for the transfer of power in Viet Nam to the Bab Dai Government,partly because of uncertainty about the attitude of the UnitedStates Government, and partly because Pandit Nehru had sethis face against any early recognition of the Bao Dai regime.Pandit Nehru&apos;s attitude was largely influenced by his distrust ofFrench policy in Asia: he was irritated by the reluctance of theFrench Government to liquidate the remnants of the French Colonialsystem in India, and he could not be convinced that they intended tomake a genuine transfer of power to a Nationalist Government inViet Nam.b 2
i.:.; &apos;&amp; 20At the end of the Colombo Conference this matter had been lefton the.basis that each of the Commonwealth Governments would be free to take its own decision in the light of the: information given,and the views exchanged, at the Conference; and the representatives. of the other Commonwealth countries had been; left with the im-pression that the United Kingdom Government would accord recog-nition to the Bao Dai regime at a fairly early date. The foreign secretary had, however, thought it preferable to hold his hand for alittle longer. He had in particular been influenced by the continuedcriticisms of the Bao Dai regime in Left-wing: circles and by the&apos; consideration thatif the French Socialists voted against ratification^ of the Viet Nam agreement, the United Kingdom Government might find themselves in some political embarrassment in the currentelection campaign if they had already accorded recognition to theBao Dai Government. Meanwhile, however, China and the soviet union had purported to recognise the rival Nationalist movementunder Ho Chi Minh. The French Parliament had at last ratified theagreement for the transfer of power in Viet Nam, without criticism from the French Socalist Party. And he had that morning heard, that the United States Government had decided to accord recogni-:-;. tion, without qualification, to the Bao Dai regime. In thesecircumstances he recommended that the United KingdomGovernment should now proceed to accord recognition to Bao Dai;and that thereafter they and the United States Government should encourage the French Government to make a firm stand against any:   , threat of Communist aggression in Indo-Chiha.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that hehad no doubt that the Governments of Canada, Australia and NewZealand would recognise the Bao Dai regime. The Government ofIndia would not be willing to do this; but he hoped that, as a resultof the discussions at the Colombo Conference, Indian ministers would at least refrain from expressing public criticism of the action taken in this matter by other Commonwealth Governments. TheGovernment of Ceylon would probably be prepared to follow the leadgiven by the United Kingdom Government; but it was agreed thatit would be inexpedient to bring any pressure to bear upon them todo so.   The attitude of Pakistan was uncertain.In further discussion it was suggested that, if the Governmentsof Egypt or Persia could be persuaded to recognise the Bao Dairegime, this might encourage the Government of Pakistan to followsuit.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should now proceed to accord recognition to the Bao Dai regime inViet Nam; and authorised the Foreign Secretary to makethe necessary arrangements for this purpose.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth Governments of thisdecision.5. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the fact that no settle-ment had yet been reached in the prolonged tramways strike in HongKong. Ministers expressed anxiety lest it might be too readilyassumed by the local authorities that Communist intervention wassolely responsible for this dispute. Experience elsewhere had shownthat there was a risk that fear of Communist interference might result in failure to give sympathetic consideration to grievances oversuch matters as wage rates and conditions of employment. The factthat the Hong Kong strike had now continued for many weeks sug-gested that it might be inspired, in part at least, by legitimateHong Kong.TramwaysStrike.(previous reference:CM. (49) 54thConclusions,Minute 2.)
grievances. Might it not be advisable to make available to the HongKong Government the services of an expert conciliation officer ?The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that every effort hadbeen made to settle the Hong Kong strike, and the Colonial Govern-ment had been successful in- preventing the trouble from spreadingto other public utilities. The Government had an expert LabourDepartment with an experienced trade union adviser. He would,however, consider the suggestion that the services of a specialconciliation officer should be obtained.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,7th February, 1950.
