57 . CM. 11 (50)NationalHealthSeraiaa.(previous reference: ,CM. (50) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Minister of Health said, with reference to the minutes ofthe Cabinet&apos;s meeting of 13th March, that he had. not understoodthat; the Cabinet desired to resume their discussion of the finances of the National Health Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in the earlier discussion he had said that, if expenditure on this Service in1950-51 was to be kept within the limits of the original Estimate,it might become necessary to consider imposing a charge for someof the facilities provided under it; and that, while he did not thinkit necessary that the Cabinet should discuss this question before he made his statement in the debate on 14th March, he was anxious that they should discuss it before he introduced his Budget.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume, before the introduction of the Budget,their discussion of the possibility of imposing charges forsome of the facilities provided under the National health service.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons. ;corporal punishment.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.When the Service Estimates were discussed on 20th-22ndMarch, inclusive, the House would have to sit until midnight, butit was hoped that divisions could be avoided. When the vote wastaken on 23rd March on all outstanding Estimates, supplementary estimates and Excess Votes required before the end of the financialyear, the division would take place at 9-30 p.m.The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the proposals which werebeing put forward in both Houses for the restoration of corporal punishment as a penalty for crimes of violence. The Home secretary said that there was no evidence of any widespread increase in theseoffences since the enactment of the Criminal Justice Bill in 1948.He recalled that the clause in the Bill abolishing corporal punish-ment had been carried by the House of Commons without a division;and that, after it had been removed&quot; from the Bill by the House ofLords, prominent members of the Conservative Opposition had joined with the Government in securing its restoration by the Houseof Commons. The Motion which was to be discussed in the Houseof Lords in the following week did no more than call attention tothe large number of crimes of violence occurring in large cities. Itwas, however, known that this would be made the occasion forvoicing the demand for the restoration of corporal punishment; andthe Cabinet agreed that the Government spokesmen on this occasionshould take the line that this question had been fully discussed inthe recent proceedings on the Criminal Justice Act and that theGovernment saw no reason to review the policy embodied inthat Act.Divorce Laws. 3. The Cabinet were informed that Lieutenant-Colonel(Previous Lipton, M.P., was again raising, in a Question for answer by the reference: Prime Minister on 20th March, the proposal which he had putCM. (49) 46th forward in the last Parliament that a Royal Commission should be conclusions, appointed to enquire into the present state of the divorce laws.Minute 3.) It was the view of the Cabinet that there was no widespreadpublic concern over this question, and that this was not an oppor-tune moment at which to launch a further enquiry into it.The Cabinet-Agreed that it would be inexpedient at the present timeto appoint a Royal Commission to review the law relatingto divorce in England and Wales.38453-1 b 2
Council ofEurope.(Previous   &apos;Reference:C.M.(49)40thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Prime Minister said that the United Kingdom Dele-gation to the Council of Europe could not be formally reconstituteduntil the next meeting of the Council. The United Kingdom should,however, be represented at meetings of standing committees whichwould be held meanwhile; and it was reasonable that this repre-sentation should reflect the relative strength of the Political parties in the new Parliament. It was therefore proposed to reduce thenumber of Labour representatives attending such meetings.When the new Delegation came to be appointed at the next meeting of the Council, it would probably be necessary, as there were no independent Members in the present Parliament, to allow theLiberal Party to nominate one member. The Cabinet would havean opportunity in due course to discuss the proposed composition of the new Delegation.Recognition ofStaff Assocla-tions in thePost Office.(previous reference:CM. (49) 72ndConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Post-master-General (CP. (50) 33) proposing a revision of the statementof policy which the Cabinet had on 15tn December, 1949, authorisedhis predecessor to make about the recognition of staff associationsin the Post Office.The Postmaster-General said that the statement then approvedby the Cabinet would have provoked controversy in Parliament on two occasions-first on the meaning of the formula and later onits application to a particular break-away Union. Parliamentarycontroversy could not be avoided, but he would jprefer to face it onceonly and on the basis of an actual decision. He therefore proposedthat, while the Postmaster-General should reserve the right of finaldecision on the question whether a staff association should berecognised, this question should in the first instance be discussed by the Staff Sides of the Post Office Whitley Councils. This wouldhave the advantage of bringing Post Office practice into line withthe practice followed by the Admiralty and by the Ministries ofHealth, Supply and Civil Aviation in dealing with professional andindustrial grades.In discussion, it was pointed out that the policy proposed bythe Postmaster-General would be criticised as making it difficult fora new staff association to establish itself against the opposition ofexisting Unions, and that the decision whether a staff association was a representative organisation which could be recognised for thepurpose of negotiations on pay and conditions was a responsibilityof management which the Postmaster-General should not handover to the Staff Sides. If a new staff association was genuinelyrepresentative of Post Office workers in some grade and the Post-masternGeneral wished to recognise it, the need to secure its acceptance by the existing Unions might increase the Postmaster-GeneraFs difficulties. On the other hand, it was undesirable tofacilitate the formation of a large number of dissentient Unions,a process which the large number of grades in the Post Officetended to encourage.The general view of Ministers was that this matter ought to be examined from a wider standpoint than that of the Post Office.Similar problems arose in other Departments, and since, with thepassage of time, the field of direct State employment might been larged still further, it was desirable that a common policy shouldbe adopted throughout the State service. It was difficult to intro-duce new staff associations into the Staff Side of the Whitleymachinery without the full agreement of the existing associations;and there was, therefore, a strong bias in favour of allowing wage negotiations to be conducted by the established organisations. Bwas desirable that these organisations should cover as much of thefield as possible, since in cases of dispute the question was bound to arise with whom and on whose behalf wages agreements had been
negotiated. It was, however, difficult to refuse to discuss other staffquestions and individual grievances with representatives of an organisation which could be said to be acting on behalf of the individuals concerned! There was, therefore, a strong case for an examination of the question of the recognition of staff associations,over the Whole field of Government employment.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for aCommittee of Establishment Officers of the Departmentsprimarily concerned to examine the question of the recognition of staff associations and to frame proposalsfor early consideration by Ministers.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a Committee ofMinisters to consider the proposals of the official,Committee to be appointed under Conclusion (1) above,and to make recommendations to the Cabinet.6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (50) 28 and 32) covering a draft of theEconomic Survey for 1950 and suggesting various amendments tomeet points raised in an examination of the draft by the production committee.In discussion the following points were made: (a) The wording of paragraph 9 (regarding the trade recessionin the United States in 194(9) might give offence in some quarters in the United States. This would be revised in consultation withthe Foreign Office.(b) Some reference should be made (possibly in paragraph 58or 59) to the problem of sterling balances.(c) The wording of paragraph 75 (as amended by the Pro-duction Committee) should be examined to ensure that undulyoptimistic promises were not held out regarding the supply ofelectricity in the winter of 1950-51.(d) In paragraph 119 (as amended by the Production Com-mittee) it would be safer to say that the national diet in 1949 hadbeen more varied.(e) The draft should be examined to ensure that there was noundue emphasis on the re-equipment of factories. In discussionof this point, Ministers agreed that, while re-equipment and the full use of modern machinery by shift-working was of great importance,industry should not be allowed to overlook the extent to which pro-productivity could be increased by other methods, including better relations between managements and workers.(/) There would be criticism of the forthcoming reduction inthe housing programme, which was brought out in paragraph 40Of the Appendix. The Minister of Health said that he would shortly be submitting to the Cabinet a memorandum showing in detail theeffect on the housing programme of the proposals relating to capital investment for 1951. ..(g) In paragraph 64 of the Appendix it would be preferable to say that capital investment in Northern Ireland was a matter for &quot; the Northern Ireland Government.(h) In general, the document would be more intelligible toreaders without specialised economic training if it could be wordedin more simple language. Paragraph 38 of the draft was instancedas an example of its verbal obscurity.
The Cabinet Subject to consideration by the Chancellor of the exchequer of the points noted above, approved the draft of theEconomic Survey for 1950 attached to CP. (50) 28, asamended by the Production Committee, and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for its presentation to Parliament.bechuanaland protectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference:CM. (50) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50) 36)covering the draft of a white paper justifying the Governmentsrefusal to recognise Seretse Khama as Chief of the BamangwatoTribe.Discussion turned first on the terms of the reply to be given bythe Secretary of State to a question, to be put to him that afternoonby Mr. Edelman, M.P., asking what steps had been taken to assistSeretse to avoid financial loss as a result of the government&apos;s decision. The Secretary of State proposed to announce that he had offered to pay Seretse an allowance of  1,100 a year for so long ashe was required to live outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate, on condition that he did not revisit the territory without permissionand did nothing to interfere with its good government. He had also agreed to pay the legal expenses incurred by Seretse inconnection with his visit to London. He also proposed to announce that, subject to good behaviour by him and his chief adherents,Seretse would be allowed to make a brief visit to the bamangwato reserve for purposes connected with the preparation of his law suit;and that he would also be given permission, if he sought it, to visithis wife during her confinement.In discussion the following points were made : (a) There was no evidence that Seretse would lend himself tointrigue, or encourage disorder, while he was in the Protectorate;indeed, he probably realised that it was in his own interests to avoid creating further trouble in the tribe. It would therefore be inexperienced-expedient to stress these conditions unduly in the announcement; andthe proposed reply should be recast in more conciliatory terms. Inparticular, it would be unwise to announce the amount of theproposed allowance in terms implying that this was the price to bepaid for keeping Seretse outside the Protectorate : it should suffice to assure the House that proper financial provision would be madefor him. And the offer of permission to visit his wife should not bemade conditional upon his asking for it.(6) Was it clear that the Government had legal powers to exclude Seretse from the Bamangwato Reserve or from the wholeBechuanaland Protectorate?The A attorney-General said that, under a proclamation of 1907,the United Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa was clearly empowered to make an exclusion order against anyone living in the Protectorate if he were satisfied that his continued presencethere would endanger the peace of the territory. Thus, although there was no power to prevent Seretse from leaving this country orfrom re-entering the Protectorate, once he was again living therean expulsion order could be made against him.(c) The Cabinet agreed that Seretse should not be allowed totake up residence in the Bamangwato Reserve as a private person,though he must, subject to the needs of law and order, be allowedto make a temporary visit to the Reserve for the two purposesmentioned by the Secretary of State. They were not satisfied,however, that it was necessary to prohibit him from taking up resi-dence thereafter in the Protectorate outside the Reserve. Indeed,so long as Tshekedi was allowed to live in the Protectorate, it seemed
unreasonable that Seretse should be forbidden to do so. The Cabinetsaw no reason why Seretse should not reside in the Protectorate,though Outside the Reserve, so long as his presence there did not prejudice public order and good government in the Reserve. And,as the business of his immediate journey to the Protectorate wouldoccupy him for several months, it seemed reasonable for the Secretaryof State to say at once that he would be prepared to review thequestion of the prolongation of Seretse&apos;s stay in the Protectorateif it were found that his presence there was not in fact prejudicing the peace and good government of the Reserve.(d) There should be no question of excluding Seretse&apos;s wifefrom the Reserve or from the Protectorate until after the birth ofher child.(e) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat, according to his information, there was no immediate risk ofany widespread disorder in the Bamangwato Reserve; and that anydisorders that might break out could best be handled by police,rather than troops. There were, however, few police in the Protec-torate; and it might be politically embarrassing to bring policereinforcements from Southern Rhodesia. He undertook to obtain a further appreciation of the reinforcements which might berequired, if disorder occurred, and to make this the basis for eonsul-tation with the Minister of Defence on this point.The Cabinet then turned to a discussion of the draft white paper annexed to CP. (50) 36. The Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations said that he would have to re-examine this draft in the light of some of the points which had been made in the cabinets discussion; and the Cabinet asked that this opportunity should be taken of making the draft rather more objective, and lessargumentative, in tone. Various specific suggestions for verbalamendment of the draft were also put forward and approved.The Cabinet then considered the terms of paragraph 10 of thedraft, which gave the Governments reasons for not publishing thereport of the Judicial Enquiry. The suggestion was made that,whatever arguments were used to justify it, the withholding of thisreport was bound to provoke suspicion; and that the preferablecourse would be to publish the report as an appendix to the white paper and to specify in the White Paper which of the arguments in the report were rejected by the Government. It was, however,the general view of the Cabinet that, if this course were followed,greater prominence would be given to the arguments in the reportthan to the Governments reasons for rejecting them. The cabinet agreed that no major change should be made in paragraph 10 of thedraft White Paper annexed to CP. (50) 36.The CabinetS attention was also drawn to a Motion, tabled onbehalf of the Liberal Party, urging the Government to publish thereport of the Judicial Enquiry and to reconsider their decision to withhold recognition of Seretse as Chief of the Bamangwato. TheCabinet agreed that, despite the public interest in this matter,Parliamentary time need not be afforded for the discussion of a motion tabled by so small a section of the House of Commons. Thequestion whether, and if so how, Parliament should be enabled to debate this matter could be considered later in the light of the reception accorded to the White Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to revise, in the light of their discussion, the terms of the reply which he was proposing to give to Mr. EdelmanSQuestion that afternoon, and to submit the revisedanswer for the Prime Ministers approval.
(2) Agreed that, in lieu of publishing the report of the judicial enquiry, the Government should present a White paper setting out the grounds for their decision to withholdrecognition of Seretse Khama as Chief of the Bamang-wato. Tribe;, and invited the Prime Minister, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations, to.settle the final terms of this white paper. ...(3) Took note that the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations would consult further with the Minister ofDefence regarding the action which might have to betaken to preserve public order in the bechuanaland protectorate.Cabinet Office, smi, -l$th March, 1950.
