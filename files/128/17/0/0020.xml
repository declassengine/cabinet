Food.PointsEationing. &quot;(previous reference erence:CM. (50) 19thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Minister of Food (C.P. (50) 59) recommending the discon-tmuance of the points rationing scheme.Further discussion showed that the majority of Ministers were reluctant to take a decision at this stage whicn would involve thefinal dismantling of the machinery for the points rationing of food.The Government were deeply committed to a policy for the fairi distribution of scarce commodities, and the abandonment of point is rationing at this stage might be regarded as inconsistent with thati policy. While the Unit Voucher System might go some way towards,seeuring the equitable distribution of scarce foods, the fact remainedthat it involved reliance on &quot; under the counter &quot; methods which left a wide discretion to the individual retailer, and it was inevitable that such a system should operate inequitably. The results of de-rationing sweets were still fresh in the public mind, and there would undoubtedly be a tendency to assume that any inevitable shortages of certain foods were the direct result of the Governments decisionto abandon points rationing. In present circumstances, the Govern-ment escaped such criticism, since it was generally recognised thatthrough the points rationing scheme they were doing their best toensure an equitable distribution of scarce commodities. For these reasons it seemed wiser to proceed with greater caution. As a first step, those types of food which were now plentiful might be removed from the scheme; the operation of the scheme could then be reviewed in May in the light of the supply position.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be inadvis-able to adjust the individual points allocation exactly in relation tothe supplies of commodities still covered by the scheme. At asimilar stage in the clothes rationing scheme, point values had been somewhat inflated in order to test the exact strength of the demand.The Minister of Food undertook to consider whether this devicecould be applied to the points rationing scheme for food.The Cabinet (1) Decided that it would be premature to discontinue entirelythe scheme of points rationing of food.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to consider, in the light oftheir discussion, how this scheme could be modified; andto submit a further report, in a month&apos;s time, on theworking of the scheme.wages policy.manual workers inGas Industry.(previous reference erence:CM. (49)66thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of fuel and Power and the Minister of Labour (P.C. (50) 28 and 29) ona claim by manual workers in the gas industry that there should be aminimum wage of  5 5s. per week in part of the country and  5per week in the rest of the country.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union and the General and Municipal Workers&apos;Union were supporting this claim, although they had givenpublic support to the Governments policy of wage stabilisation.The unions thought there was an exceptionally strong case for anincrease of wage rates in this industry on grounds of increased pro-productivity and of the lack of any general wage increase in the indus-try since early in 1948. At present, under the existing agreements,the area boards were paying widely different rates to men doing thesame type of work, and these anomalies were causing discontent.Unless the Government exercised pressure on the Gas Council, itwas unlikely that their representatives on the National joint industrial Council, which was meeting again on 13th April, wouldresist the claim. Labour relations in the gas industry had beenvery good, and the Gas Council were reluctant to face the deterioration-tion which would follow any resort to arbitration and any labour
y   122disputes culminating in a strike. In any event, the Gas Councilbelieved that, if the claim went to arbitration, manual workers mightbe awarded more than could be agreed as a result of negotiation. TheMinisters own suggestion was tnat the Gas Council might be askedto negotiate with the unions about the rationalisation of basic wage rates in the various regions. In the Midland region the wages oflabourers varied between 95s. and 101s. a week, in the Eastern regionbetween 93s. and 97s. a week, and in the South-Western region be-tween 92s. and 99s. a week. If some of these anomalies could beremoved at the regional level, it might be possible to avoid the dangerous repercussions on other industries of an attempt to secure a higher national minimum wage,The Minister of Labour said that any direct Government inter-vention in wage negotiations was open to serious objection and hewould be sorry to see the good industrial relations which had existed in the gas industry impaired. At the same time, the grant of a  5a week minimum wage in the gas industry would undoubtedly mean that current claims on behalf of railway workers and engineerswould be strongly pressed. Steps ought at any rate to be taken to postpone any final decision until after the Budget, since many unions were waiting until then to decide whether to press their claims.In further discussion the following points were made : (a) It would be no new departure for the Government to express a strong view to the management side of the gas industry in favourof maintaining the policy of wages stabilisation. Ministers hadalready had to take steps to prevent wages increases among localgovernment employees, teachers and others. Any general increasein the wages of gas workers would have serious repercussions inother socialised industries and in industry generally. The gas council might be prepared to accept informal advice from theMinister of Fuel and Power, but in the last resort the Minister mighthave to indicate that, if his advice was ignored, he would be com-pelled to give a direction prohibiting any increase in gas prices until further notice. While it would clearly be undesirable that the good relations which had existed in the gas industry should be impaired,it appeared to be more important to hold back the large number ofother claims which would be strongly pressed if the gas workerssecured an increase in wages.(6) Some Ministers were doubtful whether the policy of wagesstabilisation could be held much longer. Various negotiations forincreased wages were being held up as a result of direct or indirectGovernment intervention. A point would be reached at which the pressure could no longer be withstood and the question would arisewhether a large number of demands were to be conceded simul-taneously, with dangerous effects on the national economy, orwhether, now or in the near future, the claims of the lower-paid workers could be met, with a view to easing the pressure and prevent-ing a general rise in wages. It was also important to preserve theauthority of those trade union leaders who had supported theGovernment in the policy of wages stabilisation : if they were forcedto maintain a negative attitude for too long, other leaders might come forward who were willing to force more extreme claims. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had promised to meet the EconomicCommittee of the Trades Union Congress General Council after theBudget, and it was clear that about that time the whole wages policy would have to be considered afresh. Other Ministers were impressed by the danger in present circumstances of volunteering a concession to lower paid workers, in view of the demands which skilled workers would make to maintain their wage differentials, and they felt thatthe most serious danger was that any general increase in wages would increase costs and bring about a situation of rising prices andlowered exports in which the workers would be worse off than before. The policy of wages stabilisation had been related to wage
rates and had not prevented quite substantial increases in weekly-earnings.Tne general view of Ministers was that, because of the reper-cussions on wage rates in other industries, it was undesirable thatthe claims of manual workers in the gas industry for basic ratesof  5 and  5 5s. a week should be granted at the present time.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should impress on the Gas Council the undesirability of granting at thepresent time national minimum wages for manual workersin the gas industry, at the rates proposed by the tradeunions, and should suggest to the Council that they should offer to negotiate with the unions the removal of anomaliesin basic wage rates at the regional level.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th April, 1950.
