0The EconomicSituation.(PreviousKeferences:CM. (50) 7thConclusions,Minute&quot;^ &apos;and 9thConclusions,Minute 5.)At the Cabinefs meeting on 9th March Ministers had been invited to send to the Chancellor of the Exchequer any specificsuggestions which they wished him to take into account in framinghis Budget proposals. As a result of one of these suggestions thePrime Minister had thought it desirable that the Cabinet should hold a further discussion on the general question whether theGovernment should continue to aim at a substantial Budget surplus.The Chancellor of the Exchequer had circulated a memorandum onthis subject (CP. (50) 85) as a basis for the discussion. \!:-&quot;^.&apos;   ^   ;A full discussion took place on the role which Budgetary policy should play in supporting the Governments primary policy of main-taining full employment without giving rise to undue inflationary pressure.  No record of this discussibn is being made.The broad conclusion which emerged from the discussion wasthat the Cabinet fully endorsed the general policy outlined in theChaiaceltor&apos;s memorandum (CP. (50) 35) and his approach to theproblems of the forthcoming Budget. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he was glad to have this opportunity of hearing the views of his Cabinet colleagues on these matters and that, in framing his Budget proposals, he would bear in mind all that hadbeen said in ithte course of the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,nth March, 1950.
