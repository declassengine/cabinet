Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that in Private Members&apos;Business in business on 12th May the House of Commons would debate a motionthe House of by Major R. H. Turton, M.P., urging the Government to restore toCommons.      private traders the right to purchase food-stuffs in overseas markets.A number of Government supporters had tabled an amendmentcommending the advantages of Government buying under long-termagreements with Colonial and Dominion producers. Suitableinformation would be supplied to those who were proposing to speakin, support of this amendment. The Minister of Food would alsospeak on the Government^ behalf during the course of the debate.Sir Ian Fraser, M.P., had placed on the Order Paper of the Houseof Commons a notice asking for a return showing the number of controls involving licences, permits, rationing or other restrictions,which had been introduced since 1939 and were still in operation.The Cabinet were informed that the preparation of such a returnwould involve a disproportionate amount of trouble and expense.Unless, however, the Clerks at the Table were informed before this motion was called on the following day that the Departments con-cerned were not prepared to provide the information, the motionwould be passed as an unopposed return and the information wouldthen have to be furnished. The Cabinet invited the Chief Whip toensure that the necessary steps were taken to prevent this motionfrom going through as an unopposed return.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.2. The Chancellor of the&apos;Exchequer said that a critical stagehad been reached in the discussions in the Organisation for european economic Co-operation on the proposals for a European payments union. There was a grave risk that, unless some fresh proposals were now put forward on behalf of the United Kingdom, we might find ourselves in an isolated position in which we should be forcedto accept some scheme which failed to take adequate account ofour interests. He had therefore worked out, with the assistance ofhis advisers, fresh proposals which, while safeguarding our own interests, went a long way to meet the views of other european countries. These had been embodied in a paper (E.P.C. (50) 51),which was to have been discussed by the Economic Policy Committeeon the following day. His advisers had, however, heard from Paristhat morning that no time should be lost in taking a fresh initiative in this matter; and he therefore invited the Cabinet to agree thatthe United Kingdom Delegation in Paris should be authorisedforthwith to put forward for discussion the proposals outlined inE.P.C. (50) 51.In reply to specific questions put to him in the course of a briefdiscussion, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was satisfiedthat this new scheme involved the minimum of risk to essential UnitedKingdom interests, and gave the best protection to sterling that wecould expect to secure in the course of these discussions.The Cabinet 38749Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to instruct theUnited Kingdom Delegation to the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation to put forward, in thecurrent discussions on a European Payments Union, pro-posals on the lines indicated in the note annexed toE.P.C. (50) 51.b 2
Parliament 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordLegislative President (C.P. (50) 89) submitting for approval a provisional legis-Programme     lative programme for the 1950t-51 Session.for the 1950-51 The Lord President explained that the Future LegislationSession. Committee, in consultation with the Ministers concerned and with parliamentary Counsel, had considered what preparatory work should now be put in hand on the drafting of legislation for the1950-51 Session. On each particular Bill the Minister concerned would have to obtain any necessary policy decisions from the cabinet or the appropriate Cabinet Committee. The Expiring Laws (Con-tinuance) Bill should be added to the list of essential Bills set outin the Annex to CP. (50) 89. A substantial number of Bills shouldbe ready for introduction as soon as the new Session began, and ministers should therefore press on with their preparation.The Prime Minister drew attention to the fact that this was onlya provisional programme, and that its approval by the Cabinet didnot authorise any Minister to anticipate The .King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament by promising that a Bill mentioned in thememorandum would be introduced in the following session.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The King&apos;s Speech at the opening of the present Session had indicated that, on receipt of a further report from the Committeewhich was examining the law relating to leasehold, Ministers would consider what legislation should be introduced to amend the law inrespect of residential and business premises. This report was expected in about a month&apos;s time, and early consideration wouldhave to be given to the question whether legislation should be intro-duced in the following Session.(b) The Cabinet Committee on Distribution and Marketing were examining the distribution of fruit and vegetables, and would try to formulate at an early date recommendations on this and other aspectsof the distribution problem.(c) The Board of Trade hoped that the Consumers&apos; ProtectionBill might provide for more than the establishment of a consumers&apos;advice centre.(d) The present distressed condition of the white fish industry might make it necessary to introduce comprehensive legislation onthis subject in the following Session. This matter was under examination by the Agriculture Ministers, in consultation with theMinister of Food.(e) Legislation might be required on the constitution of develop-ment councils. The question whether a council could be set up against the wishes of a majority of the employers was at present beforethe courts.(/) The Minister of Defence and the Service Ministers were con-sidering the reports of the Lewis and Pilcher Committees on court-martial procedure. It was difficult at this itage to envisage the form which legislation on this subject might take.(g) The Lord Chancellor was in consultation with Lord Porter,as chairman of the Porter Committee, on points arising on the draftBill to amend the law of defamation. The timing of the introductionof this Bill would have to be considered in relation to the progress made by the press in the establishment of a Press Council.(h) It was not clear that the Government would see their way toadopt the recommendations of the Tucker Committee relating tolimitation of actions.(/) The degree of urgency of the Restoration of Pre-War trade practices Bill would be assessed when questions of policy in con-nection with the Bill were considered.(j) It might be practicable to enact the provisions of the FertiliserSubsidies Bill in the current Session, possibly as part of the legislationsubsidising the use of petrol for farmwork.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, where policy had been approved, work should proceed on the preparation of the Bills for the 1950-51Session indicated in paragraph 5 (1) of CP. (50) 89.(2) Authorised the Committee on Future Legislation to review,from time to time, the progress made with the preparationof legislation for the 1950-51 Session and to make suchminor adjustments in the provisional programme as might seem desirable.Public Boards.political activities ofMembers.(previous reference :CM. (48) 17thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister (CP.(50) 97) on the political activities of Peers who were full-time membersof the boards of socialised industries.The Prime Minister said that it had been brought to his notice that an unduly narrow interpretation was feeing placed on para-graph 4 (c) of the rules governing the political activities of membersof these boards (CP. (48) 53) which the Cabinet had approved on26th February, 1948; and that, as a result, the Government werebeing deprived of the valuable experience and support which might otherwise be supplied in debates in the House of Lords by LabourPeers who were full-time members of the boards. He therefore pro-posed that the Ministers concerned should inform the Chairmen ofthe boards, by letter, that it was not the Government^ intention thatthis paragraph of the rules should operate to prevent full-time members of the boards who were Peers from taking part in generaldiscussions in the House of Lords which were conducted on broadlines without Party acrimony. When this communication had gone to the Chairmen of boards, he would himself write to the LabourPeers concerned in the terms of the draft set out in the Annex to cp. (50) 97.There was general agreement with the proposals put forward bythe Prime Minister.In discussion the point was made that at least one of the LabourPeers concerned was in a position to make a useful contribution todebates in the House of Lords on defence questions; and it wasagreed that the reference to &quot; matters of economic or social policy,&quot;in the last paragraph but one of the draft letter in the Annex to CP.(50) 97, should be amended to cover also matters of defence policy.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a letter to be sentto the Chairmen of the boards of socialised industries, bythe Ministers responsible for those boards, in the terms proposed in paragraph 4 of CP. (50) 97,(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would thereafter send tothe Labour Peers concerned a letter in the terms of thedraft set out in the Annex to CP. (50) 97, subject to theaddition of a reference to debates on defence matters.Food.Tea Ration.(previous reference:CM. (50) 29thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 95 and 99) recommending that the tea ration shouldbe reduced from 2\ oz. to 2 oz. a week from 16th July.It was explained in CP. (50) 95 that, in order to maintain the ration at its present level of 2\ oz. a week, 475 million lb. of teawould be required in a full year. The Minister^ advisers were satis-fied that they could not reasonably hope to be able to buy more than380 million lb. in 1950.  On that basis our tea stocks might be
reduced from 120 million lb. to only 25 million lb.; and it might then become necessary to reduce the  ration in 1951 below the level of 2 oz.a week.The Minister proposed to submit to the Economic Policy Com-mittee proposals for modifying the current arrangements for the bulk purchase of tea. Meanwhile, however, he considered that theprudent course would be to reduce the ration to 2 oz. a week. Theearliest date on which this could now be done was 16th July.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the tea ration should be reduced from 2\ oz. to2 oz. a week as from 16th July, 1950.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce this decisionduring the course of the following week.Nigerian 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of constitution. State for the Colonies (CP. (50) 94) outlining the progress made inreviewing the Nigerian constitution and proposing that he should send a despatch to the Governor of Nigeria indicating the Govern-menfs approval, subject to a satisfactory settlement of outstanding issues, of proposals which had been made in January 1950 by aGeneral Conference of representatives of the whole country, andamended by a Select Committee of the Legislative Council of nigeria.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the new Consti-tution would give greatly increased regional autonomy, and wouldprovide for the creation of larger and more representative regionallegislatures, with increased powers. Nigerians would have a full share in shaping Government policy in a Central Council of Ministers andin Regional Executive Councils. Difficulties had arisen from the factthat the rich Northern Region, which contained a majority of thepopulation and was predominantly Moslem in character, feared that under the new constitution its interests might be subordinated to thoseof the Eastern and Western Regions. Accordingly, the northern region had pressed for equal representation with the other tworegions in the Central Legislative Council, and there had been some danger that the Colony would be disrupted on this issue. It had nowbeen suggested that a bicameral constitution might be adopted, inwhich the regions would secure the necessary safeguards through themanner in which the two Houses were constituted; this was underfurther examination and would come before the Legislative council at its meeting in September. The Northern Region had also claimed that finance should be divided between the regions on a per capitabasis, and arrangements had now been made for a committee toexamine the financial structure under the new constitution. TheGovernor of Nigeria was of opinion that, unless the United KingdomGovernment indicated at this stage that they were prepared to adoptthe proposals on which agreement had been reached in Nigeria, thesituation might deteriorate and the measure of agreement so farachieved might be lost.In subsequent discussion, attention was drawn to the importanceof ensuring that the administrative and other senior grades of the african Civil Services contained a progressively increasing proportionof Africans, so that, as self-government was progressively achieved,the transfer of responsibility at the administrative, as well as thepolitical, level could be effected smoothly. The success of the transition in India had been largely due to the policy of increasingyear by year the proportion of Indians in the Indian Civil Service.Rather similar difficulties arose in industry, and an effort was now being made to see whether more could not be done to influenceNigerian students who came to this country at their own expense totake up careers other than the professions of law and medicine, into
which an undue proportion appeared to be entering. The colonial development Corporation had agreed to sponsor a number of apprentiship schemes with a view to securing, in Africa and else-where, that the middle range of superviser could be recruited fromnative-born sources.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 94, and authorised theSecretary of State for the Colonies to send for publicationa despatch on the lines indicated in paragraph 9 of his memorandum.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to submit tothe Cabinet a memorandum indicating what steps werebeing taken to introduce an adequate proportion of native-born administrators into the higher grades of the ColonialCivil Service, particularly in African and other colonies which were progressing towards self-government.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,UthMay, 1950.
