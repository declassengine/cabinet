1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inin the the House of Commons in the week following the Whitsun Recess.from 2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (50) 108) proposing that an amnesty should be offered to men who deserted from the Armed Forces before 1st January,1947.In favour of this proposal it was argued that, since the Cabinet10th had last considered the matter in 1947, pressure for a general amnestyhad developed in Parliament and in the Press. It was both trouble-some and unpopular to persevere in the attempt to trace and punishmen who had deserted a long time ago, especially as some of them had strong compassionate reasons for deserting and those who Weretraced could not give any further useful service in the Forces. Thetotal number of deserters had now dropped to a point at which it seemed feasible to dispose of the problem by way of a generalamnesty. This would not apply to men who had been serving onregular engagements at the time of their desertion: nor would itapply to men who had been guilty of serious offences in addition todesertion. The amnesty was intended mainly for war-time conscripts;but, as many of these had continued to serve after the end of thewar, it was proposed to apply it to all who had deserted up to 1st January, 1947. After the first world war a similar amnesty hadbeen declared, in 1922. In South Africa, Australia and Canada an amnesty had in effect been granted to war-time deserters. There wasno evidence that the rate of desertion from the Armed Forces sincethe end of the war had been influenced by the fact that the grantof a general amnesty had so far been withheld. Nor was there any certainty that the grant of such an amnesty would be prejudicial to future discipline in the Forces.Against the proposal, it was argued that desertion in time of war was a very serious offence which it would be dangerous to condoneby the grant of a general amnesty. There was a clear preponderance of opinion among the Governments military advisers that an amnestymight increase the current rate of desertion and, perhaps moreimportant, would encourage desertion in a future war. The precedent of 1922 was misleading; for after the first world war there hadbeen no conscription for peace-time service, as there now was.And it was significant that the three Commonwealth countries whichhad granted an amnesty to war-time deserters had not maintainedconscription for peace-time service. In the United States and NewZealand, where a system of compulsory peace-time service was inforce, no amnesty had been given to war-time deserters. The detailsof the proposal would be open to criticism. Thus, the fact that the amnesty did not cover men serving on regular engagements would suggest an undesirable discrimination between regulars and con-scripts. And it would be difficult to defend the arbitrary date of1st January, 1947, especially as the choice of this date would includewithin the amnesty a number of men who had been called up afterthe end of the war. The main difficulty, however, was to reconcilea decision to grant an amnesty now with the policy adopted in 1947,and defended in Parliamentary debate within the last year, by whichdeserters had been encouraged to surrender themselves and regularisetheir position, even though this involved undergoing some degree of punishment. If an amnesty were granted now, the remaining bodyof deserters would fare better than those who had responded to theearlier appeals. Yet some at least of the remaining body of deserterswere less worthy of consideration than those who had already sur-rendered and paid the penalty. If the numbers outstanding were nowrelatively small, the breach of principle involved by an amnesty wasthe less warranted. An amnesty in the form proposed was liable togive the impression that desertion in war was less serious thandesertion in peace.38808 b 2
It was the general view of the Cabinet that the balance of these arguments lay against the declaration of an amnesty.The Cabinet Agreed that it would be inexpedient to offer a generalamnesty, on the lines suggested in CP. (50) 108, to men whohad deserted from the Armed Forces during the war.House CoaLSummer and winter Prices.(previous reference:CM. (50) 32ndConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal of theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (50) 103) that in the south ofEngland coal-merchants should reduce prices by 5s. a ton in summer and increase them by 5s. a ton in winter, with corresponding butsmaller price differentials in the north.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he did not considerthat an increase in winter prices amounting to 3d. per cwt. would beregarded as a serious burden by householders in the south ofEngland. A resumption of the pre-war practice of differentiatingbetween summer and winter prices was necessary because exhorta-tions alone were not providing a sufficient incentive to householdersto stock coal in the summer. Nor would the problem be solved byan increase in the quantity of coal made available to domestic con-sumers; for it arose rather from the difficulties of distributing theavailable coal in winter than from insufficient production.In discussion there was general recognition that the householderwho had no facilities for stocking coal in the summer might objectto paying a higher price in the winter. At the same time it seemedreasonable to give those who were prepared to stock coal in the summer for winter use some rebate to compensate them for the storage space which they provided: stocking by consumers reduced the need for stocking in merchants&apos; yards, where the process ofunloading coal in summer, stacking it and then reloading it for delivery in winter was very expensive. Moreover, if householderswho were able to stock coal in summer did so, those who could notwould have a better chance of getting their needs met in the winter months; and, as between having no coal at all or having to pay a somewhat higher price, there was little doubt which alternative ahouseholder would choose. The growing tendency of householdersnot to buy coal in the summer for use in the winter was aggravatingtransport difficulties; and, unless the trend was checked, there wasno prospect of providing London and the other large towns with sufficient coal by rail in a hard winter.In these circumstances the general view of Ministers was thatthere should be a reversion to the pre-war practice of charging lower prices for house coal in the summer than in the winter. some ministers, however, were doubtful whether the proposed difference in price would be sufficient to induce householders to stock in the summer. Moreover, the practice of restricting summer deliveries to25 cwt. in the south of England, and 20 cwt. in the north, limited theextent to which householders could revert to their pre-war habits of winter stocking. The restricted amounts of coal available, month bymonth, at the pit head for domestic use also restricted the extent towhich coal could be stocked for winter use: if the merchants&apos; stocks were to be built up during the summer from   million tons to 2 million tons, it seemed doubtful whether more than \ million tons would beavailable for stocking by domestic consumers, and in these circum-stances it would almost certainly be necessary to increase the amountof summer coal available for domestic use at the expense of the exporttrade.
55CM. 33 (50)Ministers considered that the announcement of different summer and winter prices should be made by the coal merchants or theNational Coal Board, not by the Government.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange fora lower summer price for domestic coal, to be offset by ahigher winter price, on the lines indicated in paragraph 8of CP. (50) 103.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to go as far as was practicable in increasing the quantities of coal whichdomestic consumers could buy in the summer.(3) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to take all practicable steps to secure that coal merchants built up stocks in thelarger towns to meet the winter needs of householderswithout storage space.112Scottish Affairs.       4.   The Lord President explained that he had suggested, and the(Previous       Secretary of State for Scotland had agreed, that the terms ofReference:     reference of the proposed committee on Scottish revenue and expendi-C.M. (50) 32nd ture should be enlarged to require them to examine and submit any conclusions,    return of revenue and expenditure, or of imports and exports, which minute 8.)      might be prepared as a result of their findings. He feared that, if thecommittee&apos;s report were confined to the practicability of either ofthese projects, the Government might be pressed to make annualreturns thereafter; whereas, if the committee appended to their reports current return, prepared by Departments in the light of thecommittee&apos;s findings, that might dispose of the matter finally.The Chancellor&apos; of the Exchequer thought that any report onpracticability might show, in respect of a revenue and expenditurereturn or of an imports and exports return, that information couldbe collected if a great deal of additional work were done by theGovernment or by commercial and industrial firms. At that stagea political decision would have to be taken whether the results ofcompiling a return would warrant the labour and inconvenienceinvolved. He feared that, if the committee were instructed to examineany return that might be prepared, there would be a presumption that such a return was to be got together, whatever the additional work involved and no matter how inaccurate the result might bebecause of the assumptions which had to be made.The general view of the Cabinet was that the terms of reference of the committee should not be extended to cover the submission ofa return. At the same time, it might be useful to have a statisticianon the committee, who could advise on the form which any returnshould take.The Minister of Health said that he was opposed to the appoint-ment of this committee since it would sharpen the demands of the nationalists and, if it showed that any such return was practicable,would raise more questions than it solved. If, however, a committeewas to be appointed, he thought that its scope should be extendedto cover Wales, as well as Scotland, and that its membership shouldbe adjusted accordingly. There would be a demand for similarinformation in respect of Wales, and the Government would be well advised to concede that point at the outset rather than be compelledto do so later under pressure.Other Ministers pointed out that separate figures of government expenditure were more readily available for Scotland than for Wales,and that there had for a long time been a demand among responsiblepeople in Scotland for this financial and economic information.Moreover, the committee might find that a return was not practicable,
either in respect of revenue and expenditure or of imports and exports,and in that event it was unlikely that there would be any demandfor a similar analysis in respect of Wales.The Cabinet Agreed that the proposed committee on Scottish revenue,and expenditure should have the terms of reference set outin Appendix I of CP. (50) 101 and that the proposed enquiry should not be extended to cover Wales.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd May, 1950.
