1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 98) and the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations (CP. (50) 102) on the line to be taken in the forthcoming discussions with the Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerceabout United Kingdom purchases of wheat and flour from Canadaafter the expiry of the current four-year contract in July, 1950.. TheMinister of Foodexplained that there was likely to be asubstantial world surplus Of wheat in 1951 and that, subject to theprovisions of the International Wheat Agreement, we should be in agood position to buy wheat and flour over the next three years onadvantageous terms. In his view, therefore, negotiations with Canadashould be conducted on the basis of the minimum price under theInternational Wheat Agreement. This country would require 104million bushels Of dollar wheat in 1950^51 and, while the proportionbought in Canada should depend on prices, it might be desirable to promise to take from Canada a specified quantity of wheat of the1950-51 crop at the minimum price. As regards the interpretation of clause 2 (6) of the Anglo-Canadian Wheat Contract, he thought itwould be right to argue that our obligations under this clause hadbeen fully met. Any concessions beyond a promise to buy a specifiedquantity of wheat in 1950-51 should be in the direction of agreeing to take other commodities we required, particularly Canadian salmon.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that, ifthe belief that there would shortly be a buyer&apos;s market for wheatproved to be unfounded, the stiff approach to the Canadianswhich the Minister of Food had suggested might have unfortunate results. In the long run the Canadian market for UnitedKingdom goods was likely to be more stable than the United Statesmarket; and the increase of United Kingdom exports to Canadamight depend on the continuing good-will of Canadian Ministers,who would be under; strong pressure to provide greater protection for their own industries. In view of the terms of the public announce-ment in December; 1948, about the interpretation of clause 2 (b) ofthe wheat contract, it was difficult to say that the interpretation of the contract was not a matter for discussion in the forthcoming talks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the total amount ofour imports from Canada was limited by the agreement which we had concluded with other sterling-area Commonwealth countries to reduce our dollar imports. Until we had completed the general review ofour import programme which was now proceeding, it was important that we should not enter into any commitment to increase our currentimports of Canadian commodities other than wheat ; and the forth-coming negotiations with the Canadians should therefore be confined to wheat. He suggested that the Government should indicate their willingness to buy from Canada all the dollar wheat which they wouldrequire in 1950-51 for human consumption, namely 104 million bushels. At a later date we might find it convenient to buy canadian wheat for animal feeding-stuffs, at the minimum price under the Inter-national Wheat Agreement, but it was as yet too early to enter into negotiations on this matter. As regards price, negotiations should begin at the minimum price under the International Wheat Agreement.This had been a generous concession to producer countries whichthis country had accepted, after a good deal of thought and againsta narrow view of its interests, because it believed that from a widerstandpoint some stability in wheat prices was desirable. An agreedprice would have to be negotiated which might be rather higher thanthe minimum price, and any such negotiated price should be regardedas meeting any remaining commitments under clause 2 (b) of theexisting wheat contract.In discussion there was general support for the approach sug-gested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. During the war, and in subsequent years, the Canadian Government had shown a friendlyb 2
spirit in trade negotiations with this country and the United KingdomGovernment for their part should show a desire to reach an amicable settlement. In particular, the Government should show willingness to discuss clause 2 (b) of the wheat contract and to meet outstandingCanadian claims in the price finally negotiated.In further discussion, the following points v/ere also made:  (a) The prospect of a world surplus of wheat in 1951 raised thequestion whether adequate international machinery was available fordealing with such surpluses. There was no reason to believe thatthe favourable North American wheat crops which had existed since1942 would continue indefinitely ; and, since at present only aboutsixteen weeks&apos; requirement of wheat was held in this country, a succes-sion of bad harvests might compel us to negotiate for supplies fromRussia and her satellites at a time when this might be, politically, a source of weakness. In reply, it was pointed out that the international wheat Agreement included provisions requiring both producercountries and consumer countries to increase their stocks of wheat in periods of surplus production.(b) The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary hadno reason to believe that the United States Government would objectto our taking all our dollar wheat from Canada in 1950-51, or to ourpaying for this a price rather above the minimum price in the Inter-national Wheat Agreement.(c) The Minister of Agriculture hoped that the door would beleft open for the purchase of some wheat from Canada at a later date for feeding to animals. He also made the point that as much aspossible of the Canadian supplies should come in the form of wheat,rather than flour, since wheat offals were the best form of animal feeding-stuffs.(d) The Canadian Minister of Trade and Commerce could, ifnecessary, be assured that we had at present no intention of buyingwheat from Russia this year for human consumption.(e) Ministers would wish to discuss separately, and at a later date, the proposal in paragraph 13 of CP. (50) 98 that the bulk purchase of wheat should be discontinued, and that further buyingshould be on a commercial basis through the grain trades.The Cabinet-Agreed that the forthcoming negotiations with the canadian minister of Trade and Commerce should be confined to proposed purchases of wheat and flour, that the UnitedKingdom Government should be prepared to agree to buyall their dollar wheat requirement in 1950-51 (104 million bushels) from Canada, that negotiations as to price shouldcommence at the minimum price under the international wheat Agreement but the negotiators should be free to goabove this minimum, and that the price eventually agreedshouid be regarded as meeting any Canadian claims under clause 2 (b) of the existing wheat contract.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Agricul-ture Ministers (CP. (50) 105) on the line to be taken in the forth-coming negotiations with the Farmers&apos; Unions about the minimum prices for livestock and livestock products in the years 1952-53and 1953-54.The Minister of Agriculture said that there was nbw some riskof surplus production of milk and eggs; and, although it was not proposed to set any quantitative limit to the assured market for these products in the period up to 1953-54, it was recommended that further expansion of their production should be discouraged by reducing theAgriculturalPrices.(previous reference:CM. (50) 14thConclusions.Minute 5.)
guaranteed minimum prices. It was suggested that the minimum price for milk for 1952-53 and 1953-54 should be between Is. Sid.and Is. I0%d. a gallon a reduction of 30-35 per cent, below the currentactual price; and that the minimum price for eggs for that period should be between 2s. lid. and 2s. \0\d. a dozen or, if necessary, aslow as 2s. 6d. a dozen in 1953-54. Fat-stock prices, on the otherhand, could not safely be reduced if the momentum of the expansion programme was to be maintained; and it was suggested that theminimum prices for fat cattle and fat sheep should be retained at the levels already fixed for the period 1950-52. To encourage a further increase in pig breeding, it was proposed that the minimum price for pigs should be increased from 305. a score in 1951-52 to a figurebetween 32^. 9d. and 35s. for the two following years. Wool was shortly to be included in the products covered by the scheme of guaranteed prices; and it was proposed that the minimum prices for1952-54 should be fixed at 10 per cent, below the current actual price.The Minister of Food, while supporting the proposals for fat-stock prices, suggested some decrease in the proposed minimum prices for milk and eggs. He suggested that the minimum price for milkshould not exceed Is. 9d. a gallon and that for eggs the minimum price should be 2s. 6d. a dozen for 1952-53 and 2s. 3d. a dozen for1953-54. The Minister of Agriculture agreed that the negotiatorsmight put forward the lower price for milk suggested by the Ministerof Food. He doubted, however, whether he could accept as a basis for negotiation the lower price suggested for eggs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his view thereshould be some slight reduction in all the prices proposed in Appen-dix I of CP. (50) 105. In the final column of that Appendix theseproposed prices were stated in terms of percentages of the actualprices fixed for 1950-51. The purpose of minimum prices was, how-ever, to give farmers some assurance in making their forward plans;and the proper percentage comparison was therefore with theminimum prices promised for earlier years, not with the actual pricessubsequently fixed. On this basis the reductions proposed were lessthan the percentage figures would -suggest. The Minister of Agri-culture said that, although the logical comparison might be with theminimum prices promised for an earlier year, farmers would in factjudge these proposals in relation to the actual prices which were currently being paid.In further discussion it was argued that the Government might find themselves in some political difficulty if they could be represented as reducing minimum prices for the purpose of discouraging agricul-tural production. In reply it was pointed out that, within an expanding total programme, guaranteed prices could properly be usedto encourage one type of production and discourage another. Thepoint was also made that the current surplus of eggs was due, not tothe fact that more eggs were being produced than people were willingto eat, but that there was a limit to the number of eggs which people were willing to buy at current prices and the Ministry of Food couldnot make substantial reductions in the retail price of eggs withoutrisking some addition to total expenditure on food subsidies. Theview was expressed that Ministers would find it useful to have ageneral statement on the relation between farm prices and retail food prices showing, in particular, what prospects there were that areduction in farm prices would produce some reduction in the pricespaid by the consumer.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the agriculture ministers and the Minister of Food to review in the lightof the Cabinefs discussions the proposals put forward in cp. (50) 105, on the basis of a joint report which shouldbe made to them by officials of their Departments; and
Recognitionof StaffAssociationsin Civil Service.(previous reference:CM. (50) UthConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (50) 104) covering a report by aCommittee of officials which had been appointed, in pursuance of the cabinet&apos;s decision of 16th March, to consider the recognition of staff associations in the Civil Service.The Chancellors memorandum embodied the conclusions reached by a Committee of Ministers which had examined the officials&apos;report. The report showed that different arrangements for the recog-nition of staff associations were in force in different parts Of the Stateservice, that the reasons for these differences were largely historicaland that in general the differing arrangements were working well. the ministerial Committee had come to the conclusion that the existingdifferences in these arrangements were justified, and that no change was necessary.On the specific Post Office problem which had given rise to this enquiry, the Postmaster-General had on further consideration decidedto revert in substance to the policy approved by the Cabinet on15th December, 1949; and he now desired to make a parliamentary statement on the lines proposed to the Cabinet on that occasion. he intended to announce at the same time his decision not to recognise the Engineering Officers (Telecommunications) Association, and inthis way to limit to one Parliamentary Occasion discussion both ofthe general principle and of its application. A draft of the statement which the Postmaster-General proposed to make was embodied in annex II to CP. (50) 104.The Lord President suggested that the final paragraph of thedraft statement should be amended to read: &quot; In the light of these considerations, and after weighing up carefully all the relevant factors,I have come to the conclusion that I ought not to grant recognition to the Engineering Officers (Telecommunications) Association.&quot;The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the report annexed to CP. (50) 104 and agreedthat no change need be made in the existing arrangementsfor recognition of staff associations in the Civil Service.(2) Authorised the Postmaster-General to make a parliamentary statement about the recognition of staff associations in thePost Office in the terms of the draft embodied in Annex IIto CP. (50) 104, subject to the amendment noted above.Scottish 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the affairs. Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (50) 101) which (i) proposed that(Previous        a committee should be appointed to consider the practicability of pro-Reference :      ducing a return of Scottish revenue and expenditure and an economicCM. (50) 9th    balance sheet for Scotland, and (ii) discussed the future handling of conclusions,    the claims put forward by the so-called &quot; Scottish Assembly.&quot;Minute 1.) Tne Secretary Qj Smte jor Scotland said that the promoters ofthe Scottish &quot; Covenant&quot; had asked the Prime Minister to receive adeputation of Commissioners from the &quot; Scottish National Assembly.&quot;The resolution passed by the Assembly had referred to &quot; negotia-agreed that, if these Ministers were unable to reach agreed conclusions on the matter, it should be brought forward for further consideration by the Cabinet.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Agriculture Ministers and the Minister of Food,to submit for their information a general memorandumon the inter-relation between farm prices, retail food prices and food subsidies.
tions &quot; between their Commissioners and the Government, and itshould be made clear in any reply that the Government could not regard the Assembly as competent to &quot; negotiate &quot; with the Govern-ment. The Opposition were not in favour of the Assembly&apos;s plan fora Scottish Parliament for domestic affairs, and it was understood thatthe Leader of the Opposition might be unwilling to meet the Com-missioners. It was difficult to assess the degree of public supportbehind the Covenant, notwithstanding the considerable number ofsignatures which had been secured. There was undoubtedly some &quot;restlessness in Scotland about the organisation of Government, but whether the Covenant represented a solution which would continueto command a substantial body of support in Scotland was a moredebateable question. The Scottish group of Labour Members ofParliament had recently asked that a Minister of State for ScottishHousing should be appointed, but he proposed to explain to themthat he saw no advantage in dividing the present responsibilities ofthe Secretary of State, and that a multiplication of junior ministers would not yield any satisfactory results.In discussion it was pointed out that nationalist movements ofthe kind fostered by the &quot; Scottish National Assembly &quot; were out ofaccord with the current movement for increased integration in Europe.Moreover, any concession to a nationalist movement of this kind was likely to lead to further demands, both in Scotland and also in Wales.At the same time it might be undesirable for the Government to appear to show discourtesy to the Commissioners, since this might cause resentment in Scotland. It might, therefore, be desirable forthe Prime Minister to receive the Commissioners, though he wouldhave to use the occasion to draw their attention to the weakness oftheir case and to the arguments against setting up a Scottish Parlia-ment for domesic affairs. It was felt, however, that it would be ofassistance to the Cabinet to know whether the Scottish Members ofParliament who supported the Government were in favour of theCommissioners being received, either by the Prime Minister or by theSecretary of State.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to ascertain theviews of Government supporters in the House ofCommons on the manner in which the request of theCommissioners from the Scottish National Assembly foran interview with the Prime Minister should be handled.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to submit a memo-randum, showing the composition which he had in mind for the proposed committee to examine the practicability of producing a return of Scottish revenue and expenditure and an economic balance sheet for Scotland.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of Scottish affairs at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.WA,15th May, 1950.
