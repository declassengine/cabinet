agricultural prices.(Previous  .Reference:CM. (50)4thConclusions,Minute 1.)1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the home Secretary, the, Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CP. (50) 24) on the main.questions of policy arising in connection with the annual review of the economic condition and prospects of the agricultural industry.The Minister of Agriculture recalled that on 7th February theCabinet had approved certain changes in future production targets.It was now necessary to settle what line the official negotiators should pursue in their discussions with the Farmers&apos; Unions on the questionof agricultural prices. On this occasion, the position had beencomplicated by the Governments decision in October last to dis-continue the Exchequer subsidy on animal feedingstuffs. this meant that, after taking into account other increases in production costs, the farmers were faced in a full year with increased costsamounting to  37-7 million on guaranteed-price products. the agriculture Ministers considered that it would not be reasonable to expect the farmers to bear this increase in full; in their view, the farmers should recover  17 million through an adjustment of guaranteed prices, and should themselves bear the remaining  20^million. On this basis, the farmers&apos; aggregate net income in 1950-51would be  261 million as compared with the actual figure of  277million in 1949-50. In addition, it was proposed in CP. (50) 24that the possibility should be examined in the negotiations of devising a scheme for selective assistance for the development ofgrassland and marginal land.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at the reviewheld in February 1949, Ministers had agreed with, some hesitation,that agricultural prices should be adjusted to secure the farmers an aggregate net income of  249 million in 1949-50. Although it was now estimated that their actual income in that year would exceedthat figure by about  30 million, the Agriculture Ministers&apos; pro-posals took no account of this situation. He also thought it inexperienced-expedient to assume that the Governments promise to make provisionfor an investment of  200 million in the agricultural industrynecessarily implied that this sum must be made available in annualinstalments, of not less than  40 million. It would obviously not be practicable to stop this form of assistance abruptly at the end ofthe fifth year : it should be tapered off over a longer period, and hethought that this process should begin in the coming year. he therefore recommended that the re-assessment of agricultural prices should be made on the basis of an aggregate net income of  209million, as approved for 1949-50 together with a further  30 or 35 million for capital investment. On that basis he would be willing to consider practical proposals for the development of mar-ginal land on a scale more generous than that proposed in cp. (50) 24.In discussion it was argued that nothing should be done whichmight prejudice the success of the agricultural expansion pro-framme; unless agreement could be reached with the Farmers&apos;Jnions on an equitable compromise, it might no longer be possibleto secure the full co-operation of the farmers in expanding produc-tion. There were some 280,000 farmers cultivating less than 100acres, and many of these were already seriously affected by rising costs; in Scotland, in particular, an excessive increase in costs might prejudice the production of beef and mutton. The recommendations in CP. (50) 24 admittedly provided for some increase in the farmers&apos;aggregate net income in 1950-51, but this reflected the increased productivity achieved by the industry. It had not hitherto beensuggested that the arrangements for the investment of  200 million in the industry should be spread over more than five years, and itwas unlikely that the farmers would regard such a proposal as ade-quate fulfilment of the Governments pledge.Against this, it was pointed out that the Farmers&apos; Unions had agreed that a reasonable figure of aggregate net income for the
industry in 1949-50 would be  249 million. In fact, as the resultof the adjustment of prices made in February 1949, the farmers&apos;actual income in the current year would be nearly  280 million.It might well be claimed that the amount made available for capital investment in the industry in that year had been  70 million ratherthan  40 million; in any event, the additional income received bythe farmers in 1949-50 greatly weakened their claim to any figureof aggregate net income in 1950-51 higher than that originallyapproved for 1949-50. Was it necessary, as an inducement to in-creased output, to increase the farmers&apos; aggregate net income onaccount of increased productivity made possible by capital invest-ment financed through guaranteed prices ? The existing structure ofprices was adjusted to the needs of the marginal farmer and, inconsequence, was over-generous to those cultivating better land.Moreover, the proposals in CP. (50) 24 took no account of theinterests of the consumer, who should benefit, through some reductionin prices, from the increased efficiency and productivity of theindustry.:   The Cabinet-^(1) Invited the Minister of State for Economic Affairs and the agriculture Ministers to examine the proposals in cp. (50) 24 further, in the light of the Cabinefs discus-sion, and to report the results of their consultations tothe Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of CP. (50) 24 at alater meeting.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50) 27) on the chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe.This showed that Seretse Khama was unwilling to relinquishhis claim to the chieftainship without further consultation with the tribe. The Secretary of State therefore proposed to inform him, inaccordance with the Cabinefs decision of 3rd March, that adecision on his claim must be postponed for a period of years. after further reflection the Secretary of State was satisfied that it shouldfrom the outset be made clear to Seretse, and announced publicly,that this period of postponement would be not less than five years.The Cabinet were also asked to agree that, if Seretse insisted onreturning to the Bechuanaland Protectorate to bring his wife to thiscountry, arrangements might be made for him to go temporarily tothe Protectorate for this purpose so long as he did not enter the bamangwato Reserve.Finally it was proposed that the decisions taken should be announced&apos; in the House of Commons on 13th March, and that this statement should include a promise to present a White Paper onthe subject.In discussion it was suggested that, before any public announce-ment was made, the Attorney-General should be consulted on thelegal issues involved especially on the question whether the pro-posal to postpone confirmation or rejection of Seretse&apos;s claim to the succession was consistent with the terms of the BechuanalandOrdinances.The Cabinet Aproved the proposals in CP. (50) 27 subject to any views which the Attorney-General might express on the legalissues involved.Cabinet Office, S.W.I.dth March, 1950.bechuanaland protectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference erence:CM.
