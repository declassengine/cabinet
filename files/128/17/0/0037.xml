74tMalaya. ].  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (50) 125) summarising the reference: points on which immediate action was required as a result of cm. (50) 24th the visits which he and the Secretary of State for War had recentlyConclusions, made to Malaya. The Cabinet also had before them drafts of state-Minute 7.)      ments which the two Secretaries of State proposed to make in theHouse of Commons on the subject of their visit (CP. (50) 129and 130).After opening statements by the Secretary of State for theColonies and the Secretary of State for War, the Cabinet had ageneral discussion under the following heads:  Reinforcement of Police and Administrative services the essence of the new plan for dealing with the emergency wasthat the military should clear areas successively and that the civil administration should then move in to hold the cleared areas andensure that bandits did not return to them. For this purpose it was essential that both the police and the administrative services shouldbe reinforced. The reinforcement of the administrative services wasbeing handled by the Colonial Office, by accelerating the posting of administrative cadets to Malaya. For the police, the immediate requirements were: (i) 117 officers, preferably trained policemen fromthe United Kingdom, and (ii) about 175 British non-commissioned officers, who would be recruited through the Crown Agents in theordinary way. In addition, it was proposed to increase the police&quot; jungle squads &quot; by recruiting for service under contract with the malayan police national servicemen now serving in Malaya who were about to take their discharge.Ministers asked why the Malayan authorities expressed thispreference for men with police experience in the United Kingdom,when former members of the Indian police were likely to be available,some of whom had long experience in dealing with Asiatics. Theywere informed that this was due to the disturbance caused in the malayan police force some time ago by the introduction of men whohad served in the Palestine police. Existing members of the Malayanpolice had found that their prospects of promotion had thereby beenprejudiced; and it was thought that the morale of the force would suffer from a second experiment of this kind. On the other hand,the Cabinet were informed that it would be difficult to meet all thepresent requirements from police forces in this country, especially asit would not be possible for the Home Secretary to second a memberof a provincial police force for a period of service in Malaya. the urgent need of the Malayan police and the conditions of serviceoffered would, however, be brought to the attention of chief constablesat a conference over which the Home Secretary would preside. Itwas unlikely that suitable recruits would be found from among thosewho were now being discharged from police duties in Germany; formany of these men were already labouring under a sense of grievancebecause their employment in Germany had been terminated earlier than they had been led to expect.The Secretary of State for War strongly supported these pro-posals for the reinforcement of the police and the civil administration.The army in Malaya, though their morale was still good, had found it discouraging that areas which they had cleared of bandits had fallen back into disorder for lack of a strong civil administration; and,if the new plan for dealing with the emergency failed to prevent a repetition of this process, there was bound to be a serious deterioration-tion in army morale.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, while a determined effort should in the first instance be made to find the men required from the United Kingdom police, other sources should not be over-looked and former members of the Indian police service should, in
Repatriation of ChineseThere were now about 10,000 suspects detained in camps in malaya and, because of the risk of mass escapes, it was important that large numbers of these detainees should be removed from Malayaas speedily as possible. Before September 1949 Chinese detaineeswere repatriated to China; but, now that China was under the controlof a Communist Government, there were difficulties in continuing thispolicy and, if it proved impracticable, other alternatives would haveto be considered. Deportation to Christmas Island had beensuggested as one possibility, but this would have to be discussed withthe Australian Government. The Secretary of State for the Colonieswas proposing to discuss this problem with the Foreign Secretary.The Secretary of State for War agreed that it was essential thatsome means should be found of removing from Malaya a substantial proportion of the suspects now under detention. Care should, how-ever, be taken not to send to China any known members of the malayan Communist Party, since they were likely to be picked outby the Communist authorities there and sent back after a time to malaya. There seemed to be strong arguments in present circum-stances for giving the authorities in Malaya even more drastic powersof detaining suspects and suspending for a time the operation ofthe appeal tribunal which had ordered the release of several suspectswhom the police and civil authorities would have preferred to keep under continued detention.Information and PropagandaThere was room for improvement in the Information Services in malaya; and the Secretary of State for the Colonies said that hewas proposing to investigate immediately the possibility of securingthe services of an anti-Communist expert for Malaya. Other detailed proposals for strengthening the Information Services would bediscussed with the Malaya Committee.The Secretary of State for War emphasised the importance ofsecuring someone with a well-trained political mind to take charge ofthese Information Services. While there was need for the greatestseverity in dealing with the current emergency, this should be coupled with an understanding of the nationalist movement in Malaya and a real desire to come to terms with it. It was also important that theperson in charge of these Services should have a sympathetic under-standing of the contribution which trade unionism could maketowards future stability in Malaya.Financial assistance the Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the various measures proposed in his memorandum would involve a heavyfinancial burden, and it was important that Malaya should bear partof the cost. The Colonial Government recognised that they must raisefurther revenue, and were thinking of doing so by means of anincrease in the export duty on rubber and tin. They did not favouran increase in income tax, for they lacked the necessary administra-tive machinery for collection.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were graveeconomic objections to an increase in these export duties, since thiswould have an adverse effect on the sale of rubber and tin in dollarmarkets. He would much prefer to see an increase in the rate of income tax, which would be fully justified on merits; and it shouldbe possible to ease the administrative difficulties of collection byparticular, be considered. Too much attention should not be paid tothe susceptibilities of the existing members of the Malayan police,since a recent investigation had shown that this force was in urgent need of reorganisation.
bringing Malayan officers over to this country for training in methodsof tax-collection. Malayan producers of tin and rubber had been receiving high prices for their products; but they had been requiredto spend substantial sums in repairing war damage and in meetingthe needs of the present emergency. He was therefore prepared toagree in principle that some further Exchequer assistance should begiven to Malaya, so long as it was made a condition that the localGovernment developed effective machinery for direct taxation and undertook to finance, at the appropriate time, measures of economicand social improvement. With this in view he would wish to suggestsome amendment of the reference to financial assistance which theSecretary of State for the Colonies was proposing to include in his forthcoming Parliamentary statement on Malaya.Social reform the Secretary of State for the Colonies said that a good dealwas being done to reorganise the native trade unions on a non-Communist basis, and it was clear that the mass of the workers were opposed to the Communists. The trade unions were not, however,regarded with great favour by employers in Malaya, whether british or Chinese; and some further initiative on the part of the UnitedKingdom Government would be required if the development of thetrade union movement in Malaya was to proceed with sufficientspeed. He also believed that it would be necessary, as soon as thepresent emergency was over, to find means of accelerating the courseof economic and social development in Malaya. Leading membersof the European community there had pressed him to make a public statement that British rule in Malaya would be maintained for anothertwenty-five years. This he had declined to do. In the light of recentpolitical developments in South-East Asia he agreed with the viewnow held by the Commissioner-General that Malaya&apos;s progress towards self-government would have to be accelerated and that theUnited Kingdom Government would be well-advised to put them-selves in a position to announce considered plans for social and constitutional reform very soon after the end of the present emer-gency. The standard of living in Malaya was very low; and in the plans for its economic and social development first priority should begiven to the improvement of agricultural methods, housing and education in rural areas. Too many of the European population were inclined to hope for a return to the conditions which existed in malaya before the war. The Government would have to make itclear that they had different aims. They must, in particular, be ableto demonstrate to the workers in Malaya that a non-Communistregime offered them greater opportunities for economic and socialbetterment than any Communist regime.AmnestyWhile they had been in Malaya the two Secretaries of State had discussed a suggestion made to them that many of the bandits might now be prepared to lay down their arms if an amnesty were granted.They were, however, satisfied that the offer of an amnesty at thisstage would be regarded as a sign of weakness on the part of theGovernment. In view of the overrunning of Malaya by the Japaneseduring the war, it was essential to British prestige that the power ofthe British Forces to quell insurrection should be clearly demon-demonstrated. The question of an amnesty could not usefully be considereduntil Johore, Negri Sembilan and Pahang had been effectively clearedof bandits.. . . .- ..- - iParliamentary Statements , ,Following discussions between the Lord President and \h&amp;Secretaries Of State for the Colonies and War, it had already been announced that a statement would be made in the House of commons by the Secretary of State for War as well as by the Colonial Secretary.
coloured people fromBritishColonialTerritories.(previous reference:CM. (50) 13thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (50) 113), submitted inaccordance with their request of 20th March, on the problems arisingfrom the immigration into the United Kingdom of coloured people from British Colonial territories.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that social prob-lems were more likely to arise if coloured immigrants into thiscountry formed themselves into residential colonies, and his Depart-ment therefore sought to disperse these people over as wide an area as possible. In this they had the full support and assistance of theMinistry of Labour. Thus, the current policy was one of dispersaland assimilation; but the policy of assimilation undoubtedly presentedgreat difficulties and, in order to overcome these, a concerted effort was needed on the part of the Government Departments and voluntary organisations concerned. The Secretary of State said that he hadtaken steps to convene a conference for this purpose on 10th July,which, he hoped, would lead to the establishment of a nationaladvisory committee on which each of the official and unofficialagencies concerned with this problem would be represented.A number of coloured people continued to find their way into thiscountry from the Colonies as stowaways. Thus, information had just been received that a ship from the West Indies was due to arrive atBristol on the following day which had at least fourteen colouredstowaways on board.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the means of pre-venting any further increase in the coloured population of thiscountry. Ministers were apprehensive lest the higher standards of social service in this country should attract here an undue proportionof the surplus population of the West Indies and other Colonial terri-tories. They were doubtful whether the existing methods of adminis-tration, as describee! in CP. (50) 113, were sufficient to keep within reasonable bounds the numbers who contrived to enter this country as stowaways. Was it clear that Colonial Governments and steamshipcompanies were doing everything possible to prevent coloured people from stowing aw,ay on vessels bound for this country? If so, should further powers be taken to deal with stowaways? Should there beamending legislation to give the appropriate Minister discretion torequire the owners of the vessel in which a stowaway arrived in thiscountry to take him back, whatever his nationality, to the port atwhich he stowed away? Should not consideration also be given tothe wider question whether the time had come to restrict the existingright of any British subject to enter the United Kingdom? In almostMinisters agreed, however, that it would be preferable that the state-ment by the Secretary of State for War should be made by wayof an addendum to the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement. This would avoid having two separate statements on different days, and wouldmake it possible for the Secretary of State for War to omit much ofthe material included in the draft circulated with CP. (50) 130. Bothstatements should be made on Wednesday, 21st June.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of CP. (50) 125.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to make in theHouse of Commons on Wednesday, 21st June, a statement on the lines of the draft appended to CP. (50) 129, towhich the Secretary of State for War would add ashortened version of the statement appended to cp. (50) 130.(3) Invited the Malaya Committee to follow up in detail theproposals made in CP. (50) 125 and iii the cabinets discussion.
all other Commonwealth countries power had been taken to restrict the admission of British subjects from other parts of the Common-wealth. Was it certain that the balance of advantage still lay against taking this course in the United Kingdom itself?The Cabinet agreed that a further review of these questions should be undertaken and that, at the appropriate stage in that review,the Law Officers should be consulted on the legal and constitutional issues involved.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (50) 113.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a review to be madeof the further means which might be adopted to check the immigration into this country of Coloured people fromBritish Colonial territories, if legislation were passedlimiting the right of British subjects, or of any class ofBritish subjects, to enter and reside in the United King-dom, and of the issues of policy involved in making sucha change in the existing law.European 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since he had lastPayments reported to the Cabinet on 15th June, the discussions in Paris on theUnion. revised proposals for a European Payments Union had taken a more(Previous favourable turn.  The Minister of State for Economic Affairs, whoReference: had presided over those discussions, had made commendable pro-C.M. (50) 36th gress towards securing agreement.   The difficulties raised by theConclusions, Belgian Government now seemed likely to be overcome. There was a minute 5.) reasonable prospect that a European Payments Union would be successfully concluded in the course of the next few days.The Cabinet took note of this statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.Trade with 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a meeting of theCanada. Anglo-Canadian Continuing Committee had started that morning inLondon. So far as was known, the Canadian delegation had not come over with any specific requests to make; but, in view of the continuing expansion of our exports to Canada, they would probablypress us to make some increase in our purchases from Canada.Canadian The Chancellor also referred to the satisfactory conclusion of theWheat discussions, held in May with Mr. C D. Howe, the Canadian Ministerand Flour.      of Trade and Commerce, on the future purchase of Canadian wheat(Previous       and flour by the United Kingdom. The conclusions reached in theseReference:     discussions had been described in CP. (50) 119. It was a satisfactoryCM. (50) 31st feature of those conclusions that they included an assurance that theConclusions.    Canadian Government would waive &quot;any further claims underMinute l.)      clause 2 (b) of the contract of 1946, which required the UnitedKingdom Government, in determining the prices payable in later years, to &quot; have regard to &quot; any differences between the prices paid under the agreement in 1946-47 and 1947-48 and the world prices in those years.   Mr. Howe had now succeeded in persuading hisGovernment and his Parliament to accept these conclusions; and itwas a relief to know that no further difficulties would arise betweenthe Canadian and United Kingdom Governments over the interpreta-tion of this clause of the 1946 agreement.The Cabinet took note of these statements by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.
