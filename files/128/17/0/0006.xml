2. The Lord President said that the Government would haveto take all Private Members&apos; time up to Easter, and the necessaryMotion for this purpose would be brought forward on 7th March.The Government would then be asked whether they intended tomake any time available for Private Members&apos; business after easter. Subject to the views of the Cabinet, he proposed to say thathe would discuss this matter with the Opposition leaders with a viewto reaching some agreement which would meet the general wishes of the House of Commons. He himself was inclined to the view thatit would be more valuable if time could be made available for debates on the work of public corporations and on special topics of currentimportance which might arise from time to time. If some time hadto be found for Private Members&apos; business, he thought it would be preferable that this should be allocated to Motions rather than Bills.In discussion it was pointed out that it would be advantageous to Ministers that time should be made available for private members&apos; Motions after Easter. For, in view of the Governmentsnarrow majority, Ministers would have to be constantly in attendance in the House of Commons when Government business was being taken; and it would be convenient if after Easter therewere one day of the week on which they could arrange in advance to undertake official engagements away from Westminster.The Cabinet-Took note that it would be necessary for the Governmentto take all Private Members&apos; time up to Easter; and invited the Lord President to discuss with the opposition leaders what arrangements should be made after Easterfor Private Members&apos; business and for debates on the workof public corporations and on special topics of currentimportance.3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Debate on the Address,the which would open on 6th March, was expected to be concluded on13th March.  The Prime Minister would settle, in consultation withthe Lord President, which Ministers should speak on behalf of theGovernment in this debate.In discussion it was pointed out that between 7th and10th March there would be a number of official functions inconnection with the visit of the President of the French Republicwhich would prevent the Prime Minister and other senior ministers from being constantly in attendance in the House of Commons. Itwould therefore be convenient if the discussion and divisions on any opposition amendment could be taken on 13th March,The Cabinet-- Invited the Chief Whip to consult the Opposition leaderswith a view to arranging that discussion of any Oppositionamendment to the Address should be taken on 13th March.1 The Prime Minister welcomed Mr. Shinwell on his returnto the Cabinet as Minister of Defence. He also welcomed Mr. JamesGriffiths, Mr. Hector MeNeil and Mr. Cordon-Walker on joining the Cabinet as Secretaries of State for the Colonies, Scotland and commonwealth Relations.
4. The Cabinet considered, on the basis of a memorandum bythe Minister of Supply (CP. (50) 21), what statement should bemade of their intentions regarding the implementing of the Iron andSteel Act, 1949.The Minister of Supply recalled that under the terms of theAct the Iron and Steel Corporation could not be appointed until 1st October, 1950, and the vesting date to be prescribed by a ministerial order which would not be subject to any parliamentary proceedings could not be earlier than 1st January, 1951. Thus,no formal steps to bring the Act into operation could be taken before 1st October. The Minister said that, if the Government had been returned with a larger majority, he would have appointed an informal organising committee to undertake the preparatory workwhich ought to be done before the Corporation was formallyconstituted; but he had not announced his intention to appointsuch a committee and in present circumstances he would not proposeto appoint one. If the Government were asked to state their intentions about the Act, it should suffice to say that under the termsof the statute the Corporation could not be set up until 1st october and that its members would be appointed in due course.The Minister of Health said that, by the terms of the statement made by the Minister of Supply in the House of Commons on16th November (which was reproduced in the Annex to cp. (50) 21), the Government became free immediately afterthe Election to approach individuals who might serve as members ofthe Corporation. In his view the Minister should seek theco-operation of any individuals in the industry who were willing togive it, and should proceed with his preparations for implementing the Act. He also favoured a public announcement to the effect thatthe Government intended to go forward with these preparatorysteps. If they showed any signs of hesitancy in this matter, theconfidence of their supporters would be undermined and theOpposition would be encouraged to press for an assurance that nofurther step would be taken towards the implementation of the Actuntil after the next General Election.Other Ministers took the view that it would be unrealistic to suppose that in present circumstances the leaders of the steelindustry would co-operate with the Government in preparing tobring the Act into operation, and that the Minister of Supply wouldbe courting a rebuff if he tried to begin these informal preparationsat the present stage. No formal step could in any event be taken before 1st October; and the Government were therefore under no obligation to take any action in this matter for some time to come.It was the view of the Cabinet that in any public statement it would suffice to take the line that the Act was on the statute book, thatthe relevant dates were prescribed in the statute, and that theGovernment adhered to their purpose of giving effect to the Act aspassed by Parliament. A statement on these lines need not give any impression that the Government had weakened in their resolve to put the Act into operation in due course.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the course of the Debate on the Address thePrime Minister should take an opportunity of making astatement about the Iron and Steel Act on the lines whichhad been agreed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Took note that in present circumstances the Minister ofSupply would not proceed with the appointment of an informal organising committee to prepare for the estab-lishment of the Iron and Steel Corporation.
The King&apos;s 5.   The  Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordSpeech on the President (CP. (50) 20) covering a draft of The King&apos;s Speech on opening of the Opening of Parliament which had been prepared by The King&apos;sParliament.     Speeches Committee.The Cabinet agreed that, in view of the late start of the session and the large volume of essential financial business to be transacted,the Government^ Legislative Programme would in any event havehad to be slight. Moreover, no major Bills could be ready in timeto be passed before the end of the Session. The Cabinet&apos;s discussiontherefore turned on the question whether the Government shouldjustify their legislative programme on these grounds alone orwhether they should also recognise that, with so small a majority in the House of Commons, they could not carry through a moreambitious programme.The Minister of Health suggested that, as The King&apos;s speech and the Debate on the Address would deal only with the plans forthe current Session, there was no need for the Government to go outof their way to state or imply at the outset that they had abandonedall intention of proceeding in the present Parliament with any ofthe major projects foreshadowed in their Election programme. Hewould therefore deprecate any reference, in the Speech or in the debate, to the difficulties of the Parliamentary situation. He saw no reason why the Government should limit in any way their discretion to choose suitable issues on which to contest the next general Election, whenever it came.In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion there was support for the view thatit might be inexpedient to include in The King&apos;s Speech itself any reference to the Parliamentary situation. Such a reference wouldhave to be brief and might be ambiguous; and there was some risk that it might give rise to misunderstanding, especially by publicopinion abroad. The Cabinet agreed, however, that in his speech inthe Debate on the Address the Prime Minister should not attemptto conceal the fact that the Government^ narrow majority in theHouse of Commons would preclude them f roracarrying through anyof the major legislative projects foreshadowed in their Electionprogramme. This applied particularly to the proposals fornationalising the cement industry, the manufacture of beet sugar and sugar-refining and the distribution of meat and for the mutualownership of the industrial assurance companies. Any government must work within the Parliamentary conditions in which it founditself, and it must be clear that there could be no prospect of proceeding with any of these projects in present circumstances. Forthe time being the Government must be content to apply theirprinciples in administration, and could not embark upon majorlegislative changes.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed that the relevantparagraph in the draft of The King&apos;s Speech (the first paragraphon page 4. of CP. (50) 20) should be&quot; amended to read as follows : &quot; In view of the restricted time available and the heavyvolume of financial business to be transacted, My government propose only a limited programme of legislation for the present session. Nevertheless, should other measures prove in their view to be immediately necessary for the maintenance of full employment and the national well-being, My Ministers will not hesitate to submit them to Parliament, even though they may seem likely to prove contentious.&quot;Other points made in discussion were: (a) The reference to the need for an effective scheme of controlof atomic energy should not be so worded as to suggest that world peace could be assured solely by a solution of this problem. Thefailure to reach agreement on the control of atomic energy was
symptomatic of a more general failure to reduce the tension between russia and the Western world.(6) It might be possible to frame, by the early summer, legisla-tion for the transfer of water undertakings to national ownership.The preparation of this legislation could not be completed untilpolicy questions had been considered by the Cabinet and negotiations had been held with local authorities and other interests. It would,however, be useful if the Speech indicated the ^ interest of theGovernment in the subject of water supplies, particularly in rural areas, and made some reference to forthcoming legislation on thissubject.(c) The Committee on Leasehold was likely to present a final report in the next few months, and the Speech should include astatement that when the report was received the Government would consider what legislation could be introduced on the subject inrespect of both residential and business premises.(d) The Government had stated in their Election Manifestotheir intention to set up a Consumer Advice Centre to test and reporton the various consumer goods on the market. A scheme on theselines was likely to be well received and the Board of Trade wouldpress on with the necessary preliminary steps, including the investi-gation of such arrangements as were in operation in the UnitedStates. There was, however, no possibility of legislation on thissubject in the current session.(e) It was customary for the Prime Minister to informMinisters who were not members of the Cabinet and junior ministers of the contents of The King&apos;s Speech on the evening beforethe Opening of Parliament. It would be inconvenient to hold thismeeting on a Sunday, and the Prime Minister therefore proposed toinform the other Ministers that the customary meeting would notbe held on this occasion. The text of The King&apos;s Speech would be conveyed to the Leader of the Opposition, in accordance with theusual practice, on the day before it was delivered.Various detailed amendments of the draft Speech were considered and approved.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the draft ofThe King&apos;s Speech attached to CP. (50) 20 to be amended to take account of the points raised in the Cabinet &apos;discussion and to submit the revised draft to His Majestyfor approval.Defence white paper.(previous reference erence:CM. (49) 72ndConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (50) 19) covering a draft of the annual Statement on Defencerevised in the light of discussion by the Defence Committee on31st January.In discussion of this draft the following points were raised : (a) The Home Secretary suggested that a brief reference shouldbe made to the role of the Armed Forces in Civil Defence. Thissuggestion was approved.(6) The Foreign Secretary suggested that rather more stressmight be laid on the contribution which the United Kingdom was making towards the defence of Western Europe in the field of war production. The Minister of Defence undertook to consider thispoint.(c) In paragraph 5 the phrase &quot; occupied territories &quot; shouldbe qualified in order to make it clear that the reference was limitedto ex-enemy countries and did not include, for example, the middle east.
(d) The concluding words of paragraph 14 should be amended so as to remove the implication that transport aircraft were beingretained in the Royal Air Force solely for the purpose of contri-buting to a further air-lift operation.(e) The appointment of the advisory council mentioned in thethe last sentence of paragraph 25 had not yet been completed, andthis sentence should be adjusted accordingly.(/) On paragraph 27 the Cabinet were assured that there wasno intention of modifying the present arrangement by which astudent was able, if he wished, to undertake his period of nationalservice before reaching the age of compulsory call-up.(g) In paragraph 33 it would be preferable to omit the state-ment that a system of selecting a limited number of men for nationalservice by ballot would be &quot;inappropriate in a democraticcommunity,&quot; since this might give offence in the United States.(k) Was it appropriate that the Statement should conclude bylooking back to the end of the war, now almost five years past ? Thegeneral view of Ministers was that it would be preferable to omitparagraph 34 of the draft.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the draft annexed to CP. (50) 19 to be revised to take account ofthe points noted above.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to present the State-ment, as so revised, to Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd March, 1950.
