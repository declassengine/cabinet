integration of French andGerman coal and steel industries.(previous reference:CM. (50) 38thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet reviewed the course taken in the first day of theHouse of Commons debate on the French Foreign Ministers pro-posal for integrating the coal and steel industries of Western Europe.They also discussed the line to be taken by the Prime Minister whenhe spoke in reply to the debate later in the day.White fish industry.(previous reference:CM. (50) 26thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Minister of Agriculture said that on 23rd June the Pro-duction Committee had agreed in principle that a White Fish industry board should be set up for the purpose of reorganising and regulating the white fish industry, but had remitted to a smaller group of theMinisters primarily concerned the question whether a subsidy shouldbe provided to ease the short-term difficulties of the industry until such time as long-term remedies could begin to produce their effects.The majority of this group had been against the grant of a short-termsubsidy. It was therefore proposed that, in reply to parliamentary questions which had been put down for answer that afternoon, thePrime Minister should announce the Governments intention to intro-duce legislation to set up a White Fish Industry Authority and to initiate discussion in the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.) with a view to securing a common policy regarding excessive landings of coarse fish and over-fishing generally.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The white fish industry had expanded under war conditionswhen other foods were scarce. Although people were still eating morefish than before the war, the industry must now contract and someunemployment and financial loss was inevitable.(b) The Production Committee had considered the grant of a subsidy for the near and inshore fishermen pending the working outof a long-term policy, because under present conditions these sectionsof the industry might come to a standstill if the Government affordedno hope beyond long-term measures which would take a year or more to mature. These measures would include international agreement on over-fishing and the reorganisation of the British industry.(c) It was doubtful whether a temporary subsidy would bring back into use the trawlers which were now laid up; and, if it did so, prices might go down still further and there would be a demandfor a higher subsidy. Moreover, under the present unsatisfactorymethods of fish distribution, some part of the subsidy would go tothe middle-men unless retail prices were again controlled. It wassuggested that, since fish was in competition with subsidised food-stuffs (notably meat and eggs), the proper course would be to readjustthe food subsidies so as to reduce those on meat and eggs by theamount of any new subsidy on fish.(d) The discussions in O.E.E.C. about over-fishing and the land-ing of catches from foreign vessels in United Kingdom ports were likely to be difficult and prolonged. No speedy remedy should beexpected from them.ie) The Minister of Food doubted whether people could now be induced by publicity to eat more fish. It might, however, be practic-able for the Government to increase consumption in the Services,hospitals and schools and in canteens run in connection with government services or socialised industries.The general view of the Cabinet was that the House of Commonswas unlikely to be satisfied with the announcement which it was pro-posed that the Prime Minister should make, particularly as itpromised no early relief for the fishermen. It was therefore agreed39002-1 b 2
that, in replying to the Parliamentary Questions that day, the PrimeMinister should confine himself to promising a statement of policy on 4th July, and that in the meantime the matter should be further dis-cussed by the Cabinet on the basis of memoranda to be submitted bythe Ministers primarily concerned.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in answer to Questions that afternoon about government policy towards the white fish industry, thePrime Minister should promise to make a considered. statement of policy on 4th July.(2) Invited the Fisheries Ministers, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food, tosubmit proposals for consideration by the Cabinet before4th July.(3) Invited the Minister of Food, after consultation with theMinisters concerned with public services, to submit pro-posals for increasing the consumption of fish in thiscountry.MarginalLand.(previous reference:CM. (50) 9thConclusions,Minute 2 (2).)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary, the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State forScotland (CP. (50) 135) proposing that grants should be made forthe improvement of marginal land and that the subsidy schemes forhill-sheep and hill-catttle should be extended for a further period.There was general support for measures designed to improvestock-breeding land where it could, without excessive expenditure, bebrought into a condition in which it would yield a remunerativereturn, but some doubt was expressed whether the proposals in cp. (50) 135 had been properly related to the measures already beingtaken to assist British agriculture and whether sufficient safeguardshad been provided against the risk that the consequential gain fromappreciation in the capital value of the land would accrue to the land-owner, rather than to the farmer or the Exchequer.The Cabinet Invited the Agriculture Ministers to bring their proposals before the Lord Presidents Committee for detailed examina-tion before re-submission to the Cabinet.Korea. 4.   On 24th June the People&apos;s Republic of North Korea had made an armed attack, with substantial forces and without warning,upon South Korea and their armies were rapidly advancing uponSeoul. On 25th June the Security Council had passed a resolution,proposed by the United States representative, calling for the immedi-ate cessation of hostilities and requiring the North Koreans to with-draw their forces. The resolution required all members of the united nations to render every assistance in the execution of the resolu-tion and to refrain from giving assistance to the North Koreans.Despite this resolution, the North Koreans had persisted in theiraggression. The United Nations Commission in South Korea had reported to the Security Council that they could hold out no hope ofbeing able to enforce the cease-fire, that the situation was deterioratingrapidly and that North Korea was unlikely to heed the Council&apos;resolution or to accept the good offices of the Commission. Theyhad therefore suggested that the Security Council should either inviteboth parties to agree upon a neutral mediator to negotiate peace, or should ask certain member Governments of the United Nations toundertake mediation forthwith.The Cabinet were informed that the United States Minister inLondon had called at the Foreign Office that morning and deliveredtwo messages from his Government. The first contained the text ofa public announcement which the United States Government were
proposing to make later in the day. After reciting the facts of the aggression, this stated that the President had ordered United states air and sea forces to give&quot; cover and support to the South Koreanforces. It went on to say that it was amply clear from this attack that&quot;centrally-directed Communist imperialism had passed beyond sub-version in seeking to conquer independent nations and was nowresorting to armed aggression and war. It had defied the security council. In these circumstances, Communist occupation of Formosawould directly threaten the security of the Pacific area and the UnitedStates forces performing necessary and legitimate functions in that area. The President had accordingly ordered the United StatesSeventh Fleet to prevent any attack on Formosa; and was alsocalling upon the Nationalist Government in Formosa to cease all sea and air operations against the mainland of China. The UnitedStates Fleet would see that this was done.&quot; The future status of formosa, it added, must await determination in connection with therestoration of Pacific security, a peace settlement with Japan orpossible consideration by the United Nations. The announcement would also state that the President had directed that military assis-stance to the Philippines should be expedited and the United states forces there strengthened; and that he had similarly directed that military assistance to the French and associated forces in Indo-China should be expedited and that a United States Military Mission shouldbe sent to ensure close working relations with those forces. Theannouncement would conclude with a statement that, as a return tothe rule of force would have far-reaching effects, all members of theUnited Nations must carefully consider the consequences of thislatest aggression. A similar warning of this impending announce-ment had been conveyed to all the other North Atlantic treaty powers, to Australia, New Zealand and India, to the Philippines andto Indo-China.The second message from the United States Government statedthat their representative on the Security Council would that afternoonintroduce a resolution recommending &quot; that the members of theUnited Nations furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea asmay be necessary to repel the armed attack.&quot; It asked that the UnitedKingdom Government should instruct their representative on theSecurity Council to support this resolution. A similar request hadbeen made to the Governments of France and Norway.The Cabinet at once agreed that the United Kingdom Govern-ment should support the substance of the resolution which was to beput to the Security Council urging all members of the United nations to assist the Republic of Korea to repel this armed attack. It wasthe clear duty of the United Kingdom Government to do everything in their power, in concert with other members of the United Nations,to help the South Koreans to resist this aggression.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherit was expedient publicly to attribute responsibility for this aggression,as the United States Government proposed to do, to &quot; centrally-directed Communist imperialism &quot; and to link it with Communistthreats in other parts of Asia. It had not been proved that, in carry-ing out this aggression on South Korea, the North Koreans had beenacting on instructions from Moscow; and it was suggested that there might have been advantage in seeking to isolate this incident and todeal with it as an act of aggression committed by the North Koreanson their own initiative. This would have enabled the Soviet Govern-ment to withdraw, without loss of prestige, any encouragement orsupport which they might have been giving to the Nonh Koreans.The announcement which the United States Government&apos;were pro-posing to make, by linking this up with Communist threats in otherparts of Asia, would present a major challenge to the Soviet Govern-ment; it would bring into controversy other issues which had not yetbeen brought before the Security Council; and its reference toFormosa might embarrass the United Kingdom Government in the irrelations with the Communist Government of China and might even
provoke that Government to attack Hong Kong or to fomentdisorder there.On the other hand it was pointed out that the action which theUnited States Government proposed to take, and the form of their proposed statement, had probably been influenced by the considera-tion that the whole of South Korea was likely to be overrun before any effective assistance could be given by the United States or anyother member of the United Nations. In that event, if action hadto be limited to Korea, it might have to take the form of an offensive against North Korea. The Cabinet were informed that the foreign secretary, who had been consulted that morning, doubted whetherit would be wise for us to try, in any public statement, to isolatethe Korean incident from the other matters mentioned in theannouncement which the United States Government proposed tomake; for we would not wish to discourage that Government fromhelping us and the French in resisting Communist encroachments in malaya and in Indo-China. In the Security Council, however, itwas important that the resolution which the United States representa-tive was to move should be confined strictly to events in Korea; andwe should certainly advise the United States Government that, what-ever form their own public announcement might take, they shouldnot include in the preamble to their resolution any reference to Com-munist threats in other parts of Asia which had not yet been brought before the Security Council.In further discussion it was recognised that, by the terms of their proposed announcement, the United States Government were deliberately taking the major risk of making it clear to the soviet union that they were resolved to put a stop to armed aggression.In this they were doubtless influenced by the consideration that, ashad be,en amply demonstrated by the events preceding the second world War, it would be easier to make such a stand in the earlier,rather than the later, stages of imperialist expansion by a totalitarianState. Though major risks were involved, it was arguable that therewould be even greater risks in allowing the Soviet Government to conclude, as Hitler had done, that aggression would succeed if itsvictim could be over-powered sufficiently quickly. The point was also made that the United States Government were doubtless taking stepsto strengthen their hold on Formosa in order to forestall any Com-munist attempt to advance there while attention was concentrated onKorea. The action which they were proposing to take there couldnot be concealed; and they were not therefore likely to be willing to refrain from referring to it in their proposed announcement, particu-larly as its terms had already been communicated to so many friendlyGovernments- It would, however, be worth while to suggest to themthat they should refrain from including in their announcement thestatement explicitly attributing to &quot; centrally-directed Communistimperialism&quot; the responsibility for the aggression against SouthKorea: it would be preferable that they should leave their proposed action in other parts of Asia to speak for itself. The Minister ofState read to the Cabinet the draft of a telegram in this sense whichhad already been prepared by the Foreign Office; and the cabinet endorsed the terms of this draft.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusions were as follows:  (1) The United Kingdom Government should in principlesupport the action which the United States Governmentwere proposing to take to halt Communist aggression in asia.(2) The United Kingdom representative on the Security council should be instructed to support the resolution, to be pro-posed by the United States representative, calling on &quot; themembers of the United Nations to furnish such assistanceto the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack.&quot;
(3) The United States Government should, however, be urged to refrain from including in the preamble to that resolutionany reference to Communist encroachments in other partsof Asia which were not before the Security Council; andit should also be suggested to them that they should refrain from including in the public announcement which they proposed to issue the statement explicitly attributing to&quot; centrally-directed Communist imperialism &quot; the act of aggression against South Korea.(4) The Prime Minister should at once communicate the sub-stance of Conclusions (l)-(3) to the United states ambassador in London; and the Foreign Office should atthe same time make a similar communication to theUnited States Government through His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington.(5) The Prime Minister and the Lord President should inform theLeaders of the Conservative Opposition of the announce-ment which was to be made by the United States Govern-ment later in the day; and the Prime Minister should communicate it to the House of Commons as soon as ithad been made public and should indicate that it had thefull support of the United Kingdom Government.(6) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations should at once inform other members of the Commonwealth ofthe attitude of the United Kingdom Government towards this United States announcement.(7) The Foreign Office should arrange for Sir Gladwyn Jebb(who had recently been appointed to take the place of sir alexander Cadogan as the United Kingdom representa-tive on the Security Council) to proceed at once to new york to handle the subsequent discussions of this issue in the Security Council.(8) The Minister of Defence should arrange for the * &quot;efs ofStaff to report to the Defence Committee what &quot;ticalsteps the United Kingdom could take to assist th .pub-lic of Korea, in pursuance of the resolution wh .. . wasbeing brought before the Security Council; and to submitan appreciation of possible Russian reactions to theUnited States announcement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21th June, 1950.
