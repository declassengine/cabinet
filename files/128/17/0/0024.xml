Receipts andExpenditureof The british transport commission.(previous reference:CM. (50) 14thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Prime Minister recalled that on 23rd March the cabinet had called for a further report on the proposed increases in railway freight rates and dock charges, and said that this report had nowbeen circulated (CP. (50) 76) and was to be considered by the cabinet at their meeting on the following day. Meanwhile the Minister ofTransport had to answer that day a Parliamentary Question asking whether he was yet in a position to announce a decision on thismatter, and sought the Cabinefs authority to promise that anannouncement would be made in the current &quot;week.In discussion it was suggested that, if a definite commitmenthad to be made, it might be safer to promise a reply in the following week. The Cabinet were, however, reminded that the Minister hadalready given several temporising replies, and that the information which had now been assembled in CP. (50) 76 should enable theCabinet to reach a final decision in the current week.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Transport to say, in reply toa Parliamentary Question that day, that he would announceduring the current week the Cabinefs decision on theapplication of the British Transport Commission for increases in railway freight rates and dock charges.Parliament.Divisions inthe House ofCommons.(previous reference:CM. (50) 16thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had some discussion about the possibility thatthe Government might be defeated in the divisions on the BudgetResolutions which were to take place on 24th and 26th April. Itwas understood that in the debate on 24th April the opposition would be concerned mainly with the extent to which the form of theResolution would limit discussion of the purchase tax; and it couldbe argued that there was no need for a Government to resign onaccount of a defeat on a purely procedural point. On the other hand it was pointed out that, as no amendment could now be tabled onthe procedural point, the division must be taken on the mainResolution and would, therefore, have to be treated as a matter ofconfidence. On 26th April the division would probably be taken on the Governments proposal regarding the petrol tax; and thisequally would have to be treated as a matter of confidence.tor-  magesPolicy.manual workers inGas Industry.(previous reference:CM. (50) 20thConclusions,Minute 2.)38669O.    ine ^aDinet naa Oexore meui a lurmer ineuiuiewiciuiii uv uicMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (50) 71) on the claim of manual workers in the gas industry for a national minimum Wage.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in accordance withthe Cabinefs decision of 6th April, he had suggested to the gas council that they should offer to negotiate with the trade unions theremoval of anomalies in basic wage rates at the regional level, butthe Council had failed to reach agreement with the unions on this basis. The Council had, however, been able to postpone furtherimmediate discussion on the understanding that the desirability ofestablishing a national wage structure for labourers was accepted and that the wage structure should cover two or three provincialrates with special rates for the Metropolitan area. There was astrong case for increasing the wages of manual workers in this industry, which were very low in some areas. It might be possibleto secure agreement on the basis of a minimum of 97s. a week, andhe believed it would be possible to postpone for a considerable periodany consequential increases for higher grades, save where theincrease for manual workers brought them above the rate for ahigher grade. If the increases were confined to labourers, andaveraged about 5s. a week, it would probably not be necessary for-1 b 2
the Gas Council to increase the price of gas; but some increase in price would be necessary if all grades received an increase of about5s. a week.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a serious inroadwould be made into the current wages policy if, when these increaseshad been given to labourers in the gas industry, the higher grades inthe industry insisted on preserving their present differentials in earnings above the manual worker and concessions in the gas industrybecame the basis for claims by railway workers and others. It wasnot, however, inconsistent with Government policy that poorly-paid workers should have some increase in wages. The Gas council should therefore try to limit the increase strictly to manual workers who were underpaid and to defer any consequential rises in payuntil some later date.In further discussion the point was also made that any subse-quent increases in the wages of the higher grades should run fromthe date when they were negotiated and not from the date when the manual workers received their increase. It was agreed that the gas Council should be urged to make this explicitly clear to theunions.(b) The Minister of Labour said that, if Ministers took it uponthemselves to decide what line the Gas Council should take in dealingwith a wages claim, the Cabinet would find that they had assumed responsibility for determining wage-rates and had to defend themin Parliament. He had understood that it was Government policy that the Cabinet should not intervene in wage negotiations; and itwas certainly Government policy that reasonable wage increases should be granted to the lowest-paid workers. The labourers in the gas industry had a strong case on merits for some increase in wages;and it was his view that the Gas Council should be left to give itto them through the normal negotiating machinery.Other Ministers pointed out that the Government were boundto be concerned about rates of wages in general and particularly inthe nationalised industries, since any substantial increases of wages would be reflected in the cost of basic goods and services. It was,therefore, right that Ministers should, where appropriate, give an indication to the boards of nationalised industries of any general considerations which they should take into account in dealing witha wages claim. It would have been within the Ministers powersto give a direction on this subject to the Gas Council, but it had always been contemplated that the power of direction should be heldin reserve and that the Minister should go as far as was practicable to secure the acceptance of his wishes by persuasion.(c) The Lord President suggested that the Cabinet ought at anearly date to review the general wages position and the policy to beadopted in regard to it. Reference was made in this connexion to amemorandum on wages policy which the present Minister of defence had submitted to the Cabinet in 1947 (CP. (47) 189).The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should raiseno objection to the establishment of a national wagesstructure for manual workers in the gas industry on thelines indicated in paragraphs 4 (i) and (ii) of OP. (50) 71,on the understanding that the Gas Council would be pressed to delay as long as practicable the discussion ofconsequential increases in the rates of pay of higher grades, to keep the field of such increases as narrow aspossible so as to lessen repercussions elsewhere, and tomake it explicitly clear that any increases which might
ultimately be granted to the higher grades would not operate retrospectively from the date when the claim was conceded in respect of the manual workers.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to submit to the Cabinet ageneral memorandum on wages policy; and agreed to reconsider, with that, the paper on this subject (CP.(47) 189) which the present Minister of Defence had submitted in 1947.4. The Cabinet were informed that more men were now on strike in the London docks and the strike was spreading to parts ofthe docks which had not previously been affected. The Port ofLondon Authority had submitted to the Official Emergencies Com-mittee a scheme for establishing a Port Emergencies Committee onwhich representatives of the London Dock Labour Board, port employers and Government Departments would serve, and theAuthority proposed that all questions of policy should be referredto the Official Emergencies Committee for guidance. The service departments had made preliminary arrangements to make 1,000 men available for work in the Royal docks that day, and the numberscould be increased, by about 1,000 men each day, to 20,000 at theend of a fortnight. A considerable number of ships were now idle,but no food ships would need to be unloaded before 27th April.In discussion the following points were made : (a) The London Dock Labour Board, after their meeting on22nd April, had issued a statement calling on the men to return towork, and the Board were meeting again that day to discuss what further action they should take in the light of events.(b) It was desirable to prevent the present stoppage from becoming linked with the dispute between the Stevedores&apos; Union andMessrs. Shaw, Savill and Albion.(c) The eventual employment of 20,000 troops in the london docks would severely dislocate the normal movements of the Servicesand would represent the maximum effort which they could make.There were, however, no signs of the stoppage spreading outside london: on Clydeside the dockers had met and passed a resolution in favour of continuing at work.(d) It was proposed that the troops should be employed in thefirst instance in the Royal docks, where 39 ships were idle and onlyone was being worked. The introduction of troops into any group ofdocks would almost certainly have the effect of bringing out on strike any dockers who were still working there; and it would therefore be wise to avoid using troops in any docks where sub-stantial numbers of dockers were still at work.(e) Officials of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union werebusy in the docks area persuading men to return to work and encouraging those who were still at work. It seemed doubtfulwhether any useful results would be achieved by seeking to enlist the full membership of the Union behind the Executive in thismatter, by means of a national delegates&apos; meeting or otherwise, sincethe membership of this Union was drawn from such varied tradesthat it was difficult to develop the corporate sense which could beachieved in a union drawn from a more homogeneous group ofworkers. Ministers thought, however, that the General secretary and other officers of the Union might with advantage take a moreprominent and active part in meetings with the dockers.(/) The dispute arose from the removal from the Union of three members who had taken part in the unofficial dock strike of 1949.The appeals committee drawn from the rank and file of the union had upheld the decision of the Executive.   There could, therefore,-1 b 3
be no further proceedings by way of arbitration on the point at issue.If the situation deteriorated seriously, the Government might atsome later stage appoint a committee to examine the causes of thedispute, and the merits of the dismissals might be discussed in thecourse of any such enquiry; but the Government must hesitate before taking a step which might appear to throw doubt upon the justice of a decision taken under the recognised procedure of theUnion.(g) If the stoppage became more serious, the question would arise whether it was sufficient to leave the organisation of special measures within the Port of London to a committee set up by thePort of London Authority, even if that committee arranged to referall questions of policy to the Government. It would in any event be desirable to suggest to the Port of London Authority that itsspecial committee should not be called the Port Emergency Com-mittee, since that name would suggest that a civil emergency hadbeen declared under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.(h) Attention was drawn to the disquieting frequency ofstoppages in the London docks, which suggested that, quite apartfrom Communist agitation, there were unsatisfactory features inthe present organisation of dock labour in the port. It was saidthat dockers were not clear who was their employer and with whomauthority rested : there seemed to be a considerable element ofambiguity about the respective positions of the Dock Labour Boardand of the employers who used dock labour. Reference was made inthis connection to the enquiry into the organisation and procedure of the National Dock Labour Board on which the Minister of labour had said on 18th July, 1949, that he was engaged (CM. (49) 46thConclusions, Minute 6).The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the employ-ment of troops in the Port of London, starting that day with the employment of 1,000 men in the Royal Docks,(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to suggest to the port of London Authority that their special committee shouldhave a title which did not suggest that an emergency hadbeen declared under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to report on the progress made with the enquiry which he was making into theorganisation and procedure of the National Dock labour board.China. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignGeneral Policy. Secretary (CP. (50) 73) reviewing the course of recent events in(Previous China and indicating the line which he proposed to take, in hisEeference: forthcoming discussions with Mr. Dean Acheson, the United StatesCM. (49) 72nd Secretary of State, on the question of policy towards China.Conclusions, The Minister of State said that the general policy which the minute 3.) Foreign Secretary had been pursuing, with Cabinet approval, hadnot so far evoked any satisfactory response from the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government. Though four months had passed since weformally recognised that Government, they had not yet agreed toan exchange of diplomatic representatives; their general attitudetowards us continued to be unfriendly; and the prospects for british commercial interests in China seemed to be deteriorating. On theother hand, it could not be shown that this weakening of our positionin China was the consequence of our policy of recognising theChinese People&apos;s Government, or that it proved that policy to havebeen wrong. The Foreign Secretary therefore invited the Cabinetto agree that the present policy should be continued and that, in his
forthcoming discussions with Mr. Acheson, he should seek to securethat the United States Government would not follow courses whichwere harmful to our common aim of preventing the permanentalienation of China from the West. He proposed, in particular,that we should seek to persuade the United States Government tomodify their attitude towards China&apos;s representation in the united nations to the extent of signifying to the four Powers represented in the Security Council their willingness to agree that China shouldbe represented in the Council by a delegate appointed by the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government, even though they did not feel able themselvesto! vote in favour of this change. The Foreign Secretary also recom-mended that British firms in China should be told that the UnitedKingdom Government would be unable to give them any financialassistance, but would do what they could to help them in any other way; and that representations should be made to the Chinese Gov-ernment about the position of British economic interests in China.In discussion it was generally agreed that the delay in securing agreement on the exchange of diplomatic representatives was most unsatisfactory. It was recognised that the Chinese Governmentcould find a plausible excuse for this delay in the fact that we hadabstained from voting in favour of their representation in theSecurity Council. It would therefore be advantageous if the UnitedStates Government could be persuaded to modify their present attitude towards this question to the extent necessary to enable theexisting deadlock to be resolved. At the same time some Ministersfelt that the United States Government would find it politicallydifficult to go very far in this direction and that it would be inexperienced-expedient to press them to do so.There was more general support for the view that, over the wholeof this field, the forthcoming discussions with Mr. Acheson should be somewhat tentative and exploratory in character. It would be unwise to press him to proceed with the modification of UnitedStates policy towards China at a faster pace than that which he regarded as acceptable to American opinion. And we should certainly be slow to risk antagonising the United States government over this for the sake of prospects which had never been bright and now seemed to be even less promising-of establishing friendly relations with the Chinese People&apos;s Government.Our relations with the Chinese Government were not likely toimprove unless we could find some means of bringing pressure tobear upon them. There could be no question of threatening to with-draw our recognition from them. Nor had we any grounds for fixing a time-limit for the exchange of diplomatic representatives. But,in the representations which were to be made to them about theposition of British economic interests in China, it should be possibleto take a rather more forceful line. Thus, could it not be represented to them that, if they extinguished our commercial and financial interests in China, we should have no interest in supporting their claims in the United Nations or in seeking to persuade the UnitedStates Government to adopt a more friendly policy towards them ?The Cabinet agreed that it must now be made clear to british firms that they should not expect the United Kingdom Government togive them any financial assistance in order to help them to maintain their establishments in China.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in paragraph 41 of cp. (50) 73 on the understanding that, in his forthcomingtalks with Mr. Acheson, the Foreign Secretary would not press the views of the United Kingdom Government on policy towards China to such an extent as to risk alienatingthe sympathy and support of the United States Govern-ment.
Cnina&apos; 6.   The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theChinese Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of StateCivil Air- (CP. (50) 74) regarding the disposal of the seventy civil aircraftcraft in in Hong Kong which were claimed both by the Chinese PeopledHong Kong.    Government and by United States firms.(Previous This showed that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 6th April,Reference:      further steps had been taken to ascertain the current attitude of the cm.(50) 19th   United States Government towards this question; and it recom-fcConclusions,    mended that, if the results of this approach were unfavourable,Minute 2.)&apos;    tne United Kingdom Government should proceed to obtain an Order-in-Council enabling the courts to determine the legal ownership ofthe aircraft and ensuring their safe custody pending this determina-tion.   This recommendation was supported by a further opinion by the Attorney-General (annexed to CP. (50) 74) in which it was argued, inter alia, that where the law could not take its normal course by reason of a claim to jurisdictional immunity it might be proper for the Executive to intervene.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, since thismemorandum was circulated, the results of the latest approach tothe United States Government had become available in washington telegram No. 1243 of 21st April. This showed that, if these aircraftfell into Communist hands, the United States Government wouldnot feel able to defend the policy which the United Kingdom Govern-ment had followed in respect of them. During recent months theyhad been seeking to persuade American opinion to accept a more realistic policy towards China, and all their work would be destroyedif these aircraft now fell into Communist hands. Moreover, theyhad hoped that in the forthcoming conversations in London theywould be able to concert with the Governments of the United King-dom and France a more vigorous policy towards China and South-East Asia; but they would be unable to do this if the divergence ofBritish and American policies, already marked by differences inrespect of the recognition of the Chinese People&apos;s Government, wasaccentuated by the outcome of the proceedings in respect of these aircraft.In view of the terms of this telegram, and of the furtherOpinion by the Attorney-General annexed to CP. (50) 74, therewas general agreement that steps should be taken to obtain anOrder-in-Council enabling the courts to determine the ownership of these aircraft and ensuring their safe custody pending thisdetermination.In further discussion the following points were made: (a) The United States firm claiming ownership of the aircraft had lodged an appeal against the refusal of the court to grant an injunction against the removal of the aircraft from Hong Kong.This appeal was to be heard on 28th April.(b) The Hong Kong police had received allegations that theUnited States registration of the aircraft had been secured by fraud;and the Governor of Hong Kong had ordered a formal enquiry tobe made into these allegations.(c) It was suggested in CP. (50) 74 that the aircraft should bemaintained in a proper state of repair until the legal question oftheir ownership had been finally determined by the courts. TheCabinet were informed that this would probably involve an initialpayment of  4,750 for essential repairs and thereafter a weeklymaintenance charge of  715. The Chancellor of the Eaichequeiagreed that reasonable costs of repair and maintenance should beborne by the United Kingdom Government.(d) If in the event the courts upheld the Chinese claim to the ownership of the aircraft, the Chinese Government might bring an action for damages in respect of their detention. The cabinet agreed that the Hong Kong Government should not be left to pay any such damages; and that the United States Government could properly be asked to indemnify the United Kingdom government against any damages awarded on this account.
(e) It was contemplated in CP. (50) 74 that the proposed Order-in-Council should do no more than enable the courts to determine the ownership of these aircraft. It would be most unsatisfactory if,after the law had been changed in this way, neither the ChineseGovernment nor the American interests concerned took the initiativeinj bringing this issue before the courts. Might it not, therefore,be, preferable that the Order-in-Council should refer this issue tothe Hong Kong court or, preferably, to the Privy Council? the attorney-General undertook to consider this suggestion though hethought it would be impracticable to refer the issue directly to the privy Council, since evidence on points of fact would be needed andit was preferable that this should be taken in Hong Kong.(/) Since the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, further examinationof the legal position had revealed the existence in Hong Kong ofthe Emergency (Control of Ships and Aircraft) Regulations madeby the Governor in October, 1949. If action to detain these aircraft had had to be taken under existing powers, it would have been more appropriate to proceed under those Regulations than under the air navigation Order. The Cabinet thought it most unsatisfactory thatthe existence of these Regulations had not been brought to noticeat the time of their earlier discussion. They were left with theimpression that, in all the correspondence on this question, the HongKong authorities had shown reluctance to disclose any information which might favour the United States&apos; side in this dispute.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Attorney-General to consider whether theOrder-in-Council proposed in CP. (50) 74 should refer to the courts the question of the legal ownership of these aircraft, or whether it should merely empower the courts to determine that question.(2) Agreed that the United States Government should be askedto indemnify the United Kingdom Government against any damages which might be awarded by the courts inrespect of the detention of these aircraft.(3) Subject to the points noted in Conclusions (1) and (2) above,approved the recommendations in CP. (50) 74.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State (CP. (50)75) setting out the arguments for and against the acceptance in malaya of consular representatives of the Chinese People&apos;s Gov-ernment. The specific recommendation made at the end of thememorandum was that a final decision on this question should be deferred until Ministers were able to assess the results achieved inthe general discussions on policy towards China which the foreign secretary was shortly to have with the United States Secretary ofState.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that, while he supported this recommendation, he hoped that the Cabinet wouldbe able to decide before long that Chinese Communist Consuls shouldnot be accepted in Malaya until the current disorders there hadbeen brought to an end. He also hoped that he would be authorisedto make a statement to that effect when he visited Malaya duringthe following month.In the course of a preliminary discussion there was general support for the view put forward by the Secretary of State for theColonies. The Cabinet were informed, that the military authoritiesin the Far East were strongly opposed to the acceptance of chinese communist Consuls in Malaya. It was also pointed out that accept-ance of these Consuls might prejudice the attempts which were nowbeing made to persuade the Governments of Australia and New
Zealand to give some military help towards the suppression of thecurrent disorders in Malaya. Consideration might perhaps be givento the possibility of requiring the Soviet Government to withdraw their consular representatives from Malaya.the Minister of State said that the Foreign Office were not atpresent urging that consular representatives of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment should be accepted in Malaya. They might, however,feel obliged to press this upon the Cabinet if at a later stage it became clear that refusal of this facility was the only obstacle pre-venting the establishment of full diplomatic relations with theChinese People&apos;s Government.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (50) 75, and agreed to defer a finaldecision on this question until they were able to assess theresults of the general discussions on policy towards Chinawhich the Foreign Secretary was shortly to have withthe United States Secretary of State.cabinet office,S.W. 1,VAth April, 1950.
