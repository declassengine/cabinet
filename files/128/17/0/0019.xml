National 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had reviewed with the health Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Health Ministers the resultsService. of the Cabinefs discussions on 3rd and 4th April on the cost of the(Previous       National Health Service.   They had agreed to recommend to the reference:      Cabinet that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should be authorisedCM. (50) 18th   to say in his Budget statement that it was not possible in existingConclusions.)   circumstances to permit any increase in the expenditure on the health Service, that, any expansion in one part of the Service mustin future be met by economies or, if necessary, by contraction in others, and that in exercising this essential control over totalexpenditure regard would be had to priorities.  The Chancellor ofthe jExchequer would go on to say that he believed the Health(Ministers had the necessary powers, but that, should these prove tobe insufficient, an amending Bill would be introduced.In discussion it was pointed out that in the Cabinet&apos;s discussions on 3rd and 4th April a number of useful suggestions had been madefor reducing the cost of this Service, including suggestions forcurtailing less essential services (e.g., dental treatment for olderpeople) if this were necessary to enable the Service to operate effectively within specified financial limits. Further exploration ofthese suggestions should not be deferred until it appeared that thecost of the Service in 1950-51 was likely to exceed the limit of 392 million; for the public would prefer that a part of the service should be somewhat restricted in scope at an early stage rather thanbe faced with the need for more drastic retrenchments at a later stage.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet Committee which wasto be set up under his chairmanship wpuld examine the various suggestions that had been made in connection with its monthlyscrutiny of expenditure on the National Health Service.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Committee of Ministers should be appointed,under the Prime Minister&apos;s Chairmanship, to keep underreview the cost of the National Health Service.(2) Took note of the statement which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to make in his Budget speech on thefuture course of expenditure on this Service.China.Oninese civil aircraft in hong Kong.(previous reference:CM. (49) 72ndConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary and the Minister of State (CP. (50) 61) on the disposalof seventy civil aircraft in Hong Kong, which were now in thecontrol of agents of the Chinese People&apos;s Government and were claimed both by that Government and by United States firms.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that these aircraft had originally belonged to two Chinese organisations, under thesegis of the Chinese Nationalist Government, which had based theaircraft on Hong Kong. The employees of the Chinese organisationswho serviced the aircraft had gone over to the Communists in theautumn of 1949. and the Chinese Communist Foreign Minister had stated in November that the aircraft belonged to the Chinese PeopkVsGovernment and that His Majesty&apos;s Government bore full responsi-bility for their safety. In December the Chinese Nationalist Govern-ment had signed a contract selling all the assets of the two Chineseorganisations to United States interests, and the United StatesGovernment were pressing that the Hong Kong Government should ensure that the aircraft were not flown away from Hong Kong until their legal ownership was established. The Hong Kong courts had,however, held that as the property was under the control of agents of a sovereign State they had no power to adjudicate on the questionof ownership; and, although an appeal had been lodged against this
decision, they had declined to grant an injunction prohibitingremoval of the aircraft pending the determination of the appeal.Hitherto, the Governor of Hong Kong had contrived to prevent theaircraft being flown away, by refusing access to the airport byChinese pilots and by other devices; but he had been unable toprevent the removal of spare parts and other equipment; It hadbeen suggested that the Governor might use his powers underArticle 60 of the Colonial Air Navigation Order to prevent the air-craft being flown away until the courts had decided whether theChinese or the United States registration of the aircraft was valid.This power was, however, primarily conferred to ensure the safety of aircraft in the air, and the Attorney-General of Hong Kong didnot think that it could properly be used to detain the aircraftpending a decision about their registration. The Governor of HongKong feared that, if their wishes in respect of these aircraft werefurther frustrated, the Chinese People&apos;s Government might fomentinternal disorder in Hong Kong or in the last resort impose a blockade to prevent essential food-stuffs from reaching the Colony.So far, the Governor had taken no overt steps to thwart the ChineseGovernment, though on various pretexts it had been possible toprevent the departure of the aircraft. The use of Article 60 of theColonial Air Navigation Order would, however, be construed as amanifest policy of partiality to the United States interests againstthe Chinese Government; and, apart from the political consequences which might follow, the courts, if they regarded this as an improperuse of the Order, might award substantial damages against theGovernor.The Attorney-General said that, in his view, the main issue for decision was, not a question of law. but the political questionwhether the Governments action should be directed to placatingthe United States Government or the Chinese People&apos;s Government.He had been informed that the State Department had pressed theForeign Office to take all possible steps to prevent the aircraft from falling into Communist hands and he had. approached the matter with this in mind. He believed that the Governor of Hong Kongcould legally take action under Article 60 of the Colonial air navigation Order to prevent the aircraft being flown away untilthe courts had decided which of the two registrations was valid.Admittedly, however, this would be something of a subterfuge,since the primary object of this power was to ensure the safety of&quot;aircraft in the air. Moreover, the use of the Order could onlyafford a period of delay and in the end the Communists might be free to fly the aircraft away. It was open to the Cabinet to decide&apos;that the United States interests must be left to stand on their rights under the existing law, although the Hong Kong courts were likelyto take a sympathetic view of the rights of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment in respect of aircraft in the control of their nationals.If, however, the Cabinet thought that an opportunity should be afforded of determining the legal ownership of the aircraft, it mightbe better for the United Kingdom Government to take the responsi-bility of changing the existing law by an Order-in-Council, madeunder the prerogative, enabling the Hong Kong courts (subject to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council) to determine the question of legal ownership. This Order might take the form of extending to the Colonies a legal provision already applicable inthe United Kingdom that the export of war material could only take place under licence; and, to prevent this being retrospective,it could be phrased as not applying to war material which was shown to be in the possession of a sovereign State before the embargo was imposed. Alternatively, the Order-in-Council mightplace a specific embargo on the removal of the aircraft andspare parts from Hong Kong until their legal ownership was determined. In either form the Order-in-Council would deprive the Chinese people&apos;s Government of the jurisdictional immunity
which at present prevented the Hong Kong courts from deter-aiining the legal ownership of these aircraft. The Cabinet should therefore be reminded that the United Kingdom Government were themselves pleading the same principle of jurisdictional immunityin a current actidn for the; recovery of certain gold whichhad come into their possession: during the war and was nowheld by the Bank of England.   The Order-in-Council would not,. however, in form traverse the issues so far discussed in thej Hong Kong courts : they had been concerned with the question ofijurisdiction, whereas the Order-in-Council would enable them todetermine the question of legal onership.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad expressed concern about the manner in which this question hadbeen handled by the Hong Kong courts. They had expected an injunction to be granted against the removal of the aircraft pendingthe determination of the appeal. Public feeling in the UnitedStates about China was highly charged. Although the AmericansWho were handling this matter in Hong Kong did not seem to havebehaved with discretion, it was clear that, if the impression gainedground in the United States that American interests had not been fairly treated, the effect on Anglo-American relations would be outof proportion to the particular issues here involved. The reponsi-bility for any further measures which had to be taken should not beleft with the Governor of Hong Kong, and the Secretary of State was inclined to favour the making of an Order-in-Council, on the lines indicated by the Attorney-General, which would empower the HongKong courts to determine the legal ownership of the aircraft.Whatever the outcome of the legal proceedings taken thereafter, theUnited States Government could then have no further grievance.It was to be hoped that these proceedings, including any appeal tothe Privy Council, could be taken speedily.The Lord Chancellor regretted that he had not been consultedat an earlier stage on the legal issues involved. The Prime ministers aid that he would look into this point of procedure and considerwhether any further instructions could usefully be issued on it.In further discussion there was general agreement that it wouldbe inexpedient to press the Governor of Hong Kong to use his powers under Article 60 of the Air Navigation Order for the pur-pose of preventing these aircraft from being flown out of the Colony.It was also agreed that, if the existing law were to be amended soas to enable the Hong Kong courts to determine the legal ownership of these aircraft, the responsibility for this amendment of the law should be assumed by the United Kingdom Government and notleft to the Government of Hong Kong. The issue before the cabinet was, therefore, whether they should leave matters to take their course under the existing law or whether they should promote anOrder-in-Council on the lines indicated by the Attorney-General.Discussion showed that opinions.on this issue were divided. Infavour of altering the existing law k was argued that, unless this were done, there would be no means of getting the question of legalownership before the courts; and the United States Governmentand public opinion were unlikely to be satisfied that their nationalshad been fairly treated if no opportunity had been given to arguethis question in the courts. Moreover, as an injunction had been refused, the aircraft might be removed from Hong Kong before thecourts had finally determined, on appeal, even the limited issue which was now before them. It was surprising that the applica-tion for an injunction had been refused; and it would be difficultto convince the United States Government that this refusal was justified. The United States Ambassador in London had been assured in December last that all processes of law up to the privy council would be available to the American interests concerned andthat, in the meantime, the property in dispute was likely to be
protected by virtue of an injunction. Now that the courts had declined to grant the injunction, there could be no guarantee thatthe second part of this assurance would be fulfilled. So far as political considerations were concerned, it was clearly impossibleto placate both the United States Government and the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government. If we amended the law so as to enable thecourts to determine the legal question of ownership, we could hope to satisfy the United States Government that we had done every-thing possible to protect the interests of their nationals. If, on theother hand, we allowed the existing law to remain unchanged, could we rely on gaining any credit for this with the Chinese People &apos;sGovernment? In particular, were that Government likely to refrain from fomenting disorder in Hong Kong out of gratitude forthe policy which we had adopted in respect of these aircraft? was it not much more likely that they would begin to stir up this troublewhen it suited them, for their own reasons, to make a hostile moveagainst Hong Kong-irrespective of any action which we might take meanwhile ? The point was also made that an awkward situa-tion would arise if, on the present legal action, the Privy Councilultimately found in favour of the American interests and theaircraft had in the meantime been removed from Hong Kong byagents of the Chinese People&apos;s Government.On the other hand, some Ministers found it repugnant thatBritish law should be, altered to suit the convenience of american interests. Even though the Order-in-Council Were so phrased asto avoid the. appearance of having retrospective effect, the fact remained that it would have been designed to&apos;alter the existing lawfor the purpose of enabling the courts to deal with a situation whichhad already arisen. And its effect would be to oust the principle ofjurisdictional immunity on which we ourselves were relying in another current action. The adoption of this course was likely togive the impression that the United Kingdom Government no longerrespected the rule of law and were prepared to make it subject to political expediency. This would involve a grave breach with long-established British tradition. In Colonial territories and through-out Asia it was likely to be construed to mean that the UnitedKingdom Government could no longer be relied upon to support the rule of law and would not scruple to disregard it when it suitedthem to secure that the interests of white peoples, or even UnitedStates imperialist interests, prevailed over those of Asiatics. Itwas also argued that such a policy would be inconsistent with thedecision of the United Kingdom Government to maintain their position in Hong Kong so that it might serve as a bridge between thenew China and the Western world. If the existing law were amended for the purpose of meeting the convenience of UnitedStates interests in this case, the Chinese People&apos;s Government wouldbe bound to regard our continued presence in Hong Kong as a directthreat to them.It was also pointed out in the discussion that the defence con-siderations involved in this decision were nicely balanced. On theone hand, if these aircraft were flown to China, they might be usedto assist the Communists in Indo-China and might there help to tiltthe balance against the democratic Powers. Moreover, the adoptionof a policy distasteful to the United States Government might havea disturbing effect on Anglo-American relations in matters ofdefence generally. On the other hand, action which was construedby the Chinese People&apos;s Government as hostile to them might increasethe risk of internal disorder in Hong Kong, which was alreadyserious, and might postpone the time when British troops could be withdrawn from there to build up the strategic reserve which was urgently required to deal with potential difficulties in other areas.At the worst, it might even become necessary to strengthen our Forcesin Hong Kong; and this could probably be done only by reducing our military strength in Malaya
The Foreign Secretary suggested that, having regard to the division of opinion in the Cabinet, further discussion should be deferred for two or three weeks, during which he would see what further consultations could be held with the United States Govern-ment through the diplomatic channel.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to defer a decision on this question for two or threeWeeks, so that the Foreign Secretary might consider what further consultations could be held with the UnitedJ       States Government.(2) Invited the Secretary^ State for the Colonies to instruct3. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a Question, for answer that morning in the House of Commons, asking the President of theBoard of Trade whether he had yet issued a direction requiring acinema circuit to show on specified dates the film &quot; The Chance of aLifetime.&quot;The Minister of Labour said that his advisers took the view thatthis film would be regarded as propaganda for Communism and for workers&apos; control in industry; and it seemed doubtful whether it wasexpedient that the Government should require an exhibitor toshow it.i i The President of the Board of Trade said that he had already announced, in reply to an earlier Question, that he intended to give such a direction under section 5 (2) of the Cinematograph Films Act,1948. His decision to do so was taken on advice tendered by anindependent Selection Committee who, by the provisions of the Act,had to be satisfied that the film was suitable for exhibition as aBritish &quot; first feature &quot; film by reason of its entertainment value.The Selection Committee having satisfied themselves on this point,it would be wrong for him to withhold the direction on political grounds which had no relevance to the considerations to which theAct required him to have regard. In any event he did not share the view of the film which was taken by the officials of the Ministryof Labour; nor was that view endorsed by prominent persons con-nected with tfie employers&apos; side of industry who had seen the film.In further discussion the question was raised whether political difficulties were not likely to arise from this power enabling a minister to compel the exhibition of a particular film.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the President of the Board of Trade should go forward with the direction which he proposed to give to the Odeon Cinema Circuit requiring them to exhibitthe film &quot; The Chance of a Lifetime.&quot;(2) Invited the Lord Presidents Committee to consider whether any political difficulties were likely to arise in futurefrom the exercise of the powers conferred by section 5 (2)of the Cinematograph Films Act, 1948.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 51) on the future of the British Council in russian satellite countries. This recommended that, notwithstand-ing the Hungarian Government&apos;s request for the withdrawal of theBritish Council and the hostile attitude adopted towards the council by the Czechoslovak authorities, His Majesty&apos;s Government should
not take the initiative in withdrawing the British Council from czechoslovakia, Poland and Bulgaria, but should allow the Councilto continue to operate in these countries until the Governments con-cerned asked for its withdrawal. Meanwhile, however, His Majesty&apos;;Ambassador at Prague should be instructed to address a note to the czechoslovak Government rehearsing the reasons why His Majesty\Government felt anxiety about the Council&apos;s future in Czecho-slovakia and asking the Czechoslovak Government to clarify theirattitude. The memorandum also recommended that the british council should be informed that members of their staff who marriednationals of Russian satellite countries would not in future beallowed to serve in any post in another Russian satellite country, andthat they would be allowed to serve in other foreign countries onlyaf ter reference to the Foreign Office.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in paragraphs 2 and 11 of cp. (50) 51.Food.PointsRationing.(previous reference:CM. (50) 15thConclusions,Minnte 5.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 59) recommending that the points rationing scheme should be terminated from 23rd April.The Minister of Food said that during the past two yearsincreased supplies had made it possible greatly to reduce the numberof commodities covered by the points rationing scheme. Stocks ofcertain of the remaining commodities, such as canned milk and meat,were now accumulating in the shops and there was no case for con-tinuing to ration them. If, however, these commodities were removed from the scheme, he did not consider that it would be practicable tomaintain the present elaborate administrative apparatus in orderto control the distribution of the few commodities that would thenremain within the scheme. He did not think that the discontinuance of the scheme would have any serious consequences; for within a fewmonths there should be a marked improvement in the supply ofcertain of these foods, such as syrup, biscuits and jellies, and themain difficulties would arise over the derationing of those few eom-modities, such as canned fish, and dried and canned fruit, whichwere likely to remain scarce for some time to come. He believed thatthe scheme had now become a source of irritation to housewives,and he was satisfied that its retention for a very limited range ofgoods would bring the whole conception of points rationing into disrepute. So long as certain foods remained scarce, fair distribu-tion would be secured by price control and the Unit Voucher System.His proposal involved some risks, but he thought they were less serious than those which would result from retaining the scheme.In discussion, the following further arguments were put for-ward in favour of discontinuing the points rationing scheme : (a) If the scheme were discontinued, the staff of the Ministry ofFood could be reduced by over 1,000. In addition, wholesalers and retailers would be relieved of much unproductive clerical work.(b) Reliance on the Unit Voucher System for securing a fairdistribution of scarce foods doubtless involved some risk that thesefoods would be shared out by &quot; retailer&apos;s favour.&quot; But, even while they remained on points, scarce foods were already being handled inthis way and there were no means by which the points scheme couldbe adjusted to avoid this.(c) The removal of further commodities from the scheme wouldmean that the monthly issue of points would have to be reduced from24 to 16. In view of the high point-value of the foods remainingwithin the scheme, the consumer would not be able to buy more thaione tin of some &quot; pointed &quot; goods in a month.
(d) Experience in administering the clothes rationing scheme had shown that it was impracticable to maintain a points rationing scheme when only one or two of the articles covered by the schemecontinued to be scarce.(e) The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of theExchequer would not be able to sanction the expenditure of dollars for the purchase of sugar suggested in paragraph 10 of CP. (50) 59.The Minister of Food said that this did not affect his recommenda-tion; in any event, he thought it would be possible to find the amount required from non-dollar sources.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussiom of CP. (50) 59 at a subsequent meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,6th April, 1950.
