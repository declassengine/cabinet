Equal Pay. 1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Labour (CP, (50) 117) regarding the line to be taken by reference: the United Kingdom Government delegates in the forthcomingCM. (47) 51st discussions on equal pay at the Thirty-third Session of the Inter-Conclusions, national Labour Conference.Minute 5.) jne prime Minister said that it was unfortunate that this questionDiscussion at should have been brought before the Cabinet at short notice duringInternational the Whitsun Recess.  It had, he understood, been under considera-Labour tion by a working party of officials since the beginning of April; andConference. it should therefore have been possible to bring it to Ministers before1950, the holiday, when it could have been considered by a full Cabinet.The Minister of Labour expressed his regret for the delay whichhad occurred, but hoped that his colleagues would be able to approve the proposals outlined in his memorandum. The draft conclusionsprepared by the International Labour Office as a basis for discussion at the forthcoming Conference were clearly unsatisfactory: theyembodied a definition of equal pay by reference to &quot; job content&quot;which would be inappropriate as a basis for international regulations,and they would impose on the Government obligations inconsistent with the general system of determining wages and salaries in thiscountry. The United Kingdom Government delegates must thereforeoppose these draft conclusions. They should not, however, adopt a purely negative attitude; for that would provoke trouble with thewomen&apos;s organisations and other sections of public opinion in thiscountry and would also be regarded as a retreat from the positiontaken up by the Government since the statement of 11th June, 1947,on the report of the Royal Commission on Equal Pay, when theGovernment accepted the general principle that no difference shouldbe made in respect of sex in payment for the same work. Moreover,if the cause of equal pay were seen to be making no progress in theInternational Labour Conference, its advocates would raise the issue in the Economic and Social Council and other agencies of the united nations, where it would be exploited for purposes of political propa-ganda by the World Federation of Trade Unions. It was preferable that this question should continue to be handled in the InternationalLabour Conference, where it could continue to be discussed in a social and industrial, rather than a political, context. The Minister there-fore recommended that the United Kingdom Government delegates- should take the positive line of guiding discussion at the Conferencetowards establishing the principle that difference of sex should notbe taken into account in the determination of wages and salaries.This approach might lead the Conference to adopt conclusions on thefollowing lines:  (i) Remuneration should be regarded as including all the benefits and advantages, whether in cash or kind, accruing to the worker inreturn for work done.(ii) Measures should be taken to promote the establishment ofrates of remuneration without discrimination based on sex-these measures being consistent with the procedures in force in the country concerned for fixing rates of remuneration.(iii) Action should be taken as soon as practicable, after consul-tation with the workers&apos; organisations concerned, to ensure to all government employees rates of remuneration determined in accord-ance with the principle set out in (ii) above. (.(iv) Action should be taken to bring these provisions to the noticeof all authorities responsible for settling rates of remuneration and of.the employers&apos; and workers&apos; organisations concerned.The Minister added that it would also be his aim to secure that conclusions on these lines were put forward in the form of a Recom-mendation rather than a Convention. For it was open to Govern-ments to attach reservations to their acceptance of recommendations by the International Labour Conference; and the United Kingdom
Government might find it convenient to accept in principle a recommendation on the lines indicated while entering a reservationon particular details and on the date by which they expected to beable to implement it in full. ...In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of State supported the view that international discussion of this question should continue to be handled through theInternational Labour Conference; and he endorsed the argument that the United Kingdom Government should take a positive line inthe forthcoming discussions, in order to reduce the risk that thisquestion would be raised in the United Nations, where it was more likely to be exploited for purposes of political propaganda.(b) Serious misgivings were felt about the suggestion that theConference might recommend that the principle of equal pay shouldbe applied &quot; as soon as practicable&quot; in Government service. a recommendation in those terms would certainly sharpen the demandfor the immediate introduction of equal pay for government employees in this country. And the limiting words &quot; as soon aspracticable&quot; would be construed as relating only to the practicaldifficulties of completing the detailed arrangements for giving effectto the principle. It was important that it should be made explicitlyclear, in any Recommendation, that the limiting factors also included the development of social policy and the economic and financial circumstances of the country. The United Kingdom government delegates should make this plain in the course of the discussions, andshould ensure that this language (which had been used in the&apos;state-ment of 11th June. 1947, by the then Chancellor of the Exchequer)was adopted in any conclusion which the Conference might reach onthe lines indicated in paragraph 8 (3) of CP. (50) 117.(c) While our delegates might follow the positive line recom-mended in CP. (50) 117, it should be their general objective to delayfor as long as possible the date on which the International LabourConference would submit positive Recommendations to Govern-ments on this subject. In the replies which Governments had returnedto the questionnaire issued by the International Labour Office therewould doubtless be numerous illustrations of the practical difficultiesof applying the principle of equal pay, and it might be possible to base on these an argument that a further opportunity should be givenfor the elucidation of these difficulties, possibly at a preliminary conference to be held in a year&apos;s time. It might also be possible todevelop the argument that the Conference had not yet before itsufficient information on which to base firm Recommendations.(d) Emphasis might also be laid, in the discussions, on the need to consider the principle of equal pay against the background of social policy. Economic conditions should not be the sole criterion for deciding when the principle could properly be implemented in any country. It was unrealistic to discuss equal pay without taking intoaccount family allowances and other social services. The conference should therefore be encouraged to discuss this question against the widest possible background of social policy as well as economic andfinancial conditions.(e) The practical difficulties of applying the principle should alsobe kept in mind. Thus, it was suggested that the introduction of equal pay for teachers might eventually produce a situation in whichalmost all teachers in elementary schools were women.(0 The heavy cost of implementing the principle might also bestressed. It was estimated that in the United Kingdom the additional cost of introducing equal pay in the Civil Service, local government service, the National Health Service and the teaching professionwould be about  35 million. Was it wise to contemplate this heavyaddition to Government expenditure at a time when many countriesin Europe were threatened with inflation?
r r 64The Minister of Labour said that he might have an opportunityfor making some general reflections of this character in the speech which he would be making at the Conference on the submission ofthe annual report by the Director of the International Labour Office-.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in paragraph 14 ofC.P- (50) 117, subject to amendment on the point noted inparagraph (b) above; but invited the Minister of labour to instruct the United Kingdom Government delegates tokeep in mind, in the forthcoming discussions at the Inter-national Labour Conference, the general points noted inparagraphs (c)-(f) above.Industrial 2.  The Minister of Labour said that the unofficial strike of disputes, lightermen in the London docks had been brought to an end. ThisLondon Dock had arisen from the action of the London Dock Labour Board instrike, dismissing 91 lightermen for taking part in an unofficial strike. The(Previous Board had decided, as a matter of general policy, to impose penaltiesReference: on men taking part in unofficial strikes; but it was unfortunate thatCM. (50) 27th their first application of this new policy had been against lightermen,Conclusions, wnO had borne little of the responsibility for the recent unrest in the minute!.)&apos;    London docks.Festival There was also an unofficial strike among building workers on of Britain. the site of the Festival of Britain buildings in London. There was some reason to believe that Communists were trying to stir up troubleamong these workers with the object of delaying the completion of the festival buildings. Steps had, however, been taken to prevent theextension of this particular dispute.The Prime Minister said that, in general, there seemed to be signsof restlessness in industrial relations throughout the country. Thiscalled for special vigilance on the part of the Ministry of Labour.The Cabinet-Took note of the position.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th June, 1950.9
