The Minister of Defence said that proposals recently submitted(i previous for increases jn the rates of pay for the Forces Medical Services hadbeen rejected by the Treasury on the ground that they wereinconsistent with the accepted policy of stabilising incomes.Experience had shown, however, that the existing rates wereinsufficiently attractive tp ensure an adequate flow of recruitmentin competition with the National Health Service and, unlessreasonable increase^ were granted, there, might well be a serious deterioration in the standard of -these Services. Recruitment for theArmy and the Royal Air Force in particular gave cause for graveanxiety: in 1949, for instance, it had been possible to fill only44 out of 368 vacancies for short-term or permanent medical officersrequired for the Army; and the comparable figures for the RoyalAir Force were 48 out,qf 551. In consequence, the proportion ofNational Service doctors was far too high for efficiency or economy,and there was a serious and growing shortage of specialists. Everyeffort had been made to overcome these difficulties by close inter-Service co-operation and by the integration of Service and civilianmedical and dental services, but such measures could afford only temporary and partial relief. The problem was particularly acutein the overseas Commands, and there had already been considerable criticism of the lack of specialist services in Malaya.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he understood thatthere was at present no shortage of general duty doctors in theServices. Under present circumstances, however, there was atendency for prospective students to undergo their military training before entering the Medical Schools, and this reduced the numberof National Service doctors available for the Forces. But this wasa temporary problem which would be gradually resolved as thenumber of ex-Service students diminished. Nor did he think thatthe shortage, of specialists was as serious as had been suggested:he understood that the Army had recently endeavoured to secure28 and had obtained 16. In his view, the difficulties encounteredby the Services in recruiting specialists were also temporary, and anadequate supply of candidates should be forthcoming once the specialist branch of the National Health Service had been estab-lished. CP. (50) 5 implied that the rates of remuneration for medical and dental officers in the Forces were less favourable thanthose provided by the National Health Service: his informationshowed, however, that for the ordinary doctor the average level of remuneration in the Forces was in fact higher than it was in theNational Health Service, In the circumstances he considered thatthere was no case for the proposed increases.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet could not reach any conclusions in the absence of an agreed statement of facts. Thewhole question should be further considered by the Treasury, theMinistry of Defence and the Ministry of Health.In further discussion, the following points were made: (a) The Minister of Health said that he thought that the diffi-culties at present encountered by the Services in recruiting doctors and dentists would gradually disappear as the demands of theNational Health Service lessened.   But, in his view, a permanent38224-2 b cabinet \.. The Prime Minister said that, he,&apos; had it in, mind that, ifBusiness.       business arose in the next few weeks which required the attentionof the Cabinet, meetings, should, so far as possible, be held onTuesdays.
solution should be sought through the gradual development ofarrangements for integrating the Forces&apos; medical services with thecivil medical services. The provision of adequate medical and dental staff for the Forces overseas was, no doubt, a special prob-lem, but he hoped that it would in due course be recognised that aperiod of service abroad would provide the National Health Servicedoctor with Valuable clinical experience. With the same object, hehad already discussed with the Secretary of State for the colonies the possibility of arranging for temporary exchanges of staffbetween the National Health Service and the Colonial medical service.(&amp;) If increased rates of pay were granted to doctors and dentists in the Forces, it would be necessary to review the rates of remuneration payable under the school medical and dental services.(c) The Minister of Pensions said that there were seriousdiscrepancies between the rates of pay for Ministry of Pensionsdoctors and those approved for the &quot;National Health Service, andthese anomalies would have to be resolved at some stage. TheCabinet were informed that this matter was under separate consideration.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Defence to reconsider the proposals put forward inC;P. (50) 5 in the light of their discussion.LocalGovernmentMan-power.(&quot;PreviousBefereD.ce:CM. (49) 65thConclusions,Minute 4.)3.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda-(i) by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP.  (49) 252), covering the first report of the Local Government Man-power Committee on the simplification of various formsof control by Government Departments over localauthorities; and(ii) by the Minister of Heath (CP. (50) 4) on the steps to betaken to implement the recommendations in the report and to secure consequential economies of man-power in local government.The Minister of Health said that the object of the recom-mendations in the report was to eliminate unnecessary detailedsupervision by Government Departments over the affairs of localauthorities. Too meticulous a control of local authorities madethese authorities irresponsible and careless, and led to swollenstaffs. Effective control over capital investment by local authorities would be preserved by an annual review of their programmes.When the report was published, he proposed to meet representativesof the local authority associations at an early date. He had pro-posed to hold a Press conference to explain the significance of theproposals in the report, but he feared that at the present time theGovernments policy might be misrepresented in certain quarters.It would be essential to press the local authorities hard to securethe economies in staff which the proposed simplification of procedurerendered possible.There was general approval of the recommendations of theLocal Government Man-Power Committee. In detailed discussionreference was made to the following points : (a) In the field of planning, the oversight which the countyplanning authority would exercise over the planning work of thecounty district councils might at first cause a certain amount of friction requiring the intervention of the Minister of Town and country Planning. The alteration in planning responsibilities would require the laying of fresh regulations before Parliament.
As pointed out by the Committee, planning schemes would have tobe submitted to the Ministry of Town and Country Planning forapproval and the matter could not be left entirely to annual reviews of investment, since these schemes involved far-reaching proposals and some of the. measures taken under the schemes would attract a90 per cent. Government grant for the first few years.(b) In the field of education and elsewhere, the greaterresponsibility placed on local authorities should be followed by acertain amount of rearrangement of work between local government officials. Thus, it would be necessary in many cases to reach a moreclear-cut division of functions between the Clerk of the authority and the Director of Education.(c) The Ministry of Works would regard the grant of a loansanction by a Government Department as making it unnecessaryfor the local authority to obtain a formal sanction for buildingschemes costing more than  500, but the Ministry would have toretain control over the starting-date of local authority building.(d) When the report was published a Press conference wouldbe useful to ensure that the scope and purpose of the proposals wereproperly understood. In present circumstances this press conference might conveniently be treated as a technical matter to be handled by the Ministry of Health at the official level.(e) Corresponding recommendations from a Scottish Committeewere not likely to be available for at least six months, but the recom-mendations would be on similar lines to those in the present report.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations in the first report of theLocal Government Man-Power Committee annexed to cp. (49) 252, subject to further consideration of theproposals involving legislation; and authorised the&quot;publication of the report as a Command Paper or aStationery Office publication.(2) Invited the Minister of Health to consider whether heshould arrange for the holding of a Press conference atthe official level for the elucidation of the report.(3) Agreed that, the Minister of Health, with the other ministers concerned, should meet representatives of the- local authority associations at an early date, with a viewto agreeing upon the procedure for bringing the recom-mendations in the report into operation and securing that the consequential man-power economies were affected.Tomatoes andCucumbersMarketingSchema.4. The Cabinet considered the following memoranda on adraft Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme : CP. (50) 2: by the President of the Board of Trade,reporting on the failure of the Official Committee on Eestric-tive Practices by Supervisory Boards to reach agreement on certain restrictive aspects of the draft scheme and on the points which the Lord Presidents Committee had remitted forconsideration by the Cabinet;CP. (50) 3 : by the Minister of Agriculture, recommending that the drafts scheme should be approved in the form in whichit had been put to the Official Committee;CP. (50) 7; by the Minister of Food, recommending thatthe promoters of the draft scheme should be informed that theGovernment were unable to approve the restrictive powerssought in respect of the control of distribution and the fixing,of prices.The Minister of Agriculture said that orderly agricultural marketing had always been an essential feature of the policy ofLabour Governments.  There had been no abuses in the Operation
of schemes under the Act of 1931, and the Act of 1949 clearlyenvisaged schemes with restrictive powers. The present draft scheme had originally, been put forward in April 1948, and hadbeen amended after a long and careful enquiry. Schemes were required for horticulture which did not enjoy the benefits of guaranteed prices; and assured markets under the Agriculture Act,1947. Only by such schemes could efficiency in  he horticulturalindustries be raised and the quality of the product improved for thebenefit of the community.The Minister of Foodsaid that he had no objection to a schemewhich dealt with the grading and improved marketing of tomatoes,but he thought it was undesirable that a Tomatoes and CucumbersBoard should have the power to regulate distributors and fix prices.The original conception of marketing schemes had been sound; but,in his view, abuses had developed before the war. In presentcircumstances, when tomato-growing was very profitable, there wasno ground for devising a scheme conferring restrictive powers on theindustry, although a scheme might be required at some later period when conditions were less favourable to the producers. TheCo-operative Wholesale Society were opposed to the restrictivefeatures of the scheme.The President of the Board of Trade said that there was a conflict between the instructions which had been given in 1947 to the interdepartmental Committee on Restrictive Practices by Super-visory Boards and the provisions of the Agricultural MarketingActs, which listed a number of restrictive powers which were regarded as appropriate for Marketing Boards to exercise. It was true that the Act of 1949 had given wide supervisory functions tothe Ministers responsible for agriculture, but this might not be enough for the protection of the consumer. As a compromise between the opposing views of the Ministers of Agriculture and food, he suggested that there should be special machinery for a close and continuous supervision of the operations of any Tomatoesand Cucumbers Marketing Board by the Ministries of Agricultureand Food and the Board of Trade, possibly coupled with arrange-ments for an interdepartmental review of the whole scheme after it had been in operation for three years. Alternatively, the draft scheme might be approved on the basis that it should contain no powers for the Board to fix prices.In subsequent discussion the following points were made (a) The Agricultural Marketing Act, 1931, had been passedbecause the distributors of agricultural produce were then more powerful than the producers and had been able to force prices downto levels which undermined the whole economy of the agricultural industry. The intention had been that prices should rise and theyhad in fact risen. The Acts had placed the production of milk,potatoes and bacon on a sounder basis, though no doubt in the later stages of the schemes some monopoly features and restrictions on production had appeared. When the Agricultural Marketing Act,1949, was passed there were unresolved difficulties about the extentto which public boards might adopt restrictive practices whichwould be frowned upon in private industry and the compromiseagreed upon had been to make it possible to grant restrictive powersto public boards, but to set up an official committee to examineschemes at the draft stage and to give to the Minister of Agriculturewide powers of control over the exercise of restrictive powers by aboard. Moreover, some of the members of boards were to be chosenas representing the interests of the consumer.(6) The production of tomatoes had been profitable in the lasttwo years and it was arguable that there was no case for a schemegranting restrictive powers in respect of this industry. Tomato-growing in present circumstances was in an entirely differentposition from that of milk-production in the early 30&apos;s.   It would
therefore be possible to reject the grant of restrictive powers to aTomatoes Board, while preserving the position that these powers under the Act of 1949 might be granted to some other branch of the horticultural industry (say, the growing of lettuces or cabbages)where the producer was to a greater extent at the mercy of thedistributors. The general view was, however, that it would be undesirable to base a decision on the tomatoes scheme on veryrecent experience. The prices of tomatoes might fall or there mightbe over-production; and a scheme could therefore be justified in thelong-term interests of the industry.(c) The draft scheme should pay greater regard to the interestsof consumers. In present circumstances the production and distri-bution of tomatoes was a profitable business, but the consumer didnot appear to secure his full share of the benefits of large-scale production. Even in periods of glut at the height of the season,prices outside central London did not fall to the full extent thatmight be expected, and this was due to the rigidity of the distribu-tive system. It was therefore desirable that the Minister of Food, inthe interests of the consumer, should be able to intervene in anyfixing of producers&apos; prices or margins by the Marketing Board.The Minister of Food would, in any event, possess (under emergency legislation) concurrent powers with the Board, though he had not found it necessary or desirable to fix tomato prices recently. Inorder to avoid any open conflict between the. Board and the Ministerof Food, the scheme should require the Marketing Board to giveprior notification of any proposals for price-fixing to the Ministerof Food and to the Minister of Agriculture, and should enable aright of veto to be exercised in respect of the proposals. It was desirable that the Board should possess the power of price-fixing,but the power should be subject to this additional check in theinterests of the consumer.(d) The power of the Board as respects wholesalers andcommission salesmen should not be expressed in a form which wouldenable the Board to compile a list of distributors to whom aloneproducers could sell their goods. Anyone should be entitled to be registered as a distributor and there should be no statutory powerof exclusion from the register, save on grounds of misbehaviour.(e) The scheme should not contain any provision which would suggest that the Board might in any circumstances regulate shop-keepers who sold tomatoes in the ordinary course of business. Itwas true that under the draft scheme the exercise of this power was subject to the consent of the Minister, but the mere existence of thepower would lead to criticism.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Minister of Agriculture might approve adraft Tomatoes and Cucumbers Marketing Scheme onthe lines of the draft scheme described in CP. (50) 2,provided that it was amended in the respects noted inparagraphs (c), (d) and (e) above.(2) Agreed that the President of the Board of Trade should raise on the Lord Presidents Committee the questionwhether, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions on thetomatoes scheme, the instructions to the official committee which examined draft marketing schemes should be revised.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th January, 1950.
