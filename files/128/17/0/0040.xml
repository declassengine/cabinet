Iron and steel act.(previous reference :CM. (50) 36thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theMinister of Supply (CP. (50) 140) on the bringing into operation ofthe Iron and Steel Act, 1949.After a general discussion, the Cabinet Agreed that the bringing into operation of the Iron and steel act, 1949, should not be further postponed; and invited theMinister of Supply to proceed accordingly.Parliament. -2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the   the House of Commons in the following week.House of Wednesday, 5th July, would be a Supply Day; and the Opposi-Commons. tion leaders had indicated that they were&apos;willing that this should betaken for a debate on the situation in South Korea, if it appeared thatthere was a general desire in the House of Commons that such a debate should be held. While the Cabinet were meeting, informa-tion was received that Mr. S. S. Silverman, M.P., was proposing tomove the Adjournment that afternoon for the purpose of discussing the use of British forces in the Korean operations; and that, unlessthe Government had already fixed an early date for such a debate,the Speaker would be bound to accept the Motion if forty Membersrose in support of it. The Cabinet, while they would have preferred to await developments before fixing a definite date for this debate,thought it important that the Government, rather than a private member, should take the initiative in arranging for parliamentary discussion of the situation; and they therefore invited the lord president to ascertain whether the offer made by the Opposition still held good, and, if so, to announce, in his Statement on Business that afternoon, that a debate on the Korean situation would be held on 5th July.Whaling Base 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theon Deception Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (50) 139) regarding a proposalisland. by United Whalers and the Colonial Development Corporation to re-(Previous establish a whaling base on Deception Island. The re-establishmentReference: of this base would be of political importance in strengthening the cm. (48) 53rd British case against Argentine claims in the Antarctic. The base would conclusions, not, however, be established unless the Government contracted to buyMinute8.) the whale oil over a period of years; and the Ministry of Food con-sidered that they would not be justified, on purely commercialgrounds, in making a long-term contract on the terms so far suggested.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this memorandumraised no question of principle which need be considered by theCabinet. The Treasury could deal with the matter if it were sub-mitted to them by the two Departments concerned.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minis-ter of Food to arrange for their Departments to discuss withthe Treasury the proposal made in CP. (50) 139.Electors Lists. 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (50) 141) andby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (50) 142) on the questionwhether a change should be made in the procedure for preparing a register of Electors for inspection by the public.The Home Secretary explained that the present method was topresent the provisional Register in three parts, viz., the old Register,a list of newly-qualified electors and a list of those no longer qualified.The Advisory Electoral Conference had recommended that this rather39002-2 B 2
complicated arrangement should be abandoned in favour of a singledraft list, since this v ould make it easier for members of the public to ascertain whether L&apos; ;ir names were on the Register. The change would also make it easier for Ministers to explain how a member ofthe public could verify that his name was on the Register, and would reduce the number of people who had a sense of grievance on findingon polling day that their names were not on the list. The estimatedcost of the printing of a single draft list was between  150,000 and 200,000, which was admittedly very high.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in his view, theadvantages of making this change were not sufficient to warrant theheavy cost involved. He thought that the obstacles which the presentsystem presented to the man who wished to find out whether his namewas on the electors&apos; list had been exaggerated. Very few members ofthe public took the trouble of consulting the draft lists, and an indi-vidual who was sufficiently interested to go to the office where thedraft lists were displayed was unlikely to be deterred by the fact thathe had to consult two lists. The estimate of cost which the stationery office had made, after reference to the British Federation of MasterPrinters, was very high: at  200,000 it represented about 2d. pername. In view of the need for economy he did not feel that this expenditure could be justified.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was important that the Register should be as accurate aspossible, but the present proposal would go only a limited way in securing greater accuracy. Simplification of the procedure might encourage a few more individuals to ascertain whether their nameswere on the list, but the great majority of voters would take no interestin the matter until polling day.(b) The Stationery Office had explained that the high cost of theproposal was due to the fact that the pages of the Register would haveto be handled twice by compositors. Even so, Ministers found itdifficult to understand why the cost should be so great.The Cabinet Agreed that, because of the cost involved, the change in themethod of preparing electors&apos; lists proposed in CP. (50) 142should not be made.Industrial 5.   The Home Secretary explained that negotiations had beenDisputes. proceeding, -trough the Joint Industrial Council machinery, betweenStrike of the Meat Transport Organisation, Ltd., and the Transport andSmithfield General Workers&apos; Union on an application for an increase of 19s. perDrivers week in the basic wage of meat transport drivers.   The employers(Previous        offered to increase the weekly basic wage of the lower-paid workersReference:      by Ss. and of the higher-paid drivers by 4s., but the men refused thisCM. (50) 35th   offer and decide&quot; 1 to strike, against the advice of the Union, v/hichConclusions,     had suggested further discussions on the Joint Industrial Council.Minute 2.)       The strike began at midnight on 23rd June.  In order to prevent acomplete breakdown in the supply of meat in London, the Emer-gencies Committee had arranged for Service vehicles and crews to distribute canned corned meat from buffer depots to the retailbutchers, and this would secure a minimum domestic ration of Is. anda ration of is. 6d. in certain areas of London.   The emergencies committee now recommended that until 1st July Service operations should be confined to the transport of canned corned meat.  they proposed, however, that arrangements should be made for additionalService vehicles and men to be available on 3rd July, and for theServices to begin then to move chilled carcase meat from cold storesto Smithfield Market for one week.  Authority was also desired to employ additional Service labour for the purpose of moving meat from the dock area into cold store, as the supplies in cold storediminished.   These additional measures might have the result of extending the strike to workers in cold stores and in Smithfield
. 13499 CM. 40 (50)Market and to dockers unloading meat ships, but this possibility would have to be faced. The Port Workers&apos; Committee, an unofficialbody, which had organised the recent strikes in the London docks,had advised the meat transport drivers not to return to work,although the dispute in no way directly concerned the docks, and they appeared to be actively engaged in endeavouring to secure anextension of the dispute.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Those responsible for organising the present stoppage were moved by political motives rather than industrial grievances. the meat transport drivers had secured a substantial increase in wages in September last; and, although further applications might have beenheld back because of the wages policy of the Trades Union Congress,the men had no sufficient reason for coming out on strike instead of allowing the application for a wages increase and for maintaining thewages differential to be discussed through the duly-constitutednegotiating machinery. As the inconvenience caused by the strikewas brought home to the public, there would be widespread resent-ment at the selfishness of the strikers. The actual earnings of meattransport drivers were far in excess of the minimum rates and weresaid to amount to  10 a week for the drivers of heavy lorries and  8 aweek for the others.(b) The dispute could not be taken to arbitration under theConditions of Employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940,because neither the employers nor the Union had asked that the dis-pute should be taken to arbitration and the Minister could not besatisfied that the resources of the ordinary negotiating machinery hadbeen exhausted. It was suggested that there ought on such occasionsto be some means of ensuring reference to arbitration: but on theother side it was pointed out that this would undermine the authorityof the Trade Union and imply recognition of those who had organisedan unofficial strike. On the present occasion this would be speciallyunfortunate if the Tribunal were to make an award which was inexcess of the employers1 offer or made it impossible to apply theconditions regarding restrictive practices which would be a valuablefeature of the settlement which the employers were endeavouring toreach.(c) There might be some public complaint about the small size of the meat ration in many parts of London in the present week, andthe high proportion of canned corned meat which would have to beaccepted. If Service vehicles were employed in the following week onthe removal of chilled carcase meat from cold stores to Smithfield, alarger ration could be given in that week.(d) The proposals put forward by the Emergencies Committeeinvolved the employment of 1,000 vehicles and 5,000 men. This would interfere with Service training and would place a heavy strain on theServices at a time when the Territorial Army camps were starting.The Services viewed with some disquiet the repeated demands whichwere being made upon them in connection with strikes; and therewas some risk that ill-will might be created between Servicemen andstrikers.(e) On general grounds, it was undesirable that workers em-ployed at Smithfield Market should be in a position, by striking orthreatening a strike, to paralyse the supply of meat in the london area. On economic grounds the Ministry of Food favoured the con-tinuance of Smithfield Market, which was well sited for its purpose.It might, however, be useful if the Emergencies Committee were toconsider whether the strikers were likely to be influenced by a public announcement that a continuance of trouble in Smithfield market would make it necessary for the Government to consider there organisation of meat supplies in London as a permanent measure.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the making of arrangements for the use of troopsin connection with the Smithfield strike, as proposed bythe Home Secretary.
(2) Invited the Emergencies Committee to consider whether apublic intimation should be given that the continuance ofthe present troubles at Smithfield would make it neces-sary to consider a permanent reorganisation of Londonmeat supplies.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to discuss with the Ministerof Labour the difficulties which he felt about the lack ofmachinery for referring to arbitration wages disputes which gave rise to unofficial strikes.The Cabinet then discussed a memorandum submitted by the attorney-General (CP. (50) 143) enquiring whether any circumstance were known to Ministers which they thought he should take intoaccount in deciding whether or not he should take criminal pro-ceedings on the present occasion for contravention of the Conditionsof Employment and Natic lal Arbitration Order, 1940.The Attorney-General said that he had so far refrained from taking criminal proceedings, where unofficial stoppages constituted a breach of contract and contravened the Conditions of employment and National Arbitration Order, 1940. The Government had, how-ever, continued this Order in operation as an act of policy, and hethought that they would be exposed to criticism if he continued to refrain from enforcing it.In discussion Ministers expressed serious disquiet at the action taken by members of the Port Workers&apos; Committee in activelyfomenting an unofficial strike in an industry with which they werenot themselves concerned. If the leading members of the committee could be shown to have been responsible for this, their action wouldappear to amount to a conspiracy which public opinion would regard as meriting imprisonment. The leaders of the meat drivers&apos; stoppagemight not be thought to deserve imprisonment, but, if they wereconvicted and fined, the effect might be salutary.The Attorney-General said that, in reaching his decision on thequestion whether any criminal proceedings should be instituted, hewould take account of the considerations of public policy to which reference had been made in the Cabinefs discussion.BechuamalandProtectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference :CM. (50) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50) 138) proposing that steps should be taken to ensure that Seretse Khama and his wife wouldtake up residence outside the Bechuanaland Protectorate after theconclusion of the legal proceedings for the purposes of which Seretsehad been allowed to make a temporary visit to the Protectorate.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that hehad previously hoped that it might prove possible to allow Seretseand his wife to live in the Protectorate, though outside the Bamang-wato Reserve. He was now, however, satisfied, from discussions which he had had with the United Kingdom High Commissioner inSouth Africa, that it would be inexpedient to allow this. Seretse&apos;conduct during his visit and more particularly that of his wife hadbeen unsatisfactory; and it was clear that, so long as they were living in the neighbourhood, none of the responsible leaders of the tribewould be willing to co-operate in restoring the administration of theReserve. There was some reason to believe that it might be possibleto persuade Seretse and his wife to leave the Protectorate voluntarily;but it might become necessary to give them written instructions to doso and, in the last resort, to remove them by force. Their forcibleexpulsion would doubtless provoke public criticism both in thiscountry and elsewhere; but, if the Cabinet agreed that it was undesir-able that Seretse and his wife should remain in the Protectorate, theymust be prepared to enforce that decision if it became necessary todo so.   In that event it would probably be desirable that a White
Paper should be published explaining and justifying the Govern-ments action. Instructions had already been given for the prepara-tion of such a White Paper; but a final decision to present it need notbe taken until a draft was available.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he supported theproposals in CP. (50) 138 but hoped that it would prove possible to persuade Seretse and his wife to leave the Protectorate voluntarily. Ifit became necessary to order their departure, and still more if theyhad to be removed by force, a good deal of emotional feeling wouldbe aroused among Africans, both in this country and in Africa, whoseresults could not be forecast. The Secretary of State said that he was already disturbed at the signs of increasing tension betweenEuropeans and coloured people in Africa.In further discussion the following points Were raised:  (a) The Government had not decided that Seretse was unfit toassume the chieftainship of his tribe: they had agreed to postponedecision of that question for a period of years. Was it to be assumedfrom the arguments used in CP. (59) 138 that the Secretary of state had now reached the conclusion that Seretse would never be a suit-abie chieftain of the tribe?The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that he did not Wish that deduction to be drawn from his memorandum.There might in the next five years be changes in Seretse&apos;s personalcircumstances which would make it possible for the Government torecognise him as chieftain of the tribe. There was nothing inherent in the man&apos;s own character which need debar him from the chieftainship.(b) Seretse&apos;s wife was likely to be troublesome to the Govern-ment if she returned to this country; and it would be preferable if sheand her husband could be induced to take up their residence elsewhere.It was recognised, however, that, while they could be excluded from the bechuanaland Protectorate, there was no power to specify in what other country they should take up their residence.The Cabinet Approved the proposals set out in paragraph 25 of cp. (50) 138.135 AidChina. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCivil Aircraft Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of State (CP. (50)in Hong Kong. 134) explaining the reasons why they had not felt able to carry out(Previous the Cabinet&apos;s request that the United States Government should be reference: asked to indemnify the United Kingdom Government against anyCM. (50) 24th damages which might be awarded against them in respect of their conclusions, detention of the civil aircraft in Hong Kong, ownership of which was minute 6.) claimed both by the Chinese Government and by a United StatesCorporation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in view of the situa-tion which had arisen in Korea, he would not now think it appro-priate to press the suggestion, which he had made in the Cabinet&apos;discussion on 24th April, that the United States Government shouldbe asked to give such an indemnity.The Cabinet took note of CP. (50) 134.New Hebrides. 8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Colonies, the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Minister of State (CP. (50) 136) proposing accept-ance of the Australian Government^ suggestion that they shouldtake over the responsibilities of the United Kingdom Government inthe Anglo-French Condominium of the New Hebrides.
The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the existing position in the New Hebrides was unsatisfactory, for the reasonsstated in CP. (50) 136, and could not be left as it was. Of thealternative courses open, the most attractive was to accept theAustralian offer to take over our existing responsibilities under the condominium. The Chiefs of Staff raised no objection to such a transfer from the point of view of defence, since the New Hebrideslay within the area for which Australia accepted the primarystrategic responsibility.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations supported this proposal. He thought that it need not seriously prejudice theGovernments position in respect of the South African claim to theHigh Commission territories; but he hoped that the proposed trans-fer might be carried through without undue publicity. In discussion it was pointed out that the transfer could not be made withoutattracting attention in the United Nations; but it was to be hopedthat the Australian Government would avoid giving unnecessarypublicity to it.The Cabinet Approved the proposals made in paragraphs 16 and 17 of cp. (50) 136 for transferring to the Australian Governmentthe existing responsibilities of the United Kingdom Govern-ment under the Anglo-French Condominium of the new hebrides. ,Cabinet Office, SWA,29th June, 1950.
