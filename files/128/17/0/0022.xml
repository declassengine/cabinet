2. The Minister of Town and, Country Planning said that anumber of Conservatives had tabled, for discussion on 24th April,a Motion praying for the annulment of the Town and country planning (Grants) Regulations, 1950, These Regulations had theeffect that Government grant would not be payable for land acquired by local authorities under the Town and Country Planning Acts,-1947, unless the valuation had been made by the District Valuer.This requirement had aroused hostility in local authority circles;and the Minister had recently received a deputation from the localauthority associations at which he had been strongly pressed to agreethat local authorities should be free, if they so desired, to negotiatesuch purchases through their own valuers so long as the final pricewas approved by the District Valuer: The Minister said that hewas satisfied that there was some substance in this claim; but, apart altogether from its; merits, it was clear that the local authorities would be able to mobilise a substantial measure of support for their view among members of all Parties in the House of Commons and theGovernment were likely to be defeated on the Prayer unless some concession were made. He therefore wished to announce, in thecourse of the debate on 24th April, that he would shortly bring forward an amending Regulation giving him discretion to exemptany local authority, or any class of local authority, from the require-ment that all these valuations should be made by the District Valuer;and he proposed at the same time to indicate that he would use thisdiscretion to enable some of the largest local authorities to continueto employ their own valuers for this purpose. He sought the cabinet&apos;s authority to disclose this intention to the leader of thedeputation which had recently waited upon him, so that he mighthave his help in arranging that criticism of the Regulations wouldnot be pressed to a division in the House of Commons on 24th April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as the Cabinet wouldbe aware from their discussion on 13th December, 1948, of his proposal that the District Valuers should undertake all valuationsand negotiations in respect of land required by GovernmentDepartments, the State&apos;s acquisition of development values under theTown and Country Planning Acts, 1947, had greatly strengthenedthe case for centralising in the Valuation Office all the valuationwork connected with the acquisition of land by public authorities.The fact that Government grant was payable on these acquisitions,often at a high rate, was a further reason for insisting that the valuation should be made by the District Valuer. Before assenting,therefore, to the concession which the Minister of Town and country planning wished to make, he would wish to have a further oppor-tunity to consider its implications.In further discussion, however, serious doubts were expressed about the wisdom of seeking to concentrate all this work in the valuation Office. At their meeting on 13th December, 1948, theCabinet had not felt able to endorse the Chancellors proposal thatthe Valuation Office should have exclusive responsibility for carryingout this work on behalf of all Government Departments; and several ministers felt that the largest local authorities, ;at any rate, could. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 27th April, in Committee of Supply, there would be a debate on the Fishing Industry. The Cabinet were informed that,with the increasing variety in the food-stuffs available and the growing competition of foreign-caught fish, United Kingdomfishermen were now landing greater quantities of white fish than theI market could absorb. There was reason to fear that the period of prosperity which the fishing industry had enjoyed was now coming toan end.
3. The Minister of Labour said that the unofficial PortWorkers&apos; Defence Committee had organised a stoppage of work insome of the London docks as a protest against the action of theTransport and General Workers&apos; Union in expelling three men fromthe Union on account of their activities in connection with theLondon dock strike in 1949. This was independent of the currentdispute between the Stevedores&apos; Union and a shipping company which wished to engage some gangs of stevedores on weekly wagesinstead of by the day. Efforts to extend the stoppage of work hadnot so far been very successful; and, as it seemed unlikely that theunloading of any perishable cargoes would be delayed, the minister thought that the Government should not be in a hurry to introduceemergency measures, such as the use of troops to unload ships.The Cabinet were informed that the Emergencies Committeewere to meet that afternoon and would consider what steps shouldbe taken if the stoppage were extended and essential supplies werethreatened.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.London DookStrike.(previous reference:C.M.(49)48thConclusions,Minute 1.)Socialised 4.   The  Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordIndustries.      President (CP. (50) 60) on the efficiency and public accountabilityof the socialised industries.The Lord President explained that his memorandum was theresult of long consideration of this subject by the Socialisation ofIndustries Committee and of two meetings which the Committeehad held with the chairmen of the boards of socialised industries.be trusted to carry out this work as effectively as the ValuationOffice. But, whatever the merits, it was clear that the Governmentwould have very great political difficulty in persuading the Houseof Commons to accept the Regulations in their present form; andThe Lord Privy Seal added that, even if the Regulations survived thepresent challenge in the Commons, a Prayer for their annulment was almost certain to be carried in the House of Lords.In these circumstances the Cabinet agreed that some concessionmust be made on the lines indicated by the Minister of Town and country Planning. It was, however, pointed out that it would be dangerous to use any formula describing, by reference either topopulation or to rateable value, a class of local authority which mightbe exempted from this requirement. Any such discrimination between local authorities might embarrass the Government in futurediscussions of local government reform. It would be preferable thatthe Minister should take an absolute discretion to exempt anyparticular local authority from the requirement.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that in the debate in the House of Commons on24th April on the Town and Country Planning (Grants)Regulations, 1950, some concession snould be made to theview of local authorities that they should be allowed to employ their own valuation staff in negotiating for theacquisition of land under the Town and country planning Acts, 1947.(2) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning todiscuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland the precise form which this concession shouldtake.
133CM. (22) 50The boards and the responsible Ministers had effected with great success the transition from private to public ownership. It was now,however, necessary to consider whether the arrangements forchecking the efficiency of these industries were adequate, and how the growing demand for increased Parliamentary control should bemet. If Parliament and the public felt that; there was no check onthe efficient working of each socialised industry, other than theopinion of the responsible Minister and the board, there would be strong pressure for the appointment of a Select Committee in respectof all or each of these industries, and this Would undoubtedly hampertheir efficient working. He and some of his colleagues on the socialisation of Industries Committee were therefore inclined to favour the setting up of a common efficiency unit for the socialised industries, to which Ministers could point as constituting an externalcheck on efficiency, even though the unit would be appointed by the boards collectively and would investigate problems referred to it for examination by the boards. It also seemed desirable that periodicalenquiries should be held into the operation of each of the socialised industries, rather on the lines of the enquiries into the british broadcasting Corporation. He set out in paragraph 16 of his memorandum certain other respects in which the Socialisation of, Industries Committee felt that the public accountability of the boards should be recognised. Further efforts should be made to findcapable individuals to serve on the boards : what was now needed inmembers of boards was current ability rather than past reputation.The responsible Ministers should keep in close touch with the boards and there might, with, advantage, be some change of emphasis intheir relationship which would ensure that the boards gave prompt and full attention to Government policy. The Socialisation ofIndustries Committee were examining the machinery for consul ta-tion with consumers, which did not seem tp be yielding in practice allthe benefits which had been expected. The arrangements for consul-tation between management and workers were good, but could probably be improved : something might usefully be done to stimu-late greater interest in this machinery among trade unionists. the boards had not been very successful in their public relations, and the socialisation of Industries Committee had recently approved anumber of proposals made by an official working party which hadlooked into that aspect of the subject the Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the question whetherarrangements should be made for checking the efficiency of thevarious socialised industries.Some Ministers felt that it was premature to consider externalefficiency checks, such as the Lord President proposed. The variousboards had only been in existence for a relatively short period. Theyhad taken over the industries for which they were responsible at atime of rising costs, which had inevitably led to higher prices and charges. They had effected with success the difficult task of transition from private to public ownership, and they had already secured substantial improvements in their industries. While therewere some complaints of over-centralisation, over-staffing and over-payment of office staffs, there had been relatively little criticism ofthe technical operations for which each board was responsible andno detailed evidence of inefficiency had been produced to the Cabinet.In the view of these Ministers, the Government should consider indetail the internal checks on efficiency which the boards had created and the steps which Ministers might take to keep themselvesinformed of points of difficulty, e.g., by statistical material collected in their Departments, before further machinery was considered.The Cabinet were entitled to look to the departmental Minister for aview on the efficiency of the industries for which he was responsible.Other Ministers felt that all experience went to show thatorganisations of the size of some of the socialised industries were likely to contain some defects because of the inherent difficulties
of large-scale Organisation, The Government could reasonably argue that, in asking the boards to accept some form of external check onefficiency, Ministers were not suggesting that the boards wereinefficient, but were merely drawing the deduction that any large-scale organisation should nave some external check on efficiency inaddition to any internal checks. The Ministers departmentallyresponsible were not in a position to reach a technical conclusion onthe degree of efficiency attained by the industries.The point was also made that the Government had not merely tosatisfy themselves, they had also to satisfy Parliament and the public at large, that the socialised industries were being efficiently organised and administered. Ministers were in a better position to judge theneeds of the situation than the chairmen of the*boards. parliament and the public were not likely to be impressed with the argument that each board and its responsible Minister were the best judges of the efficiency c-f the industry. Under Parliamentary pressure,the most likely alternative to an external check on efficiency insti-tuted by the Government in agreement with the boards was a SelectCommittee on all or each of the socialised industries. There was general agreement that Select Committees would induce in the boardsa spirit of caution and a reluctance to take risks, and might well havethe result that chairmen of boards would be selected in future, not for their business ability, but for their capacity to handle a Parlia-mentary Committee. Moreover, in present conditions select committees would tend to be used for political propaganda ratheras a means of securing a higher standard of efficiency.As regards the suggestion for an efficiency unit common to thevarious socialised industries, some Ministers were doubtful whetheroutside consultants could give useful advice to the boards of socialised industries, the members of which had been chosen because of theirhigh standard of ability and technical skill. Other Ministers con-si dered that a common unit would be more useful in dealing with problems of organisation and office administration than withtechnical processes. On this view, a common efficiency unit would bear some resemblance to an Organisation and Methods Division inthe Civil Service, and would deal mainly with those questions ofdecentralisation and staffing which greatly exercised the public mind.It was, however, pointed out that experience in the cotton industryshowed that skilled industrial consultants could offer valuable advice on complicated technical operations because, in the course of their investigations into a number of different industries, they were able to devise techniques which had a broad application in judging theefficiency of a technical process. The members of boards and execu-tives were often chosen for their skill in operating the existingcomplicated machinery, rather than because of any capacity to makeimprovements in it.Those Ministers who favoured the appointment of a commonefficiency unit were disposed to prefer a small unit which would be reinforced by bringing in outside experts and consultants for par-ticular enquiries. The suggestion was made that the BritishInstitute of Management, which was drawing up a list of reputableindustrial consultants, might be able to offer useful advice on the selection of experts and consultants.While there was considerable support for the Lord Presidentssuggestion that any common efficiency unit should be set up by the boards collectively and should only engage in investigations at the instance of a board, some Ministers considered that the Governmentshould assume responsibility for the unit, either through theMinisters departmentally concerned with each industry or through a Minister with a wider field of responsibility, such as the lord president or the Chancellor of the Exchequer. The view was alsoput forward that Parliament and the public might not be impressed by a unit which was in fact part of the Government machine, and
135CM. (22) 50that steps should be taken to emphasise the independent status ofthe unit and its power to make investigations into aspects of theadministration of socialised industries about which there was public anxiety.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that he did not think there was yet sufficient unanimity among ministers to enable the Socialisation of Industries Committee to embark uponfurther negotiations with the boards of socialised industries aboutthe setting up of a common efficiency unit. The Cabinet were notyet agreed upon the need to set up such a unit, nor on the functions which it would perform. It was not yet clear that the time had come,at this early stage in the development of the socialised industries,when such an external check on efficiency could usefully be instituted.Periodical enquiries were made into the work of the British Broad-casting Corporation because the Corporation had so great aninfluence in moulding public opinion; but it did not follow that thesame form of enquiry would be appropriate to the socialised industries. As regards the steps proposed to emphasise publicaccountability of the boards, he did not think that anything shouldbe done which would tend to suggest a reversal of the past trend ofGovernment policy: for example, any encouragement of Parlia-mentary Questions might suggest that the Government consideredthat Members of Parliament could now enquire into the day-to-day management of the socialised industries.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of the issues raised in CP (50) 60.Resettlement 5.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the home of Refugees. Secretary and the Minister of State (CP .(50) 69 and 70) on thequestion whether the United Kingdom Government should offer to admit to this country a certain number of the refugees still underthe care of the International Refugee Organisation for whose dis-posal arrangements would have to be made when that Organisationcame to an end in June 1950.The Cabinet-Remitted this question for decision by a Committeecomprising the Home Secretary (Chairman), Minister ofHealth, Secretary of State for the Colonies, Secretary ofState for Scotland, Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, Minister of State and Financial Secretary,Treasury.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.20th April, 1950.
