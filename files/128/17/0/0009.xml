(49) 72ndConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Prime Minister said that the Conservative amendment to the Address, on the subject of the Iron and Steel Act, would be pressed to a division; and it was now known that the Liberals wouldvote in support of the amendment. This therefore would be the firstserious challenge to the Government in the present Parliament; andhe proposed to make it clear that he would treat the division as a vote of confidence in the, Government. The Cabinet agreed that theMinister of Supply and the Prime Minister should be the government spokesmen in the debate., They would reaffirm the policy whichhad been approved by the Cabinet on 2nd March and outlined by thePrime Minister in his speech on the opening day of the debate viz., that it was the Governments purpose to give effect in due course to the provisions of the Act as passed by Parliament.The Cabinet had some- preliminary discussion about the situa-tion which would arise if the Government wejje defeated in a divisionearly in the life-time of the Parliament. It was generally recognisedthat, from the point of view Qf the national interest, a very serious situation would result^-especially as essential financial business hadto be transacted by Parliament in March and April.The Cabinet were also informed that on 10th March the Speakerproposed to allow a wide debate covering the subject matter ofvarious amendments to the Address, including the Liberal amend-ment advocating that Scotland and Wales should be accorded self-government in domestic affairs.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that one of the pointslikely to be raised in this debate was; the extent of Scotland&apos;economic independence; and on this he would like to be able to saythat the Government were considering how best to establish the facts of Scotland&apos;s revenue and expenditure.In discussion it was pointed out that much time and effort wouldbe needed to separate the Scottish element in the national accounts;and it would be inexpedient that the Government should be com-mitted to publishing full factual information on this question. Itwas agreed that the Secretary of State, in replying to this part of the debate on 10th March, should enlarge upon the general difficultiesof granting self-government to Scotland and should avoid committing the Government to presenting any detailed statement on the financialissues involved.The&apos;Cabinet-(1) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, after consul-tation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to submit amemorandum on Scotland&apos;s contributions to, and claimsupon, the United Kingdom Exchequer.National health service.(previous reference:C.M.(49)37thConclusions,Minute 1.)The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 14th March, on the motion to go into Committee of supply on the Civil Supplementary Estimates, the Opposition would bring forward a motion deprecating the failure of the Chancellor of theExchequer to carry out his declared intention of requiring civil departments to keep within the limits of their original Estimates forthe current financial year. The main subject of debate would bethe Supplementary Estimate for the National Health Service; butit was agreed that, as this general criticism would also be voiced,the Chancellor of the Exchequer should intervene in the debate. Itwas desirable that the Government spokesmen on this occasion shouldbe able to say what steps were to be taken to impose a stricter controlover the finances of the National Health Service.   Proposals for this38452-2b 2
Control ofEngagementOrder&apos;.(previous reference:P.C.(49)22ndMeeting,Minute 1.)purpose were now under discussion between the Treasury and theMinistry of Health.The Cabinet  %(2) Invited the Minister of Health to submit, for consideration at the Cabinefs meeting on 13th March, a memorandum explaining the existing financial basis of the national health Service and the modifications which would haveto be made if the central Government were to be able toexercise closer control over the expenditure incurred onthis Service.On 15th March, in Committee of Supply, the conservative opposition proposed to raise a debate on the Control of EngagementOrder. The Cabinet were informed that it was no longer practicable to enforce compliance with this Order; and it was agreed that, if nopurpose was in fact served by retaining the Order, it would be preferable that the Government should announce, before the debate on 15th March, their intention to withdraw it. Suggestions for itsWithdrawal would probably be put forward in connection with a parliamentary Question which had been put down for answer bythe Minister of Labour that afternoon; and the Cabinet agreed that instead of giving a full answer to that Question, the Minister ofLabour should make a formal statement after Questions announcinghis intention to withdraw the Order.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the Control of Engagement Order should be revoked; and authorised the Minister of Labour to announce this in a statement to be made after questions that afternoon.agricultural prices.(previous reference:C.M.(50)8thConclusions,2. At their meeting on 6th March the Cabinet had invited theMinister of State for Economic Affairs and the agricultural ministers to examine further the proposals in CP. (50) 24, in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion, and to report the results of theirconsultations to the Prime Minister.The Cabinet were informed that the Agricultural ministers had agreed to instruct their officials to open discussions with repre-sentatives of the National Farmers&apos; Union on the basis of an aggre-gate net income of  250 million for 1950-51. This approach wasbeing made without prejudice to the further consideration of pro-posals for the development of marginal land.In discussion it was pointed out that the development of marginal land Was closely linked with financial assistance for the jpurchase of fertilisers and that the Cabinet ought to consider thetwo subjects together.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Agriculture Ministers should open theannual review of agricultural prices on the basis of an aggregate net income of  250 million for farmers in1950-51.(2) Invited the Agriculture Ministers to submit to the Cabinettheir proposals for the development of marginal land,including any proposals regarding the supply of fertilisers
)f 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary, the Minister of Agriculture and the Secretary of State* for Scotland (CP. (50) 25) recommending that the rationing of animal feeding-stuffs should continue, despite the withdrawal of theExchequer subsidy.In discussion there was general agreement that the uncertainty of future supplies made it inopportune to deration feeding-stuffs atthe present time. In any statement about the Government&apos;s hope togive larger rations, care should be taken not to give any guarantee of larger supplies since this might make it necessary at a later stage to import supplies from dollar sources.I was suggested that, as a result of uncertainty about futuresupplies, there was a tendency to build up excessive stocks of feeding-stuffs some part of which went bad before it could be used.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the rationing of animal feeding-stuffs shouldcontinue.(2) Invited the Minister of Food to submit a memorandum onthe suggestion that stocks of feeding-stuffs were so largethat some part of them went bad before they could beused.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (CP. (50) 29) covering the draft of an answer which he proposed to give that day to Parliamentary Questions about thepublication of information collected from local authorities regardingthe size of their waiting lists for houses.The Minister of Health reminded the Cabinet that, when theyhad previously discussed this matter on 20th October, they had agreed that he should delay publication of this information andshould consider whether publication could not be withheld indefi-nitely. He had come to the conclusion that the information shouldnot be given, as different local authorities compiled their lists indifferent ways and any aggregation of the local figures was mis-leading. In his answer, he proposed to explain in detail his reasonsfor withholding publication and to undertake that, when circum-stances allowed, he would arrange for a detailed survey of housingrequirements to be undertaken on a uniform basis.In discussion, reference was made to the following points : (a) The Minister of Health had indicated, in reply to previousQuestions, that the information was being collected from localauthorities with a view to publication; but he intended to explain that, although this promise had been given, it had not proved to bepossible to obtain reliable figures.(b) The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, although hehad not been consulted in advance on the terms of this statement,he was in general agreement with the Minister&apos;s proposals and wouldbe glad if words could be added to the draft answer to make it clearthat they applied to Scotland as well as to England.(c) Various drafting amendments were suggested, of which themore important were designed to make it clear that the war-timeestimates of post-war housing requirements had been falsified by subsequent events, and that there were other claims upon the national resources which limited the proportion of those resources which couldbe devoted to meeting housing needs. r
The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft statement, annexed to CP. (50) 29, onthe publication of information about local authorities&apos;waiting lists, subject to the amendments suggested in the cabinet&apos;s discussion; and authorised the Minister ofHealth to make the statement in answer to parliamentary questions later that day.The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the Minister ofHealth (CP. (50) 30) suggesting that it should be open to localauthorities to distribute their allocation of houses for 1951, inaccordance with their judgment of the needs of the applicants,between houses to be built by the Council- and houses to be built under licence.The Minister of Health explained that local authorities were now authorised to issue licences for the erection of new houses up toa maximum of one-tenth of the total number of houses allocated tothem. In his view, this uniform maximum took insufficient accountof the different needs of different areas. In the north and in Walesthere was relatively little demand for houses for sale, but there wasa much larger demand in the south and sOuth-east of England, wherethere was a tradition of house-ownership. His proposal was that local authorities should ascertain from the applicants for houses atthe top of their waiting lists whether any of them wished to buy a house, to be erected by a private builder, rather than to rent a councilhouse. The proportion of houses erected under licence would thus be determined, not by the Government or by the local authority, butby the consumer. In practice he believed that the result would bethat in many parts of the country fewer houses would be built under licence than at present, but the Government would be in a positionto say that this was the result of a free choice by those most in need of new accommodation.In discussion, doubt was expressed whether the proposed scheme would work satisfactorily. Local authorities who favoured thebuilding of houses for sale might be induced to give high priority intheir waiting lists to applicants who were prepared to employspeculative builders. The Cabinet considered whether this difficultycould be overcome by fixing a maximum proportion of houses forsale which should not be exceeded; but they agreed that the insertion of a maximum of this kind would weaken the case for the proposed arrangement.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had not been consulted in advance about the Minister&apos;s proposal and, on pre-liminary consideration, he was doubtful whether the scheme was practicable in Scotland.The Minister of Health said that, in the light of the views ex-pressed in the Cabinefs discussion, he would withdraw thesuggestion put forward in CP. (50) 30.The Prime Minister said that it would be convenient to theCabinet if housing questions could in future come forward, so faras possible, on the basis of joint memoranda from the two health ministers.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that, while it would be useful to introduce a greater measure of flexibility into the arrangements for grantinglicences for the erection of houses for sale, the objectionsto the proposal outlined in CP. (50). 30 appeared to outweigh its advantages.Licences forErection ofNew Houses.(previous references:EP.C.(49)35thMeeting and cm. (49) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)
The EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CM. (50) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet agreed that, in view of the limited time available to the Chancellor of the Exchequer for framing his budget proposals, they would not resume the general discussion of theeconomic situation which they had opened on 3rd March. AnyMinisters who had further specific suggestions to make could send them, in writing, to the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th March, 1950.
