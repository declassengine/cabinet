Tourist 1.  The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the LordAccemmoda-   President (CP. (50) 91) and the President Of the Board of TradetioD for 1951.   (CP. (50) 96) outlining steps that hnght be tafceh to mitigate the-r;   shortage of hotel acepmmodatidh- in the principal tourist centres,particularly London, before the opening of the Festival of Britain in;        1951.   &apos;&quot;;:::y-y&apos;&apos;;.;-;:&apos;\w &apos;o;&apos;!;;;;i&apos;&apos;- . r/ieLdr^Prew^ewfsaidthat the Council of the Festival of britain were; alarmed at the risk of a serious deficiency of accommodation forvisitors in 1951. This applied, not only to London, but to many other, parts of the s country as well; and permanent harm might be done tothe tourist industry if overseas visitors to the Festival failed to securesatisfactory accommodation. Several measures Were in train, but itwas doubtful whether; without a greater impulse from Ministers, theywould produce the desired results. ;      .The President of the Board of Trade said that the acute difficultieswhich might be experienced in 1951 illustrated the general inadequacy of existing hotel accommodation in London and elsewhere to cater forthe tourist traffic which it was desired to encourage and increase.All practicable steps had been taken to secure the release of as many as possible of the requisitioned hotels; but the fact was that in presentcircumstances if was often more profitable to adapt or construct large buildings for use as offices than as hotels, and hotel management wasno longer as profitableas it had be nformerly. There had, however,been a greater interest in the opehirig of new hotels in the last fewmonths/due mainly to the expectation of increased tourist traffic asa result of devaluation, arid to a belief that something might be done to mitigate the effects of the Catering Wages Orders. It was doubtful,however, whether hew coristructiori would be undertaken without some form of Government assistance, either by way of loan or by aguarantee of interest. It would also ease the problem of equippinghotels if there could be some relief in respect of purchase tax on hotelequipment, and this question was under examination by the treasury and the Board of Trade.&apos;    .       In discussion the following points were made;  (a) The main hotels in London had agreed to reserve a high pro-portion of their accommodation in 1951 for visitors from Airierica.Some of the London Clubs were also willing to provide accommoda-tion for some American visitors. It might be practicable to accommo-date overseas visitors in private houses, as had been done successfullyin Edinburgh during tte(b) Some concern was expressed at the slow progress of theenquiry by&apos; the Catering Wages Commission .iftio. toe. effects of the catering Wages Orders upon the hotel industry, For this delay, how-ever, the Commission were not entirely to blame. There was generalagreement that all practical steps should be taken to secure that theCommission^ report should be submitted at an early date.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer indicated that he would beprepared, in the exceptional circumstances, to consider the possibilityof giving a guarantee in respect of the interest on any money raised to equip the Carltbn Hotel for use as a hotel between now and 1957,when it was due to be handed over to the New Zealand Government.; There was general agreement that, if the Carltori Could be re-openedas a hotel, it would make a useful contribution to the provision ofhotel accommodation of the luxury class; but the New zealand government were unlikely to be prepared to waive their right to takepossession in 1957, and the relatively short term for which the premisescould be used as a hotel would present financial difficulties for anycompany taking it over for this purpose.(d) The hope was expressed that it Would be practicable to make-the Great Central Hotel available for tourists. One suggestion wasthat the Transport Executives should use instead the St. PancrasHotel, and that the staff of the Railway Executive, now occupying the38724-3 b 2

Theshortage of hotel accommodation in London and elsewhere was, how-. ever-, a long-term problem and Ministers should consider, in theirforthcoming review of the capital investment programme, whether a1   larger-allocation of resources might not be made to hotel buildingMaf the expense, not of housing, but of industrial or commercialconstruction. fa;.:&apos;&apos;^&amp;2,]^-c:-&apos; uhi?.h.j &apos; . if) Ought., the Government to consider some relaxation of the: - liquor licensing laws, to make London and other tourist centres more attractive to overseas visitors? The Home Secretary said that thelaw had been eased in various respects by the Licensing Act, 1949;and in the present Parliamentary situation he did not regard it aspracticable to make any further attempt to remove existing restric-tions.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the Lord Presidents view that vigorous action should be taken to provide better catering and accommo-dation for visitors to the Festival of Britain, 1951.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Lord President and the Minister of Works, toexamine in the light of the Cabinefs discussion what: further steps could usefully be taken to increase hotel accommodation in 1951 and in later years.Food. 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterTea Ration.    of Food (CP.

The Cabinet had before theni a memorandum by the ForeignMeeting of Secretary 4G.PW50) 92) reporting the progress made in the early stagesForeign    , i of the discussions between---officials of the United Kingdom, the UnitedMinisters. States and France in preparation for the forthcoming meeting of&apos; Foreign Ministers.                       .-f^K -The Foreign Secretary^ said that the Ministerial discussions, whichwere to open on the following day, would be developed in three stages.First, there would be Anglo-American conversations: secondly, thereM would be tripartite discussions between the United Kingdom, theUnited States and France: and, finally, there would be the meetingof the North Atlantic Council. Concurrently, opportunity would betaken to discuss matters of common concern to the United Kingdom,. the United States and Canada., including certain questions relating, to atomic energy research.The Foreign Secretary said that throughout these italks hisprimary objective would be to secure a closer understanding with theUnited States Government on major questions of policy in relationto Europe and the Atlantic area, the Middle East and the Far East.In all matters of foreign policy and defence policy there could be nodoubt that our interests would best be served by the closest co-opera-tion with the United States and Canada. It was clear that, even withthe support of the Commonwealth, Western Europe was not strong
enough to contend with the military dangers confronting it from theEast. To withstand the great concentration of power now stretchingfrom China to the Oder, the United Kingdom and Western Europemust be able to rely on the full support of the English-speakingdemocracies of the Western Hemisphere; and for the original con-ceptioh of Western Union we must now begin to substitute the widerconception of the,Atlantic community.One of the problems which we should have to face in the forth-coming discussions was how our financial and economic policies could best be related to this general conception of political and defence policy. It was clearly desirable that the objectives which we werepursuing in our relations with the United States Government on matters of foreign policy and defence should be in harmony with the aims of our financial and economic relations with the United States.The United States authorities had recently seemed disposed to pressus to adopt a greater measure of economic integration with Europethan we thought wise; and there was some risk that the United states might join with the countries of Western Europe in accusing us oflack of co-operation in economic policy. One possible solution of this difficulty would be to obtain from the United States Government afurther declaration of their determination to support the stability of sterling, and an assurance that in the context of collaboration inforeign policy and defence no pressure would be put on us whichmight impair the strength of our economic and financial position.Another grave problem to be faced was the position of western germany in relation to this new conception of the atlantic community. The Foreign Secretary had circulated a separate memorandum (CP. (50) 80)von policy towards Germany. western germany now contained a formidable industrial communiy of aboutAO million people which, having been cut off from its former sources of food supply in Eastern Germany, must now.live largely upon itsexports. It was a challenging task for statesmanship to bring thiscommunity into association with the Western world, in a peaceful and constructive spirit, by means acceptable to public opinion in France.The first instinct of the French people had been to insulate western germany from the Atlantic community, and to limit her association with Western Europe to the economic questions handled) in theOrganisation for European Economic Co-operation (O.E.E.C.). ThePresident of the French Republic had, however, adopted a rather more conciliatory attitude in his remarks about French policy towards germany in a speech which he had made on the previous day on theoccasion of the fifth anniversary of the German surrender at Rheims.If Western Germany were allowed to evolve as part of a Europeanorganism, through association first with the O.E.E.C. and with theCouncil of Europe, France might in time be persuaded to modify her present insistence that Germany should be insulated from the north atlantic Treaty Organisation. This, however, was not a process whichcould be rushed; for it must not be forgotten that both France andItaly were genuinely apprehensive about a resurgence of Germanmilitarism.The forthcoming talks with the United States Secretary of state would also provide an opportunity for a frank exchange of views on policy towards China and Japan. There were as yet no indications that the United States Government had been able to formulate any fresh policy towards China; and the continuing uncertainty aboutAmerican policy was undoubtedly embarrassing to a number of theother countries of the Commonwealth. Nor were there any signs that the United States Government were yet ready to consider theconclusion of a peace treaty with Japan. Although the conclusion ofsuch a treaty would be greatly to our advantage, it was difficult tosee what pressure we could effectively bring to bear to induce theUnited States Government to face these issues.In the third phase of these discussions, when the meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council opened, the Foreign Secretary hoped that itmight prove possible to frame a formal declaration of policy to be
made on behalf of all the North Atlantic Treaty Powers. The cabinet would, of course, be given an opportunity of seeing the draft of anysuch declaration before it was finally adopted.In conclusion the Foreign Secretary] said that in the forthcoming discussions various economic and defence questions were likely tobe raised which were of close concern to other Ministers. He wouldbe glad if he could have his colleagues assistance on these matters,as they arose; and he proposed that, as the discussions developed, heshould keep in close touch with the Ministers most directly concerned.Discussion showed that the Cabinet fully endorsed the foreign secretary^ ultimate objective of merging the original conception of western Union into the wider conception of the Atlantic community,and thereby ranging the United States and Canada in support of thecountries of Western Europe in their resistance of any Communistencroachment from the East. There was general support for theForeign Secretary&apos;s view that the strength of the Soviet Union and her satellites could not be matched by the Commonwealth and western Europe without the full support of North America; and that,from the point of view of foreign policy and defence, reliance mustbe placed on the greater strength of the Atlantic community.In discussion the following points were also made:  (a) In paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 92 it was stated that, in the officialdiscussions preceding the Ministerial talks, the United States andFrench delegations had been prepared to consider the possibility offurther negotiations with the Soviet Government, but that UnitedKingdom officials had taken the line that general negotiations with theSoviet Union were unlikely to succeed until the Western Powers were able to negotiate from a position of strength. It was suggested thatthe Government would be placed in a difficult political position ifany report were circulated that the United States and French Govern-ments had been in favour of making an approach to Moscow and thatthis had been prevented only by the Unwillingness of the UnitedKingdom Government to associate themselves with such an approach.The Foreign Secretary explained that these were preliminary discussions only, and it was not yet known what view would be takenby United States and French Ministers on this point. His ownattitude was clear. No good would come of negotiations with theSoviet Government unless the Western Powers knew precisely what their objectives would be in such negotiations and had some grounds for believing that they could secure them. If the Russians gave any indication that they were ready to discontinue the cold war andgenuinely anxious to negotiate a general settlement, he would be quickto seize any opportunity for full and frank discussion of all out-standing issues. But experience had shown that, in dealings with theSoviet Union, it was useless to negotiate from weakness.The Cabinet fully endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view on thisquestion. They considered, however, that there was force in the point that the attitude of the United. Kingdom Government might be mis-represented if reports became current that the Americans and theFrench had favoured a final attempt to secure a peaceful settlement with the Soviet Union by negotiation. The Foreign Secretary under-took to bear in mind the importance of ensuring that the United King-dom Government could not be misrepresented as having been alone in placing obstacles in the way of any such negotiations with Moscow.In this connection it was suggested that, if the Americans showed anydisposition to favour general negotiations with the Soviet Govern-ment, we might suggest that we should be prepared to enter into such negotiations on the basis of an agreed agenda including thequestion of atomic energy. This, it was thought, would induce the americans to adopt a more realistic attitude towards such a proposal.(b) With reference to paragraphs of-CP. (50) 92 it was urgedthat in the discussion on economic questions we should make it clear
that we were not prepared to adopt policies which would prejudice our prospects of attaining economic viability by the end of 1952.There was general support for this view.(c) The Cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement on future policy towards Germany. It was essential that western germany should be brought into closer association with western europe, and that France should be persuaded to adopt a realistic viewof the future place of Western Germany in Europe. The first experi-ment in this direction could be taken in the Council of Europe. But,before long, it would be necessary to consider how Germany could best contribute towards the defence of Western Europe though thisraised grave questions which would require most careful considera-tion. French and Italian anxieties about a resurgence of Germanmilitarism were among the reasons for substituting, for the originalconception of Western Union, the wider conception of the atlantic community. For, in the wider context of the North Atlantic Treaty,France and Italy could feel greater assurance of security against german aggression and would therefore be more justified in takingthe risk of agreeing to some measure of German rearmament.(d) In connection with the defence of Western Europe, reference was made to the importance of building up the great potential military strength of France. Importance was also attached to the need for amore complete integration of the machinery established under the brussels Treaty and under the North Atlantic Treaty.ie) It was agreed that the Commonwealth Relations Office should arrange to be kept informed of all matters arising in the course of theforthcoming discussions which would be of direct concern to any ofthe other self-governing members of the Commonwealth.The Cabinet-Endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement; and took note of CP. (50) 80 and 92 and of the points raised in thediscussion.Cabinet Office, SWA,8th May, 1950.
