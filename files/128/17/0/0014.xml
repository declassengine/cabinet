1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter Recess from6th to 18th April. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his budget on 18th April.The Lord President said that he had not yet completed had discussions with the Opposition leaders On the allocation ofParliamentary time for debates On socialised industries, discussions of special topics and Private Members&apos; business. He Still hoped toavoid having to provide time for Private Members&apos; business in thecurrent session; but, if this proved Inevitable, he proposed thatfive days should be made available for Private Members&apos; Motions.  ..2. The Lord President said that Mr.: J. G. MacManawayi a&quot;clergyman of the Church of Ireland whb had been elected: fOr WestBelfast, had not yet taken his seat in the House of Commons in view]of the doubt which had been raised about his eligibility. He was-apparently unwilling to risk exposing himself to penalties by takinghis seat; and the question therefore arose whether the Governmentshould take the initiative in proposing the appointment of a SelecVCommittee to consider his position.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the legal issues involved were of great complexity and it was doubtful whether a select Committee would be competent to resolve them. While it was appropriate that the House of Commons should ascertain the factsthrough the medium of a Select Committee, it would be preferable that the legal questions should be considered by the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council. A Select Committee, if appointed,could recommend that the House of Commons should invite HisMajesty to remit the legal questions to the Judicial Committee : thiscourse had been followed in 1912 in connection with the election ofSir Stuart Samuel.The Cabinet agreed that there was no reason why the Govern-ment should not take the initiative in proposing the appointment ofa Select Committee. It would be for that Committee to suggest thatan opinion on the legal issues should be given by the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council., The Cabinet-Authorised the Lord President to.suggest, in replying to aPrivate Notice Question which was to be put to him that afternoon, that the issues arising from Mr. MacManaway&apos;selection to the House should be investigated by a SelectCommittee.U.N.E.S.C.O. 3.   The Minister of Education said that the next meeting of the(Previous United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural OrganisationReference: (U.N.E.S.C.O.) was to be held shortly in Florence. The united cm. (49) 22nd Kingdom delegation to these meetings had for some time been ledConclusions, by his Parliamentary Secretary. In view of the present Parlia-Minute 3.) inentary situation, it had been suggested that, if the parliamentary secretary was to lead the delegation this year, one of theConservative back-benchers who had shown special interest in thesequestions might be asked to serve as a member of the delegation, soas to preserve unchanged the relative voting strengths of the Labourand Conservative Parties in the House of Commons.In discussion the view was expressed that such an arrangement,while it might lead to no difficulty at the forthcoming meeting of u.N.E.S.C.O., would create a precedent which might be embarrassingparliamentBusiness inthe House of -Commons.Parliament.Disqualifica-tion of aMember.
in connection with future meetings of other agencies of the united nations.   If this meeting was to take place while Parliament was; sitting, it would be preferable that the United Kingdom delegation should be led by a Minister from the House of Lords.The Minister of Education said that the meeting would takeplace largely in the Whitsun Eecess. He would therefore prefer toappoint his Parliamentary Secretary as leader of the delegation,and arrange for him to be represented by an official during the first few days of the meeting before the beginning of the Whitsun Recess.Receipts and-Expenditureof the british transport commission.(Previous    .Reference:CM. (50) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Prime Minister referred to the Cabinet&apos;s decision of13th March that the Minister of Transport should examine afreshthe finances of the British Transport Commission before the Cabinetresumed their discussion of the Commission^ application fOr anincrease in railway freight rates and dock charges. As the matter was urgent he (the Prime Minister) had initiated discussions on thesubject, and he was now inclined to the view that the transport commission^ application for increased charges should be granted,on the understanding that the Minister of Transport, with theassistance of the Minister of State for Economic Affairs, would undertake a thorough investigation into the financial position of theCommission, and of the railways in particular, so as to ascertainwhere economies might be effected and how the integration of road and rail transport could most speedily be secured.In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion attention was drawn to the serious effect of the proposed increases in railway freight rates on the levelof internal prices and of export prices. It seemed very doubtfulwhether the general wages position could be held if an all-roundincrease in prices occurred. Moreover, as had been pointed out whenthe Cabinet previously discussed the matter, an increase in railway freight rates was likely to drive further traffic from the railwaysand so to accentuate the difficulties from which the railways were suffering. Even if the increases were regarded as temporary, itwould be difficult for the railways to recover the lost traffic at alater stage.The Cabinet were informed that the Transport Commission didnot consider that they were faced with a temporary difficulty. Inthe Commission^ view the disequilibrium between railway expenses and receipts was permanent in character, and would not be fullycompensated by fresh receipts from other sources when a more fullyintegrated transport system was achieved. Costs had increased by120 per cent., whereas receipts had only gone up by 55 per cent.;and the losses on the railway system were at present running at therate of  30 million a year. The Commission^ long-distance road haulage undertaking could only yield a million or so towards thereduction of the railway deficit, even if the traffic carried by roadwas substantially increased. Similarly, any surplus revenue fromthe road passenger undertakings which the Commission alreadyowned, or had recently bought, would be relatively small in amount.Because of the opposition of local authorities, there seemed little prospect of further road passenger undertakings being transferredto the Commission in the near future. The Transport Tribunal had estimated that the increased railway rates would result in a loss tothe railways of traffic worth  10 million, but the Commission wereprepared to face this loss in return for increased railway receiptsestimated at  27 million, and some of the traffic lost to the railways would go to the Commission^ road haulage undertaking.It was, however, the view of the Cabinet that without more precise and detailed information they could not accept the conclusionthat the Transport Commission^ undertakings, taken as a whole,would be bound to run permanently at a loss unless railway freight
charges were increased. Ministers still thought that there was room for substantial economies in the operation and the staffing of therailways. The re-equipment of the railways had been drasticallyrestricted; and, if it became possible to allow more re-equipment inthe next few years, the improved facilities thereby afforded shouldattract more traffic. The balance between rail and road traffic might also be improved by restrictions on &quot; C &quot; road licences or by fiscalmeasures designed to prevent the expansion of road transport. Inall these ways, the next few years might see a tilting of the balance in favour of the railways.I jThe Cabinet then discussed the basis on which the transport commission might be asked to continue without increased charges,if it were felt that their financial position was likely to improveduring the next few years and that it would be reasonable to carry the existing losses meanwhile and so avoid any distortion of thenational transport system which might arise from the raising ofrailway freight rates.The following were the main points made in this part of thediscussion: (a) In favour of a temporary Exchequer subsidy, it was argued that any decision to delay a grant of increased railway freight rates would be taken by the Government against the advice of theCommission and the Transport Tribunal, and that it was thereforeunreasonable to ask the Commission to bear the cost of the delay.The general body of tax-payers might be better able to bear theadditional cost of operating the railways than the railway users,particularly as the main burden would fall on heavy mineral traffic.Moreover, the Exchequer had received substantial sums during thewar under the railway agreements, and it was arguable that therailway undertakings ought to have been allowed to retain some ofthis surplus in order to enable them to deal with problems of thepost-war transition before re-equipment could be carried out andan integrated charges scheme achieved.(b) Some Ministers felt that, if further investigation showed that the Transport Commission were likely to be able to pay their way when greater integration of transport facilities had been achieved, it would be reasonable to treat any Exchequer assistance given in present circumstances not as a subsidy, but as a loan whichcould either be repaid at a later period or in some form added tothe capital liabilities of the Commission.(c) The Minister of Transport and other Ministers thought It most undesirable to contemplate the possibility of Exchequerassistance to the railways, either temporary or permanent. the morale of the Commission^ undertakings would suffer if the incentive of endeavouring to balance expenses and receipts were not made immediately applicable. There would also be little inducement to transport workers to abate their wages claims if they felt thatthe Exchequer stood behind the Commission.(d) It would not be desirable to delay for more than a few weeksa decision on the broad lines on which this problem was to be handled.The matter had been referred to the Transport Tribunal inNovember last and the Tribunal had reported on 6th February. TheMinister of Transport was under strong pressure in Parliament toindicate the Governments decision on the TribunaFs findings.The general view of the Cabinet was that the Minister ofTransport, with the assistance of the Minister of State for economic affairs, should review the position in the light of the variousfinancial and economic points which had been raised in thediscussion; and that it would not be unreasonable to expect theBritish Transport Commission to bear the current losses on railwayoperation for a few further weeks pending the results of that review.
In further discussion reference was made to some of the long,term issues raised by the Transport Commission^ application(e) Experience showed that the operations of the socialised industries were closely linked. Increases in coal prices had to aconsiderable extent precipitated the difficulties of the railways.There was a case for some correlation of wage rates in the socialised industries, and possibly for Government control of their prices and charges. &apos;(/) The various socialisation measures might place too great anemphasis on an annual balancing of accounts. Other basic industries were able to undertake capital re-equipment without too much regardto the current financial position. A broad view covering a number ofyears was required. This was not, however, necessarily applicable tothe present railway difficulties, which arose from losses on currentoperation,and not from expenditure on capital re-equipment whichwas not yet remunerative. .., f(g) There might be a case for treating transport differentlyfrom other socialised industries which were expected to pay. their way.   A large amount of capital equipment had been sunk in the;railways and it could not be in the national interest that this equip-ment should be only partially used while fresh equipment was being provided for road transport.   This view, however, ran contrary tothe principles on which the Transport Act had been framed, sincethe Act assumed that the Transport Commission would run itsundertakings on commercial lines and would make these under-takings, taken as a whole, pay their way.    Government subsidieswould involve strict Treasury supervision.   Moreover, the Act:provided that, after the present transition phase had come to an end,rail and road charges would be settled by the Transport Tribunal:on the application of the Transport Commission without any inter-vention by the Government.(h) If . it were decided that the Transport Commission&apos;?;undertakings, as a whole, could not be expected to pay their way, itmight be practicable to avoid the appearance of a direct exchequer subsidy by transferring to the Commission, for the maintenance ofthe permanent way Of the railways, some of the taxes paid by thoseusing the roads./The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Transport to discuss with the;Minister of State for Economic Affairs the variousfinancial and economic points which had been raised iithe Cabinet-&apos;s discussion; and to submit a further report;soon after Easter, and in any event not later thai1st May.(2) Agreed to suspend, meanwhile, their decision on the appli-cation of the British Transport Commission for increases jin railway freight rates and dock charges.agricultural prices.(previous reference:G.M.(50)9thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the agriculture Ministers (CP. (50) 45) reporting the results of thediscussions on agricultural prices with representatives of the farmers&apos; Unions. These discussions had shown that there was nipossibility of reaching agreement on the basis of recouping by price increases only  12^ million of the total estimated cost increase of 37^ million. As a result of the negotiations it was now proposedthat prices for sheep, cattle, pigs and milk should be raised ty 12j million plus a further  2f million to be saved from withdrawing the acreage payments on early potatoes; that a further 5 million should be spent in the twelve months ending June 1951on schemes for encouraging the use of fertilisers on grassland andmarginal land and the ploughing-up of old grassland; that a furthet
 1-33 million should be spent on an extension of the existingMarginal Production Scheme designed to afford relief to smallproducers of milk, pigs and eggs; and that there should be a further extension of the existing Marginal Production Scheme to give anadditional stimulus to the reclamation of small areas of semi-derelict land at a maximum cost of  670,000. These measures wouldtogether provide a sum. of  19J million towards the estimatedincreased costs of  37^ million.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwiithj these proposals, under which the farmers would be required tobear two-thirds of the increased costs of production.Further points in discussion were : (a) The extent to which these increased prices would be passed on to the consumer, with a consequent increase in the cost-of-living index, could be left for discussion at a later meeting of the Cabineton the basis of a memorandum which had been circulated by theMinister of Food (CP. (50) 46). No substantial increase in thecost-of-living index would in any event be involved.(6) The figure of  12  million allowed in recoupment of increased costs included  If million in respect of an assumedincrease in railway freight charges. If in the event, as a result ofthe discussion recorded in the preceding Minute, these increased charges were not authorised or their introduction was substantiallydelayed, farmers&apos; incomes would be correspondingly increased.(c) The proposals for giving special assistance to smallproducers would do nothing to compensate domestic keepers of pigs and poultry for the price increase which would result from thewithdrawal of the Exchequer subsidy on animal feeding-stuffs.(d) There was likely to be some delay before the Minister ofFood announced the increases to be made in certain food prices inconsequence of this review of agricultural prices. It was therefore desirable that, in announcing the latter, the Agriculture ministers should make it clear that any consequential increases in food prices would not necessarily follow the same pattern.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals for increases in agricultural prices,for fertiliser subsidies and for extensions of the marginal Production Scheme set out in paragraph 3 of cp. (50) 45.(2) Authorised the Agriculture Ministers to announce forthwiththese results of the annual review of agricultural prices.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd March, 1950.
