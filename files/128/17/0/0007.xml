bechuanaland protectorate.Chieftainshipr, i of the tribe.(Previous&apos; Reference:CM. (CO) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidthat his predecessor had had one interview with Seretse Khama andhe was himself to have another that afternoon. Though he would tryhis best to induce Seretse, in accordance with the Cabinet&apos;s decisionof 31st January, to relinquish voluntarily his claim to the chief taintship of the Bamangwato tribe, all the indications were that this attempt would fail. Although Seretse might accept a decision thathe could not assume the chieftainship, he was likely to insist that,in order to avoid the reproach of having abandoned his supporters,this decision should be imposed upon him and not taken of his ownvolition. In these circumstances the Secretary of State suggestedthat the Cabinet should authorise him, if need arose, to propose toSeretse, as an alternative solution, that the Government should postpone for five years their decision on the question whether hecould assume the chieftainship--on the understanding that in themeantime he would remain outside the territory of the tribe. TheUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in South Africa had expressedthe view that, although postponement would give rise to considerable difficulties within the territory, these should not be insuperable.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were not prepared to agreethat Seretse should at once assume the chieftainship of the tribe.That being so, they agreed that, if he proved unwilling to withdraw his claim to the chieftainship, the best solution would be to postponetheir decision for a period of years. In the meantime appropriatefinancial provision should be made for Seretse and his wife; andit should be made a condition of this allowance that he should not return to the territory without the permission of the Secretary ofState and should refrain from promoting any political intriguewithin the territory, So long as it was made clear to Seretse thatthe postponement would be for a substantial period of years, itwould be preferable to avoid specifying any definite period. WhileSeretse could not be prevented from leaving the United Kingdom,the necessary steps should be taken to prohibit his admission to theterritory of the tribe. Tshekedi&apos;s return to the territory should similarly be prohibited.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations, if he failed to persuade Seretse Khama to relinquish his claim to the chieftainship of the bamangwato Tribe, to inform him that the Governmenthad decided to postpone for a period of years their decision on the question whether they could approve hisassumption of the chieftainship, and that during thattime he would not be at liberty to return, without per-mission, to the territory of the tribe.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations would submit, for consideration during thefollowing week, a memorandum on various consequentialmatters, including the&apos;question of publication of thereport of the Judicial Enquiry.The Economic       2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer made an oral report toSituation.       the Cabinet on the financial and economic situation of the countryand the main factors which he would have to take into account invitation framing his Budget proposals.On the basis of this statement the Cabinet held a general dis-cussion on the economic situation. At the end of the meeting they agreed to resume this discussion early in the following week.No record is being made of the Chancellors statement or of the cabinet&apos;s discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd March, 1950.
