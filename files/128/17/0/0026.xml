1. The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of the efforts ofthe Whips in-securing the attendance of so large a number ofGovernment supporters in the critical divisions on the Budget Reso-resolutions on the previous day., The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Friday, 5th May, was. to be devoted to the discussion of private members&apos; Motions. It was agreed that the first of these, on sciencein industry, could be accepted; and that the Lord President should reply on behalf of the Government. The second supported theclaim of the more poorly-paid workers to some increase in wages;and its terms had now been so adjusted that it could, if necessary,be accepted. It was agreed that the Minister of Labour should reply to this Motion on behalf of the Government.2. The Minister of Education said that, in the debate on hisEstimate on 4th May, two questions would be raised regarding thetreatment of Church schools under the Education Act, 1944. Thefirst of these related to the rate of Government grant payable todenominational schools under the Aqt of 1944; and on that point the Minister proposed to say that no change could be made in thesettlement made, by the terms of that Act. The second concerned the provisions of section 15 of the Act, which required the Ministerto satisfy himself, before he decided that a denominational schoolneed not be taken over as a controlled school, that the Churchauthorities would be able, as well as willing, to meet the financial commitments involved in aided status. The Church authorities werecontending that it was unreasonable to require them to prove at thisstage that they would be able to meet all the expenditure whichthey might be obliged to undertake in years to come. There was someforce in this contention; and the Minister had been prepared, as amatter of administration, to allow the school managers to limit theirassurances to a diminishing proportion of the total sums involvedaccording to the time which would elapse before the building work was undertaken. The Roman Catholics feared, however, that acceptance of this administrative compromise might prejudice their freedom to challenge in future the principle underlying this sectionof the Act. It was possible that, in the forthcoming debate, theOpposition might propose some amendment of this section; and, ifa reasonable proposal were put forward, the Minister was disposed to offer to consider it.After some preliminary discussion the Minister said that hewould submit a memorandum on this point for consideration by theCabinet before the debate on 4th May.The Cabinet-Took note that the Minister of Education would submit tothem, for consideration on 1st May, a memorandum on thepossibility of amending section 15 of the Education Act,1944.3. The Minister of Agriculture said that, in the debate in theHouse of Commons that afternoon on the fishing industry, Oppositionspeakers were likely to press for the establishment of a White FishCommission. It would be politically inexpedient for the Governmentto reject that suggestion without putting forward any alternativein its place. The Minister therefore sought authority to say, in thecourse of the debate, that the Government were willing to consider any constructive proposals for assisting the fishing industry,including (if it were made) the proposal for the establishment of aCommission.
The Minister of Food said that, so long as the Government were   not committed to any particular solution; he raised no objection to&apos; the proposal made by the Minister of Agriculture.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to say; in the debate;.M :    that; day in the House of Commons, that the Governmentwere prepared to consider any constructive proposals for&apos;   assisting the fishing industry; &apos;London Dock 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeStrike. Secretary (CP. (50) 84) on the London dock strike.   This showed(Previous       that there had been no substantial change in the situation sinceReference:      the Cabinet had last discussed it on 25th April.   There were saidCM.

At a meeting of the london dock Labour Board on the previous day it had been suggested thatan announcement should be made that strikers who did not return towork by the morning of 28th April would be regarded as dismissed.; from the scheme, and that the troops should be withheld from the docks until 9 a.m. that morning in order to give the strikers anopportunity to return to work.  The trade union representatives onthe! Board had not felt able to support this suggestion, and it had-.. then been decided that the National Dock Labour Board should beasked for their advice.  The Ministerial Committee on Emergencies,&apos; to whom this situation had been reported, believed that the national dock Labour Board, if asked for advice, would favour the dismissal of the strikers; and they thought it would be inexpedient to threatendismissal at the present time.  They also thought it would be unwise to make the experiment of withholding the troops in order to seeif the strikers returned to work, unless this was formally proposed on&quot;    behalf of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union.In discussion there was general support for the views of the ministerial.Committee. Ministers agreed that it would be a mistake to threaten the strikers with dismissal at the present juncture; andthey thought it preferable that the National Dock Labour board should not be encouraged to advise on the handling of the situation.The better course would be to show that the Government were deter-mined to keep the port in operation, by proceeding with the building-up of the numbers of troops engaged in the docks.&apos; The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange for the london dock Labour Board to be informed that, in the view of theGovernment, it would be untimely for them to approach the National Dock Labour Board for advice on the handling of the situation.Foreign 5.   The Cabinet considered a further memorandum (CP.Yisiting (50) 68) by the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, the Minister of forces.

anxiety in their earlier discussion on 3rd April of the proposalsitt the original memorandum (CP. (50) 42); and he was satisfied thatthese raised no difficulties which could not be met in the course ofthe proposed negotiations with the United States authorities.In discussion Ministers agreed that this further memorandum(CP. (50) 68) cleared up most of the doubts which had been expressedin their earlier discussion. They still thought it undesirable, how-eyer, that members of United States Forces in this country shouldbje left permanently in a more favoured position, as regards criminal proceedings, than members of the Forces of other commonwealth countries; and they expressed the hope that it would eventually bepossible to put Commonwealth Forces on the same footing in thisrespect as United States Forces. They agreed, however, that thefirst step was to explore the possibility of securing some modificationof the existing agreement with the United States Government.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to enter into negotiations, with the United States Government with a view to securing their agreement to an arrangement on the lines set out inparagraph 4 (d) of CP. (50) 42.Jordan and 6.   The Minister of State said that the United States Govern-Israel. ment had now expressed their views on the declarations regarding(Previous       the union of Arab Palestine with Jordan which had been proposed reference:      in CP.

TheyC.M.(50)25th   raised no objection to the proposed declaration welcoming the unionConclusions,    of Arab Palestine with Jordan :  they made no comment on the minute 2.)      proposal to accord de jure recognition to Israel: but they preferred that the United Kingdom Government should hot make their pro-posed declaration reaffirming their desire for peace in the middle east. Their reason for suggesting that this last general declaration should not be made at the present time was that they hoped that,in the course of the current discussions on foreign policy between representatives of the United Kingdom, the United States andFrance, it might be agreed that a joint declaration on the middle east, in much stronger terms, should be made on behalf of all three governments. In these circumstances the Minister of State proposedthat the statement which he was to make that day, in answer to aPrivate Notice Question in the House of Commons, should be limitedto the matters covered in paragraphs 18 (1) and (2) of CP. (50) 78:The Cabinet Agreed that, in the circumstances described by the Ministerof State, the proposed statement on&quot; Jordan and Israelshould not include any general declaration reaffirming thedesire of the United Kingdom Government for peace in theMiddle East.Meals in 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofEstablish-       Food (CP. (50) 72) recommending the revocation of the Meals inments Order.    Establishments Order, which restricted the amount of food thatmight be served, and limited the charge that might be made, formeals in restaurants.The Cabinet Were reminded that the Production Committee andthe Economic Policy Committee had both concluded, in June and november of 1949, that although there was a strong practical case for revoking this Order it should be retained on political grounds(P.C. (49) 15th Meeting, Minute 2 and E.P.C. (49) 43rd Meeting,minute 1). There could be no doubt that the revocation of the order would be advantageous to the tourist trade; and the only question38669-3 b 3
for the Cabinet was whether supporters of the Government would regard its withdrawal as an infringement of the policy of &quot; fairshares.&quot;In discussion it was suggested that, in view of current criticisms of the Budget and the importance of encouraging the continuanceof restraint in respect of wage claims, this was not an opportune moment to withdraw this Order. Some Ministers also felt that the revocation of the Order would be misunderstood in some industrialdistricts in the north.On the other hand, it was recognised that these vexatiousrestrictions on restaurant meals were undoubtedly increasing thedifficulties of attracting tourists to this country, particularly fromthe United States. It was also considered that the Order was nolonger very effective in limiting the amounts spent on restaurantmeals.The Cabinefs conclusion was that the Order might be with-drawn, for an experimental period during the tourist season, on theunderstanding that the position would be reviewed in September1950, when it would be decided in the light of experience whetherthis restriction should be reimposed or finally withdrawn. It wasthe view of the Cabinet that the revocation of the Order should be announced in an unobtrusive manner, possibly by way of a letter tothe British Travel and Holidays Association.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Food to arrange for the revoca-tion of the Meals in Establishments Order, subject to the safeguards noted in paragraphs 10 and 12 of CP. (50) 72.(2) Agreed that the Meals (Service at Social Functions) order should be withdrawn simultaneously.(3) Took note that the position would be reviewed, in the lightof experience, in September 1950, when the cabinet would be invited to decide whether these restrictions should be reimposed or permanently withdrawn.socialised industries.(previous reference:CM. (50) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the Lord Presi-dent&apos;s memorandum (C.P.(50) 60) on the efficiency and publicaccountability of socialised industries.The Lord President said that his memorandum relatedprimarily to the question of the public accountability of socialised industries. The boards had completed satisfactorily the transition from private to public ownership; and, as respects the past, themain criticism must be that through inadequate public relationswork sthey had failed to secure full public recognition of the efficientmanner in which they had performed this task. He was anxious,however, that his colleagues should approach the subject, not fromthe angle of appraising the degree of efficiency which the boardshad secured so far, but from the point of view of what would haveto be done to meet the demand that their accountability to Parlia-ment and to the public should be more clearly established. Unlesssomething was done to meet this demand, which commanded support in quarters which were well-disposed towards socialisation, Parlia-ment might insist on establishing machinery, e.g., Select committees for each socialised industry, which would not in the long run facili-tate the smooth and efficient working of these industries. The respon-sible Ministers accepted, and the chairmen of the boards acquiesced in, the suggestion that there should be periodical enquiries, sayevery seven years, into the principal socialised industries. these should be general and not technical in character. Periodicalenquiries would go some way to satisfy Parliament and the public,and the knowledge that there was to be this independent stocktakingat intervals would help to keep the boards alert.   There was also
general agreement that there should be ampler opportunities for parliamentary discussion, and three days had been promised for thispurpose in the current Session.   These debates should not always be arranged on the basis of Opposition,demands for opportunities to voice criticism : there might be occasions when a debate would besought, by the responsible Minister or by Government supporters.Then again, although the relations between the responsible ministers and the chairmen snould be close and harmonious, it was important that jthe Ministers should be critical and independent-minded, andthat; the chairmen should give full weight^ to views expressed bythem.  The Socialisation of Industries Committee were looking intothe workirig: of Consumers&apos; Councils. There was probably some room for improvement in the machinery for consultation between manage-ment and workers, though a great deal of useful work had been donein that field. There remained the question whether, if these varioussteps were taken, the public would be satisfied that the publicaccountability of the socialised industries had been fully secured,and that there were sufficient extern aL checks to promote furtherefficiency Where this could be attained.  He himself still thought itdesirable that the boards should take the further step of setting upa common efficiency unit answerable to the boards themselves, whichwould consist of a small number of skilled industrial consultantswho could either give advice on problems referred to them by aboard, or indicate where the necessary advice could lie secured.Progressive private companies had achieved substantial economiesby the employment of reliable industrial consultants; and the vastsocialised industries inevitably presented problems on which a freshangle of view, external to the management of each industry, wouldbe of great value.  He did not, however, wish to be dogmatic aboutthe form of check which should be adopted : this was a matter forfriendly discussion with the chairmen of the boards, who would be free to put forward their own suggestions as to the manner in which public concern on these issues could best be met.  He thought thetime was now ripe for a further discussion of all these issues withthe chairmen of the boards, and he was anxious that the responsible ministers should undertake such a discussion with the authorityof the Cabinet behind them.  It had been said that the boards had only been set up comparatively recently and that it was too early to be considering checks on their efficiency; but account had to betaken of the widespread publie concern and of the danger that, ifmatters were left to drift, an unsatisfactory relationship would develop between the boards on the one hand and Government and parliament on the other, which failed to make  the boardssufficiently responsive to public criticism and would be difficult tomodify at a later stage.Discussion showed that the proposals in CP. (50) 60 were generally acceptable to the Cabinet, apart from the proposed recom-mendation to the boards for the establishment of a common efficiencyunit, on which there remained some divergence of opinion.It was.argued that the Cabinet were not in a position to formany judgment on the degree of efficiency achieved in the socialised industries. Before they could form such a judgment they would need to have before them more detailed information about the opera-tion of the industries. and the machinery available both to the boards and to the responsible Ministers for supervising the work ofthe industries and checking their efficiency. The efficiency of these industries must depend primarily on the calibre of the men whoWere put in charge of them, and nothing should be done whichwould needlessly detract from their sense of responsibility. Inpresent circumstances much of the criticism directed against these industries was political and partisan in character, and was in con-trast with the relatively small amount of criticism which had been directed against public boards set up by other Governments beforethe war. Nevertheless, from the angle of public accountability, many
Ministers considered that more frequent debates in Parliament andthe institution of periodical enquiries would probably not be suffi-cient in themselves to allay public disquiet, and that the setting upof some form of efficiency check external to the individual boards would serve a useful purpose though it would probably be undesirable to use the term &quot; efficiency &quot; in its title since this mightbe thought to imply an existing state of inefficiency. A unit of thiskind could be used very effectively for probing into difficulties before they reached the stage at which Parliament and the public began toexpress concern about them.As regards the type of problems which would arise in connectionwith socialised industries, there was general agreement that questions relating to the structure of an industry&apos;s organisation,where it was not established by statute, would not normally be appropriate for any form of investigation other than discussion between the responsible Minister and the board of the industry. Asregards improvements in technical industrial operations, experience in the cotton industry and in engineering showed that outsideconsultants could make a useful contribution, though some of the boards would doubtless claim that they were already conductingadquate enquiries into possible developments. Experience would berequired to show the field for external investigations in respect of operations at the coal-face, in generating stations, gas works, on therailways and so forth. There remained the administrative organi-sation and the steps necessary to ensure that staff were not wasted.The experience of the Ministry of Civil Aviation suggested thatoutside consultants could here perform a useful function; thoughadmittedly some of the socialised industries already had Organi-sation and Methods branches.The Cabinet next discussed the extent to which the responsibleDepartments were staffed to meet the needs which the lord president had in mind in suggesting the establishment of a commonefficiency unit. The parent Department could not, and should not,have technical experts who could give authoritative advice to theMinister which might lead him to over-rule a view expressed by theboard of a socialised industry, since this would involve a wastefulduplication of staff with the socialised industry. The most that departments could have were administrative officers, with experience in the administrative questions which arose, and statisticians,economists and scientists who could draw attention to generalofficers could indicate to the Minister the questions to&quot;which answerswere required, but they could not be expected to advise on thetechnical steps necessary to meet any deficiencies which came to view.Some discussion followed on the question whether any commonefficiency unit which might be established should be responsible tothe boards of the socialised industries, to the Minister or toParliament. In favour of responsibility to the boards, it was argued that the members of the boards could not be expected readily toaccept a proposal that the Minister or Parliament should employ an instrument for probing alleged weaknesses in their organisation.If any such unit were made responsible to the Minister orto Parliament, there would be pressure for the publication of itsreports : if a report was favourable to a board, it would be said thatthe Minister had arranged for the board to be whitewashed and, ifit were unfavourable, there might be difficulty in retaining themembers of the board or public confidence in their ability. Moreover,the boards would collaborate more closely with an organisation whichwas responsible to them and which they called in when necessary.Some Ministers were doubtful, however, whether the establishmentof a unit solely responsible to the boards would satisfy parliament or the public. If a board was unduly complacent about its organisa-tion, it would never ask for assistance from the unit. It would alsobe argued that a unit of this character in no way improved the publicaccountability of the boards.  Those who considered that the boardsconsiderationsenquiries.   These
had been left, by statute, in too independent a position would demand that any common unit should be at the service of the Minister to investigate alleged inefficiencies which came to his notice.The general conclusion of Ministers was that proposals for sucha common unit Would have to be worked out in greater detail after thematter had been further explored with the chairmen of the boards of socialised industries. One possible solution would be to give anysuch unit a semi-independent position under the aegis of the BritishInstitute of Management. While an independent unit of this kind would normally be called in for consultation by the boards, it mightbe possible to secure acceptance of an arrangement by which the responsible Minister asked the unit to undertake a specific enquiryor was associated with the board in instituting an enquiry.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the general proposals in regard tosocialised industries which were put forward by the lord president in CP. (50) 60.(2) Agreed that the Socialisation of Industries Committee, inthe light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, should decide uponthe manner in which the need for some external checkson efficiency should be discussed with the chairmen of the boards of socialised industries.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,27 th April, 1950.
