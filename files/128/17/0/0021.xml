The Budget.(previous erence:;:CM. (50) 12th1Conclusions.)1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.housing programme.(previous reference:CM. (50) 10thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health (CP. (50) 67) stating that, if effect was to begiven to the cut in the housing programme which the Cabinet had approved on 21st October, 1949, the allocation of new houses to localauthorities in England and Wales for 1951 wvould have to be reducedto 120,000, as compared with 148,000 for 1950 and 170,000 for 1949.In view of the widespread public dissatisfaction at current housing conditions, the Minister believed that it would prove politically impossible to maintain the earlier decision; once its effects were known; and he thought it better that the Government should take theinitiative in reversing that decision rather than wait.until they were forced to do so in response to political pressure. He therefore sough?authority to make an allocation of 140,000 houses for 1951; and hesuggested that the announcement of this adjustment in the housing programme might appropriately be made by the Chancellor of theExchequer in his Budget speech.the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that for his part he favoured stabilising the housing programme at an appropriate figure for a period of two or three years; and he proposed that the pro-gramme for the whole of Great Britain should be stabilised, for thethree years 1950-52, at a completion rate of 200,000 houses a year,which was the rate originally envisaged for 1950 before the reductionapproved by the Cabinet on 21st October, 1949. This would mean that housing would be given a fixed priority, at this rate, in thecapital investment programme for those years, and that any necessary cuts in the total volume of investment would have to fallon other parts of the programme. He read to the Cabinet the terms in which he proposed, subject to their approval, to announce thisdecision in his Budget speech.In discussion there was general support for the proposal putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. It was thought thata statement on the lines suggested would ease the political difficultieswhich were arising from the public dissatisfaction at the current rate of house-building.The following particular points were raised in the dis-cussion:  .(a) Would it not be possible to justify this decision, as hadbeen suggested by the Minister of Health in paragraph 7 of cp. (50) 67, on the ground that the improvement in our economic position during 1949 had been greater than was originally foreseen ?The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this would pre-judge theconsideration which Ministers must shortly give to the whole problemof capital investment in 1951 and 1952 on the basis of a report whichhad just been completed by the Investment Programmes Committee.He himself believed that, whatever was done about housing, some means would have to be found of reducing the total volume ofexpenditure on capital investment.(6) In his statement in the Budget speech the Chancellor was proposing to say that the supply of building materials was becoming&quot;less critically difficult.&quot; The President of the Board of Tradepointed out that he still had difficulty in ensuring an adequate supplyof softwood, though his difficulty now was, not to find the quantityrequired, but to buy it from soft-currency countries at a reasonable price. He did not, however, object to the statement which theChancellor proposed to make, since it might serve to strengthen hisposition as a buyer from soft-currency countries.
3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in dealing in his budget speech with the general question of inflation, he would haveto make some general statement on the policy of restraint in relationto wages and personal incomes. He read to the Cabinet a draft ofthe passage on this subject which he proposed to include in his speech. -In discussion there was general agreement that the chancellor should state the, difficulties of finding an equitable policy for distri-buting the extra wealth made available by increased production, andshould urge that the current policy of restraint should not be broken down either in wages, salaries or profits until a better policy hadbeen worked out to take its place.Some suggestions were made for verbal amendment of the draftof the Chancellor&apos;s statement.The Cabinet Gave general approval to the statement on wages policywhich the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed to makein his Budget speech; and invited the Chancellor, in thelight of their discussion, to settle the detailed wording ofthe statement in consultation with the Minister of Labour.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,17 th April, 1950.wages policy.(previous reference:CM. (49) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)(c) If the housing programme were fixed as proposed, and a; -reduction had to be made in the total volume of expenditure on capital investment, would the cut be made to fall wholly on the investment programmes of the other social servicesT The Chancellorof the Exchequer said that Ministers would be free to decide wherethe cuts should fall throughout the whole field of capital investmentoutside the housing programme.,:&apos; &apos;: (d)&apos; - The -Secretary of State for: Scotland said that-he had- already-; planned that any reduction of the housing programme in scotland should be secured, not by reducing the total number of houses built,&quot;-&apos;&quot;        but by reducing the size of the houses and the standard of their equipment.   If, as now proposed, the housing programme was not; 1- - reduced but housing standards in Scotland were lowered, it would be&apos;;      - unreasonable that the Chancellor&apos;s formula (a completion rate of200,000 houses a year for the whole of Great Britain) should operate: to reduce the number of houses which might otherwise have been built in Scotland.   It was agreed that, in the application of this&apos; formula, account should be taken of any, adjustment of housingstandards in Scotland.     - i- &apos; -(e) It was suggested that there were strong political reasons for:    ! -introducing a greater measure of flexibility into the arrangementsfor granting licences to persons wishing to build their own houses.; The Minister of Health endorsed this suggestion and said that he..... would wish, after consultation with the Secretary of State for Scot-land, to put before his colleagues at a later meeting proposals some-what similar to those which the Cabinet had discussed on 9th March..^  The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that for the years 1950-52 the housing programme for Great Britain should be stabilised at a completionif rate of 200,000 houses a year; and authorised the Chan-1  cellor of the; Exchequer to make an announcement to this;   - effect in his Budget speech.. (2) Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to submit proposals for introducing agreater measure of flexibility into the arrangements for granting licences for the erection of houses by prospectiveowner-occupiers.
