1. The Cabinet were informed that there had been no material change in the situation in the London docks during the last twenty-four hours, but it must be expected that, as troops moved in, more men would come out on strike. Troops had so far been used onlyin the Royal docks but the Official Committee on Emergencies nowsought authority to use troops, starting on the following day, for theunloading of perishable cargoes at Hays Wharf and in the Westi India Dock. They also recommended that the special committee setup! in the Port of London should have discretion to vail for theservices of troops in other parts of the London docks, on the under-standing that specific authority would be sought from Ministersbefore troops were employed in circumstances which might leadto a substantial extension of the strike. Accommodation was being prepared in the London parks so as to enable the full number of20,000 troops to be employed, if required, in the docks. The strikerswere proposing to march to a meeting in Victoria Park on thefollowing day: the Commissioner of Police did not think that thismarch could be stopped in pursuance of the ban on political pro-cessions in the Metropolitan Police District, but he was keeping a close watch on the activities of the organisers to detect any possiblebreaches of the law. The police were also keeping a watchful eye onthe strikers&apos; pickets in Smithfield Market and elsewhere. TheLondon Dock Labour Board were keeping in close consultation withthe Ministry of Labour, and were showing a more co-operativeattitude than the National Board had done on the occasion of the dock strike in 1949.In discussion it was suggested that the introduction of troops into Hays Wharf and the West India Dock might be avoided if someof the dockers still at work there were diverted from the ships onwhich they were working to unload the perishable cargoes whichneeded urgent handling. It was pointed out, however, that if theywere asked to do this the men would conclude that they were being used as strike-breakers. It was the view of the Cabinet that itwould be preferable to use troops for the unloading of these perish -able cargoes.There were as yet no signs of the strike&apos;s spreading to portsother than London. It was, however, suggested that if ships whichwould normally have docked in London were diverted to other ports,this might provoke strike action in those ports.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that troops should be used for the unloading ofperishable cargoes at Hays Wharf and in the West IndiaDock.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to arrange for the specialcommittee set up in the Port of London to be givendiscretion to call for the services of troops in other partsof the London docks, on the understanding that specificauthority would be sought from Ministers before troops were employed in circumstances which might lead to anysubstantial extension of the strike.(3) Asked the Minister of Transport to consider what steps could be taken to prevent ships from being diverted from london to other ports, where there was a risk of thestrike spreading beyond the London docks.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 78) on the union of Arab Palestine with jordan and the de jure recognition of Israel.This stated that a union of Jordan and the part of ArabPalestine controlled by Jordon was likely to be voted shortly by theAssembly recently elected to represent both countries; and that, inthe view of the Foreign Secretary, this union would make an38669-2 b 2)24thons,4.)
important contribution towards the stability of the area and would strengthen Israel against Arab expansionism. It was therefore recommended that, when the union was proclaimed, His Majesty&apos;sGovernment should at once announce their recognition of it andshould declare that the provisions of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty would apply to the areas thus united to Jordan. This announcement should include appropriate reservations in respect of Jerusalem andthe frontier between Arab Palestine and Israel, and should include a statement that the United Kingdom Government had no intentionof establishing British military bases in time of peace in the portionof Arab Palestine to be united with Jordan. It was also recom-mended that His Majesty&apos;s Government should simultaneouslyaccord de jure recognition to Israel, with similar reservations inrespect of Jerusalem and the frontier between Israel and the neigh-bouring Arab States. Finally, it was recommended that these twoacts of recognition should be accompanied by a general statementreaffirming the desire of the United Kingdom Government for peace in the Middle East and their opposition to any use of force betweenMiddle Eastern States.The Minister of State said that events had run ahead of therecommendations in this memorandum, since the new Assembly atAmman had, as its first act on 24th April, passed a resolution pro-claiming the union of this part of Arab Palestine with Jordan. If,therefore, full benefit was to be reaped from the policy advocated inthe memorandum, the United Kingdom Government should lose no time in making the declarations recommended by the foreign secretary. These were likely to command widespread public support,both in this country and in most other parts of the world. Protestswould doubtless be lodged by the members of the Arab League; but these would have no effective backing and need not influence our policy.There was general support for the recommendations made in thememorandum. In discussion the following points were raised :-(a) Should we not seek to secure the support of the United StatesGovernment for the policy which we were proposing to follow ? TheCabinet were assured that the United States Government had beeninformed of the line which we proposed to take if and when KingAbdullah proclaimed a union between Jordan and Arab Palestine.There was no reason to believe that they would take exception toour policy of welcoming this union, though they would probably be unwilling., for reasons of domestic politics, themselves to make asimilar declaration. United States support would not commend our policy to the other Arab States; and, in the eyes of public opinion in other parts of the world, it needed nothing to commend it.(&amp;) Should not other Commonwealth Governments be informed and given an opportunity of making simultaneous declarations on similar lines? It was specially important that the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand, who had at our request delayed theirde facto recognition of Israel, should have advance notice of our intention to accord de jure recognition to Israel. The cabinet agreed that other Commonwealth Governments should be informed that once of our intentions, and that the public announcement shouldbe so timed as to give them reasonable opportunity to consider whatcorresponding action they should themselves take.(e) The Chiefs of Staff had questioned the necessity for any public announcement that British military bases would not beestablished in the portion of Arab Palestine now united to jordan and had asked that, if such an announcement had to be made, itshould be explicitly confined to the establishment of such bases intime of peace. The Cabinet were informed that the Government of israel had already been given an assurance that no such bases would
be established in peace-time. With a view to strengthening the posi-tion of that Government against their domestic critics, it was desirable that this assurance should now he given publicly.(d) In paragraph 4 of CP. (50) 78 it was stated that at a recent meeting of the Arab League Council King Abdullah&apos;s representative had acquiesced in a resolution to the effect that any member of theLeague signing a separate peace with Israel would be expelled and liable to sanctions. Was there any foundation for the rumour that itwas on the advice of British officials in the Middle East that KingAbdullah&apos;s representative had acquiesced in this resolution? TheMinister of State said that no such advice had been given by or onthe instructions of the Foreign Office, and he had no reason to believethat it had been given by any of His Majesty&apos;s diplomatic repre-sentatives in the area. He undertook, however, to make further enquiries on this point.The Cabinefs conclusions were as follows :-(1) A public declaration should be made at an early date onbehalf of the United Kingdom Government recognising the Union of Arab Palestine and Jordan and declaring that the provisions of the Anglo-Jordan Treaty appliedto the areas united to Jordan. This declaration should contain reservations, as stated in paragraph 11 of CP.(50) 78, regarding Jerusalem and the frontier betweenArab Palestine and Israel; and it should also include astatement that the United Kingdom Government had no intention of establishing British military bases in peace-time in the portion of Arab Palestine now to be unitedto Jordan.(2) The United Kingdom Government should accord de jure recognition to Israel, with similar provisos regardingJerusalem and the frontier between Israel and the neighbouring Arab States.(3) A general statement should be made reaffirming the desire of the United Kingdom Government for peace in theMiddle East and their opposition to any use of forcebetween Middle Eastern States.(4) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations should at once inform other Commonwealth Governments of theintention to make the declarations summarised in Con-clusions (l)-(3) above.(5) The Minister of State should arrange for the three declara-tions summarised in Conclusions (l)-(3) above to be madein a single statement in the House of Commons duringthe course of the current week. The timing of this state-ment should be concerted with the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations, with a view to giving other commonwealth Governments a reasonable opportunity toconsider whether they should take corresponding simul-taneous action.3. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute reference was made to the continuing difficulties of securingthe passage of sterling oil to the refinery at Haifa.The Cabinet were informed that doubts had been expressed about the legality of the action taken by the Egyptian Governmentin preventing the passage through the Suez Canal of tankers bound for Haifa. This point had been raised in the debate on foreignaffairs in the House of Commons on 28th March. It was suggestedthat the Cabinet should resume at an early date the preliminary dis-cussion which they had held on this matter on 14th November, 1949.The Minister of State said that the legal issues involved were underconsideration by the Law Officers.
The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to arrange that, as soon asthe Law Officers had given their Opinion, proposals forresolving the existing deadlock should be submitted forconsideration by the Cabinet.Receipts andExpenditureof the british transport(previous reference:CM. (50) 24thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (50) 76), prepared in consultation with the Ministerof State for Economic Affairs, setting out the conclusions they had reached as a result of their further examination into the applica-tion of the British Transport Commission for increases in railway freight rates and dock charges.The Minister of Transport said that he was satisfied that these increases could not be avoided by requiring the Railway Executive toreduce costs or by waiting for the results of the long-term integra-tion of transport services. He was also satisfied that the effects onthe cost of living and on prices generally had been exaggerated. the alternatives were, therefore, either to grant the increases or to givea Government subsidy to the British Transport Commission. If theCabinet agreed with the conclusion which he and the Minister ofState had reached, that the Commission&apos;s application should begranted, he proposed to announce the Government&apos;s decision in theHouse of Commons and to make available some of the information in CP. (50) 76 with a view to drawing attention to the main issues involved.The Minister of State for Economic Affairs said that it was clear from the further enquiry which he and the Minister of Trans-port had made that the railways&apos; losses were very largely due to theloss of Government traffic gince the end of the war, and to a reductionin railway passenger traffic which seemed to be largely due to changes in the travelling habits of the public. Even when integra-tion was completed, the road services would not be sufficiently largeor remunerative to meet the deficit on railway operation, nor couldthat deficit be met by increased efficiency on the railways. If someof the information in CP. (50) 76 were made available to parliament and to the public, care would have to be taken about the release ofthe information in paragraph 11, which might be be used by roadoperators in opposition to the increased petrol tax. He suggestedthat the Minister of Transport should present to the production committee from time to time statistics designed to show what pro-gress was being made by the Railway Executive in lowering costs,raising efficiency and increasing revenue.The Chancellor of the exchequer agreed that the Commission^application for an increase in railway freight rates and dock charges should be granted. He was not prepared to make a government grant to the British Transport Commission to meet their deficit.In subsequent discussion the following points were made : (a) If it had been shown that the present deficit on railwayoperation was a temporary feature, there might have been a case for granting a loan to the Commission to tide them over their present difficulties. In fact, however, the deficit appeared to containpermanent elements, due to the disparity between the level of costs and the level of charges; and the Commission would not be prepared,even if the Government had proposed it, to accept a loan to meetlosses in their current operation which were not transient in character. While an increase in railway charges would give rise tosome political difficulty, there would be similar difficulty in defend-ing either the grant of a subsidy to a socialised service or the con-tinuance of a weekly loss of about  500,000 for a period of one ortwo years.
(b) In the ordinary way any future application for the varia-tion of transport charges would be directed to the transport tribunal and not to the Minister, since the Commission hoped,Within the next year or so, to be able to put before the Tribunalco-ordinated charges schemes under the Transport Act. Theincrease in the petrol tax, which would seriously reduce the profits of the Commission on their road-passenger and haulage services,and any increase in wages granted to their lower-paid employees,would present the Commission with serious difficulties in the fram-ihg of their charges schemes. If, in addition, the Commission hadto liquidate a deficit, which by that time might have amounted to 75-  100 million, the Commission^ task in framing reasonablecharges schemes would become almost impossible.(c) Some Ministers were not entirely satisfied that the Corn-mission had taken all possible steps to effect economies. It waspointed out that the Transport Tribunal had declined to consider in detail whether the deficit could have been met by greatereconomies in passenger services or by the attraction of passengersby better and cleaner railway carriages, though it was pointed outin this connection that the Government, rather than railway executive, were responsible for delaying the replacement of oldrolling-stock by modern equipment. The Transport Tribunal had reported that the estimated economies for 1950 appeared to be dis-appointingly small; and, while it was true that (when allowance was made for the shorter hours worked) the man-power on therailways was probably no greater than before the war, it was feltthat there was room for further economies in labour.(d) Some railways overseas seemed to be in even greaterfinancial difficulties. Although it was argued in CP. (50) 76 thatthe revenue collected from commercial road vehicles covered expendi-ture on the roads, some Ministers considered that the long-termdifficulties of railway operation in this country would have to bemet by some form of Government assistance towards the maintenanceof the permanent way.(e) At a later stage it would be useful if a critical examinationwere made of the costs and revenue of the long-distance road-haulage service which the Ministry of Transport had operatedduring the war and which had now come under the British Trans-port Commission. The evidence given before the transport tribunal also suggested that there had been a substantial rise inthe volume of traffic carried by &quot; C &quot; licence-holders and, while itmight be difficult in present circumstances to pass legislation to restrict the operations of &quot; C &quot; licence-holders, Ministers would find it useful to know whether administrative action could be taken toprevent private haulage from growing at the expense of the trafficcarried by the Commission.(/) Although the time which the Cabniet had occupied in con-sidering the Commission^ application had increased the size of the deficit to be met, it had served the useful purpose of drawing theattention of the Commission to the need to provide fuller informa-tion to enable the Government to reach decisions on matters of thiskind. Ministers could not be expected to give decisions on such issues unless they were in possession of enough detailed information to enable them to appraise the situation adequately.(g) The Minister of Transport said that he had it in mind tosubmit to the Cabinet a memorandum on the main issues arisingfrom the organisation and operation of the British Transport Com-mission. In preparing this, he would bear in mind the various points which had been raised in the discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to approve theapplication of the British Transport Commission for increases in railway freight charges and dock and canal
charges; but invited him to remind the Commission ofthe need for continuing scrutiny of their organisation in order to secure all practicable economies.(2) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should announce theGovernments decision in a statement to be made in theHouse of Commons later that week, and should make available detailed information in support of the decisionon the lines of that contained in CP. (50) 76.(3) Took note that the Minister of Transport would shortlysubmit to the Cabinet a memorandum on general ques-tions arising in connection with the organisation and operation of the British Transport Commission.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,25th April, 1950.
