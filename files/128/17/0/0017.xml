Parliament.business in theHouse ofCommons.ForeignVisitingForces.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Easter Recess.I 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor, the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of State (CP. (50) 42) seeking authority to enterinto negotiations with the United States Government with a viewto securing their agreement to a modification of the war-timeprovisions under which the United States authorities exercisedexclusive criminal jurisdiction in respect of members of the UnitedStates Forces stationed in the United Kingdom. The memorandumcontemplated that, if this agreement could be secured, legislation would be introduced to give to the authorities responsible for Alliedvisiting Forces in this country concurrent criminal jurisdiction withthe civil courts in respect of offences committed by members ofthose Forces.The Lord Chancellor explained that, under an agreement signed by the Brussels Treaty Powers in 1949, it was contemplated that legislation would be jpassed in this country conferring jurisdiction,concurrently with the civil courts, on the courts-martial of the visiting Forces of the other signatories. It was desirable that thesame procedure should apply to United States troops in this country;and, while it would be difficult to get the United States Governmentto accept this, it was suggested in the memorandum that they mightbe persuaded to do so if an Undertaking were given that criminal proceedings would not be brought in a civil court against a memberof a visiting Force save with the consent of the Attorney-General orthe Director of Public Prosecutions or, in Scotland, the lord advocate.In subsequent discussion reference was made to the followingpoints : (a) The United States Administration would argue that it was difficult for them, on constitutional grounds, to place the membersof their Forces under the jurisdiction of foreign courts. Theywould also argue that, for the practical purpose of maintainingdiscipline, they must retain the power to impose for offences suchas rape the heavier penalties which were available under their military code.(6) Parliament would not be prepared to continue on apermanent basis the exclusive jurisdiction which had been grantedto the United States authorities under the war-time Act of 1942;nor could the United States Government expect the United KingdomGovernment to grant them this measure of extra-territoriality intime of peace. There might also be criticism of the procedure ofUnited States courts-martial and of the possible treatment of civilwitnesses in these courts though admittedly a foreign court-martialwould have no power to detain, or impose penalties upon, a witnesswho was not a member of the foreign Force.(c) Some Ministers were not satisfied that a proposal to conferconcurrent jurisdiction on the civil courts and on foreign courts-martial would work satisfactorily. It was suggested that in thelast resort the authorities who had the custody of the offender wouldbe able to enforce their right to try him. Would it not be better to follow the precedent of the Visiting Forces (British Common-wealth) Act, 1933, under which, by agreement, all offences of murder,manslaughter and. rape were tried in the civil courts? In reply,it was explained that there was in draft an elaborate agreementbetween the Brussels Treaty Powers, which would define the circum-stances in which cases would be tried under civil or military38573-2b 2
procedure, and it was hoped that a similar agreement would be concluded with the United States Government.(d) Ministers would find it useful to have further information about the manner in which the privileges afforded to the UnitedStates Forces since 1942 had worked in practice. What happened,for example, when an American soldier and a British subject werecharged jointly with a crime?(e) In any permanent legislation now introduced CommonwealthVisiting Forces should have treatment not less favourable than thataccorded to United States Forces.(/) The United Kingdom Government should insist onreciprocity in the course of the negotiations with the United states administration.It was the view of the Cabinet that this question should be examined again in the light of their discussion, and that a further memorandum should be submitted for their consideration containinginformation about the working of the existing arrangements andfocussing the points of general principle involved.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor, the Home Secretary, theMinister of Defence, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of State to examine further the privilegesto be granted to foreign visiting Forces, and to submit afurther memorandum for the consideration of the Cabinet.3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatthe gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area had risen by296 million dollars during the first quarter of 1950. He read to theCabinet the terms in which he proposed to announce this in the Houseof Commons on the following day. He wished in this statement to sound a note of caution, because the present favourable position might be partly due to temporary factors which would not recur andalso because it would be inexpedient to make an unduly optimisiticstatement at a time when the Appropriation Bill was passing through Congress.The Cabinet expressed their satisfaction at the favourable position which the Chancellor&apos;s statement disclosed. This reflectedgreat credit on the Chancellor of the Exchequer ,and the other ministers concerned, by whose efforts this notable improvement inthe country&apos;s balance of payments had been secured.It was suggested that the statement should give the correspond-ing figures for the first quarter of 1949, so as to counter any argu-ment that the Chancellor had not paid sufficient regard to seasonalfactors.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of the statement which theChancellor of the Exchequer proposed to make in the Houseof Commons on the following day on the present positionof the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofNational Insurance (CP. (50) 58) recommending acceptance of proposals which were about to be submitted by the national assistance Board for an increase in the scales of national assistance.It was proposed that the rates for a single householder should beincreased from 24s. a week to 26s. a week, and for a married couplefrom 4:0s. a week to 43s. 6d. a week. The total additional cost tothe Exchequer would be about  10 million a year.The Minister of National Insurance said that the national assistance Board had wished to put forward proposals for increases
in 1949, but bad then been persuaded to postpone doing so. The risein the cost of living, and particularly in the cost of food, made thepresent scales quite inadequate, and she hoped that the cabinet would accept the modest increases now proposed. She was satisfiedi that they would have no serious repercussions on rates of National. Insurance benefit; for comparatively few recipients of these benefitswere receiving supplementary national assistance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted the needfor the proposed increases and would make provision in his budget for the additional cost involved.The Minister of Pensions said that he would resist any claims,based on these proposals, for an increase in war pension rates. Forthese proposals were in line with the general policy of the Govern-ment that basic pension rates should not be raised, but necessitouscases should be dealt with specially; and the increased rates ofnational assistance would benefit some of the more unfortunate war pensioners and widows of war pensioners.In discussion there was general agreement that the existingscales of national assistance were inadequate; but some apprehen-sions were expressed lest an increase in these rates might be ex-ploited by those who were pressing for increases in other socialpayments. These increased rates would be linked with the rise inthe cost of living, and they would be exploited in arguments on wage claims. They would also involve a Supplementary Estimate in1950-51, since the Estimates for that year in respect of national assistance had already been submitted. Would it not be preferable to postpone the increases for, say, six months ? The general view ofMinisters was, however, that some alleviation of the plight of thosein receipt of national assistance was called for and that the present economic position of the country did not justify an endeavour to save  10 million a year by refusing relief to the poorest section ofthe community.The Cabinet then discussed the timing and the terms of theannouncement of these increases. After discussion it was finally agreed that the announcement should be made before the announce-ment of increases in food prices which the Minister of Food was tomake on Wednesday, 5th April. From the point of view of possible repercussions on wage claims, it was important that the announce-ment should not be made in terms which suggested that it was con-nected with the increases in food prices. The increases should notbe justified by reference to the cost of living : they should be presented as resulting from a review by the National assistance board, whose duty it was to take account of all the relevant factors.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the increases in the scales of national assistanceproposed in CP. (50) 58.(2) Invited the Minister of National Insurance to make anearly announcement of these increases in the House ofCommons, in terms to be agreed with the Minister ofLabour.5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Minister of Health and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CP. (50) 53, 56 and 57) on the cost of the national health Service.Reference: The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was his duty toO.M.(50)llth invite the Cabinet to consider two questions. First, were they pre-Conclusions, pared to contemplate that expenditure on the National HealthStinute 1.) Service should continue in future years at its present level of  392million, having regard to the other claims on the national resources ?Secondly, if it was admitted that some parts of this Service must be
expected to expand and that expenditure on this expansion would exceed any savings which might be made by economies in other partsof the Service, what measures could be adopted to ensure that thetotal expenditure could be kept within whatever limit the Cabinetthought appropriate? The proposals which he putforward for the cabinet&apos;s consideration, in reply to these two questions, were first,that in future years the net cost of this Service should not exceed I 350 million; and, secondly, that for the purpose of keepingexpenditure within that limit power should be taken to make charges for some of the facilities provided under the Service.  He had not thought it right to suggest at this stage what those charges might be.His colleagues would wish first to consider the question of principle;and in this connection he recalled that the Cabinet had already decided, on 21st October,  1949   (CM. (49) 61st Conclusions,Minute 2) that a charge for prescriptions should be, imposed. If theCabinet now agreed that the imposition of charges could be accepted in principle, he and the Health Ministers could together work out what charges would be required for the purpose of keeping the net annual cost within the limits of  392 million in 1950-51 and  350million thereafter.The Minister of Health agreed that the Cabinet should firstdiscuss the question of principle : it was for that reason that he hadrefrained from discussing in his memorandum the details of any possible charges.   Ministers had in fact considered this questionalready, in the discussions in the Economic Policy Committee inOctober 1949, about the reduction of Government expenditure(E.P.C. (49) 34th and 35th Meetings); and he had been under theimpression that they had then satisfied themselves that the principleof charges should not be applied generally throughout this Service.A large proportion of the total expenditure on the Service was incurred by the hospitals, and there would be great difficulties inrecovering a &quot; hotel &quot; charge from the occupants of hospital beds.For a wide range of hospital treatment, particularly in Scotland,no charge had ever been made even before the introduction of theNational Health Service.   And the deduction of sickness benefit which was already made after the recipient had been in hospitalfor more than eight weeks was in effect equivalent to a charge. Evenif it were now decided that hospital patients should contribute tenshillings a week from the date of their admission to hospital thetotal revenue raised could not exceed  10 million. And he could notpredict how much of this total would in fact be recovered; for hewas satisfied that, if such a system had to be introduced, it must be operated by the National Assistance Board and not through a revival of the almoners&apos; functions in the hospitals, and he could not say what criterion the Board would apply in determining the patienfscapacity to make such a contribution.  In the dental service he didnot favour the introduction of charges : he would prefer to proceed by way of closer scrutiny of the dentists&apos; claims, if the treasury would agree to the appointment of not more than twenty inspectorsfor this purpose.   In the ophthalmic services he was prepared toreduce the choice of spectacle frames provided free of charge, andto increase the charges made for other kinds of frames; and he expected to secure by this means a saving of  1 million. As regardsprescriptions he no longer favoured the proposal to impose a charge:he would prefer to seek economies by prohibiting doctors fromprescribing proprietary medicines.He was glad that the Chancellor of the Exchequer accepted thefact that expansions in some parts of the Service were inevitableHe had particularly in mind the need for new buildings and capital equipment for the hospital service. He thought it unreasonable that capital expenditure of this kind should have to be met as an annualrevenue charge; and he suggested that, as a matter of accounting,arrangements should be made to spread this type of expenditure overa number of years.
The Minister pointed out that, if a system of charges was to beintroduced, amending legislation would be required. This legisla-tion might be criticised by the Opposition, and would be unpopular with Government supporters; and in the existing parliamentary situation the Government might well find it difficult to pass sucha Bill through the House of Commons. The Governments abandon-ment of the principle of a free and comprehensive health service would be a shock to their supporters in this country and a gravedisappointment to Socialist opinion throughout the world. TheGovernment had so far had experience of only one full year&apos;sworking of the existing system; and he strongly urged that theyshould not abandon the principle of a free service on the basis of experience over so short a period.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he accepted the chancellors view that there should be some means of limitingexpenditure on this Service. He had therefore given, in his memorandum, some indication of the revenue which might beobtained in Scotland through the imposition of charges. Hestressed the difficulty of obtaining any substantial revenue from theimposition of charges in respect of the hospital service. As theMinister of Health had said, a wide range of hospital treatmenthad been available in Scotland free of charge for many years beforethe introduction of the National Health. Service and there wouldbe special difficulty in recovering charges from patients in Scottishhospitals. In any event, it should be remembered that 40 per cent,of the hospital beds in Scotland were occupied by mental patients,including mental defectives, for whom no charge could be recovered.In his view, it was mainly outside the hospital service that economiesmust be sought; and he doubted whether savings of the magnitudesuggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer could be securedwholly by means of charges. He himself believed that, if economieson this scale had to be realised, it would also be necessary to reducethe scope of some of the services, e.g., by restricting free dentalservices to young people and by suspending the supplementaryophthalmic service. This type of retrenchment could be defended,so long as an efficient hospital service and general practitionerservice continued to be provided free of charge. Finally, however,he pointed out that, even if Ministers favoured such drastic tretrenchments as these, their financial effects would not begin to be felt until near the end of the current financial year; and, as it wouldbe easier to estimate in six months&apos; time the future level of demandupon the dental and ophthalmic services, it might be expedient to defer announcing until then any major departure from the principleof a free and comprehensive health service.The Lord President said that he shared the Chancellors con-cern at the mounting cost of this Service. In his Budget speech on 6th April, 1949, the Chancellor had announced that Supple-mentary Estimates would in future be allowed &quot; only in special cases such as, for example, major changes of policy.&quot; But, in spiteof this, a Supplementary Estimate of nearly  100 million had hadto be presented for the Health Service. When this was made thesubject of criticism in the House of Commons on 14th March, 1950,the Chancellor of the Exchequer had stated that the Estimate of 392 million for this Service for 1950-51 would be regarded &quot; as a ceiling beyond which we must not be carried by new developmentsor extensions of existing services which cannot be provided out ofascertained economies in other directions.&quot; It would be intolerableif, after this statement, a Supplementary Estimate for this service had again to be presented in 1950-51; and the Chancellor and his cabinet colleagues were entitled to satisfy themselves that thiswould not prove to be necessary. He himself found in the memo-randum by the Minister of Health no guarantee that expenditureon this Service in the current financial year could be kept within
the limits of the original Estimate.. He strongly supported theChancellor&apos;s suggestion that the Government should put themselvesin a position, by taking power to recover charges for some of thefacilities provided, to. obtain some revenue to offset increasingexpenditure on this Service. He believed that, in seeking to pro-vide a comprehensive health service for all, the Government hadbeen trying to do too much too quickly. Some priority needs were jUndoubtedly suffering as a result: he instanced the falling-off inthe standard of dental services provided for school children. while he recognised the political difficulties of abandoning the principleof a free service, he believed that there was equal political danger in allowing expenditure on this Service to continue unchecked. Ifthis expenditure continued to increase, a popular scheme wouldbecome discredited.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting to be held on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd April, 1950.
