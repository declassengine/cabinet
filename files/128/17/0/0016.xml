1. On the previous evening the Opposition had forced a division in the House of Commoris on the motion for the adjourn-ment, in order to emphasise the criticisms which they had expressedin a debate on coal and oil supplies. This division had beenunexpected, and a considerable number of Government supporterswere absent from the House at the time. As a result the Govern-ment had been defeated by 283 votes to 257. The Prime ministers aid he did not propose to treat this as an issue of confidence and,if asked for a statement in the House that afternoon, he would saythat the Government did not intend to resign office in consequenceof this defeat. This incident would, however, serve to remind all government supporters of the importance of regular attendance at westminster when the House was sitting, and the Whips shouldtake steps to ensure that its significance was fully appreciated in theParty. The Whips would normally try to avoid divisions betweenthe hours of 3 - 30 p.m. and :7 p,m., in Order that Ministers might bebetter able to devote the afternoons to the work of: their Depart-ments; but after 7 p.m. Ministers must be prepared to set an example of regular attendance at the House.The Cabinet also took note of the fact that six Labour members had voted against the Government in the motion to apply the closureto the debate on 28th March on the Government&apos;s handling of theclaim of Seretse Khama to the chieftainship of the BamangwatoTribe.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that the announcement of the increased prices for butter and bacon would be made in the House of Commons.These price changes were normally announced through the Press;but on this occasion a Parliamentary Question had been put downand deferred at the Ministers request and it would therefore bemore appropriate that the first announcement should be made inParliament. The Lord President took this opportunity of remind-ing Ministers that, when announcements were to be made in replyto arranged Questions in the House of Commons, it was desirablethat as a general rule a supporter of the Government should begiven the chance of putting down the Question.It had been suggested that a Minister should address theParliamentary Labour Party, at their next meeting on 5th April,on the Economic Survey for 1950. If the Chancellor of theExchequer did this, there was a risk that he would be questionedabout his forthcoming Budget. It was therefore agreed that theMinister of State for Economic Affairs should address this meeting.It was further agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would speak at a meeting of the Parliamentary Party to be held imme-diately after his introduction of the Budget. The housing pro-gramme should not be discussed at a Party meeting until after theGovernment had considered the investment programme for 1951.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 43) on the decartelisation and reorganisation of the iron and steel and coal industries in Germany.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for ForeignAffairs said that provisions for the deconcentration and reorganisa-tion of these industries had been included in Military GovernmentLaw 75 concerning the British and United States Zones of Germany,which was made in November 1948. Unfortunately, however, thisLaw had not been carried into effect because of differences of view between the British and United States.High Commissioners. Whenthe High Commission and the Federal Government covering thewhole of Western Germany, including the French.Zone, were con-stituted, Law 75 came up for revision and for agreement with the-1 b 2
French. The French would raise objection to the preamble of theLaw, which left the Federal Government to determine the futureownership of these industries, but it was unlikely that they wouldpress their objection against a firm stand by the United Kingdomand United States High Commissioners. Difficulty would, howeverarise with the United States authorities who wished to remove threefirms from the list of those definitely scheduled for liquidation, andto transfer them to the list of those whose assets and propertiesmight be included in the plans for reorganisation which were being prepared. The Americans were primarily concerned with the firmof Stinnes, in which United States financial interests were heavilycommitted, but they were also supporting the transfer to the otherlist of the firms of Thyssen Bornemisza and Ilseder Hiitte, in thefirst of which Dutch interests were involved. The Foreign Secretaryconsidered that a, stand should be taken against the transfer of these three firms from one list to another. If, however, the Cabinet feltthat it was more important to preserve the rest of the revisedLaw 75, rather than have a breach with the Americans, the british high Commissioner might suggest as a compromise that any firmmight be transferred from the list of firms to be liquidated if itcould be shown that United Nations nationals had held apredominant financial interest in it in September 1939.The Cabinet first considered the question of the future owner-ship of these industries, and the following points were made in discussion: (a) The Minister of Health said that in correspondence withthe Prime Minister in November 1948, he had expressed disquietabout the proposal that the ownership of the Ruhr industries shouldbe determined by the future Federal Government of western germany. He had foreseen that the first Government of western germany was likely to be a government of the Right (as had in facthappened) which would be under strong pressure from Germanbusiness interests. If such a Government returned these industries to private ownership, the pacification of Europe would be made more difficult and agreement with Eastern Germany more hard tosecure. He had accordingly suggested in 1948 that a provision should be inserted in the Law to the effect that no transfer to private ownership should be permitted within five years of the passage of theLaw. He was still anxious that nothing should be done to prejudice the transfer of the Ruhr industries to public ownership.(&amp;) On the other hand it was argued that the decision taken in1948 to leave the question of the ownership of these industries tothe future Government of Western Germany represented a con-siderable victory Over the United States point of view. It had been impossible at that time to predict with certainty the political com-plexion of the future Government of Western Germany, and in any event it was right that a matter of this kind should be left for freedecision by democratic processes. Admittedly, there was no indication in the Law at what stage the German Government would decide on the ownership of the Ruhr industries; but, if at some future date a Left-wing German Government were elected, it wouldbe open to it to bring these industries under public ownership.(c) The French Government and the French Socialists were opposed to German ownership of these industries, whether privateor public, since they feared that a Germany which had full controlover them would be enabled to become an aggressor. Accordingly!the French favoured international ownership of the Ruhr industries,but the details of any such arrangement would be exceedingly difficult to work out and would encounter both German and UnitedStates opposition. An element of international control was provided by the Ruhr Authority.(d) Law 75 remained in force notwithstanding the changes i&quot;the constitutional position of Western Germany. The UnitedKingdom Government, after due consideration, had: decided that
the question of the ownership of the Ruhr industries should be leftto the German Government. In view of the opposition of theUnited States Administration and the German Government to anyattempt to impose a scheme of public ownership at this stage, thequestion of public ownership could not be reopened with any prospect of success.As regards the three firms which the United States authoritieswished to remove from the list of undertakings scheduled forliquidation, the following points were made in discussion: (e) Any scheme of deconcentration which omitted the firms ofStinnes, Thyssen Bornemisza and Ilseder Hiitte would be generally regarded as failing to give effect to the general objects of the plan.(/) The Minister of Defence said that the continued existenceof the Stinnes combine would involve a dangerous addition toGermany&apos;s war potential.\g) The possible compromise suggested by the Foreign Office,namely, that firms which were mainly owned by United nation nationals in September 1939 might be removed from the list of undertakings scheduled for liquidation, was unlikely to be accept-able to the United States authorities since it was reasonably clearthat any predominant American interest in the Stinnes combine hadbeen acquired in recent years.The Cabinet- ,&quot;&apos;&apos; ; \ \ &apos;.&apos;r&quot; &apos;Agreed that the Foreign Secretary might authorise theBritish High Commissioner in Germany to agree to theproposed revision of; Military Government Law 75,provided that the firms of Stinnes, Thyssen Bornemiszaand Ilseder Hutte remained on the list of undertakingsscheduled for liquidation.Future of 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-Emergenoy dent (CP. (50) 49) on the steps Which should be taken to continuePowers. in force various emergency powers which were due to expire on. 10th December, 1950.(Previous \.-r-,-r- &apos; ,    .reference: The Lord President said that the. various economic controls,CM. (45)38th and a large number of other powers which Government DepartmentsConclusions, required, were kept in force by the Supplies and Services (Transi-Minute l.) tional Powers) Act, 1945, and the Emergency Powers (Miscel-laneous Provisions) Act, 1947, which were due to expire on10th December, 1950, unless continued in force from year to yearby Orders in Council made in consequence of Addresses presented by both Houses. It was not satisfactory that powers essential to continue planning should be linked so obviously with the continu-ance of war-time legislation and should rest on such an uncertainbasis as annual rertewals dependent on the passing of Addresses by both Houses of Parliament. In these circumstances he favoured theintroduction next session of an Economic Controls Bill, which would place on a permanent basis the powers required for the Governmentseconomic planning. There was a risk, which would have to be faced,that in the present Parliamentary situation efforts might be madeto cut down these powers or make them subject to unnecessaryParliamentary safeguards. If for any reason the Governmentfailed to secure the Bill, it might be made an issue at the nextElection that the Government had been denied the powers needed to secure full employment, fair shares, rationing and price control.The whole subject would have to be examined in detail by the lord presidents Committee, and the first stage would be the drafting of a Bill on economic controls. The Cabinet would have a lateropportunity to examine the Bill and the other detailed proposals to be put forward by the Lord Presidents Committee.In discussion, several Ministers expressed serious doubts aboutthe expediency of trying to secure the passage of an Economic38573-1 b 3
Controls Bill in the present Parliamentary situation. To enable them to deal with all possible contingencies, the Government wouldhave to seek very wide powers capable of being used for action far more drastic than any which was likely to be taken in practice, andthey would lay themselves open to the criticism that they were seeking the powers of a totalitarian regime. Both Houses, andmore particularly the House of Lords, might insist on introducingsafeguards and restrictions on the Governments powers which,while appearing reasonable, would seriously impede the operationof the economic controls. It would be difficult in an election campaign to represent such action as an unwarrantable denial of necessary powers. As an Election issue a refusal to renewexisting powers could be exploited to much greater advantage thanthe refusal of a demand for fresh powers, especially if those freshpowers were necessarily wider in terms than the use which was actually being made of existing powers.The Government would be in a stronger position if in an election campaign they confined themselves to a statement of the controls which they wished to continue in operation, and left the wide legal framework underlying those controls to be indicated after they had been returned to office with a working majority. Mean-while, there was no reason to apprehend serious difficulty in securing a temporary renewal of existing powers by Addresses from bothHouses before 10th December, 1950.There was general agreement, however, that preparations forthe drafting of an Economic Controls Bill should be put in hand,so that the Government could consider at a later stage the most convenient time for its introduction. The Lord Presidents Com-mittee could supervise the discussion of the means by which to keepin force the various&apos;emergency powers which were still required.The Home Secretary said that he hoped that a Minister respon-sible for economic affairs would take charge of any economic controls Bills which might, in due course, be introduced. that bill should, be separate from any measures required to continue inforce the other emergencv powers which were required, whethertemporarily or permanently. He had not regarded as satisfactorythe arrangement under which the Home Secretary was responsiblefor the Bill which became the Supplies and Services (transitional powers) Act, 1945.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the necessary steps should be taken, under the. aegis of the Lord Presidents Committee, to examine thelegal form in which essential economic controls shouldbe continued in force on a long-term basis; but deferred for later consideration the question whether such legis-lation could appropriately be introduced in the present parliament.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the Lord Presi-dent&apos;s Committee to make a detailed examination of theneed for continuing the various other emergency powersand of the manner in which those required should becontinued in force.economic affairs.(previous reference:G.M.(49)72ndConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (50) 47) covering a report on the economicsituation. the following points were made in discussion : The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that as in previous years a popular version of the Economic Survey had been published. Hewould be glad if his colleagues would look at this and let him knowwhether they thought it would make the right impact on theordinary reader.
Some newspaper critics of the Economic Survey for 1950 had drawn the conclusion that this marked the end of the Governmentsattempts to plan the distribution of man-power. In fact, althoughit was no longer appropriate to speak in terms of man-power&quot;targets&quot; since the withdrawal of the power to direct labour, afair measure of success had attended the Governments efforts to. influence by other means the redistribution of labour. Thus, thegrowth of the labour-force in the textile industries was continuing,and the rise in the numbers employed in distribution appeared tohave been checked. On the other hand, the labour-force of the coal-mining industry continued to decline., the numbers employed at thecoal face having dropped by 8,000 during the twelve months endedJanuary 1950. The Cabinet were informed that the man-powerproblem of the coal-mining industry was, not so much to increasethe total number of face-workers, but rather to redistribute theexisting labour-force between the various coal-fields there was a surplus of face-workers in some fields and a shortage in others.Some progress had already been made with this transfer of labour,notably in Scotland; but it gave rise to difficult social problems and the pace at which it could be carried out was limited, inparticular, by the shortage of housing accommodation.Attention was drawn to the fact that during 1949 the totalworking population had increased by 133,000, as compared withthe forecast of only 15,000 in the Economic Survey for 1949. Thiswas due mainly to the fact that the number of women remaining in, or entering, industry was much larger than had been expected :the extent to which women would remain in industrial employmenthad been consistently under-estimated since 1945. In thisconnection reference was again made to the tendency to under-estimate the increase in industrial productivity, and to assume thatin various industries production must have reached its peak.Ministers emphasised the dangers of being led by such conservativeestimates as these to adopt difficult political policies, which provedin the event to have been unnecessary.Reference was made to the comparison, in paragraph 7 of cp. (50) 47, between the rate of unemployment in Great Britainand that in the United States and in Northern Ireland. Ministersthought it unprofitable to contrast conditions here with those inthe United States, since they would not be prepared to accept theconditions of unemployment which were tolerated in the UnitedStates. Moreover, it would be inappropriate to group NorthernIreland with the United States for this purpose, as the paragraphseemed at first sight to do. These international comparisons shouldbe handled cautiously, and it would certainly be inadvisable thatany public use should be made of them.The tonnage of merchant vessels under construction continuedto decline, and in the shipbuilding areas there was widespread fearof unemployment. It was pointed out that a very large volume ofnew orders had been placed in February, and there seemed to beno reason to fear any sharp recession in ship-building. Ship repairs,on the other hand, were bound to fall off now that the war-timearrears had been so largely overtaken. The future of the ship-building and ship-repairing industries was being reviewed by aspecial working party, whose report was expected in about a month&apos;s time. This was likely to show the need for introducing otherindustries into the areas which were excessively dependent on ship-building and ship-repairing. So far, however, the number ofredundancies in these industries had been much smaller than hadbeen expected; and most of the men concerned had been absorbed into other employment.The enquiries made by the Ministry of Labour into weekly earnings in the manufacturing and certain other industries inOctober 1949 showed that the average weekly earnings of men were107 per cent, higher than in October 1938 and had increased by4s. Qd. a week since October 1948.   Average hours worked by men
Production.external trade.Balance ofPayments.Stocks ofAnimalFeeding-stuffs.(previous reference:CM. (50)9thConclusions,Minute 3.)(including overtime) had increased.slightly from 46-7 hours ;a oweekin October 19.48 to 46 - 8 hours in October 1949. These figures showed that there was no foundation for the suggestion that average earnings were decreasing because less overtime was being worked.On the contrary, average earnings continued to increase, and therewiasmorreduotion in the amount of overtime which was being worked.In the year. ended October 1949 increased earnings probablyamounted to something, like  250 million. The fact that the workers had obtained this share of :the increase in the total volume of pro-duction should be kept in mind in considering (representationsagainst the stabilisation of wage rates.Production continued to increase at a rate surpassing expectation-tations. In the industries covered by the Index of Production, pro-productivity had risen in 1949 by 5-  per cent. And provisionalfigures for the first two months of 1950 suggested that total indus-trial production was about 9 per cent, higher than in the corres-ponding months of 1949. This represented an increase in productivity of about 7^ per cent. During the past year the total output of coal had increased, though the labour force in the industry had dropped by 20,000 men.   As a result costs were falling.Some signs were being reported of a surplus of jcoal in certain parts of europe There was as yet no difficulty in finding export markets for good quality coal from the United Kingdom; but, as time went on, it would doubtless become more difficult to maintain our exports. As a first step, advantage could be-taken of the fallingcosts of production to reduce.the export prices of our coal. In thelong run, however, it would probably be necessary to negotiate a european Goal Agreement; and, in view of the difficulties which thiswould present, there was much to be said for giving some preliminarythought to it in the near future.There had been a notable expansion in the export of cars andtrucks; and the two main manufacturers were now exporting over90 per cent of their total production. The fears that an undueproportion of this output would go into the home market had so far been falsified.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would beannouncing on 4th April the latest figures of the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area; and he would give ;the Cabinet thelatest information on the balance of payments position at their meeting on 3rd April.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (50) 47 and of the points made in thediscussion.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 48) on the suggestion that his Department had built up excessive stocks of animal feeding-stuffs, with the result thatsome part of them went bad before they could be used.The Minister of Food said that, since this point had beenbrought to his notice at the Cabinefs meeting on 9th March, he had made careful enquiries and was glad to be able to submit a reassuringreport. In the year ended March 1949, out of a total of 1,670,000tons of feeding-stuffs taken into store, only 4,117 tons, or 0-25 percent., had been lost: from i infestation and other. causes, i As a resultof the special steps taken by the Ministry of Agriculture to checkinfestation, the amount lost from this cause was very small in com-parison with the total quantities which had to be held in store toensure that the rations could be honoured.The Cabinet agreed that the situation revealed by this report was satisfactory. It was, however, important that all the measures taken to prevent the loss of food-stuffs through infestation should becontinued in full force.
93CM. 16 (59)The Cabinet-Took note of the memorandum (CP. (50) 48) submitted bythe Minister of Food.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President ofthe Board of Trade (CP. (50) 52) seeking authority to introduce a one-clause Bill enlarging the powers of the Board of Trade to advance money to the National Film Finance Corporation.The President of the Board of Trade explained that he was notyet in a position to put before his colleagues his long-term proposals regarding the future of the British film industry and that if, as was likely, these proposals involved legislation, it would be some little time before they could take practical effect. The National FilmFinance Corporation had done excellent work in keeping the more efficient elements of the industry in production in this interim period, and it was desirable that they should be enabled to continuethis work. The funds originally placed at their disposal were, how-ever, becoming exhausted; and he now wished to obtain power toprovide them with a further  1 million so that they might continue their work until a long-term policy could be put into effect.In discussion the hope was expressed that the President of theBoard of Trade would be able to bring his long-term proposals to theCabinet in the fairly near future. A great deal of information about this industry had been collected as a result of the variousenquiries which had been made; and the Government would find themselves in Parliamentary difficulties if they were not able fairlysoon to announce some long-term policy. The Chancellor of theExchequer supported this view, but said that in the meantime hewas prepared to agree that a further sum of  1 million should bemade available to the National Film Finance Corporation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that legislation should be introduced during thecurrent Session to increase from  5 million to  6 million the total amount which the Board of Trade mightadvance to the National Film Finance Corporation.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to announce, in the debate that afternoon on the cinema to-graph Films (Quota) Amendment Order, the Govern-menfs intention to introduce this legislation at an earlydate.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th March, 1950.
