The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 77) on the legal aspects of the situation arisingfrom the stoppage of work in the London Docks.The Minister of Labour said that there had been some increasein the number of dockers who had stopped work in the Royal Docks.In the Pool area there was no change, and elsewhere in the london docks the men were still working. Stevedores were working at allthe docks where dockers were working. He thought that theGovernment should not take any action and, in particular, shouldnot send any troops into the docks, until the situation could befurther reviewed on 24th April! The National Dock Labour board had not arranged any meeting, but his Ministry had been informed by the chairman of the London Dock Labour Board that, at a meet-ing that afternoon, his Board would consider whether they shouldpost a notice informing men that, if they did not return to work bya given date, they would be regarded as dismissed from the scheme.As regards the dispute between the Stevedores&apos; Union and Messrs.Shaw, Savill and Albion, the stevedores had on the previous eveningrejected a suggestion that the matter should be handled by theconciliation machinery of the industry, and had declined to go to arbitration. If the employers agreed, it would probably be desirableto refer the. matter to the National Arbitration Tribunal. For-unfortunately, there was no question of a crisis in the next few days asthe snip where the new arrangements were to be tried out could notyet be worked. &apos;the Home Secretary said that the Emergencies Committee hadreviewed the position on the previous evening. The Service Depart-ments had indicated that 1,000 troops could be made,available by24th April, but they were anxious that, if possible, the week-endleave of the troops should not be interfered with. arrangements would be made for officers to visit the docks on Sunday, in mufti,to plan the work of the troops. It would be undesirable that troops should be employed in any part of the docks where the strikeappeared to be on the point of collapsing or where substantial numbers of men were still at work.The Attorney-General said that, as indicated in his memo-randum, the present stoppage was not a &quot;trade dispute &quot; and wasnot, therefore, illegal within the terms of the Conditions of Employ-ment and National Arbitration Order, 1940. The disciplinarycode under the Dock Workers (Regulation of Employment) Order,1947, had, however, been infringed; and it would be open to the dock Labour Board to suspend men for a period not exceedingseven days, or to discharge them from the scheme. Since the menwere already suspending themselves from the scheme, suspensionas distinct from discharge did not appear to be an effective remedy.Employers could probably institute civil proceedings in the county court or police court for breach of contract, where men engaged ondaily or longer contracts had stopped work in the middle of the day.It would, of course, be difficult to assess the amount of the damagesand those awarded against individual dockers might be of the orderof  1 or less. As regards the threatened strike of stevedores, whichwould probably be illegal within the terms of the 1940 Order, he feltthat it would be difficult for him to refrain from prosecutions sincethe Order, so long as it remained in force, could not be allowed tobecome a dead letter. He would, however, be glad to have the viewsof Ministers on the political and other repercussions of anyprosecutions, in order to assist him in reaching a decision on thequestion.In subsequent discussion the following points were made : (a) Ministers with experience of the practice of bringing civil proceedings against miners who came out on strike in breach of contract were in favour of encouraging the employers to bring pro-feedings against the 2,000 dockers, mainly in the Royal Docks, whoLondon DockStrike.(previous reference erence:CM. (50) 22ndConclusions.Minute 3.)
were believed to have broken their contract by stopping work in themiddle of the day. In the long run civil penalties were likely to bemore effective in discouraging Communist-inspired stoppages thanattempts to enforce the disciplinary code against large numbers ofworkers. The unions could undertake the defence of the men incourt and could endeavour to compound with the employers on theamounts which had eventually to be paid; and this would help tostrengthen the position of the unions. Other Ministers were doubt-ful whether it was expedient for the Government to encourageemployers to take civil proceedings; and The Minister of Transportsaid that, while the employers might be prepared to take proeeed-ings, they would undoubtedly argue that the proper course was forthe Dock Labour Board to take action under the disciplinary code.(6) Attention was drawn to the difficult situation which would arise if the London Dock Labour Board dismissed over 7,000 dockerswho had stopped work, since this might lead to a wide extension ofthe stoppage and it would be necessary to employ troops in place ofthe dockers for a period the length of which could not be predicted.The general view of Ministers was, however, that the Governmentshould not purport to take a decision which rested properly with the dock Labour Board. The Unions were represented on the LondonBoard; and it was understood that, if a majority of either theemployers&apos; or workers&apos; side were against any proposed action, thematter was then referred to the National Board. All the considera-tions which were troubling Ministers would be present to the minds of the union representatives on the London Board, particularly onthe present occasion, when the authority of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union was at issue. The Minister of labour would doubtless be given an opportunity of seeing the terms of anynotice which the London Board proposed to put up.(c) The Minister of Labour, in consultation with the Ministerof Transport, should consider whether the Dock Labour scheme might not usefully be amended to enable the National Board, or localboards, to sue dockers for pecuniary penalties in respect of breaches of the disciplinary code. This might prove a more practical deter-rent, where large numbers of men were involved, than the presentsanctions of suspension or discharge. &apos; If the Scheme were beingamended, the occasion might usefully be taken to consider whetherthe composition of the Boards should be altered.(d) The Cabinet agreed to postpone for consideration at a later meeting the question whether Ministers should express a view onthe possible repercussions of a prosecution of stevedores, if theyengaged in an illegal strike, for breach of the Conditions of Employ-ment and National Arbitration Order, 1940.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should not endeavour to influence the London Dock Labour Board in any decisionit might reach later that day on applying the disci-plinary provisions of the Dock Labour Scheme.(2) Agreed that, though preliminary preparations should go forward, Service labour should not be introduced intothe London Docks until Ministers had had a further opportunity to consider the situation on 24th April.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Transport, to consider whether the dock labour Scheme should be amended to enable the national board or local boards to sue for pecuniary penaltiesagainst dockers who broke their contracts.
