ParMament,Business inthe Houseof Commons.. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.   .      .The Opposition were stilk anxious to have an early opportunityto. debate the French proposal for the integration of the coal and steelindiusjtnes, pf W^terh Europe, and it how seemed likely that theywould elect to use a Supply day for this purpose on 26th June.Leasehold;(PreviousReferenceCM. (50) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The Conitiiitjtee On Leasehold had presented their final report; and at a meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on14th June there had been strong pressure for early legislation on thissubject. The, suggestion had been made at-the nieeting that, if itwere found that comprehensive reform, of the existitig law on thebasis of the Committee^ recbmmehdatidils would present parliament with a complex and protracted task, the Gbvernhjeht should promotean interim bill in the form of a moratorium designed to give relief toleaseholders pending the enactment of permanent legislation.The Lord Chancellor saidthat he had not yet had time to study the Cbmmittee&apos;s report in detail; but. it might prove possible to extract frbih it and embody in an interim Bill some proposals com-mandirig a general measure of agreement which would represent aninstalment towards a more comprehensive reform of, the law whichmight follow at a later stage. The Cabinet Were, however, inclined to take the provisional view that, oh political and other grounds,it might be preferable tb consider interim legislation in the form ofa moratorium. It Was recdgiiised that a decision on this point shouldbe taken as quickly as pbssible; and that for this reason no time should be lost in making available to Ministers proof copies of theC0mmittee&apos;s report.The Cabinet-Invited,the Lord Chancellor to arrange for proofs of the&apos;^m^^t^&apos;s,r^^,tp/b^:pi^ted and circulated to ministers with the least possible delay.Parliament.disqualification-cation ofa. Member.(previous reference: ; .C-M. (50) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)3: The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 121) about the action to be taken on the reportof the Select Committee which had considered the questions arisingfrom the election of the Rev. J. G. MacMariaway, a clergyman ofthe Church of Ireland, as Member of Parliament for West Belfast.The Attorney-General said that the position had altered since his memorandum was Written, as Mr. MacManaway had now taken the oath, though it was not yet clear whether he proposed to take any further part in Parliamentary proceedings. In present circurn-stances three courses seemed to be open to the Government. Theymight take hp action at all, though it seemed ciear that there wouldbe strong pressure for action to be taken on the report of the SelectCpmmittee. They might introduce legislation which, in its simplestform, might be to the effect that the House pf Commons (ClergyDisqualification) Act, 1801, should apply only to beneficed clergy ofthe Church of England and placed ministers of the Church of Scot-land, though it was clear that any such Bill would leave manyanomalies and would raise the whole question of the disqualificationof the clergy of various denominations. Or, thirdly, they mightpropose that the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council should beasked for an advisory opinion on the case of Mr. MacManaway. he himself still favoured the third course.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It seemed unlikely that opinion in the House of commons would be in favour of taking no action at all. It would be regarded
as unsatisfactory that Mr. MacManaway&apos;s position should remainuncertain and there would be strong pressure on the Governmentto initiate action to clarify the position.(b) A Bill restricted to the immediate issue, and providing thata person ordained to the office of priest or deacon in the Church ofIreland could serve as a Member of Parliament, WOuld give rise tomany anomalies. It would mean, for example, that a clergyman ofthe Church of Ireland who was nominated to an English living couldsit in the House of Commons, whereas a Church of England clergy-man ordained in that Church could not do so. A Bill which restrictedthe 1801 disqualification to beneficed clergy of the Church of Englandand placed ministers of the Church of Scotland would be moredefensible, but would immediately give rise to the question whetherRoman Catholic priests who had retired from active work should beallowed to sit: at present they were disqualified by the roman catholic Relief Act, 1829.(c) Any general review of the disqualification of clergymen from membership of the House of Commons would involve an extensiveinvestigation, presumably by a Select Committee. Although somenewspapers had suggested that these disqualifications should be entirely swept away, the Churches, including the Roman catholic church, were unlikely to take this view, at any rate in respect ofclergy actively engaged in church work.(d) Reference to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council was open to the objection that the Select Committee had rejected thiscourse when it was suggested to them by the Attorney-General. Itmight also be represented that the Government were resorting to itin order to prolong the uncertainty of Mr. MacManaway&apos;s position,and so deprive the Opposition of his vote. On the other hand, itcould be argued that legislation on this subject involved difficultissues which cut across Party lines, and that it was undesirable toconsider further legislation until the present law had been clarified.It should be possible to arrange for the Judicial Committee to give an opinion on the point before the Summer Term ended, and Mr. Mac-Manaway&apos;s state of uncertainty need not, therefore, be prolongedfor more than a few weeks.(e) There was general agreement that, if the Judicial committee reported that Mr. MacManaway was disqualified, it would be neces-sary to introduce an Indemity Bill to prevent a common informerfrom recovering penalties in respect of his attendance at Westminster.It would, however, be undesirable to make any promise at this stage that in certain contingencies the Government would introduce suchan Indemnity Bill, since this might seem to be an invitation to Mr,MacManaway to commit further acts, by way of sitting and voting,which might subsequently be held to be illegal, and the Governmentwould be open to criticism if they purported to exercise a dispensingpower of this kind. It would, however, be reasonable for the Govern-ment, in commending to the House a proposal that the Judicial Com-mittee should be asked for an advisory opinion, to explain that, ifthe Judicial Committee gave an adverse report, the Governmentwould consider whether an Indemnity Bill should not be introduced in respect of any illegality which Mr. MacManaway, in the uncertainstate of the law, had already committed. It was unfortunate thatthis might mean that Mr. MacManaway&apos;s constituency might remainwithout an effective Member for the next few weeks, but Mr. Mac-Manaway could perform many of the functions of a Member ofParliament without sitting and voting in the House.  jThe Cabinet-Agreed that the Government should recommend to theHouse of Commons that Mr. MacManaway&apos;s qualification for membership should be referred to the Judicial Com-mittee of the Privy Council for an advisory opinion.
Exports.Man-power.Production.Coal.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (50) 28thConclusions,Minute 5.)Balance ofPayments.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP, (50) 122) covering a report on the economicsituation.The following points were made in discussion:  The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this report reflectedboom conditions, due to rising demand at home and abroad. It was,however, a disquieting feature that, although our dollar balance con-tinued to improve, our general balance of payments was developingless favourably than had been hoped. This was probably due to an unfavourable turn in our terms of trade with the non-dollar world and, in particular, to the high prices which we were paying for imports of rubber, wool and jute. During April and May the gold and dollar reserves of the sterling area had increased by $250 million,and a further $65 million had been added in the first two weeks ofJune.The Cabinet were informed that exports to North America con-tinued to improve, and the figures for May had established newrecords in terms of United States dollars, 23 million to the UnitedStates and 34-7 million to Canada.Unemployment in development areas was no lower than it hadbeen a year ago, and still accounted for two-fifths of the total unem-ployment in Great Britain. In a recent debate in the House of Lordsit had been represented that some firms in development areas hadbeen refused permission to build extensions of their factories whichwould have enabled them to absorb more workers..The Cabinet Were informed that recovery in the development areas was in fact beginning to lag, mainly because of increasingdifficulty in persuading firms to establish new enterprises there. Itwas true that some firms had been refused permission to build factoryextensions in these areas: the hmitations imposed on new industrial building by the Government&apos;s capital investment programme had made it necessary to confine the grant of building licences to appli-cants who could show that by expanding their activities they couldearn or save dollars. These and other questions of policy relating tothe development areas were about to be discussed by the production committee on the basis of a memorandum submitted by the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade.Special attention was drawn to the fact that industrial output in the first quarter of the year had reached a level about 9 per cent,higher than that of the corresponding quarter of 1949. It wassuggested that this provided further evidence that official estimates ofthe probable rate of increase in industrial productivity had beenunduly conservative.Production of cotton and wool textiles was making satisfactory progress. The rise in the production of synthetic fibres was even morenotable. Thus, the current output of rayon was now one-third above that of 1949, and the output of nylon was six times greater than it hadbeen at the beginning of 1949.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had become neces-sary to allocate more coal for domestic consumption and, as a result,there was a risk that insufficient coal would be available for export.This might mean the permanent loss of some valuable overseas markets. The only certain way of avoiding this was by an increasein the total output of coal.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the target output of deep-mined coal for the year was between 205 and 210 million tons.Current output was above the level required for the attainment ofthe lower target figure; output was normally larger in the second half-year than in the first; and there had been no decrease in the totalnumber of face-workers during the past six weeks. It might thereforebe possible to avoid any serious reduction in exports.The Cabinet were, however, disturbed at the possible loss of export markets for coal. Suggestions were made that the Govern-ment should appeal to the miners to increase their output and that
the Prime Minister: should: meet the miners&apos; leaders and impress upon them the seriousness of thejiosition, It was, however,;the general viewof the Cabinet that further exhortations to t% miners, calling forincreased output, would dp. np good and might even do harm. Therehad been a noticeable improvenieiit hi the general temper of theindustry: little time was now being lOst^through,industrial disputes;output per man-shiffc had risenand there had been; some decreasein absenteeism,. In these circumstances pttblic; appeals for increasedeffort by the miners might well be resented-though members of theGovernment might take the. opportunity for private consultation withthe:miners-&apos;: leaders, during the annual;conference of their Union earlyin July. In the long run increased coal production-nror, indeed, themaintenance: of the current rate of output-must;,depend, not on additional effort by the miners, but. on the further mechanisation andtechnical reorganisation of; the mines.. This wa$ the more important as it seemed inevitable that in future years there would be a seriousdecrease in the total labour force of the industry.^ The Minister.of-Ftfe(&apos;and-:Powfr said;.in reply,, that the national coal Board were confident that in the long run increased mechanisa-tipn could offset the. decline in the labour., Force. They had beenpreparing a national plan fpr theindustry, which he hoped to receiveupm theni shortly. Thi^ Would doubtless raise a number of difficult problems ^wjdchwo^ by the Govern-mejrit before the plan was published. Meanwhile,, the Board hadsubstantial achievements to their credit: the increased output whichthey had achieved since 1946 was impressive.The Prime Minister said that it would be helpful if the MinisterOf Fuel Md Power would subiriit a memorandum on the technicaldevelopments which might be undertaken in the short term toincrease the total output of coal. The Minister of,Labour mightcontribute to this memorandum a section on the general state oflabour relations in the coalmining industry.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (50) 122 and of the points raised in thediscussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power, to submit a members-fandum on the steps which might be taken in the shortterm to increase the total Output of coal by acceleratingthe technical developments which were taking place in theindustry.European 5.  The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that protractedPayments discussions had taken place in the Organisation for EuropeanUmKMu Economic Co-OperatiOh on the revised proposals for a European Pay-(Previous       ments Union which had been put forward by the Minister of StateReference:      for Economic Affairs With the approval of the Cabinet and the cm. (50) 30th Economic Policy Committee.  As he had expected, difficulties had conclusions,    been encountered over the proposals for credit margins and the minute 2.)      gold point. Earlier in the week there had been some prospect that agreement might be reached on this question. It had, however, been announced that morning that the Belgian Government had decidedto reject these proposals; and, this being so, he feared that it might prove impossible to hold the other countries to their provisional agreement.The Cabinet took note of this statement by the Chancellorcf the Exchequer.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\5th June, 1950.Iron andSteel Act(previous reference:CM. (50) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Supply (CP. (50) 112) on the bringing into operation of the Ironand Steel Act, 1949.The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion of the issues raised inthis memorandum. They agreed to resume their consideration ofthese issues at a later meeting.
