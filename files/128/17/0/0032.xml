1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 22nd May there would be a debate on the building industry.This would be based mainly oh the report of the Working Party onBudding Operations which had been published on 1st May; but itwas desirable that account should also be taken of the report on building by the Productivity Team of the Anglo-American Council on productivity. The Chief Whip was invited to arrange that (if this hadnot; already been done) copies of this latter report would be madeavailable to Members before the debate.Parliament would be adjourned for the Whitsun Recess on26th May, and would re-assemble on 13th June.2. Mr. Anthony Eden, M.P., had suggested that he should puta Private Notice Question to the Prime -Minister that day asking whether the United Kingdom Government could not afford somepractical assistance to relieve the suffering caused by the widespreadfloods in Manitoba. The Cabinet were also informed that the Mayorof Maidenhead was proposing to open a fund for the same purpose.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thathe had already sent a telegram to the Canadian Government asking whether the United Kingdom could help in any way by sendingclothing or medical supplies or skilled helpers. The Cabinet agreedthat any assistance given should take a material form: any offer offinancial assistance (as, for example, from Maidenhead to Winnipeg)would raise awkward exchange difficulties. It might be useful if such things as blankets, household textiles and medical supplies could besent from the United Kingdom to Manitoba; but, before this waspublicly suggested, it would be advisable to verify that the canadian government would welcome such an offer. The question might use-fully be raised in the meetings with Canadian Ministers which wereto be held in London later in the week, unless in the meanwhile a reply had been received to the telegram already sent to the canadian government.It was the view of the Cabinet that, for the time being, further discussion of this question in the House of Commons should be discouraged.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofNational Insurance (CP. (50) 100) asking for authority to proceedwith the arrangements necessary for bringing into force on1st October, 1951, the increased rates of contribution provided underthe National Insurance Act, 1946.The Minister of National Insurance explained that it would benecessary to issue in the course of November, 1950, the first instal-ment of national insurance cards for the period from December, 1950,to December, 1951, and that these would show the increase in con-tributions, amounting to 4d. for adults, which under the provisionsof the Act of 1946 would become payable from 1st October, 1951.If they were to be ready in time, the printing of the cards wouldhave to be put in hand almost at once. She thought it unlikely thatthere would be much public interest in the increased contributionsuntil they became payable in October, 1951. On the other hand, theintroduction of an amending legislation which would be required ifcontributions were to be maintained at their present rates wouldstimulate pressure for the grant of increased benefits to spinsters, old age pensioners and other classes who would be eager to draw uponthe large surplus in the National Insurance Fund.b 2
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the surplus in theFund was primarily due to the low rate of unemployment. Butretirement pensions and widows&apos; benefits would, within the nexttwenty or thirty years, impose ah increasing burden on the Exchequer,rising in 1978 to a figure which varied between  260 million and  338million according to the level of unemployment which was assumed.The Government Actuary was due to submit, towards the end of theyear, a report on the working of the scheme up to March, 1950 ;and it was arguable that, if this showed that the original assumptionabout the rate of unemployment had given rise to a large surplus inthe Fund, any relief which could be given (in reduced contributions or increased benefits) should be confined to employed persons. Adecision not to increase contributions generally in October, 1951,would give the benefits resulting from the lower rate of unemploy-ment to all insured classes, whereas it would no doubt be argued onbehalf of employed persons that any benefits should accrue to themrather than to the self-employed and non-employed.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) As a matter of timing, it was awkward to have to announcetowards the end of 1950 that the increases in contributions for whichthe Act of 1946 provided would come into operation in the followingautumn, and to publish about the same time a report on the workingof the scheme which, by disclosing the large surplus in the Fund,suggested that there were grounds for some reduction in contributionrates.(b) It was doubtful whether employed persons, who constitutedby far the largest number of contributors to the Fund, would dis-distinguish between the position of the Fund as respects unemploymentbenefit and as respects retirement pensions. They would expect theGovernment to take their decision on a comprehensive view of allthe risks which the scheme covered.(c) Various assumptions made in the original actuarial calcula-tions had been falsified by events. The Government had themselvesdecided to base the scheme on an average rate of 8i per cent, ofunemployment. Sickness claims had been less than had been ex-pected. On the other hand, it could be argued that the lengthenedexpectation of life was increasing the prospective burden of retire-ment pensions.(d) Faced with arguments based on the mounting cost of retire-ment pensions over the next thirty years, many contributors to thisscheme would doubtless contend that they ought not to be requiredto contribute to the cost of pensions of a later generation. against this it could be pointed out that many of the present contributorswould be receiving pensions in thirty years&apos; time, and that to a con-siderable extent the heavy burden on the Exchequer was due to thedecision to pay retirement pensions in the early years of the operationof the scheme to persons who had not made contributions throughout their working life, as all young people entering the scheme would now have to do.(e) It was arguable that it was no longer justifiable to basenational insurance strictly on actuarial calculations. A comprehensive-sive scheme of insurance was, in fact, a form of taxation or forcedsaving by which persons contributed to increase the capital equipment of the country and later, in retirement, drew their share of theincreased national income resulting from that capital investment. Atthe same time it had to be remembered that the Act of 1946 had been framed as a scheme of insurance, and the reports on the workingof the scheme would be judged on that basis.(f) The prospective burdens on the Exchequer through the costof retirement pensions in the next thirty years was so heavy that itwas difficult to believe that, on a general review of the position itwould be found practicable to forgo the increased contributionsenvisaged in the Act of 1946.
The general view of Ministers was that the printing of cardscovering the period from December 1950 to December 1951 should proceed on the basis that increased contributions became payable,as provided in the statute, after 1st October, 1951. The positionwould be reviewed before the cards were issued; and, to enable thisito be done, the preparation of the Government Actuary&apos;s report onthe operation of the scheme up to March 1950 should be expedited.If, as a result of a general review of the scheme in the autumn of 1950it was decided that the rates of contribution payable after 1st October,1951, should be different from those laid down in the Act of 1946,the Government could announce their intention to introduce amen-ding legislation and the cards could be over-stamped, before issue,with the proposed new rates.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of National Insurance to arrangefor the insurance cards for 1951 to be printed with the contribution rates envisaged by the National InsuranceAct, 1946.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to expedite thepreparation of the Government Actuary&apos;s report on thefirst year&apos;s operation of the scheme under section 39 (1) (b)of the National Insurance Act, 1946, and to ask theGovernment Actuary to frame his report in a manner which would present to the public the full facts aboutcurrent and prospective claims on the Fund, and theextent to which Exchequer contributions would berequired in future years.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof National Insurance to bring forward general proposals,based on the Government Actuary&apos;s report, before thetime came to issue insurance cards for 1951.Food. 4.   The Cabinet considered a further memorandum by thePoints Minister of Food (CP. (50) 111) recommending the withdrawal of rationing.       the points rationing scheme.(Previous The Minister of Food said that after the Cabinefs previous dis-Reference: cussion on 6th April a number of foods which were plentiful had. (50) 20th been taken out of the points rationing scheme, and the monthlyConclusions, allocation of points had been reduced to sixteen. It was now clear,Minute 1.) however, that the scheme was failing to secure equitable distributionof the foods remaining within it. Supplies of these foods were notevenly distributed between retaders; and an allocation of only sixteenpoints a month made it difficult for the smaller households to makeprofitable use of their points. This situation was giving rise to wide-spread complaints from both consumers and traders; and its con-tinuance was likely to bring into disrepute, not only the points scheme,but the whole machinery of food rationing. The Minister was satis-fled that equitable distribution of these foods was now more likelyto be secured by a system of allocating supplies to retailersaccording to the number of their registered customers and leaving itto them to distribute those supplies fairly among their customers. he therefore recommended that the points rationing scheme would nowbe withdrawn entirely.In discussion attention was drawn to the following aspects ofthis problem:  (a) The President of the Board of Trade said that he was sorrythat the Minister of Food had not seen fit to make the experiment,38779 b 3
which he had suggested in the Cabinefs earlier discussion, of intro-ducing a moderate amount of inflation into the points scheme inorder to test the strength of the demand. If this had been done, theCabinet would now be. in a better position to judge whether the with-drawai pf the control would be followed by a sharp increase in thedemand for the foods still covered J?y it.The Minister of Food said that he had considered this suggestionbut had concluded that its adoption would lead tP an even greaterdegree of disorganisation in the distribution pf these foods.(b) The Chancellor, of the Exchequer- feared that withdrawal ofall rationing control over these foods would sharpen the demand foran increased supply of sugar to manufacturers; and additional sugarcould not be made available without further dollar expenditure.The Minister of Food said in reply that more sugar was requiredfor manufacturing purposes and he would be obliged to ask for authority to increase sugar imports. That question would, however,have to be considered&quot; on its merits, whether Or not the pointsrationing scheme was withdrawn.(c) If there Was a shortage of the foods still subject to this control,the retention of points rationing would at least ensure that no one was able to get more than his fair share of them. On the other hand, thescheme was already failing to secure that everyone did get his fair shareof these foods. In most areas the consumer could only get such pointsgoods as were available at the shop where he was registered, and theretailer was sharing out what was available among his registeredcustomers. In these circumstances there was much to be said for putting distribution frankly on that basis.(d) Although the headquarters of the Co-operative wholesale society favoured the withdrawal of the scheme, a different view wastaken by some of the branch managers, who were reluctant to assume responsibility for distributing these foods fairly among their customers.(e) There was undoubtedly great dissatisfaction with the currentworking of the scheme ; and many housewives would be glad to be relieved of its inconveniences. But this had to be weighed against the complaints which wpujd be directed against the Government if, afterthe withdrawal of the scheme, there were serious shortages of thefoods to which it now applied.The discussion showed that the advantages and disadvantages of withdrawing the scheme were nicely balanced. The predominant view in the Cabinet was, however, in favour of Withdrawing the scheme,It was recognised that great care would have to be taken in the public presentation of this decision. It would be unwise to give the iriipres-sion that the scheme could now be withdrawn because there was an abundant supply of these foods. On the other hand, if it was admitted that the demand exceeded the supply, there would be a runOn the shops and the shortage would be aggravated. One of the strongest arguments for the decision was perhaps that a pointsrationing system could not work smoothly unless it poyered a fairlywide range of goods, and that the scope of this scheme had now become so restricted that it was no longer profitable tp continue it.The Cabinet-Apprpved the prpppsal pf the Minister pf Food that pointsrationing should be discontinued.
NorthAtlanticCouncil.(previous references:CM. (50) 15thConclusions,Minute 3,and 29thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Foreign Secretary made a brief preliminary report onthe work of the current meeting of the North Atlantic Council.The main questions under discussion at this meeting had beenthe policy of building up balanced Forces for the Atlantic treaty powers as a whole, the creation of machinery for the continuingstudy of all matters of common concern to the Treaty Powers, andthe arrangements to be made for the co-ordination of the economiceffort;of the Treaty Powers after the end of the European recovery programme in 1952. A full report on the meeting would be circulated for the Cabinefs consideration as soon as possible. The UnitedKingdom Government were not finally committed by the proceedings at the Council, to any increased expenditure on defence.There might be some difficulty in deciding how much of theCounciTs proceedings could be communicated to other Common-wealth Goverments. On this point the Foreign Secretary would consult with the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Wages Policy.Gas Industry.(previous reference:CM. (50) 24thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (CP. (50) 106) reporting the results of the further discussion of the gas workers&apos; wage claim by the National joint industrial Council for the Gas Industry.This showed that a national wage structure had been agreed for labourers in the gas industry. At their earlier discussion on 24thApril the Cabinet had expressed the hope that any consequential increases for more highly-paid workers in the industry (i) would be delayed as long as possible ; (ii) would be restricted within the narrowest possible limits ; and (iii) would not be allowed to operateretrospectively from the date of the increase granted to the labourers.Subsequently, however, it had been found that the Gas Council were already committed to back-dating, not only the increases for labourers,but also any increases subsequently granted to the more highly-paid workers in the industry. In these circumstances it was now suggestedthat there would be no advantage in delaying discussion of the con-sequential increases for the more highly-paid workers.In the Cabinefs discussion some regret was expressed that it hadnot been found possible to secure in this socialised industry, that anincrease in the wage rates of the lowest-paid workers was not followedby consequential increase for other workers designed to preserve thefull range of wage differentials throughout the industry.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the progress of the discussions of the wageclaim by workers in the gas industry as reported in cp. (50) 106.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the boards of allsocialised industries to be reminded, by the responsible ministers, of the Governments attitude towards wage claims designed to preserve existing wage differentials inan industry following an award of increased wage rates tothe lower-paid workers in the industry.House Coal. 7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterSummer and of Fuel and Power (CP. (50) 103) explaining that a serious fall in theWinter Prices,   summer-stocking of house coal by domestic consumers involved a danger of a breakdown in the winter distribution of domestic coal.He therefore proposed that in the south of England merchants should
reduce prices by 5s. a ton in summer and increase them by 5s. a tonin the winter, with corresponding but smaller price differentials inthe north.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the National coal board, the Coal Merchants&apos; Federation and the co-operative societieshad warned him of the grave danger of a breakdown in the supplyof household coal to domestic users during the winter of 1950-51. all those with experience of coal distribution advised him that the mainremedy must be for those members of the public who had facilitiesfor storing coal to stock it in the summer. Propaganda would be useful but would not be enough. Consumers would only stock coalif summer prices were substantially lower than winter prices, as hadbeen the commercial practice before the war. The difficulty about thisproposal was that 10 per cent, of domestic consumers throughout thecountry had no storage space; but he believed that this difficulty would have to be faced if a breakdown of coal distribution was tobe averted. In any event, those who could not store coal in the summer would only have to pay about 3d. per cwt. more in thewinter (an increase which was no more than the difference in price to which consumers were already accustomed owing to variations in the quality of coal) and the total cost to a person who bought all his coal in small amounts in the winter would be about 6s.The Minister of Health said that, when this matter had been dis-cussed by the Production Committee, a majority of its members had seen serious objection to the scheme proposed by the Minister of fuel and Power. In various parts of London and other large towns,considerable numbers of the poorer people had no facilities for storingcoal, and it seemed unfair that they should have to pay increased charges in order to induce those who had storage facilities to buy inthe summer. Reliance should be placed primarily on effective propa-ganda and the threat could be held out that, if those with storage facilities failed to buy coal in the summer, preference in the sale ofcoal in winter would be given to those who had no storage space.Moreover, it seemed reasonable that the amount ( 380,000) which theNational Coal Board were prepared to give to facilitate the operationof a. scheme of price differentials should be spent on subsidising coalmerchants for stocking coal in the summer for winter use, as hadbeen done in previous years by the Exchequer.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Production Committee had considered whether it wouldbe possible to delimit the urban areas in which a large proportion ofhouseholders did not possess storage space and to apply special measures in these areas, but had reached the conclusion that such ascheme was impracticable.(b) An increase in the quantity of coal available for domestic consumption would go some way to meet the difficulties of thefollowing winter, but it would not suffice to overcome the difficultieswhich would arise if there were a period of severe cold weather.(c) Several Ministers felt that the National Coal Board should be pressed to do more to give merchants a financial inducement to buildup larger stocks of coal in the summer. The argument so far advanced by the National Coal Board against this course (that by subsidisingstocking by one set of customers they would lay themselves open to similar claims from other customers) was not considered to beconclusive.(d) Some Ministers thought it would be reasonable to return tothe pre-war custom of charging different prices for coal in summer and winter, particularly in view of the support which this policy hadreceived from the co-operative societies and from the Domestic CoalConsumers&apos; Council. At the same time it was pointed out that thepolicy of refusing to allow a householder to receive his whole year&apos;sstock in the summer, based on the fear that he might burn it before
the winter, detracted seriously from the results likely to be achievedfrom any appeal to householders to stock up in the summer forwinter needs.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (50) 103 at a later meeting.scottish affairs.(previous reference:CM. (50) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet again had before them the memorandum by theSecretary of State for Scotland on Scottish Affairs (CP. (50) 101) andalso had before them a further memorandum (CP. (50) 107) con-taining proposals regarding the composition of the Committee whichwas to examine the practicability of producing a return of Scottishrevenue and expenditure and an economic balance-sheet for Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he had ascertained that the Leader of the Opposition was not proposing to receive thedeputation of Commissioners from the so-called &quot; Scottish national assembly.&quot; He therefore presumed that the Cabinet would not thinkit appropriate that, on the Government side, this deputation shouldbe received by the Prime Minister.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the deputation from the &quot; Scottish national assembly &quot; should be received by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consult with theLord President and the Chancellor of the Exchequerregarding the composition and terms of reference of theproposed Committee on Scottish revenue and expendi-ture; and in the light of those consultations to submit his proposals for final approval by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,ISth May, 1950.
