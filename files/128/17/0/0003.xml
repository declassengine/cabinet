$teohuanalandProtectorate.chieftainship of the bamangwato tribe.(previous reference erence:C.M.(49)47thConclusions,Minute 8.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50) 13) on the. succession to the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on 21st July that a Judicial enquiry should be held under the provisions of the Bechuanaland NativeAdministration Proclamation into the suitability of Seretse Khamafor the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe. The judicial enquiry had now completed their work and a copy of their report was annexed to CP. (50) 13. Their main findings were that thetribal meeting (Kgotla) at which Seretse had been designated as chief had been properly convened and assembled, and that its pro-ceedings had been Conducted in accordance with native custom; butthat, having regard to the interests and well-being of the Tribe,Seretse was not a fit and proper person to discharge the functionsof Chief. The reasons given for this second finding were that, asthe headquarters of the administration was at Mafeking andSeretse was a prohibited immigrant in the Union of South Africa,he would*be unable efficiently to carry out his duties as Chief; thatthe friendship of the Union and of Southern Rhodesia was essentialto the well-being of the Tribe and to the Bechuanaland Protectorategenerally; and that recognition of Seretse would disrupt the Tribe.The Secretary of State said that, while he accepted the conclusionthat Seretse was not a fit and proper person to discharge thefunctions of Chief, he did not consider that the reasons given bythe members of the Enquiry in support of this conclusion could be endorsed by His Majesty&apos;s Government. In his view there were three main reasons for refusing to recognise Seretse as Chief.First, those closely acquainted with the Bamangwato Tribe were agreed that the Enquiry had under-estimated the risk that hisrecognition would result in the disruption of the Tribe. At their previous discussions, Ministers had expressed the view &quot;that theprincipal objective of policy must be to safeguard the future well-being of the Bamangwato themselves &quot; and he was in no doubt thata decision to recognise Seretse would be incompatible with this objective. Indeed, various passages in the report showed that, in supporting Seretse, the members of the Tribe had been actuated byfear of Tshekedi, and the decision of the tribal meeting should not therefore be regarded as an endorsement of Seretse&apos;s claims.Secondly, Seretse had shown an irresponsibility, both in his marriage and in other matters, which made it doubtful whether he could safely be entrusted with the duties and responsibilities of Chieftain.Thirdly, liberal European opinion generally was convinced thatSeretse ought not to be recognised as Chieftain, and this view wasshared by a strong body of native opinion in Africa. He thoughtthat these considerations would in themselves justify a decision notto recognise Seretse; but it would not be realistic wholly to ignore the effect which recognition might have on South African opinion and on future relations with the Union Government. From thepoint of view of African interests, the paramount need was to safe-guard the position of the South African High Commission Terri-tories. For the first time, there was a strong body of opinion withinthe Union itself which considered that the Union&apos;s claim to these territories ought not to be actively pressed at the present time.Recognition of Seretse would weaken this opposition and strengthen the position of those who favoured the transfer of these territories to the Union. In these circumstances he recommended that Seretseshould not be recognised as Chief, and that the Government^decision should be announced in a White Paper on the lines of thedraft annexed to CP. (50) 13. In the first instance, however, hesuggested that Seretse and his wife should be invited to come toEngland, so that a further attempt might be made to persuade him to relinquish voluntarily his claim to the Chieftainship. Finally,he recommended that the administration of the Bechuanaland38251 b 2
Reserve should for the : present he conducted directly by the bechuanaland Protectorate Administration, and that the system of native government in the Reserve should, by gradual stages, be made more representative.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was ingeneral agreement with the recommendations made in CP. (50) 13.The decisive consideration was that the recognition of Seretse would undoubtedly endanger the stability and well-being of the Bamarig-wato Tribe. Although opinion in Africa was divided on this issue^, itwas clear that a substantial body of opinion was opposed to the recognition of Seretse. He also endorsed the proposals for reform-ing the system of native government in the Bamangwato Reserve;and he thought that every effort should be made to transfer the head^quarters of the administration from Mafeking to some place inside the Protectorate.In discussion there was general agreement that the handling ofthis problem had been seriously complicated by the terms of thereport of the Judicial Enquiry. - It was impossible for the Govern-ment to endorse the reasons on which the second conclusion of theEnquiry was based; and, if it became necessary to publish the report,the Government would have no alternative but to make this clear.There were other passages in the report which were likely to giverise to damaging controversy in this country or in Africa. On theother hand, there could be no doubt that Seretse&apos;s marriage hadintroduced into the affairs of the Bamangwato Tribe a persistingelement of controversy and unsettlement, which would be furtheraggravated if he should have children. Indeed, the United kingdom high Commissioner and his advisers considered that insufficientweight was given in the report of the Judicial Enquiry to the stimulus which recognition of Seretse would give to the disruptivetendencies already inherent in the Tribe. In these circumstancesSeretse&apos;s continuance as Chieftain would involve great risks for the tribe. It seemed likely that Seretse himself was not unaware ofthese considerations and that he might therefore be responsive tosuggestion that, by relinquishing voluntarily his claims to the chieftainship, he would serve best both his own interests and thoseof the Tribe. The general view of Ministers was therefore that,as a first step, Seretse and his wife should be invited to come toLondon for discussions with the Secretary of State. In these talksan offer of an allowance and other appropriate forms of help shouldbe made to Seretse on condition that he should not return to the bechuanaland Protectorate. Ministers hoped that it might then bepossible to avoid publication of the report of the Judicial Enquiry.Ministers considered that it was unnecessary to decide at thepresent stage what action should be taken if it should prove im-possible to persuade Seretse to relinquish the Chieftainship.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to invite Seretse Khama.and his wife to visit london with a view to persuading him to relinquish voluntarilythe Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe.(2) Agreed that their consideration of the recommendations made in CP. (50) 13 should be resumed in the light ofthe results of the talks held in accordance with Con-clusion (1) above.(3) Instructed the Secretary to recall all copies of CP. (50) 13from circulation.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Minis-ter of Labour and National Service (CP. (50) 15) reporting the pro-gress made in providing for the resettlement in civilian employmentof ex-regular members of the Armed Forces, and recommending theestablishment of an Advisory Council to study means of securing a closer integration between service in the Forces and civilian work-ing life.
The Minister of Labour said that keen interest in this problem was already being shown in industrial and educational circles. Thetrade unions would be in favour of the proposed Advisory Counciland would co-operate in its work though there would have to befurther negotiations with some unions on the question of readmittingex-members of the Forces to union membership. The proposed corn-position of the Advisory Council was set out in Annex A to cp. (50) 15. The Minister said that it was his intention that the membership of the Council should eventually be widened so as toinclude representatives of the ex-regular members of the Forces whohad undergone some form of resettlement training.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that these proposals hadbeen discussed with the Service Ministers and had their full support.The Service Departments were grateful for the valuable assistance which the Ministry of Labour had already given in dealing withthis problem.In further discussion the following points were raised: (a) When the composition of the Advisory Council was announced care should be taken to make it clear that the council would include a representative of Welsh, as well as Scottish, educa-tion.(6) Agriculture should be adequately represented on theAdvisory Council.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofDefence to proceed with the establishment of the AdvisoryCouncil proposed in CP. (50) 15, subject to further con-sideration of the two points noted in paragraphs (a) and(6) above.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,Slst January, 1950.
