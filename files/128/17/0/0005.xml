The Cabinet met to consider the situation resulting from theGeneral-Election^ With six returns still outstanding, 314 seats hadbeen won by Labour, 294 by Conservatives and their supporters,8 by Liberals and 2 by Irish Nationalists. The remaining seat wasthe Speakers. Thus, whatever the results in the six outstandingconstituencies, Labour would have a majority over all other parties in the new House of Commons. .1..&apos;.&apos;,..&apos;L...&apos;.]The Prime Minister said that the King&apos;s GovernmentMiaust-becarried on and, as Labour would have a majority, the proper course was for a Labour Administration to remain in office. It must,however, be recognised that, with so small a majority, there wouldbe great difficulty in transacting Government business in the Houseof Commons. There could, &apos; in particular, be no question of attempting to carry through any of the major controversial legis-lation which had Been promised in the Party&apos;s Election Manifesto.Very careful consideration would also have to be given to the content and presentation of the Budget.The Cabinet endorsed these views.The Prime Minister asked that all Ministers should place their offices at his disposal in order to facilitate his reconstruction of theGovernment. Meanwhile, Ministers should continue to supervise the current administration of their Departments until his wisheswere made known to them.        ; /   ;i        u j  ;In further discussion the suggestion was made that it wouldbe useful if the Cabinet could have a preliminary discussion of thefinancial situation before the Chancellor of the Exchequer formu-lated his final Budget proposals.   This suggestion was approved.The Cabinefs conclusions were as follows:-(1) It was the duty of a Labour Administration to continue in office in order that the Kings Government might becarried on.(2) A public announcement to this effect should be issued f orth-with : to this there should be added a call to all membersof the community to. turn their efforts, now that theElection was over, to carrying on the necessary work ofthe nation.(3) All Ministers should place their offices at the PrimeMinisters disposal m order to facilitate his recon-struction of the Government.(4) At their meeting on 2nd March the Cabinet should considerthe terms of the King&apos;s Speech and a draft of the defence white Paper. .,:(5) At a meeting of the Cabinet on 3rd March the Chancellorof the Exchequer should give his colleagues a broadpicture of the financial position of the country and ofthe main factors which he would have to take intoaccount in framing his Budget: discussion of this statement could, if necessary, be continued at a further meeting in the following week.(6) The Prime Minister should ascertain whether ColonelClifton Brown was willing to be nominated forre-election as Speaker. If so, the Chief Whip should suggest to him that Mr. David Kirkwood might proposehis election, and that a member of the Opposition mightbe asked to second that proposal.(7) As the strength of the two main Parties in the House ofCommons was so nearly equal, the Chief Whip should ascertain whether it would be possible to arrange forthe office of Deputy Chairman of Committees to be filled by a member of the Opposition.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,25th February, 1950.
