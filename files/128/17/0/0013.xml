CM. 13 (50)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (50) 39) seeking authority for the issue of circularsto local authorities about the plans which they should prepare under regulations made by the responsible Ministers, and approved byParliament, under section 2 of the Civil Defence Act, 1948.The Home Secretary said that the issue of these circulars hadbeen held up while the Election campaign was in progress, but theCivil Defence Committee considered that they should now be despatched. They would be accompanied. by a general circularmaking it clear that the issue of these instructions was not to betaken to imply that war was imminent.In discussion, reference was made to a proposed handbook on civil defence against atomic bombs. This handbook was being-written in the light of suggestions made by the Civil DefenceCommittee. It would be submitted to the Prime Minister before it was issued; and, in view of its potential political importance, itmight be appropriate that the text should be considered by theCabinet.The Cabinet-Authorised the Home Secretary, the Minister of Health andVj the Secretary of State for Scotland to issue to localauthorities the circulars on civil defence mentioned in cp. (50) 39.2. The Home Secretary said that the report (Cmd. 5684) of theDepartmental Committee on Corporal Punishment, published in 1938,had given an analysis of the case histories of 440 persons convicted of robbery with violence during the period from 1921 to 1930. Inthe forthcoming debate in the House of Lords there might be ademand for the publication of comparable information regarding thepersons convicted of this offence since 1930; and he proposed toauthorise the Government spokesman to offer to make this furtherinformation available.In discussion the following points were made : (a) There was a good deal of public uneasiness about the apparent prevalence of crimes of violence. The Government spokes-men in the debate should not give any impression that the authorities were not concerned about this.(6) The Lord Chief Justice, though he regretted the repeal ofthe courts&apos; powers to impose corporal punishment, was understood to recognise the disadvantages of sudden reversals of policy inconnection with the penalties for criminal offences.(c) Some concern was expressed about the criticisms expressedby some of the High Court Judges of statutes recently enacted byParliament. If the independence of the Judiciary was to continueto command respect, there was an obligation on the Judges to refrain from criticism of the Legislature.The Cabinet-Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints made in the discussion.3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (50) 38) regarding his intention to refuse applica-tions for naturalisation from (i) known members of the BritishCommunist Party or of any foreign Communist party, (ii) personswho were associated with Communist activities in such a way as-1 b 2
-   V; 68&apos;to cast doubt on their loyalty, and (Hi) persons who, because of pastassociation with a Communist party, appeared !to have an enduringloyalty to Communism. 1The Home Secretary said that recent experience had shown thedanger that Communist sympathisers who became naturalisedBritish subjects might ignore the obligations which they undertooktowards this country. He had had the problem in mind for sometime past and he had now reached the conclusion that he ought not,in present circumstances; to naturalise persons coming within the categories listed in his memorandum. He was not required to givereasons for his decisions ori applications for ^naturalisation; and he did inot propose ^to make any public statement of policy.The Cabinet  - .,- Took note with approval&apos; of ?the Home Secretary&apos;s intentionito refuse applications for naturalisation from Communistsor Communist sympathisers.-Economic^development in South.and&apos;South-east asia.(previous reference:C.M1(49)62ndConclusions,minute .8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the foreign secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofStateior Commonwealth Relations (C.P. (50) 41) covering a reportby officials on the recommendations regarding economic development in South and South-East Asia which had been adopted at theCommonwealth Conference on Foreign Affairs held in Colombo inJanuary. These contemplated the establishment of a consultative committee, limited in, the first instance to those members of the(Commonwealth wishing to participate in its work, and ihaving as its object the furtherance and co-ordination of plans for economic development in South and South-East Asia. At the ColomboConference the Australian Delegation had taken the initiative in proposing the establishment of this machinery; and the australian government, having accepted the recommendations of the Conference,ihad now proposed that the first meeting of the Consultative Corn-mi ttee should be held in Canberra in May. In the report of officialsannexed to CP. (50) 41 it was suggested that the United KingdomGovernment should adopt the recommendations of the ColomboConference on this subject and should accept the Australianinvitation to be represented at the first meeting of the consultative committee. The report further recommended that the UnitedKingdom Government should be represented at this meeting by officials; but it was indicated in the covering note that it was theviewof the Foreign Secretary that the United Kingdom delegation should be led by a Minister. .,The Cabinefs discussion turned on the question whether this first meeting of ;the Consultative Committee should be a meeting of jMinisters or of officials. On the one hand it was pointed out that,before any decisions of policy could be taken, there was need for agreat deal of preparatory and technical work which could more appropriately be undertaken by officials. Moreover, a meeting ofMinisters might be expected to produce immediate practical results;and there might be disappointment, particularly in the countries ofSouth and South-East Asia which needed assistance, if those results were not forthcoming- On the other handi the Australian Govern-ment were specially anxious that Ministers should attend thismeeting, and the Governments of New Zealand and Ceylon hadalready decided to be represented by Ministers. An official delega--tion from the United Kingdom would ibeaf a disadvantage &apos;if several of the other Commonwealth countries were represented by Ministers.Further, the interest of the United States Government in this neflapproach ;to the problems of this area would the, more easily retainedif the first meeting of the Consultative Committee were attended by Ministers.
It was the view of the Cabinet that the balance of advantage lay on the side of sending a Minister to represent the United King-dom at this meeting; and The Prime Minister undertook to considerwhether the Paymaster-General could undertake this duty. TheCabinet also agreed that it would be helpful if the Commissioner-General for South-East Asia, or his representative, could join theUnited Kingdom delegation.The Cabinet-(1) Accepted the recommendations of the Colombo Conferenceon the economic development of South and South-east asia, as set out in Appendix A of the report annexed to cp. (50) 41.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should berepresented by a Minister at the first meeting of theproposed Consultative Committee which was to be heldin Canberra in May.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would ask the Paymaster-General to lead the United Kingdom delegation to thismeeting.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50) 37) on thecurrent state of relations between India and Pakistan.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the proceedings inthe Security Council on the Kashmir dispute. The Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations said that India&apos;s acceptanceof the resolution sponsored by the United Kingdom and other delega-tions represented a substantial advance towards a solution of thisEroblem; but it must be recognised that the reservations which theyad made in accepting the principle of the resolution were sufficientto enable them subsequently to avoid compliance with the provisions relating to demilitarisation. Pakistani representative at theSecurity Council was likely to demand that the significance of thesereservations should be clarified; and the Cabinet must decide what attitude the United Kingdom representative should take towards this demand. He could persist in the attitude of firmness whichhad produced such satisfactory results in the recent discussions, and press for India&apos;s full acceptance of all the terms of the resolution.Alternatively, he could take the line that the important practicalobjective at the present time was to secure agreement on the appoint-ment of a mediator and to arrange for his early arrival in Kashmirso that he could address himself without delay to the practical measures which might be taken on the spot.Discussion showed that the Cabinet favoured the latter of these alternatives. The Government of India had, from the point of viewof their internal politics, made a substantial concession in going asfar as they had towards accepting the resolution; and the wiser coursenow was to accept the concession offered rather than, by demandingmore, to risk the withdrawal of what had been offered. If the twoGovernments could be persuaded to agree to the appointment of asuitable individual as mediator, that person might well be able to putforward practical proposals on the subject of demilitarisation whichwould prove acceptable to both parties. As a matter of tactics itmight be preferable that the Secretary-General of the united nations should assume the responsibility for persuading the repre-. sentatives of India and Pakistan that the right course now was totake advantage of the substantial measure of common ground whichhad been achieved, rather than continue to argue about the points of difference still outstanding. The best hope of further progresslay in proceeding at once to the appointment of a mediator, and leaving the reservations of the two parties to be discussed, if need arose, at some later stage.
The Cabinet further agreed that it would be inexpedient to press for the appointment of Admiral Nimitz as mediator, since it was known that his appointment would not be acceptable to the Govern-ment of India.The further suggestion was made that the Foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations might takeinformal steps to have it conveyed to the Government of Pakistanthat they would be well advised to accept the appointment of amediator without pressing in the Security Council for the with-drawal or clarification of India&apos;s reservations to the resolution.The Cabinet Took note that the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations would arrange forfurther instructions to be sent to the United kingdom representative on the Security Council in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion.Bechuanaland 6.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the adverse commentsProtectorate, which continued to be made, in certain sections of the Press, on the chieftainship Government&apos;s dealings with Seretse Khama.   A difficult Parlia-of the mentary situation would arise if this matter had to be debated in the bamangwato House of Commons and a number of Government supportersTribe. abstained from voting in the division.   The Government could,(Previous however, continue to decline to find time for a debate; and thereReference: was as yet no reason to believe that the leaders&apos; of the ConservativeCM. (50) llth Opposition, would be willing to make a Supply Day available for this conclusions,     purpoSe.Minute 7.) jn (jiSGUSSion it was pointed out that the critical articles in the weekly journals must have, been written before the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations made his further statement in replyto Mr. Edelman&apos;s Question on 16th March. It was also possiblethat public anxiety would be further relieved by the White paper which was to be published during the course of the week.The Cabinet Took note of the position.People fromBritishColonialTerritories.7. In connection with the discussion recorded in the preceding minute the Cabinet were informed that, at a deputation on behalf of seretse Khama which Mr. Leary Constantine had recently broughtto the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and commonwealth relations, instances had been given of racial discrimination againstcoloured people in the United Kingdom. In the Cabinefs discussionof this question reference was made to the difficulties of finding suit-able employment for the coloured people who had come to thiscountry in recent years from the West Indies; and the view was expressed that serious difficulties would arise if this immigrationof coloured people from British Colonial possessions were to Icontinue or increase.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies, afterconsultation with the Home Secretary, the Minister ofLabour and the Minister of Health, to submit for their consideration a memorandum on the problems arising fromthe immigration into this country of coloured people (otterthan students) from the West Indies and other Briti1Colonial territories.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,&apos;   20th March, 1950.
