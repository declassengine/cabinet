The Cabinet were informed that there had that morning beena general resumption&apos; of work throughout the London docks. Thetroops which had been employed in the docks were, however, to beretained in the London area for another twenty-four hours, in casetheir services might be required. Further trouble might arise fromthe proposal of Messrs. Shaw, Savill and Albion to engage gangs ofmen to work regularly on their ships.In discussion the view was expressed that the Government shouldbe slow to use troops for the unloading of ships on which work hadbeen stopped as a result of this proposal by Messrs. Shaw, Savill andAlbion. For there was an industrial issue at stake here, which meritedconsideration by the employers and unions concerned; and the firmshould not put their proposal into effect until it had been fully dis-cussed through the normal conciliation machinery.Later in the meeting The Minister of Labour informed theCabinet that he had obtained specific assurances from Messrs. Shaw,Savill and Albion that they would follow the normal machinery for discussing their proposal with the unions concerned; and a meeting between representatives of the firm and of the Stevedores&apos; Union hadalready been arranged for that afternoon.The Cabinet had some general discussion about the working ofthe dock labour decasualisation scheme, and about the underlyingcauses of the current unrest in the docks and the recurrent stoppagesto which this gave rise. They agreed that there was need for a thorough enquiry Which would identify the cause of this trouble and suggest appropriate remedies.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with theMinisters directly concerned what further investigationshould be made into labour conditions in the docks.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (50) 83) proposing that, in the proceedings beforethe Transport Tribunal on the interim scheme submitted by theBritish Transport Commission for passenger charges in the london area, he should be represented but should not intervene unless anyspecial point should arise in connection with charges on Governmenttraffic.The Minister of Transport said that he had received representa-tions from the Ministry of Labour regarding the Commission^ pro-posals for the modification of workmen&apos;s fares, from the Ministry ofEducation regarding the age-limit for half-fares for children, and fromthe Service Departments regarding the special fares for Servicemen.The Commission had indicated that they did not intend under thescheme to seek any alteration in the principles governing the calcula-tion of fares for persons travelling on duty or on leave at Governmentexpense; and the arguments in favour of workmen&apos;s fares and half-fares for children would be fully canvassed before the Tribunal by thelocal authorities, trade unions and other organisations which hadlodged objections to the proposed scheme. He thought it would be inadvisable for him to press objections on these issues before theTribunal against the proposals of the British Transport Commission.He had brought the matter before his colleagues because his attitude on this occasion would set a precedent which would influence him or his successors when other charges schemes came before the Tribunal.38724-1b 2
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Under the old procedure under the Railways Act, 1921, theMinister of Transport had been represented before the Railway rates tribunal by an official of the Ministry who acted as amicus eurice andaddressed the Tribunal on any issue of Government policy on whichguidance was sought. It was agreed that the same procedure shouldbe followed in relation to the Transport Tribunal.(b) Since the estimated effect of the proposals in the draft scheme would be to increase the gross receipts from passenger services in theLondon area from  74^ million a year to about  77J million a year,the increases in fares would clearly out-balance any decreases. It was,however, pointed out that the Tribunal might wish to modify someof the Commission^, proposals and that the draft scheme had doubt-less been prepared with this possibility in mind.(c) There would be strong opposition to the proposed replacement of workmen&apos;s fares by rather higher early-morning fares, especially since this might be regarded as a precedent for similar alterations inother parts of the country. Both in London and elsewhere manyworkers had to travel long distances to work, and an increase intravelling costs would be most unpopular. In London, however, thepresent system of workmen&apos;s fares was full of anomalies and thesubstitution of buses for trams had precipitated the need for a morerational system, since workmen*s fares were not available on the buses.It was also doubtful whether in London there was still the samevalidity in the old social argument that workmen who used the early-morning trains were less able to pay the full fare than clerical workers who used the later trains. The Minister of Transport should, however,make it known to the Commission that the Government had a closeinterest in the subject of workmen&apos;s fares, that they would be interested to see how the arguments for and against these fares were devolped in the course of the proceedings before the Tribunal, and that it might in certain circumstances be proper for them to introduce legislation on the subject.(d) The Government would doubtless be held responsible in thepublic mind for any unpopular decisions which the Transport Tribunalmight take. It was therefore important that the Tribunal should payfull regard to the interests of the consumer. The machinery set up under the Transport Act did not give Parliament any opportunity tomodify the conclusions reached by the Transport Tribunal. Thesubject of transport charges could of course be raised in generaldebates on transport, but the Minister could not be questioned on thesubject since he was not responsible for the fixing of the rates. At thesame time, the Transport Act, by conferring responsibility for the fixing of charges on a Tribunal before whom interested parties couldappear, went further in the direction of enabling the consumer to voiceobjections than had the other socialisation measures which left theresponsibility for price-fixing to the board which managed theindustry. If the present system proved to be unsatisfactory in prac-tice, the only alternative was direct administration by a GovernmentDepartment; and there would be grave disadvantages in leaving thefinal decision on transport charges to a Minister, who would be subjectto the political pressure of local interests and sectional groups.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, as proposed in CP. (50) 83, the Minister ofTransport should be represented in the proceedings beforethe Transport Tribunal on the draft London PassengerCharges Scheme, but that his representative should notintervene unless any special point should arise in connec-tion with charges for Government traffic.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to inform the British Trans-port Commission confidentially that the Government were interested in the subject of workmen&apos;s fares, that they

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofEducation (CP. (50) 87) explainuig. how he was seeking to meet by administrative measures the difficulties which the church &quot;authorities had experienced in satisfying the requirements of the Education Act,1944^ relating to aided denominational schools. The Minister thoughtthat he had gone as far as was necessary in this matter but he was prepared, if his colleagues so desired, to propose amending legislation which would give a school provisional aided status when it could notbe finally decided whether the church &quot;authorities were able to meet their share of the cost of the necessary improvements.The Minister of Education said that, where improvements were required forthwith, the church authorities were asked to show their ability to provide their full share of the cost. If the improvementshad to be made within ten years, they were asked to show that theycould provide 50 per cent, of their share. If the improvements werenot to be made until after ten years, they were asked to show thatthey could - provide 25 per cent, of their share. He had been advised that this administrative arrangement was intra vires. If it were decided to introduce amending legislation, it would be essential to preserve the general financial structure of the Act of 1944 and toseeure the agreement of all the various authorities with whom the 1944settlement had been negotiated. Without such agreement the legisla-tion would become controversial and the whole subject of the financing of denominational education would be re-opened. although there could be no question of going back on the 1944 settlement, hewas collecting information on the cost of the necessary improvements in denominational schools, with a view to lessening the field of contro-versy by securing agreement on the facts.The general view of the Cabinet was that, if the Law Officersconfirmed the legality of the administrative measures which theMinister was taking, there was much to be said for proceeding onthat basis. The discussions which the Minister proposed to have withthe Opposition leaders might, however, show that the Oppositiondesired to go further and to regularise the position by amending legislation. If so, there would be no serious objection to a statutory provision on the lines indicated in paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 87, pro-vided that the agreement of all the interested parties on the terms ofthe legislation could be secured. If the Ministers discussions withthe Opposition suggested that an attempt should be made to framelegislation, it was undesirable that the Government should appear tohave yielded to pressure from the Opposition expressed in the opening speech by a member of the Opposition in the debate on education on Thursday, 4th May; and in any event fresh legislation could notbe discussed in a Supply debate. In these circumstances it might bewell if the Minister of Education, in reply to a Question which hadbeen tabled for answer on 4th May, could indicate that the Govern-ment were prepared to consider the practicability of legislation on thelines set out in paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 87.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if discussions with the Opposition showed thiscourse to be desirable, the Government should indicate their willingness to consider legislation on the lines set outin paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 87.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to consult the Law officers on the legality of the administrative measures which hewas taking to meet the difficulties of the church authorities.
(3) Invited the Minister of Education to bring before the Cabinet.  on 4th May the terms of any statement which he was proposing to make, in answer to a Parliamentary Question,setting out the Government&apos;s policy in this matter.international 4.
