EducationExpenditure(previous reference:CC. (61) 67thConclusions,Minute 7)1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the chief secretary, Treasury (C (61) 210) and the Minister of Education(C. (61) 212) oii the level of educational expenditure in the period up to 1965-66.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Treasury were seeking to contain the expansion of public expenditure within thelimits of the increase in the gross national product, which was estimated at something between 2  and 3 per cent, for this period.An expansion of 2\ per cent, had been agreed for the national health Service; and, for the education programme, he had beenready to concede a higher figure of 3 per cent. Current expenditureon education was now running at the rate of  694 million a year;and a 3 per cent, increase would bring it up to  780 million in fouryears. The Minister of Education was, however, anxious to adhere to a programme rising to  830 million in four years, and thusinvolving an annual increase of 4*6 per cent. This was in his viewtoo high; with an annual growth of 3 per cent, it should still bepossible to plan for steady and acceptable expansion.In investment, as opposed to current expenditure, the Minister^programme also showed a steady increase, rising from  117 million in 1961-62 to  139 million in 1965-66. In the present state of our resources increases of this order in educational building could notbe authorised unless compensating reductions were made in other services. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested that theprogramme should be stabilised at  120-5 million for the three-year period up to 1965-66. This was an increase of  3 million a year over the level for the current three-year period. He recognised thatthis would involve the postponement of projects in the 1962-63programme which had already been approved, but he saw no alternative.The Minister of Education said that the only practicable wayto get a substantial saving in current expenditure would be by reducingthe supply of teachers. But even under present plans he was facedwith the prospect next year of having to turn away 2,000 qualifiedapplicants for teacher training because there would be no room forthem in the training colleges. To restrict the programme deliberatelyat this stage seemed to him to be politically and economicallyindefensible. The growth in national resources on which all government expenditure was dependent would be greatly influenced by our success in improving and expanding the educational services.This in turn was governed by the supply of teachers. Against this background it was difficult to see how to make cuts in the educationalbuilding programme which would have any effect on current expenditure at all. He had set out in his paper (paragraph 5) themain elements in the present programme. It was impossible toreduce that part of the programme which aimed at providing school places for children who would otherwise have no school to go to.The reorganisation of all-age schools had been *niilt into theEducation Act. 1944. and had consistently figured in the Conservativeprogramme for education. A pledge had been given in the white paper of 1958 that the programme would be completed in five yearsand under present plans this would be achieved, except in Liverpool,where there were special problems. Those parts of the programme which aimed at providing better scientific and workshop facilities were also essential. Thus, the only part of the programme in whi^hreductions could be made was that for the replacement and rebuildii.of out-of-date and unsatisfactory schools. Work under this he- twas now concentrated largely on secondary schools. As new schoolswere built, political pressure for the replacement or rebuilding ofthe older schools increased. Moreover, postponements or reductions in the replacement programme would not produce any saving incurrent expenditure.    It could  indeed be argued that current6O20O-11b 2
expenditure would increase if the programme were held back, forthe older schools were more expensive to run. There was also a difficult question of timing. If the programme in later years wereto be cut to the figure of  120-5 million which the Chancellor of theExchequer had suggested, it would be necessary to postpone projectsalready approved for 1961-62 and 1962-63. This was becausebuilding costs were greatest in the second and third years of any givenproject. It did not seem to be politically practicable to announce atthis stage major cuts in the school building programme for next year.This would be interpreted as a policy of restriction, not of growth,and would be repudiated by public opinion.In discussion the following points were made:(a) On present evidence a serious shortage of teachers wasforecast for 1970. This would make it very difficult to defend apolicy which could be interpreted as restricting still further the supplyof teachers. This argument applied with particular force to technical education in view of the emphasis placed on the need to improve thefacilities for technical training generally, and the expansion of day-release schemes for industry.(b) It was not clear that it would be necessary to cut projectsout of the building programme altogether. It was rather a questionof controlling starting dates and spreading out the programme overa longer period. Increases in the later years of the period might bemore manageable than increases now. Nevertheless, it was probablethat any substantial postponement of new starts would be represented as a cut in the education programme.(f) It was difficult for Ministers to take a final decision aboutinvestment expenditure in education without considering at the sametime plans for capital expenditure elsewhere, particularly on housing and roads. Comprehensive proposals had been put before theEconomic Policy Committee but had not been circulated to theCabinet. Priorities were changing all the time. Housing, for example,had been the highest priority 10 years ago; it had dropped back inthe interval but was now likely to rise again. Slum clearance wouldbe a major political issue in the following year.(d) From a national point of view it was by no means clear that-6 per cent, would be regarded as an excessive increase in expenditure on education and there would certainly be many whowould argue that an increase of 3 per cent, was too small.(e) It would be helpful to the Cabinet to see in some detail theeffect of reducing the investment programme for school building bystated amounts; as well as the figure of  120-5 million which theChancellor of the Exchequer had suggested higher figures of, say, 125 million and  130 million should also be examined.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Education to circulate a paper setting out the effect of reducing the education investmei tprogramme for the period 1963 64 to 1965-66 from itspresent planned level to an average of  130 million,  125million and  120 million.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to circulate, for theinformation of the Cabinet, a paper showing the present plans for civil public investment as a whole in the threeyears in question.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting
EducationColleges ofAdvancedTechnology(previous reference :CC. (61) 67thConclusions.Minute 7)2. The Cabinet again considered the memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (61) 191) on the transfer of Colleges of advanced Technology to direct grant.The Minister of Education said that arrangements to transferthese Colleges to direct grant were well advanced. Great importancehad been attached to the transfer by the Chairman of the Committeeon Higher Education, who had urged him to proceed with it inadvance of the publication of the Committees report. This course was also supported by leading scientists, who deplored the original decision to set up the colleges under the control of local authorities.The transfer would not result in any increase in public expenditure.It involved no more than a bookkeeping transaction under which some  5 million would be transferred from the rates to the Exchequer.If at this late stage he had to tell the local authorities that the transferwas to be postponed for a year he would be placed in an embarrassing position. The local authorities, although they had at first been unwilling to accept the transfer, had in the end been most co-operative;to tell them now that they would have to carry the load on the ratesfor an extra year and hand over control at the end of that time would create a major grievance. They might well want to re-negotiate theterms of transfer, with increased cost to the Exchequer.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that much more than a book-keeping transaction was involved. The Chancellor of the exchequer had given a specific pledge to restrict the rise in the 1962-63 Estimatesto no more than 2\ per cent, above the level for 1961-62. The wholeof the  5 million involved in this transfer would fall on the estimates and some other saving would have to be found to make room for it.The Cabinet had already considered painful changes designed tosecure economies, e.g., in the nutritional services, and were still far short of the total of  100 million which was required. To accept thisextra  5 million now would add unnecessarily to their difficulties. Itwas not strictly true to say that the salaries of the teachers at the colleges would be affected by the delay; they had already been promised substantial increases from 1st April, 1962, and it was most unlikely that any further increases could be negotiated before April1963. The reaL trouble was the fact that the estimated cost of the colleges had risen so steeply. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldhave been prepared to carry the extra  1$ million which was at firstthought to be involved; but it was much more difficult to absorb the revised figure of  5 million.In discussion to following points were made:(a) It was undeniable that the Chancellors pledge related interms to the level of Estimates and not to public expenditure as awhole. To accept the extra  5 million for the colleges would involvefinding an equivalent saving elsewhere, unless it could be argued thatthe cost of the colleges represented new business which had accruedsince the framing of the 1961-62 Estimates, and could for that reasonbe excluded from the calculation of the 2$ per cent, increase.(/)) It was difficult to take a final decision without knowingmore about the savings which might have to be made in other directions in order to reach the total of  100 million involved in theChancellor^ pledge. Further delay would make it even more difficultto persuade local authorities to accept postponement of the date of transfer with good grace. Nevertheless this risk would have to beaccepted.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a later date whenmore progress had been made in reducing the Estimatesmore progrefor 1962-63.
