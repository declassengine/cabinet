aircraft industry(previous references:CC. (60) 44thConclusions.Minute 2 and cc. (59) 64lhConclusions.Minute 4)2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Aviation and the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 150 and159) on the future of the aircraft industry.The Minister of Aviation said that, in pursuance of the policy announced by the Government in February 1960, the principal firmshad undertaken, at considerable cost and with great dilliculty, a major reorganisation of the industry. The Government had adoptedthis policy in order to maintain a substantial aircraft industry in thiscountry and had accepted that this would entail the continuance ofGovernment assistance for research at an annual level of  25 million and for the development and launching of new air-frame and engineprojects on a scale which would rise to an additional  20 million ayear. The industry&apos;s share in the financing of new projects was,however, considerably larger than this contribution from theExchequer. It had been recognised that this reorganisation of theindustry would involve the closure of some factories and a reductionin employment. These consequences were already h^:ng feil. But,in addition, there were signs of a run-down of design stalls and otherkey technicians which, if it continued, would undermine the efficiency of the industry. This arose from delay in reaching decisions on futureprogrammes and projects. If the Governments policy were not &apos;obe frustrated, linn decisions must be taken on the following projectswithout fnrth or clelav:(i) We should secure an agreement between British european airways and Sabena for services between London, Paris and Brusselswith American helicopters powered by British engines. This couldbe done at a cost of not more than  500.000 spread over the next five years. It would enable us to gain valuable operational experience,to link the helicopter group of the industry with United Stateshelicopter interests, to use British-built engines, and to facilitate theintroduction of the Rouxiyne. At the same time, a production order for 12 Rotodynes required for military purposes should he placed.Education 1.   The Minister of Education said that, at a meeting of the teachers&apos; Burnham Committee on the previous day, the representatives of the salaries teachers had agreed to accept the  42 million increase in salaries(Previous       offered by the Government and to rescind their decision to call a reference:      one-day strike on 23rd October and the withdrawal of supervision ofCC. (61) 56th school meals from 1st November.  The Minister for his part had conclusions.    agreed that, in consideration of this decision, he would not introduceMinute 6)      before Christmas any legislation to amend the procedure for determing teachers&apos; salaries.   This would give more scope for consultation before legislation was introduced.  The teachers had made it plain that they would be unwilling to accept any alteration inthe procedure for negotiating changes in their salaries until they had seen, and had had an opportunity of studying, what changes theGovernment proposed to make in the procedures for wage and salarynegotiation over the whole range of public employment.The Cabinet expressed their satisfaction at this outcome of thedispute over teachers&apos; salaries.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that relations with therepresentatives of Scottish teachers were also showing signs ofimprovement. Arrangements were being made to discuss the causes of dissatisfaction, apart from the level of salaries; but the teachersseemed to be in no hurry to begin these discussions. Tt was possiblethat they had been waiting upon developments in England and Wales.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.
and British European Airways should be encouraged to proceed withtheir purchase of this machine.(ii) The Trident aircraft should be developed, in order to meet a potential export demand.(iii) A tactical transport aircraft to replace the Beverley shouldbe developed. It might be possible to entrust this task to ShortBrothers, Ltd., in Belfast.(iv) Some flexibility should be allowed between the expenditureauthorised for research and that authorised for production.The prospects of the industry in the longer term would dependon collaboration with firms in other countries, particularly in europe and the United States, so that the cost of research and developmentcould be shared and our export prospects could be safeguarded. But,in order to meet the immediate needs of the industry, the fourproposals mentioned should be examined at once by officials so that decisions could be reached within the next three weeks.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreement that the Governmenfs declared policy for the aircraft industry shouldbe maintained.  The following were the main points raised :(a) The figures in C. (61) 159 which purported to show that employment in the aircraft industry was increasing were misleading.They were not up to date, and they included in some cases personsemployed by aircraft firms on other work. Employment in theindustry had declined substantially since June 1961.(/;) The support of military projects must be related to theessential requirements of a manageable long-term defence plan. ThePrime Minister would shortly issue a directive giving the assumptionson which future defence planning should be based, but some time must elapse before definite development and production orders forlong-term military projects could be placed.(c) Military projects should be examined by the establishedmachinery for this purpose, including the Defence Research PolicyCommittee; but this need not involve substantial delay.((/) Military aircraft should in future be designed to serve anumber of military roles. In addition, the requirements shouldwherever possible be adjusted to take greater account of the potentialvalue of such aircraft for civil purposes.(e) While the aircraft industry was certainly among the mostimportant of our technologically advanced industries, it was unlikelythat it could become economically viable, without government assistance, for a very long time. This increased the need to pursueany possibility of collaboration with the aircraft industries in othercountries. Some progress had been made in this respect through the negotiation of agreements with Germany for the development of an aircraft based on the P-1127. and with France and Germany for thedevelopment of the RB-162 engine. It remained extremely difficultto secure effective collaboration with the United States.(/.) The ship-building industry, which did r-H enjoy any subsidy,was critical of the Governmenfs policy of assisting the aircraft industry. The shipping industry also considered that the air linesenjoyed an unfair advantage by reason of their status as nationalised undertakings. There were in fact many large projects of technologicalimportance for which Government assistance might be justified. Theproblem was to decide which of these, on grounds of technologicalimportance and national interest, were most worthy of support. Therewas no machinery for considering the relative technological merits ofsuch different projects as radio telescopes, supersonic aircraft and nuclear maritime propulsion(u) The desirability of providing Government assistance for major projects of technological importance had to be considered inthe context of the need to restrain public expenditure in proportion to the prospective growth in the national product.   However, the
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th October, 1961.immediate problem in the aircraft industry was, not to increase thelevel of Government assistance which had already been authorised,but to take decisions to proceed with specific projects.The Home Secretary said that, in order to enable decisions to bereached as soon as possible on the four projects specified by theMinister of Aviation, it would be useful if the Chief Secretary,Treasury, could consider these, in consultation with the Minister ofDefence and the Minister of Aviation, as a matter of urgency. Itwould be helpful if the Chief Secretary, Treasury, were also toconsider at a later stage the longer term projects to which reference was made in the memorandum by the Minister of Aviation.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (61) 150 and 159.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence and the Minister of Aviation, toconsider as a matter of urgency the proposals listed inparagraphs (i) to (iv) above.
