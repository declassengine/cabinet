The Foreign Secretary said that, while the Soviet Govern-Nuclear Tests   menfs resumption of nuclear tests might be due in part to a desire to(Previous        improve their military position, it was likely that it was also a reference:       deliberate attempt to intimidate neutral Governments in the hope thatCC.

The Soviet decision had, however, given the West aconsiderable propaganda advantage.  It was unlikely that the SovietGovernment would accept the proposal made by the United States and united Kingdom Governments for a cessation of nuclear tests in the atmosphere. In that event further advantage might be derived if those governments could continue to refrain from making such tests.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the protests made byneutral countries, at their conference in Belgrade, against the Sovietdecision to resume testing were markedly less vigorous than thosewhich they would have made against a similar decision by the UnitedSECRET
^cf7* 3States or United Kingdom Government or, indeed, than those whichthey had made against the French nuclear tests in the Sahara. Thispoint might be made in private representations to those Governments.In further discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in tabling a resolution in the United Nations urging the cessation of all nuclear tests in the atmosphere. If such a resolutionwere disregarded by the Soviet Government, it need not inhibit theUnited States authorities from conducting such tests if they decidedthat they were essential for military purposes.  In any event it was understood, that the United States authorities had no need to.     I    conduct further nuclear tests in the near future. There might, on their*T I    other hand, be disadvantage in tabling such a resolution, since thevv *    Soviet Government might propose an amendment calling for the cessation of all nuclear tests without effective control. An amendmentof this sort, which the  United  States  and United  kingdom governments could not accept, would have great emotional appeal formany neutral countries.The Prime Minister said that a message should be sent to theUnited States Government suggesting that, if the Soviet government did not accept the joint proposal to refrain from atmospheric nuclear tests, consideration should be given to the means of extracting furtherpolitical advantage for the West from the Russian resumption oftesting. It was to be hoped that time would be allowed for full consideration of this question before the United States authoritiesdecided to resume nuclear testing on their own account.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to the Prime minister a draft message to the United States Government on thelines which he had indicated.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit to the PrimeMinister an appreciation of the need of the United states authorities to resume nuclear tests.germany berlin(previous reference:CC. (61) 45thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 132) on the Berlin situation.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad abandoned their earlier concept of meeting any obstruction to allied access to Berlin by a military probe. Instead the United states secretary of State, at the recent meeting of Foreign Ministers in Paris,had proposed a double-barrelled policy of building up the military strength of the North Atlantic Alliance while at the same time beingready for negotiations. The purpose of increasing the state of militarypreparedness was both to dissuade the Soviet Government fromaggressive unilateral action and to bring pressure on them pendingnegotiations, and also to provide a wide range of military action in thelast resort. Various steps were being progressively taken to reinforceUnited Kingdom forces in Europe, including the despatch of a surface-to-air guided weapons regiment, the earmarking of two anti-aircraftregiments, and the provision of certain additional aircraft. But thesedid not represent a significant increase in the strength of the british army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.) and did not fully meet the requests for additional efforts which had been made to us. The difficulty was thatB.A.O.R. could not be brought up to full strength without calling upreserves or reintroducing some form of compulsory military service.
3o1aCC. 49 (61)In view of the strong opposition of the French Government to the initiation of negotiations on Berlin, the United States Government hadnot yet carried out their intention to make an early public move in thisdirection. It had, however, been arranged that the Western foreign ministers should meet in Washington on 14th September to discusspossible solutions for Berlin, and the United States Ambassador in moscow would shortly take soundings of Mr. Khrushchev to ascertain whether there could be an early opportunity for discussing with theSoviet Foreign Minister means by which negotiations might bebrought about. It seemed clear that, sooner or later, negotiations would take place, but it might be best for these to be concentrated onthe narrow issue of the presence in Berlin of Western forces and theirmeans of access, rather than on the even more difficult problems ofself-determination and the reunification of Germany.The Cabinet first discussed the question of further military preparations. There was general agreement that it would be premature to call up reservists or to reintroduce compulsory militaryservice. These measures would require the approval of Parliament,and there would be serious disadvantage in allowing an opportunityfor debate on Berlin while the prospects of negotiation were stilluncertain. Some further steps might be taken to increase the strengthof our forces in Germany over the next few months by drawingindividual specialists and technicians from other theatres. We could also make it plain that we should be prepared to call up reservists andto introduce some form of compulsory military service if the situationbecame critical.59910-1b 3
appear reluctant to participate in the planning of economic counter-measures on the lines approved by the Western Foreign Ministers inParis.The Cabinet then discussed the problem of initiating discussions with the Soviet Government. There was general agreement that,while the French Government were justified in asserting that negotiations were likely to entail concessions by the West, the riskin present circumstances of accidental hostilities was considerable andjustified the view, which was shared by the United States and WestGerman Governments, that negotiations should if possible bearranged without delay. On balance it seemed that there would be advantage in seeking a settlement before the Soviet Government had signed a peace treaty with East Germany, since this would be more likely to provide Soviet guarantees for such Western rights in relationto Berlin as might be secured in negotiation.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the BerlinContingency Planning (Non-Military Counter-Measures)Committee to submit to him, for the meeting with western Foreign Ministers in Washington on 1.4th Septem-ber, a detailed brief on the disadvantages of a completeeconomic embargo against the Soviet bloc and theadvantages of the application of economic counter-measures to East Germany.&apos; (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, at the meeting of WesternForeign Ministers in Washington on 14th September, to be guided by the views expressed in their discussion.United NationsChineseRepresentation(previous reference:CC. (54) 49thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (61) 131) on Chinese representation in theUnited Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that, at the forthcoming meeting of theUnited Nations General Assembly, it would not be practicable to useagain the moratorium device which had hitherto been successful inprocuring deferment of the question of Chinese representation. Therewould not now be enough support for this.&apos; The United states administration had therefore been considering possible alternativesand had suggested that the Assembly should be asked to declare bysimple majority that the subject of Chinese representation was an&quot; important question &quot;, with the result that any resolution dealing with it would require a two-thirds majority. They would then muster ablocking one-third of the votes to exclude the Peking Government thisyear, and subsequently would have the matter referred to acommission which would examine it in conjunction with the criteria for membership of the United Nations and the composition of united nations councils, of which China was a member by specific provisionof the Charter.A move of this kind might well be attacked as merely anotherdevice to preclude substantive discussion; and the voting arrange-ments entailed by it appeared far from reliable. Moreover, the UnitedKingdom Government had publicly stated their own view that theChinese seat should be held by the Peking Government. On the otherhand, the proposition that Chinese representation was an&quot; important question &quot; was incontrovertible, and none of the possible alternative courses of action seemed preferable. No form ofresolution based on a &quot; successor State&quot; conception wouldbe accepted by the United States Administration or, probably, by either of the Governments in Peking or Formosa, and a straight vote on Chinese representation, with the United States and the UnitedKingdom Governments in direct conflict, would be most damaging.In discussion it was the general view of the Cabinet that, in spiteof the drawbacks of the proposal and the likely division of opinion5ECT; F;T
within the Commonwealth upon it, the right course would be tosupport the United States proposal on the understandings set out inparagraph 10 of C. (61). 131.The Cabinet Approved the recommendation made in paragraph 10 ofC. (61) 131.Middle EastKuwait(previous reference:CC. (61) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (61) 133) outlining the military dispositions whichwould be required in future in order to maintain our capacity to forestall an attack by Iraq on Kuwait.The Minister of Defence said that the Ruler of Kuwait had now-agreed that a stockpile of British equipment might be established in kuwait, and that a small number of technicians might be stationedthere to maintain it. The cost of this would be defrayed by the Ruler.It was desirable that this should be in position before the Arab Leagueforces entered Kuwait.. As regards the other dispositions outlined in his memorandum,the Minister said that he was satisfied that these would be necessary if we had to be in a position to put a substantial force into Kuwait at36 hours&apos; notice. He hoped, however, that before becoming finallycommitted to those dispositions Ministers might be able to review the continuing need for that requirement when it was known what sort of force the Arab League would put into Kuwait and for how long itwas likely to remain there.In discussion it was suggested that, as Kuwait had now joined theArab League and invoked its protection, the special relations whichwe had previously had with the Ruler might be affected. A newpolitical situation might develop in which we should be less likely tobe called upon to safeguard the independence of Kuwait by militarymeans. We might have to rely increasingly on political methods ofsecuring our interests in Kuwait. In the longer term we should weighthe value of those interests against the future cost of being preparedto maintain kuwait&apos;s independence by military means. While itwould continue to be necessary to maintain some military presence inthe Persian Gulf in order to safeguard our oil interests generally, afresh political assessment might show that it was unnecessary tomaintain a military deployment on the full scale envisaged in C. (61)133.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that immediate steps should be taken to establish astockpile of British equipment in Kuwait, on the basisaccepted by the Ruler.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence,to consider whether our military commitments in thePersian Gulf should now be redefined in the light of probable changes in our relationship with Kuwait.EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC. (61) 45thConclusions,Minute 2)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the full effect ofthe measures he had announced before the recess could not yet be seenbut current indications of the state of the economy were on the wholeencouraging. There was somewhat less pressure on employment,though this was due partly to the seasonal addition of school leavers.Production during the second quarter of the year showed a slight increase over the first quarter.   There had been an appreciable
secp.f,treduction in the level of bank advances. Exports and imports in Julyhad shown a better balance more, however, because of a reductionin imports than because of an increase in exports. The general position of sterling was improving and there had been a reasonableaccretion to the reserves in the previous month. Serious difficulties would, however, be encountered over the next six months, since theinternational situation might aggravate the inevitable seasonalpressures on the reserves. He was conscious, in particular, of the disadvantages of the high interest rate on finance for exports.The. Chancellor then described the discussions he had held inrecent weeks about the wages pause and economic planning.Within the Civil Service the associations representing non-industrial civil servants had expressed strong objections of principle to the Governmenfs interference with arbitration but were unlikely togo beyond public protests. Industrial civil servants had shown lessconcern for the principles of arbitration and were taking the effects ofthe pause slowly, and so far moderately. There was, however, one particular issue which would require further consideration. The ratesof pay of about 100,000 industrial employees were settled byautomatic reference to increases in outside rates of pay, under anagreement which did not expire until 1964. The Wages Committeewould consider on 7th.September whether it would be right to act in breach of the agreement and to withhold the increases which wouldin the ordinary way be due in October.In the private sector the employers&apos; organisations were accepting the need for a, pause and were advising their members to encouragecompliance with the Governmenfs policy. On the union side, the &quot;*response had been better than might have been feared. But there^wasa danger of a conflict in the early autumn in the electricity industry,where staffs would be able to argue that increases in pay, reflecting theincrease in productivity, could well be afforded.As regards planning, he had put before both sides of industry aproposal that there might be an independent body charged with theduty of producing and publishing economic plans, and an alternative proposal that there might be a two-tier planning organisation,comprising at the upper level representatives of both sides of industry under the chairmanship of a Minister, and at the lower level aneconomic planning staff, not under direct Government control butincluding civil servants as well as people seconded from industry. this alternative form of organisation might work on lines similar to thoseadopted in France, with sub-committees which would go into detailswith representatives of particular industries. Employers&apos; representa-tives had welcomed the prospect of participating in a planningorganisation of this kind. Trade union representatives, whileexpressing strong criticism of the Governmenfs policy, had notrejected the idea of participation but had asked for time to think aboutthe proposals. He was anxious to maintain the momentum of this approach and proposed to send letters to both sides of industry at theend of September giving a more detailed account of the proposed two-tier planning organisation and inviting discussion of it early inOctober. He had it in mind that the new organisation shouldsupersede the Economic Planning Board and the Council on Prices,Productivity and Incomes, but that the National Joint AdvisoryCouncil and the National Production Advisory Council for industry would be retained.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) In spite of the favourable reception given in many quarters tothe system of economic planning in France, it might be prudent, as amatter of presentation, not to lay much stress on the French model.(b) In some branches of the engineering industry there seemed tobe scope for reduction in the number of firms engaged and it might
7. The Minister of Education said that at a meeting on theprevious day with representatives of local education authorities and teachers he had made it clear that the Government would not increasethe offer of salary increases totalling  42 millions, and he had rejected a series of suggestions which had been put to him viz., that the offermight be made effective at an earlier, date; that payment of theadditional  54j millions might be authorised but not actually made until after the end of the pause in wage and salary increases; and that,if the Government must withhold approval for the  54; millions, theymight agree that the saving should be met mainly from increases whichhad been proposed in differentials for graduates instead of wholly atthe expense of basic scales.After the meeting it had been suggested to him that, if theGovernment could agree to abate the differentials and increase the basic scales, there was some possibility that the teachers would feel able to accept the limitation to  42 millions. He was satisfied that itwould be wrong on merits to make this concession, but he recognisedthat the gap between the Government and the teachers could berepresented as a small one and the Cabinet might feel that itwas expedient to make this concession in order to obtain a settlement.He understood that the teachers&apos; reason for pressing for it wasto establish that, while the Government might properly determine thetotal sum to be awarded, they should not control its detaileddistribution.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the Minister should maintain the position which he had taken upEducationTeachers&apos;Salaries(previous reference:CC. (61) 44thConclusions,Minute 3)CC. 49 (61)be necessary to undertake a programme of amalgamations, such ashad been adopted in the aircraft industry.(c) To maintain a rate of interest for finance for export which wasrelated to Bank rate was a disincentive to exporters; and thepossibility of providing finance for exports at favourable rates ofinterest should be examined urgently.(d) Any planning organisation of the kind now contemplated would be concerned with technological development in industry. the research Councils could make a contribution here, and thought should be given to the means of linking them up with the new organisation.(e) It was desirable that, before any further proposals were madeto industry, the Economic Policy Committee should have anopportunity of considering in detail the structure and functions of theproposed economic planning organisation.(/) If it were intended to have a further meeting about economic planning with representatives of the employers and the trade unionsearly in October, it would be advisable for details of the proposedplanning organisation to be sent to them well before the end ofSeptember.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe President of the Board of Trade, to examine means whereby finance for exports could be provided atfavourable rates of interest, and to submit a report to thePrime Minister.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for early consideration by the Economic Policy Committee of his proposals for a new economic planning organisation.
in regard to differentials. There were indications that opinion in thecountry was coming round to support the Governments view on that point, and it would be a tactical mistake to give way.The Cabinet Agreed that the Minister of Education should maintain hisrefusal to authorise abatement of the proposed amounts ofthe differentials for graduate teachers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th September, 1961.
