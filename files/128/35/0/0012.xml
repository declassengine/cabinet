congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (61) 9thConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Congolese provincialleaders, with the exception of Mr. Gizenga, had agreed at the meeting in Madagascar on a confederal form of constitution for the congo republic. It also seemed that, with the departure of Mr. Dayal, theCongolese military authorities might now be prepared to co-operate with the United Nations representatives and forces in the Congo.There was therefore some reason to hope that the situation mightimprove.South-EasiAsia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 10thConclusions.Minute 1)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Ambassadors-dor in the Soviet Union had urged upon Mr. Khrushchev the merits ofestablishing a commission of neutral countries as a means to ensurethe genuine neutrality of Laos. Mr. Khrushchev had agreed with the objective of a neutral Laos but had not committed himself as to themeans of attaining this.There was now some indication that it might in time be possibleto secure the participation of Prince Souvanna Phouma, who had recently met General Phoumi, in a broadened Government. Therewould be an opportunity for further discussion of this problem withthe United States Secretary of State at the forthcoming meeting of theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation.Law ofthe SeaIcelandicFisheries(previous reference:C.C. (61) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that the fisheries agreement with Iceland, having been passed by the IcelandicParliament, had now been signed and had been accepted by the leadersof the different sections of the United Kingdom industry. The Grimsbytrawler skippers were, however, threatening to refuse to take theirvessels to sea if landings of Icelandic fish were renewed. Although theagreement was now binding on the Icelandic Government as onourselves, a reimposition of the ban on the catches of their ships wouldhave an unfortunate effect on our relations with them and every effort would be made to persuade the British skippers to accept counsels ofmoderation.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Agricultureand Fisheries.Parliament 4.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that, if the Opposition continued to obstruct virtually all Government business, it would be impossible tocomplete the programme of legislation designed for the current session, even if the Whitsun recess were shortened and if parliament were to sit until 3rd August and resume the session in the second halfof October. It might therefore be necessary to defer until thefollowing session the Bills relating to Road Traffic, Depositors,
Q OBritishTransportCommission(previous references:CC. (60) 63rdConclusions an&apos;CC. (60) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Minister of Transport said that he wished to makea statement on 16th March about the initial steps he proposed to take to implement the reorganisation of the British Transport Commission.The present Chairman of the Commission, Sir Brian Robertson, wasto retire as from 1st June and was to receive, as compensation for theloss of 2\ years&apos; expectation of office, the sum of  12,500 (part of whichwould be subject to tax) in addition to his normal superannuationaward. The Minister had decided to appoint as Chairman-Designateof the new Railways Board Dr. Richard Beeching, a Director ofImperial Chemical Industries Ltd., who had agreed to release him for five years. Dr. Beeching&apos;s salary was to be the equivalent of his presentremuneration, namely  24,000.In discussion it was agreed that, while the salary which it was proposed to pay Dr. Beeching was likely not only to attract commentbut to have some effect on future levels of remuneration in the nationalised industries generally, it was necessary that these industries should be enabled to attract men of the right calibre by offeringcompetitive salaries. It was, indeed, only by doing so that they could hope to put their economy on a sound footing.In further discussion various drafting amendments to thestatement proposed by the Minister of Transport were approved. Itwas also agreed that it would be preferable that the statement shouldbe deferred until the following week, if the necessary meeting of theTransport Commission could be adjusted accordingly.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to make a statement onthe reorganisation of the British Transport Commission onthe lines he proposed, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to defer the statement untilthe following week if the necessary arrangements could bemade with the British Transport Commission.Criminal Justice (Scotland) and Oversea Resources Development. Itmight even be necessary, in addition, to give up the attempt to securethe passage of the Bills which had already been introduced on weights and Measures, Suicide and the Crown Estate, despite the fact that substantial progress had already been made with the first two of these.In discussion it was recognised that, while some reduction in theprogramme could hardly be avoided, deferment of all the Bills referredto by the Home Secretary would be acutely embarrassing to theGovernment. It might therefore be worth while to try to secure theOpposition^ agreement to facilitating at least such of them as hadwide popular appeal; if agreement could not be obtained, it might thenbe possible to show that the Government could not be held to blame for deferring this legislation. It was agreed, however, that no morelegislation should be introduced until possible tactics and the implications of deferment had been further considered by theMinisters concerned.The Cabinet Took note that the Home Secretary would give furtherconsideration, in consultation with the Ministers concerned,to the possibility of deferring the introduction of the road traffic, Depositors, Criminal Justice (Scotland) and OverseaResources Development Bills, and of suspending progress onthe Weights and Measures, Suicide and Crown Estate Bills.
GermanyDefenceFacilitiesin the united kingdom(previous reference:C.C. (61) 7thConclusions.Minute 6)6. The cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 34) about defence facilities in the United kingdom for the Federal German forces.The Home Secretary recalled that, at their meeting on16th February, the Cabinet had approved the provision of certaindefence facilities in this country for the Federal German armed forces,including facilities for tank range training for one armoured regimentat a time. They had felt, however, that it would be preferable not tooffer the German forces the benefits of the Visiting Forces Act, 1952,unless we were under some definite obligation to do so. He was nowsatisfied, in agreement with the Minister of Defence and the foreign secretary, that it would be necessary to extend to the German forces the provisions of the Visiting Forces Act and the Application of LawOrder madejinder it. It was impracticable for an armed force of one country to function satisfactorily in another country unless these facilities were conferred; and as soon as the Federal Republic ratified the Status of Forces Agreement reached by the North atlantic alliance (which was expected in the following year) we should be under a definite treaty obligation to extend the Act to them.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal. The extension of the visiting forces Act would, however, require affirmative resolutions of bothHouses of Parliament and, from the Parliamentary point of view, thebalance of advantage probably lay in deferring the debates for as longas possible. The extension should, however, be effected before thebeginning of the following session and it should be explainedmeanwhile to the German Government that they could not be given any of the facilities they sought until that had been done.The Cabinet Took note that the Home Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Defence and the Foreign Secretary, wouldprepare the necessary orders for extending to the federal german forces the Visiting Forces Act, 1952. and theApplication of Law Order; would in due course submit theorders to the Legislation Committee; and would give furtherconsideration to the timing of their introduction.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Nth March, 1961.
