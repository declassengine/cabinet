South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 12thConclusions.Minute 2)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Laos seemedto be worsening. The conversations between General Phoumi andPrince Souvanna Phouma had been broken off, and the latter had left the country. Militarily, the forces of Pathet Lao were gaining ground;and deliveries of Russian arms seem to be increasing.The Soviet Government still favoured a conference. Therefore,in the hope of finding a basis for agreement, he had suggested to theUnited States Government that a four-pronged proposal might nowbe put forward namely, that the International Control commission should reassemble in Delhi; that he and the Soviet Foreign Minister,as co-Chairmen, should appeal for a cease-fire; that the commission should be asked to report when the cease-fire had become effective;and that an international conference should then be convened. Hewould have an opportunity of discussing this proposal with theUnited States Secretary of State at the forthcoming meeting of theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Congo 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in the absence of Mr. Dayal,Republic        there had been some improvement in the relations between the United(Previous        Nations forces and the Congolese.

It would, admittedly, be more difficult to deal with the troops inKatanga; but, if the others were first integrated into the united nations forces, Mr. Tshombe might be more co-operative.The Foreign Secretary added that the discussions at the Meetingof Commonwealth Prime Ministers had disclosed a markeddivergence of view between the Commonwealth Prime Ministers most directly interested in the problem of the Congo.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the E?.ster recess from30th March to 11th April.nationalised industries(previous references:C.C. (60) 61stConclusions.Minute 3. andC.C.(60)16thConclusions.Minute 3)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 38) covering a draft White Paper on the nationalised industries.The Home Secretary said that following discussions withrepresentatives of the Boards of the nationalised industries on the basisof the aide-memoire approved by the Cabinet on 10th March, 1960, astatement had been drawn up in the form of a draft white paper which interpreted more precisely the existing financial andeconomic obligations of the nationalised industries.  The Boards in
general acknowledged the need for this since their statutory obligations were at present in undesirably vague terms especially thatwhich prescribed that their revenues should, on an average of good and bad years, be not less than sufficient to meet all items properlychargeable to revenue. But they were naturally concerned with theway in which this new definition of their obligations would be applied in practice to their industries. The Boards of the nationalised fuel and power industries would in fact have preferred that thisrestatement of their financial objectives should not be made public.Nevertheless, the Committee on Nationalised Industries consideredthat there would on balance be advantage in proceeding with thepublication of the White Paper, though it had been suggested that the reference to an approximate return of 8 per cent, on the capital employed should be omitted. If it were agreed that the White paper should be published, it would be appropriate for it to appear at theend of the first week in April, in advance of the White Paper whichhad been promised on borrowing by the nationalised industries in thecoming year.The Minister of Power said that the Electricity Council regarded the figure of 8 per cent, (paragraph 23 of the draft White Paper)as unrealistic, and they considered that the proposed definition of obligations demanded a considerably higher rate of self-financing bythe electricity industry than had ever previously been suggested. they also took the view that to express a financial target in terms of therate of return on net assets was inappropriate for the electricity industry with its high capital requirements. The National coal board had also pointed out that the arrangements proposed inparagraph 32, under which a Board might require a written statement,which they could publish, of the views expressed by the government if these had induced a Board to modify their proposals for price changes, would damage the existing relations between the Governmentand the nationalised Boards. Despite these objections, he agreed on balance that, if Parliament and public opinion were to be persuaded to adopt a more realistic attitude towards the problems of the nationalised industries, the White Paper should be published, thoughit would be preferable to omit references to the figure of 8 per cent.In discussion it was suggested that there were strong arguments against publication. It was unlikely that the financial and economicprinciples proposed in the White Paper would in practice be appliedto the nationalised industries, whose circumstances differed so greatly,in a way which would have much effect on their efficiency and financialsoundness. At the same time it would have the disadvantage of concentrating public attention on the extent and manner of theGovernments interference with the industries&apos; freedom to adjustprices. If it was intended to give the nationalised industriessubstantial commercial freedom, the Government would have toaccept a corresponding diminution in their ability, not only to controlprices, but to influence the commercial policies of the Boards. Forinstance, the air corporations would insist or purchasing the most economic aircraft and would be unwilling to continue uneconomicservices or to accept higher airfield charges. In this connexion it waspointed out that the right which the Boards would have, under paragraph 33 of the draft White Paper, to ask for commerciallyunprofitable activities to be taken into account in fixing their financialtargets, might enable them to avoid complying with strict financialdisciplines.On the other hand it was argued that it was of great economic importance to establish a sounder financial policy for the nationalised industries, and that the publication of a White Paper would greatlyhelp towards public acceptance of stricter financial disciplines in this sector of the economy. In view of the objections of the electricity industry, the last two sentences of paragraph 23 might be omitted, andthe last sentence of paragraph 24 might be amended to read: &quot; for others, the objective may be in terms of a specified rate of return on
8 0 ICC. 15 (61)capital employed, depending on the particular circumstances of each industry &quot;.As regards the arrangements relating to the Governmenfs interestin the price policies of the nationalised industries, it was suggested thatthe last two sentences of paragraph 32 might be omitted; this would help to preserve the existing relationship between the Governmentand the Boards. On the other hand it was argued that the Boardsmight be unwilling to accept the financial disciplines proposed in thedraft White Paper if at the same time the Government retained theirpresent authority to interfere with their commercial freedom withoutdisclosing that they had done so.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would need to give further consideration at an early meeting to the question of publishinga White Paper in the terms of this draft subject to the amendmentsthat had been suggested to paragraphs 23 and 24, and to paragraph 32.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C (61) 38 at an early meeting.Camcroons 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (61) 36) about the future of the BritishCameroons.The Colonial Secretary said that, in the recent plebiscite on thefuture of the British Cameroons after the ending of our presenttrusteeship under the United Nations, the Northern Cameroons hadvoted for joining Nigeria and the Southern Cameroons for joining theCameroun Republic.The Cameroun Republic was disappointed at the result of the plebiscite in the Northern Cameroons and intended to challenge itsvalidity at the United Nations. It should be possible to rebut anyallegations against the propriety of the voting, but the Republicwould almost certainly be able to rally the support, not only of theother French Community States, but also of France herself.Administratively, there would be little difficulty in transferring the Northern Cameroons to Nigeria and it was in our political andfinancial interest to complete the transfer as soon as the agreementof the United Nations could be obtained. The transfer of theSouthern Cameroons to the Republic would give rise to moredifficulty. While the Republic at present appeared willing toco-operate in the transfer, difficult problems would arise over theconstitutional, financial and defence arrangements and the futurestaffing of the public services and the police. All these questions would need to be discussed with France, Nigeria and the Republic.While it was in our interest that the transfer should be completed withas little delay as possible, great care would be needed if we were toavoid a breakdown in administration which could lead to a situationcomparable to that in the Congo. The Colonial Secretary said thathe proposed to consider with the Foreign Secretary how further discussions with the other Governments concerned could best be pursued.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the course proposed by the Colonial Secretary. Furtherconsideration should, however, be given as a matter of urgency to thebest and quickest methods of reducing our military and financial commitments in the Southern Cameroons.
Economic 6.  The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the survey, Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 37 and 42) to which were annexed1961 drafts of Part I of the Economic Survey, 1961, and of certain additional paragraphs.The Chancellor of the Exchequer proposed that the economic survey for 1961 should be published as a White Paper on 5th April.No question arose about Part II (a factual account of developments in1960) and Part I (an assessment of the economic situation at thebeginning of 1961 and of the factors likely to affect developments inthe remainder of the year) had been approved by the Economic PolicyCommittee. The Committee had been inclined to the view that a barestatement (at the end of paragraph 23 of the draft) that excess demanddamaged the internal value of money and the balance of paymentswas a sufficient answer to the criticism that the action taken by theGovernment to check excessive demand was itself the cause ofstagnating production. On reflection, however, his opinion was thatthis gave less than adequate weight to the Governments view that themeasures they had taken to influence the level of demand had madeconditions more, rather than less, stable than they would otherwise have been, and that this view should be elaborated on the lines of theadditional paragraphs he had put before the Cabinet.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the proposed lines of the Economic Survey for .1961, andthat the balance of opinion was in favour of including an additionalpassage as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Thisshould, however, be amended so as to avoid suggesting that action to restrain demand was a necessary and permanent part of theGovernments policy and that to allow increased pressure of demand would not stimulate increased production in the short run.In further discussion the Cabinet approved a number of minor and drafting amendments in the draft White Paper.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the addition of the paragraphs annexed to C. (61) 42, and subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion, the draft of Part I of the Economic Survey, 1961,annexed to C. (61) 37; and authorised the Chancellor of theExchequer to arrange for publication of the economic survey early in the following month.7.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (61) 39), to which was annexed a draftBill providing temporarily for the consequences of South Africa&apos;sReferences:     withdrawal from the Commonwealth.C.C.(61)13thConclusions and The Commonwealth Secretary said that detailed negotiationsC.C. (60) 34th with the South African Government would be needed before all theConclusions, problems connected with our future association with South Africa asMinute 3)       a country outside the Commonwealth could be determined.  TheseSouthAfrica(PreviousThe Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (61) 36.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War, to bring before an early meeting of the Defence Committee detailed proposals for reducing our military commitments in the Cameroons.
included such major questions as citizenship, preferences and othereconomic matters, defence arrangements and the future of the high commission territories. There was no possibility that the discussions could be completed and the necessary permanent legislation passed before South Africa became a republic on 31st May. He therefore proposed immediate legislation to provide that for an interim period,say until 31st March, 1962, the existing law of the United kingdom should continue to operate in relation to South Africa as if she had not become a republic and had continued to be a member of theCommonwealth.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in principle with the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposal. It would be important to avoid giving the impression that after her withdrawal South Africawas to remain a member of the Commonwealth in all but name. Atthe same time the present law would have to continue for a sufficiently long time to allow all these problems to be fully considered and forthe enactment of the necessary permanent legislation, which might prove to be complicated. The proposed Bill should therefore be amended so as to provide for the interim period to run to 31st May,1962.The Cabinet Approved the draft Republic of South Africa (ConsequentialProvision) Bill, attached to C. (61) 39, subject to an amendment extending its duration to 31st May, 1962.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st March, 1961.
