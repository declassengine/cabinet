Coal(previous reference:CC. (61) 58thConclusions.Minute 5)1.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Power (C. (61) 186) on coal prices.The Minister of Power said that in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion he had given further consideration, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland! the Chief Secretary, Treasury,the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister without portfolio, to the proposals of the National Coal Board for selectiveincreases in coal prices. A report by accountants on the Board&apos;financial prospects up to the end of 1966 showed that the outlook was even more serious than had previously been thought. Even onassumptions which might in certain respects prove optimistic it was estimated that, without further price increases and allowing for the replacement of fixed assets in compliance with the requirements ofthe recent White Paper, the Board&apos;s deficit would be  47 million in1962 and  282 million over the whole five years. After consultationwith the Board, in the light of this report, he would bring before hiscolleagues proposals for making a comprehensive review of thelong-term future of the coal industry.The serious position which had now been revealed made it evenmore urgent to secure additional revenue.  The Board had putforward a comprehensive schedule of selective price increases, whichwere summarised in Annex A I of C. (61) 186.   In addition to the increases which had previously been proposed for Scotland and theNorth-Western region, as well as for Welsh boiler fuels, it was nowproposed to increase the prices of house coal and other large coal inEngland and Wales.   If the Board&quot;s proposals were accepted in full,they would earn  33 million more in 1962 towards their estimateddeficit of  47 million in that year.  To meet the criticism that the increases were unduly severe, particularly in Scotland, he would beprepared, if the Cabinet accepted the principle of differential price increases, to urge the Board to accept a number of modifications:these werersummarised in Annex A II of C. (61) 186, and their maineffects would be to reduce the price increases in Scotland from anaverage of 14s. lOd. a ton to 12s. 6d. a ton. and to postpone theincrease in the price of house coal and other large coal both inScotland and in the North-Western Division until 1st May   Withthese modifications the price increases would vield onlv  28-8 million in 1962.The Minister said that in his discussions with other Ministersthere had been a difference of view on the question whether theincreased revenue required should be sought by selective price increases or by a general increase. On the one hand selective increases would impose a burden on certain parts of the country, particularlyScotland, where the Government were already taking special measuresto support the economy. On the other hand, a general price increase would still further weaken the ability of the economic coal-fields to compete with oil and other fuels, and would fail to secure inuneconomic regions the reduction in demand which would enablethe uneconomic pits to be closed. His own advice was that the board should be allowed to introduce selective price increases sufficient tocontribute towards the policy of closing uneconomic pits anamaintaining the ability of the economic sections of the industry to compete with other fuels.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that in the past the board had been dissuaded from introducing selective price increases whichwould discriminate against those regions, like Scotland, which wereeconomically vulnerable. The serious financial prospects of theindustry made it essential that substantial price increases should beauthorised, and the Board\s latest proposals did not concentrateincreases on Scotland and the North-West region.   A general price
increase would not be in the long-term interests of the industry,whereas selective increases would be consistent with the financial policy recommended for the nationalised industries in the recentWhite Paper. It would, however, be important that increases in theprice of industrial coal in Scotland should take account of the special position of the steel industry there.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the increases proposed for house coal in Scotland were severe, but he was evenmore concerned about the effect of the increases proposed for industrial coal. The selective increases now suggested would removeone of the few economic incentives to industry to settle in Scotland.Although the effect on most industrial interests in Scotland would notbe materially heavy, the psychological effects would be serious andwould add to the apprehensions which were already widely currentabout Scotland&apos;s future economic prospects. The effect of theproposals on ColvilIe&apos;s steel-works would be particularly unfortunate.What would the Governmenfs attitude be if, as was likely, ColvihVsthen sought to import coking coal from the United States?In discussion is was suggested that the selective price increasesnow proposed by the Board were a departure from the principle that,apart from pithead adjustments which were not directly related tothe cost of production, changes in coal prices should be uniform andconsistent over the whole industry. There was nothing intrinsicallywrong in supplying coal at uneconomic prices in Scotland, in the same way that certain rail transport services were provided at present. Itwas by no means clear that a general price increase, if it were of a moderate amount, would in fact result in a decline of demand for coal from the economic coal fields.Against these arguments it was pointed out that there were already considerable variations in coal prices in different parts of thecountry. Competition from oil was keen and would increase,especially when transport costs were reduced by the development ofa national system of pipelines. A general price increase, which wouldhave to be of the order of 4s. 6d. a ton on all coal to raise an equivalentamount of additional revenue, would be virtually certain to reducethe demand for coal from the economic coal-fields and would consequently worsen the financial position of the industry as a whole.Moreover, unless substantial selective price increases were introduced in areas near the uneconomic coal-fields, the demand for coal in those areas would remain artificially high and it would be impossible toproceed with an adequate programme for closing uneconomic pits.A policy of selective price increases was. in short, the only way toenable the Board to exploit the natural protection from competition which coal enjoyed in areas near to economic coal-fields.It was also pointed out that, if the Board were not allowed tointroduce the price increases they recommended, it would become known that the Government had prevented them from fulfilling thefinancial obligations laid upon them by the recent White Paper. Inother words it would be recognised that the Government had decidedto subsidise an uneconomic coal industry. It had to be rememberedthat the Chairman of the Board had publicly expressed the opinionthat a genera! price increase would be contrary to the interests of theindustry.There was general agreement that the Government should accept responsibility for ensuring a reasonable economic future for Scotland.It was argued that the maintenance of artificial!) low prices anduneconomic coal production were not the appropriate means for providing economic assistance to Scotland. Instead, economicallyviable new industries should be given every encouragement to settlethere in accordance with the Governments policy for the distributionof industry.
congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61163rdConclusions.Minute 3)In further discussion the following points were made:(a) If selective prices were introduced, it would be desirable toavoid imposing an unduly severe additional burden on the steelindustry in Scotland, notwithstanding that it was likely that the effectof this would be taken into account by the Iron and Steel Board in fixing steel prices. It should therefore be represented to the coal board that it was in their interest to make some concession, if this was within their powers, to the Scottish steel industry. This wouldprovide the best hope of avoiding a request from Colville&apos;s that theyshould be allowed to import coking coal.(b) The Minister of Power said that he would be in a stronger position to urge the Coal Board to make some concession to theScottish steel industry within the framework of selective price increases if he were able to agree that the price increases which theBoard proposed for large coal other than house coal could beintroduced on 1st January and not deferred to 1st May, as suggestedin the modifications set out in Annex A II of C. (61) 186.(c) If price increases were approved, since some of them would come into effect on 1st January, 1962, it would be necessary for theCoal Board to hold consultations without delay with the domestic and the industrial consumers&apos; councils. It was desirable that, in thesecond reading of the Coal Industry Bill which was to take place on29th November, the Minister of Power should make an appropriatereference to the price increases which the Coal Board had in mind.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power to consult the Chairman of theNational Coal Board with a view to ensuring that, in introducing selective price increases, a suitable concession should be made to the Scottish steel industry, and toreport the outcome to the Prime Minister.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) approved the proposals inparagraph 10 of C. (61) 186, and agreed that the price increases proposed for large coal other than house coalcould if necessary be put into effect on 1st January, 1962.(3) Invited the Minister of Power to submit to the economic policy Committee in due course proposals for reviewing the long-term financial problem of the coal industry.2. The Foreign Secretary said that the representative of theUnited States Government at the United Nations was now proposing to bring before the Security Council a resolution which would dealwith the situation in the Congo generally and would not concentrate on Katanga. This resolution contained, however, two operativeparagraphs which would extend the existing mandate of the united nations, which was primarily to restore order in the Congo. Thefirst of these paragraphs would authorise action, including the useof force if necessary, to apprehend, detain and denort all foreignmilitary and para-military personnel and political advisers not underthe United Nations command, and mercenaries. This might be interpreted as inviting a renewal of the unfortunate military action taken by the United Nations against Katanga in August; and in authorising the use of force for the removal of political and otheradvisers it went beyond the measures which had been authorised inthe CounciPs resolution of 21st February. The second paragraphwould authorise the Secretary-General, in consultation with theCentral Government, of the Congo. &quot; to neutralise where necessary toprevent their use for military purposes against the United Nations,the Republic of the Congo or the civilian population, aircraft andSFCRFT
6SECMETother weapons of war At first sight an authorisation of this kindmight seem less objectionable than that in the first paragraph, butin practice it might involve equally drastic action includingt forexample, bombing-in support of the policies of the CentralGovernment.Discussion showed it to be the general view of the Cabinet that,while a resolution on the lines proposed by the United states representative would be an improvement on the resolution previously proposed by Liberia and the United Arab Republic, the two operativeparagraphs were still unsatisfactory. It would be inadvisable for usto abstain from voting on the whole resolution because this mightleave us isolated, or almost isolated, and might seriously damage ourrelations with the Central Government. The better course would beto abstain only in respect of these two paragraphs. The UnitedKingdom representative could explain, without analysing the wordingin great detail, that the Government had always attached the utmost importance to conciliation and had opposed the use of force save forthe prevention of civil war; and he could express the Governmenfsfear that to authorise the use of force would lead to a recurrence ofthe state of civil war in the Congo which it had been the object ofUnited Nations action to prevent.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations on the lines approved in their discussion.organisation for economic co-operationandDevelopment(previous reference:CC. (61) 61stConclusions.Minute 3)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during theprevious week he had attended a meeting of the Ministerial Councilof the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.In accordance with the view he had earlier expressed in Cabinet, hehad taken a cautious line in discussion of the proposal of the UnitedStates Government for a collective target of economic growth in the member countries of at least 50 per cent, during the years 1962-70.It had proved impracticable to resist the proposal but the british delegation had been successful in securing that it was presented in asatisfactory perspective. The period had been prolonged to 10 years(which would require an annual cumulative growth of 4 -1 per cent,or 4-25 per cent, allowing for poor performance in I%1) and it hadbeen recognised that growth rates must vary for different countries.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,2hl November, 1961.
