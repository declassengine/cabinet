industrial relations(previous reference:C.C. (61) 28thConclusions,Minute 4)RestrictivePracticesThe Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (61) 75) on restrictive labour practices.The Minister of Labour said that, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 18th May, he had given further thought to the means ofenquiring into restrictive practices by labour. Some useful action had already been taken in recent years. The National Joint AdvisoryCouncil had published in 1959 a report of their general enquiry intopractices impeding the full and efficient use of manpower. This hadlisted the industries in which such practices prevailed. Specialenquiries had also been held, or were proceeding, into particular industries, viz., docks and harbours, shipbuilding and the newspaperindustry. Restrictive practices had also been touched on in thediscussions which he had held on industrial relations in the motor industry. Two alternative courses were now open to the Government.They could continue to approach this question selectively, industry by industry. On that basis the National Joint Advisory council could be invited to take it up again and to identify the problems inparticular industries: the Minister could then follow up their recommendations by the means most appropriate to each case.Alternatively, it would be possible to establish a permanent body,similar to the Monopolies Commission, with the task of makingindependent enquiries into restrictive labour practices. Such a body would have no powers: its function would be to draw public attentionto practices which were contrary to the public interest. this alternative course would involve legislation: it would be unwelcome to industry certainly to the workers and probably to some employers: and it would leave the Government with an invidiousresponsibility for enforcing the Commission^ findings. The ministers aid that, on balance, he favoured the first alternative of continuing to deal with the problem selectively, industry by industry.Discussion showed that opinion on this question in the cabinet was divided.On the one hand it was argued that the precedent of the monopolies Commission was not encouraging. It had originally been thought that, if the full facts relating to restrictive practices were established by independent enquiry and made public, the pressure ofpublic opinion would be sufficient to induce the industries concerned to mend their ways. In practice this hope had been disappointed.Industry had not responded to this purely inquisitorial method. Ithad been necessary to supplement the work of the Commission by requiring the registration of restrictive trading agreements and establishing a special court with compulsory powers. This experiencesuggested that it might be preferable to follow, in respect of restrictive practices by labour, the existing policy of dealing with the problemselectively, industry by industry.On the other hand it was argued that this selective approach wasnot sufficiently dramatic to meet the needs of the present situation.Some fresh initiative was required to induce the trade unions to adopta more helpful attitude towards the efficient employment of manpower. In relation to restrictive practices by labour, a regularmachinery for bringing the facts to public notice might well provehelpful as a means of bringing the pressure of public opinion to bearon the unions.
200EconomicSituation(previous reference:C.C. (61) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)*2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the deterioration in the balance of payments position over the previous two years wouldbe aggravated by a further deficit in the current year. Until recentlythis deterioration had been masked by a substantial inflow of short-term funds, and it would have been worse if it had not been for certain exceptional receipts, such as the proceeds of the sale of theFord Motor Company and the repayment by Germany of herpost-war debt out of accumulated sterling balances. With thereversal of the flow of short-term funds, the balance of payments difficulties, together with doubts about the stability of the internal economy, had now resulted in a critical exchange position. It had so far been possible to avoid emergency measures because of theco-operation of central banks in lending substantial sums of foreigncurrencies against sterling holdings. But there was a limit to the accommodation that could be obtained in this way, particularly asthe belief was growing that as a nation we were trying to live beyond our means. It was therefore necessary to consider measures to demonstrate the Government^ intention to restrain the developmentof inflationary pressures in the economy and thus to encourageforeign confidence in the long-term future of sterling.The state of the internal economy was in some respects puzzling.Despite higher investments, rising demand and an increasing shortageof labour, production had so far shown little sign of increasing. Itwas estimated that the various components of demand, especiallyinvestment in manufacturing industry, would continue to risesubstantially. There were further signs of pressure for wage increases,and the retail price index was 2-7 per cent, higher than a year ago.It seemed clear that there would soon be no spare productive capacity and this strongly reinforced the argument for taking correctivemeasures without delay.The two. economic regulators which had been introduced in thelast Budget could not be used until the Finance Bill had receivedthe Royal Assent in the latter part of July. It would then be possibleto bring the first regulator into effect and to impose a surcharge, whichmight be at the maximum rate of 10 per cent., on most Customs and excise duties, and purchase tax. Examples of the consequential increases in duty, and therefore in prices, were 4d. on a packet of twenty cigarettes, 3d. a gallon on petrol, Id. on a pint of beer and  1on a refrigerator. This would yield  230 millions in a full year andwould increase the retail price index by H per cent.The second regulator provided for a surcharge on employers&apos;contributions under the National Insurance scheme, and at amaximum rate of 4 per cent, would withdraw purchasing power fromthe economy, to the extent of about  200 millions a year. It might,however, be preferable to impose a lower rate of, say, 2s. Od.; and inany case this regulator could not, for administrative reasons, comeinto effect before early November.As regards monetary measures, it was not thought that anincrease in Bank Rate would be of great value in presentcircumstances in encouraging confidence overseas; but it might beof some value for internal purposes, particularly in conjunction withother measures. If the first regulator were used, it would probablybe undesirable to tighten the existing hire-purchase restrictions, sincethe industries mainly affected still had a certain amount of sparecapacity. Although bank advances had recently shown a steady increase, and the ratio of advances to deposits was now high, it wouldprobably not be desirable to make a further call for special deposits;for the most likely result would be that banks would have to sellinvestments to meet such a call, and the measures would therefore beof only limited value.* Previously recorded in a Most Confidential Record
As regards public expenditure, it might be necessary for theGovernment to show that they were determined not to let investment in the public sector get out of hand, since the latest Estimates showed that in the aggregate this was running at nearly  140 millions abovethe total for the previous year. The five-year review of expenditureagainst resources which was now in train would soon be completed;It was already clear that, if the rate of increase of expenditure wereto be kept in step with the likely growth in national production, itwould be necessary to accept major changes of policy, including adimitation of expenditure on education, agriculture and defence. Itwas particularly important to restrict Government expenditure overseas. An examination of ways and means of curtailing overseadefence expenditure to  200 millions a year had been put in hand,and it might be necessary to consider drastic reductions in our commitments in the Far East and South-East Asia. It was also desirable to find some means of reducing defence expenditure inGermany: we might have to give warning that, in the followingfinancial year, we could only afford, say,  25 millions a year acrossthe exchanges on this account. It had already been accepted thatour aid to countries overseas should be held within a ceiling of 190- 200 millions a year. It might also be necessary to considerexchange control measures, such as the curtailment of travelallowances and the limitation of remittances abroad; but in generalunless action of this sort were drastic (for example, a reduction in the travel allowance to  50) the saving would be small and any value would be mainly psychological.It was clear that the building industry was heavily overloaded,and the reintroduction of building controls had been suggested. Butthis would need legislation and was open to the disadvantage of forestalling; a preferable approach might therefore be to seeksome administrative means of slowing down the rate of private housing and office building. As a precautionary measure, anemergency scheme had been prepared for the reimposition of restrictions on certain ranges of imports, including manufacturedconsumer goods; but any measure of this nature was open to gravedisadvantages in present circumstances since, in the absence of rationing controls, its effect would be bound to be inflationary, andit would moreover encourage other countries to adopt restrictivepolicies.It was possible that one of the factors in the decline of ourinvisible earnings was a diminution in the remission of profitsaccruing from oversea investment. It would be very difficultadministratively to enforce the requirement that such profits shouldbe remitted to this country, and this problem might conceivably bebetter dealt with through adjustments in taxation policy. He would continue to examine this problem.Finally, the Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the need forpositive action to encourage efficiency and stability in the economy.In this connexion it might be desirable to examine unconventionalpolicies, such as the unilateral reduction of tariffs, the encouragement of special forms of saving, and the establishment of a national economic planning council. Even more important would be theinculcation of some effective restraint on wage demands, since wages were the dominant factor in the inflationary pressure.The Home Secretary said that firm action to deal with the balanceof payments situation and to restrain inflation at home would beregarded by the country as the real test of the Governmenfsdetermination and ability. It seemed essential that severe remedial measures should be introduced before the summer recess.
There was general agreement with this view. In discussion thefollowing points were made:(a) It was suggested that the level of production would shortlyrise, and that with the greater consciousness of the importance of exports our prospects of foreign earnings might soon improve.Nevertheless, in order to restrain costs and to provide capacity forincreased exports, some restrictive measures were undoubtedlynecessary.(b) The fact that, despite the Budget surplus, an inflationarytrend was developing showed that the underlying pressures,particularly that attributable to increases in wages and salaries, were very strong. It was important that the Government should discourageunjustifiable wage demands, even at the risk of incurring a strike.It would, for example, be unwise to surrender to the teachers&apos; presentdemands. This in no sense meant that the Government shoulddeliberately provoke strike action. If the Government took otherremedial measures, especially in the field of public expenditure, thiswould of itself tend to encourage a sense of responsibility in wage negotiations. It might be that the Government should make some public declaration about wage policy, in the interests of encouraging restraint; such a declaration would have to cover thequestion of profits. The possibility of urging a standstill for a period in wage and profit levels should not be ruled out.(c) The current deficit was approximately equal to the sum ofour military expenditure overseas and our foreign aid. The fact thatwe still accepted these burdens, at the expense of our balance ofpayments, tended to be overlooked by international financial opinion.(d) It was suggested that remedial action might best take theform of a few firm and drastic measures, rather than a large numberof items some of which were of doubtful efficacy.(e) There was general agreement that the first regular (theimposition of a surcharge on Customs and Excise duties and purchase tax) would be appropriate, and that this might be at the maximum rate. Considerable doubts were expressed, however, about thesecond regulator (the pay roll tax) on the ground that this would, forthe most part, directly add to industrial costs.(/) It was suggested that our present policy of full employmentwas not wholly compatible with the maintenance of sterling as aninternational currency at a fixed rate of exchange and that, as partof the long-term problem, the possibility of a floating exchange rate should be re-examined.(g) If, as the Chancellor of the Exchequer had suggested, wewere to indicate that it was our intention in the following year toreduce our expenditure of foreign exchange on account of our forcesin Germany, it was by no means clear that we would be able toenforce any saving. To do so we would, in the last resort, have toremove the bulk of our troops, but this would be open to the gravestpolitical objections in present circumstances. Nevertheless, adeclaration of our need to limit our expenditure of foreign exchangeon this account might induce the other members of the North atlantic alliance to find some means of meeting our needs, perhaps throughthe creation of blocked sterling accounts. Our specific obligationarose under the Treaty of Western European Union which, after all,provided for adjustments in the event of balance of payments difficulties. Moreover, there would be no question of our removingtroops while the problem of Berlin remained critical.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that the Cabinet had hada valuable preliminary discussion of the current external and internal economic position. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would nowgive further consideration to the desirability of remedial action. Theintroduction of measures to restore confidence should secure the
CC. 32 (61)continued co-operation of the central banks to deal with theimmediate situation, but some fundamental adjustments in our economic and financial policies might be necessary to meet the longer-term problems. A new attitude to oversea expenditure, both for defence and aid, and to -oversea investment, might have to beadopted. It might be necessary to take a firm public attitude on thelevel of wages and profits. He would arrange for the Cabinet togive further consideration to all these matters at a further meeting in the near future.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer and of the points raised in the discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,16th June, 1961.
