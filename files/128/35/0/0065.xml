ParliamentCoal(previous reference :CC. (61) 64thConclusions.Minute 1)EconomicSituationPlanning(previous reference :CC. (61) 51stConclusions.Minute 4)2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the previous day the General Council of the Trades Union Congress had declined to endorse the recommendation of their economic committee thatthey should accept his invitation to participate in the proposed national Economic Development Council, and had decided instead to seek a further meeting at which to discuss with him their objectionsto the Governmenfs economic policy. Although they might in due course agree to take part, it was undesirable that the Governmentshould appear to be dependent on their assistance. While thereforehe would meet the representatives of the Trades Union Congress, he intended meanwhile to proceed with some of the preliminary measuresto establish the proposed planning staff.In discussion the view was expressed that those members of theGeneral Council who were hostile to the proposed planningconsultations had taken advantage of the reaction to theGovernment^ reaffirmation on 21st November of the policy of thewages pause to put off accepting the invitation to participate; butthere was a reasonable hope that the Trades Union Congress would shortly decide to take part. It was generally agreed that preliminarvaction to set up the proposed planning staff should p.v*ceed. thoughit would be inexpedient at this stage to appoint the head of the office.The cabinet took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.germany berlin(previous reference :CM.. (01) (i2ik1Conclusions.Minute 1)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 184) on the prospects of entering into negotiations on Berlin.The Foreign Secretary said that it was to be hoped that themeeting between President Kennedy and Dr. Adenauer and themeeting which the Prime Minister was about to have with general. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was suggested that, in order to avoid any subsequent complaint that the House had been misled, the proposals of the National coal board for increases in coal prices should be made known before thesecond reading of the Coal Industry Bill on 29th November, 1961.Apart from the criticism likely to be levelled against the proposalsfor price increases, some Government supporters might seek to limit the borrowing powers of the Board in order to discourage them frommeeting the claim for higher wages which had been presented by theminers&apos; representatives; and the Government spokesmen in the debate should be prepared to deal with this issue.The Minister of Labour said in this connexion that he expectedto be asked by Government supporters why the Government werenot prepared to take power to control wages in the nationalised industries. He proposed to take the line that to do so would entaildirect Government interference in a large area of the national economy, and that the trend of Government policy had been in the opposite direction, as shown for example by the recent White paper on the financial responsibilities of the nationalised industries.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to discuss with the Minister of Power the tactics for handling the debate on the Coal Industry Bill.
421ft)Malaya 4.   The  Cabinet  had before them a memorandum by theGreater Commonwealth Secretary (C. (61) 190) covering a copy of the publicMalaysia statement issued at the end of the discussions with the Prime Minister(Previous        of Malaya about the project for Greater Malaysia.Reference :CCYitiiiiOn&apos; The Commonwealth Secretary said that these discussions hadConclusion:.. been successful. It had been agreed that a commission should be minute en appointed to ascertain the views of the peoples of the borneo territories. It had also been decided that the existing defence agreement between the United Kingdom and Malaya would beextended to embrace the other territories concerned, but that theUnited Kingdom should have the right to continue to maintain theexisting bases and facilities in Singapore and to make such use ofthem as the United Kingdom Government considered necessary forthe defence of Malava. for Commonwealth defence and for thede Gaulle would lead to allied agreement that negotiations shouldtake place with the Soviet Government about Berlin. TheAmbassadorial Group in Washington had been working for several weeks on a paper which set out the points iikeiy to arise in such negotiations, the extent to which some of these matters weresusceptible of adjustment, and the objectives which we should seek.The text of this paper, which had not yet been approved by theGovernments concerned, was annexed to C. (61) 184. It showed thatthere was general agreement that it would be in the best interests ofthe allies to aim at a narrow negotiation confined to the problem of berlin, though the possibility of subsequent discussions on wider questions such as European security could be held out for the future.The main points likely to be pressed by the Soviet Governmentwhich would present special difficulties for the West GermanGovernment concerned the existence and authority of the east german Government, the recognition of the Oder-Neisse line, thepolitical relationship between West Berlin and the West GermanGovernment, and the limitation of nuclear weapons for Germany.It was likely that the West German Government would accept it ,need for increased practical dealings with the East GermanGovernment, and they probably realised that some form of recognition of Germany&apos;s eastern frontier would become inevitable;but it would be difficult to persuade them to agree to any substantial changes in the existing links between West Berlin and West Germany,and they were highly suspicious of any limitation on their possessionof nuclear weapons which might seem a mark of an inferior status.The Foreign Secretary said that, although he believed that theSoviet Government wished to settle the Berlin question by negotiation,there was very little evidence to that effect and there was no guarantee that they were prepared to concede an acceptable status for, and means of access to, West Berlin.In discussion it was suggested that the paper prepared by theAmbassadorial Group was unrealistic in a number of respects. Forexample, it was doubtful whether we should continue to insist thatthe source of Western rights in Berlin should remain unchanged.Again, it was hardly conceivable that West Berlin could continueto have the same relationship to West Germany as at present. Onthe other hand, if the West German and French Governments wereto be brought to accept the need for a negotiated settlement, it wouldnot help at this stage to put forward negotiating proposals whichwere less favourable than those included in the paper prepared bythe Ambassadorial Group.The Cabinet Took note of C. (61) 184.
SECRET 5CC. 65 (61)preservation of peace in South-East Asia. It was clearly understoodthat this right would enable us to use Singapore to fulfil our obligations under the South-East Asia Treaty.The Prime Minister said that the Commonwealth Secretary andthe other Ministers concerned were to be congratulated on the outcome of the discussions. The Prime Minister of Malaya might feel obliged to avoid acknowledging in public that the agreement would allow us to use Singapore to fulfil our obligations to the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation. It would not be expedient for usto emphasise this point unduly. For purposes of public presentation,it would suffice to make it plain that the right to use the bases and facilities in Singapore would remain with the United KingdomGovernment, who would be entitled to use them to fulfil theirinternational obligations.The Minister of Defence said that he proposed to discuss withthe Malayan Minister of Defence how responsibility for internal security in Singapore should eventually be transferred to theGovernment of a Greater Malaysia.The Cabinet Took note with approval of C. (61) 190.Europe 5.   The Lord Privy Seal said that a further meeting withCommon representatives of the European Economic Community had been heldMarket and in Brussels on 8th and 9th November for the double purpose of (i)Kuropcan hearing  the replies  of the  member governments  and  of theI-roe Trade Commission to the United Kingdom&apos;s application for membership of association (]ie common Market and (ii) making an effective start with detailed(Previous negotiations. The general tenor of the replies had been friendly butCC r(6l)C56th stress nat&apos; Deen &apos;a&apos;d on the importance of maintaining the balancer&apos;^.u,.Ln- Qf the European Community after the admission of the Unitedv. onciusions,        .     , , .    .  , ,    . .        -Minute &quot;*)        Kingdom and questions had been asked on a number of points,including particularly the duration of the transitional arrangements.Before the detailed negotiations could be begun there had been aprocedural discussion deriving from the desire of the FrenchGovernment to consider the problems of a common external tariffbefore considering Commonwealth problems. On this a compromise solution had been reached which had enabled discussions amongofficials to begin on the previous day.  These appeared to be goingsatisfactorily.There had subsequently been a meeting of the ministerial council of the European Free Trade Association in Geneva, whenhe had reported the outcome of the Brussels meeting. Three neutralmembers -Austria. Sweden and Switzerland had stated their intention of applying individually on 15th December to be associatedwith the Common Market. It was likely that an application for membership would be made by Norway in January. The intentionof the Portuguese Government was to seek a form of association on the Greek model and their application would probably be confined to metropolitan Portugal. Satisfactory conclusions had been reached on the acceleration of tariff reductions.The cabinet took note of this statement bv the Lord Privy Seal.
LocalGovernmentOrganisationGreaterLondon(previous reference:CC. (61) 41stConclusions.Minute 5)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (61) 185) covering a draft White Paper setting out Government proposals for there organisation of London Government. They also had before thema memorandum by the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster(C. (61) 188).The Minister of Housing and Local Government recalled that,in their discussions in July, the Cabinet had been broadly agreed thatthe main recommendations of the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment in Greater London ought to be accepted namely, thatthere should be a directly elected Greater London Council responsiblefor planning, traffic, main roads and other functions which needed to be planned and operated over the area as a whole; and thatboroughs formed by the amalgamation of existing boroughs shouldbe the primary units of local government. Doubts had been felt,however, about the Commission^ recommendations on the size ofthe boroughs and on responsibility for the education service. these and other points had been further examined by the Ministers most directly concerned and new proposals on them were included in thedraft White Paper which he now sought authority to publish.The draft proposed that, in re-arranging the pattern of boroughs,the aim should be to secure minimum populations of around 200,000wherever possible, though some boroughs might be substantiallylarger. Shortly after publication of the White Paper a detailed plan for creating 33 boroughs would be put before the local authorities as a basis for consultation.The Royal Commission had proposed that responsibility for education should be shared between the Greater London Counciland the boroughs. Ministers had considered a proposal thatthroughout the area education should be the responsibility of joint boards constituted by grouping (for this purpose alone) the newborough councils into units with a population in most cases of theorder of 400.000. This had not been found satisfactory, mainly because of the general antipathy to joint boards in local government,and it had been recognised that to cover the whole area with joint boards would amount to declaring that none of the directly electedlocal authorities in Greater London, although larger than county boroughs, would be capable of administering this local government service. The proposal put forward in the White Paper was thatoutside a central area education should be a borough responsibility and that the form of organisation for education within the centralarea should be left open for further consideration: it might be ajoint board or it might be a body constituted from those member selected from the central area to the Greater London Council. Thepopulation in the central area would be about two million.In discussion it was suggested that boroughs of the size proposed would not have much local character and might not attract the interestand loyalty of the people who ought to be engaged in localgovernment. But it had to be accepted that bigger authorities,through having greater financial resources and being able to recruitbetter staff, would provide a more efficient standard of service. Itwas also suggested that proposals for amalgamation of existingboroughs wotdd give rise to keen controversy which might be handled more easily if the Government refrained from modifying the recommendations of the Royal Commission. To rest on those recommendations, however, would make for less efficient servicesand would destroy one of the main advantages of securing the largest possible units, namely that education could then over the greaterpart of the area be put straight into the hands of the boroughs, thusdoing away with the need for joint boards for education save in thecentral area.The White Paper proposal that education in the central area should be the responsibility of a specially-created body would be
criticised as a departure from the general principle of reliance onboroughs, which was to be followed elsewhere in the area. It wasagreed, however, that there was no satisfactory alternative. TheRoyal Commission^ proposal for sharing responsibility for educationhad been shown by experience elsewhere in the country to make forinefficiency and friction between the authorities concerned; and inthe special conditions of central London, where the school system had been built up by a single authority (the London County Council),reversion to control by borough councils would involve thefragmentation of the service. There would be difficulties in the detailed working out of the compromise proposal in the White Paperbut on balance it appeared to be the best course to adopt. the consultations which would take place following publication of theWhite Paper would be bound to result in substantial modifications in the detailed boundaries of the new boroughs, which would in turnaffect the size of the central area for education purposes. For thisreason there would be advantage in leaving open for the time beingthe question of the precise form of organisation for the new body.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The White Paper might be improved by including in an appendix a statement of the services administered by the various types of local authority at present exercising responsibility in greater london.(b) Many people would welcome a statement in the White paper that the Government were considering whether borough councils inthe central area could be associated with the education service butit would be unwise to hold out hopes on this point which it would notin the event be practicable to fulfil.(c) It would be desirable to bring it out that local government reorganisation need not destroy historical ties and traditions withingeographical counties, but it would be inappropriate to suggest thatthe administration of justice could remain unaffected by there organisation. On this latter point a separate paragraph should beincluded, making it clear that the Government would have to reserveconsideration of certain consequences of their reorganisationproposals.(d) A passage should be included to describe the extent to whichelections could be suspended in the period before the reorganisationwas put into effect.(e) Publication of the White Paper at this stage would commit the Government to legislation during the 1962-63 session on a major political issue, but it was believed that it would be the general opinion among the Government^ supporters that this problem should not beleft until after the end of the present Parliament. The difficulties arising from postponement would be greater than those involved byearly action.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Home Secretary, the LordChancellor, the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster and the Minister of Education,to give further consideration to the points raised in their discussion.(2) Subject to Conclusion (I) authorised the Minister of housing and Local Government to present to Parliament a white paper on London Government on the lines of the draft attached to C. (61) 185.Cabinet Office. S.W. I.23 rd November. /V6/.
