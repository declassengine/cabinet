South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 16thConclusions)*1. The Foreign Secretary said that the President of theUnited States had now announced that his Government stronglyand unreservedly supported the goal of an independent and neutralLaos. He had said that if there was to be a peaceful solution thepresent armed attack by externally supported Communists mustcease, and that if this did not happen those who supported a neutralLaos would have to consider their responsibilities. He had endorsed the proposals for a political settlement which the United KingdomGovernment had made to the Soviet Union, and he had pointed outthat no time-limit had been set for a reply. He had specificallyreferred to the obligations of the United States Government underthe South-East Asia Treaty Organisation pact, and had clearlyindicated, that, if United States intervention became necessary, itwould be likely to be as a result of an appeal from that Organisation.The announcement, as a whole, had been firm but unprovocative,and we could certainly support the views which the President had expressed.The Commonwealth Secretary said that since the cabinets discussion earlier in the day he had seen the Prime Minister of malaya. He had told him of the deterioration in the situation inLaos and had asked what his attitude would be if the question aroseof intervention, either by the South-East Asia Treaty Organisationcountries or by the United States. The Prime Minister of Malayahad replied that a Communist conquest of Laos must be preventedand that, although there was a serious danger that hostilities mightspread through South-East Asia, military intervention might benecessary. In that event, he undertook to make a public statementgiving full moral support. He had also given an assurance that hewould make no objection to the despatch of British or commonwealth troops from Malaya, provided that his country andin particular its airfields were not used as a base for active militaryoperations. He expressed the hope that any such action would be properly presented in the United Nations.The Prime Minister then informed the Cabinet of the terms of a message which he proposed to send to the President of the UnitedStates. This emphasised the need to avoid, as far as possible, the disadvantages of overt intervention, if that course became necessary,and it pointed out that we had to take into account the likelyreactions of our Commonwealth partners, particularly India and malaya, as well as the general opinion of the neutral countries,especially as it would be expressed in the United Nations. Theproposed message suggested that the disadvantages of intervention would be less if it were undertaken by the United States, with the goodwill and support of individual members of the South-East AsiaTreaty Organisation, than if it were an operation undertaken by that organisation as such. It also suggested that it might be desirable,once it became clear that military intervention was necessary, forthe United States Government to report the situa^on to the united nations and to say that, as the Soviet Union had failed to respond to the United Kingdom proposals for a political settlement, it had become necessary to take unilateral action to hold the situation.The message repeated the warning that military intervention mightprevent negotiations and result in a stalemate. Finally it made itclear that if in the last resort the United States Government decidedto take military action, they could count on the support of the UnitedKingdom Government, though it would be necessary to agree what form our support should take bearing in mind the importance of theattitude of other Commonwealth countries.In discussion it was generally agreed that, if intervention were undertaken by the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation, the risks* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
of a major extension of hostilities would be greater. It was, however,pointed out that almost all the member countries would be willingfor the Organisation formally to intervene, and that it might bedifficult for the Foreign Secretary at the meeting in Bangkok to persuade them to the contrary. It was also suggested that, if it became necessary for the United Kingdom to give direct and overtsupport to an intervention by the United States, there would be great advantage in securing the participation of some Asian countriesin this operation.Further discussion showed that there was general agreement inthe Cabinet that, if the United States Government were to decide inthe last resort on overt intervention in Laos, we should give support for their action in whatever form might be agreed to be appropriateat the time. The Cabinet also agreed that, on balance, there wouldbe advantage if the Prime Minister sent a message to the President ofthe United States forthwith on the lines he had proposed.The Cabinet Agreed to support military intervention in Laos, if in thelast resort this were decided upon by the United StatesGovernment; and took note that the Prime Minister wouldforthwith send a message to this effect to the President ofthe United States.european free TradeAssociationFinland(previous reference:C.C. (60) 64thConclusions,Minute 4)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (61) 41) about the associationof Finland with the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.).The President of the Board of Trade said that furtherconsideration had now been given to the difficulties which would arise from Finland&apos;s agreement with the Soviet Union, under which she would have to extend to the Soviet Union any tariff reductions which she made in favour of the E.F.T.A. countries, if she becameassociated with E.F.T.A. It had now been established that the member countries of E.F.T.A. would all continue to withstand Sovietpressures for the extension of E.F.T.A. tariff treatment to their imports from the Soviet Union. It had also been ascertained thatthe United States, Germany, France, and the principal Common-wealth countries concerned in the GATT would not press their objections to the breach of her obligations which the association off inland with E.F.T.A. would entail. These countries had in generalsignified their understanding of the political importance of an association between E.F.T.A. and Finland.It was therefore recommended that Her Majesty&apos;s ambassador at Helsinki should be authorised to sign the draft agreement of association with Finland on 27th March.There was general agreement with this recommendation.The Cabinet Approved the recommendation in C. (61) 41.
