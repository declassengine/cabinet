The Foreign Secretary said that he had sent a message tothe Soviet Foreign Minister to ask him to accept the indian governments proposal that, as a means of exploring the possibilityof reviving the International Commission, the King of Laos should first be approached. It was likely that the Soviet Government wouldmake difficulties about this on the ground that the King was not ,anindependent agent and would have to act in accordance with theviews of Prince Boun Oum&apos;s Government. In a recent message tothe Prime Minister Mr. Khrushchev had maintained that the right course was to reconvene the Geneva Conference. The deterioration of the military position in Laos might eventually compel us to accept this proposal.Meanwhile the Government of Laos had requested the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation to send a preparatory commissionto visit Laos and to ascertain the facts as regards Communistintervention. This might be followed by a request for direct military intervention by the Organisation. It remained our view that military intervention would be unwise, and we should therefore continue to seek a political solution, in consultation with the United States andother Governments.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Law ofthe SeaIcelandicFisheries(previous reference:C.C. (60) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Minister of Agriculture and Fisheries said that theGovernment of Iceland were putting forward their preoccupationwith wage negotiations in their fishing industry as an excuse for avoiding the conclusion of a settlement of the fisheries dispute withthe United Kingdom. Agreement had virtually been reached on terms which the Cabinet had been prepared to accept at their previous discussion. In the interests of achieving a settlement, British fishermenhad abstained from fishing in the disputed waters for the last ten months. With the approach of the spring fishing season it was likely that some of them would not be prepared to abstain any longer, aridthere would be a risk of incidents. It was therefore desirable that a last effort should be made to reach an early conclusion of thenegotiations, and this might best be secured if the Prime minister were to send a personal message to the Prime Minister of Iceland.In discussion it was pointed out that, in the debate on the WhiteFish and Herring Industries Bill in the following week, it should bemade clear that the fishing industry would insist on a satisfactory settlement of the dispute with Iceland. Although the Bill had been revised with this point in mind; it might otherwise appear that the fishing industry were certain to receive compensation, whatever theterms of a settlement with Iceland.The Foreign Secretary said that the best course would be for him to send a personal message to the Icelandic Foreign Minister,in which he would explain the need for the negotiations to be concluded without delay by registering the terms of the agreementwith the United Nations. If this approach were not successful, itwould then be possible for the Prime Minister to send a personal message to the Prime Minister of Iceland.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to send a personal message to the Icelandic Foreign Minister, urging the early settlementof the fisheries dispute.

national health service(previous reference:C.C.(61) 1stConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland,the Minister of Agriculture and the Minister of Health (C. (61) 1) andby the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (61) 6) aboutthe level of subsidy on welfare milk; and had before them also anadditional memorandum on the subject by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (61) 8).The Prime Minister recalled that, at their previous meeting, theCabinet had agreed that increases should be made in the prescriptioncharge and in certain other charges in the National Health Service,which would benefit the Exchequer by some  15 millions in a full year.The increase in the Health Service contribution to be introduced later in the year would secure  48 millions, and a net increase of  120millions would be derived from increased contributions under thehew scheme of retirement pensions. There remained for decision thequestion whether approval should be given to the proposal to reducethe subsidy on welfare milk by 2d. a pint and, if so, the extent of any concessions which should be made in favour of larger families. Theproposal would bring a gross saving to the Exchequer of  9 millionsor  7 millions a year, according to the extent of the concessions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was difficult toestimate the reduction in the consumption of liquid milk which wouldresult from the proposal, especially as it would in part depend on what concessions were allowed. The reduction was, however, likelyto result in a loss to milk producers of the order of  1 million a year.But, since the standard quantity on which the guarantees to theindustry were based had already been fixed, any loss in 1961-62would be borne, not by the farmers, but either by the Exchequer or(through an increase in ordinary retail prices) by the consumer. Therewould be no objection to giving an assurance to the milk industry that if the cut in the subsidy led to a demonstrable fall in consumption,this fact would be taken into account in the 1962 Price Review. on balance, he was in favour of the proposed reduction in the subsidy,and would prefer that this reduction should extend to families with three children. If this course were adopted, it might be possible toavoid a further increase in Health Service charges or contributions for the remainder of the present Parliament.In discussion it was suggested that a reduction in the welfare milk subsidy in the case of all families who were clearly no longer in need of it would enable the Government to show that they were acting on the principle of concentrating Exchequer assistance whereit was most needed. In recent years there had been a marked improvement in the financial position of nearly all families and a consequent change in the attitude of the public to the need for thevarious forms of welfare subsidies. It would be unrealistic to ignorethese facts when considering how to meet the strain of steadily increasing Government expenditure.On the other hand, the new retirement pension scheme, theincrease in the Health Service contribution and the increased chargesalready agreed would involve a significant increase in the burden on individuals and families, and would bear especially heavily on those in the lower income groups. These changes and the proposedcut in the welfare milk subsidy were analogous to taxation and werenot true economies in expenditure. Moreover a reduction in the welfare milk subsidy was different in kind from the other measures in that it was unrelated to any corresponding benefits by way ofParliament 3.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
increased retirement pension or improved health services. Politically,therefore, it might be advisable not to reduce the welfare milksubsidy, which could easily be represented by the Governmentsopponents as a direct blow to children and their health.The proposal would, moreover, be unpopular with the milkproducers (even though it had no actual effect on their income) since they would regard it as inconsistent with the encouragement givenby the Government to their campaign to increase the consumptionof liquid milk. Since no practicable agricultural policy could avoid the production of more milk than was required for. consumption inliquid form, it would not be easy to justify any action which wouldresult in reducing that consumption. While it might be easier topresent the proposed reduction in the context of introducing a charge for school milk or an increase in the charge for school meals, therewere serious nutritional and other objections to either of these courses.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that, fromthe point of view of the broad political impact of what was proposed,the balance of opinion in the Cabinet appeared to be in favour of retaining the welfare milk subsidy at its present level. This wouldnot, however, preclude the Health Ministers from putting forwardtheir proposal for further consideration if, later on, circumstancesmade that seem desirable.The Cabinet Decided that the present level of welfare milk subsidy should, for the time being, be maintained.EducationTeachers&apos;Salaries(previous references:C.C. (59) 38thConclusions.Minute 6, andC.C. (60) 61stConclusions,Minute 5)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (61)7) about teachers&apos; salaries.The Paymaster-General said that the present salary scales for teachers had taken effect on 1st October, 1959. The report of the burnham Committee on which the scales were based had contemplated that the settlement should remain in force at least until 31st March,1962, and it had been made clear that it was on this basis that theGovernment had given their approval to the settlement. The teachershad recently given notice to terminate this agreement and had asked that negotiations should at once be opened for new scales to operate as early as possible in 1961. The teachers&apos; claim was for a salaryincrease of about 30 per cent., the annual cost of which would be 89 millions.To resist this claim and to refuse to allow any increase until thepresent agreement expired would be politically difficult, and open to criticism in view of the increases recently agreed for the police, theCivil Service and others. An interim increase would set an unfortunateprecedent, and could not be justified on cost-of-living grounds. Itmight in the end prove more expensive than to negotiate a settlementfrom a date rather earlier than the end of the current agreement.The Wages Committee had therefore concurred in the proposal ofthe Minister of Education that negotiations should begin for a newsettlement, but that it should be made clear at the outset that thiswould not operate before 1st January, 1962.The Minister of Education said that he recognised the disadvantages of condoning a breach of a Burnham agreement bythe teachers. It was, however, clear that, while they might not be unanimous, the majority of the local authority representatives onthe Burnham Committee favoured some advance in the date fromwhich a new settlement should operate, and there would be great
-6 - - SECRET&apos;difficulty in restraining them from agreeing to this. There was alsothe.point that,&apos;unless some.concession..were made to the teachers,- it would be impossible to secure their agreement,to a settlementembodying differential increases in favour of the more seniorappointments. These were-most desirable from the; point of viewof the quality of the service.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he accepted therecommendation of the Wages Committee, &quot;although if large salary increases were finally agreed it might be necessary to insist on somecompensating economies in the education service, either by slowingup the expansion programme or by some other method.In discussion it was agreed that, although the teachers&apos; claim was a bad example of comparability in wages, the balance ofadvantage lay with adopting the course proposed. Had it not been for the attitude of the local education authorities, it might have been preferable to open negotiations for a settlement without priordiscussion of the date of its operation. It was imperative that theGovernment should not concede and should secure that the localauthorities did not concede an earlier date of operation than January, 1962.It would in consequence probably be necessary to reopendiscussions on the amount of the general grant for 1961-62 as wellas for 1962-63.The Cabinet Endorsed the conclusion of the Wages Committee on theaction the Government should take on the claim for anincrease in teachers&apos; salaries, as set out in C. (61) 7.The Gambia 6.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theColonial Secretary (C. (61) 5) about the future of the Gambia.The Colonial Secretary said that, when Sierra Leone attainedindependence in April, the Gambia would (apart from Portugueseand Spanish possessions) be the only remaining Colonial territory in west Africa. The Gambia was too small and too poor to become fully independent alone, and Sierra Leone, the nearest British territory,was too far away and not sufficiently strong economically to acceptthe liability of a federation between the two countries. There were strong geographical and ethnic reasons for the Gambia becomingpart of Senegal, and this might provide substantial economic benefits to both countries. The Chiefs of Staff considered that there were nostrategic reasons for obstructing an association between the Gambiaand Senegal, though they emphasised the need to prevent thedevelopment of Communist influence there. The Senegaleseauthorities would welcome closer association with the Gambia, andthe people of the Gambia, despite their attachment to the Britishconnexion, increasingly took the view that their future must lie insome form of association between the two countries.Constitutional discussions would be held with Gambian minister during the summer, and it was possible that some progress towardsfull internal self-government, perhaps by the appointment of a chief minister, might be made early in 1962. Gambian Ministers, of various parties, themselves thought that any process of association withSenegal should be gradual. But this process might well end incomplete integration with Senegal and separation from theCommonwealth. It would be desirable at some stage, perhaps in thecourse of the constitutional discussions, to let the people of theGambia know that the United Kingdom Government would not rule
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th January, 1961.out the possibility of their seeking an association with Senegal. Thiswas in accordance with the views of the Governor of the Gambia, whowould consult further about the timing and nature of any public statement to this effect.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, while separation from the Commonwealth would be a matterof great regret, the best prospect for the future of the people of theGambia inevitably lay in some form of association with Senegal. Ilwould be desirable so far as possible to maintain some degree of separate identity for the Gambia. It was suggested that it might bepossible to evolve a special status for Bathurst, which might become a free city serving the interests of both countries. Moreover it wouldbe unwise for the United Kingdom Government to appear in any wayto seek to hasten this development. The people of the Gambia were well disposed towards the United Kingdom, and any impression thatwe wished to sever our link with them must be avoided.The Minister of Defence said that it was highly desirable thatwe should not prejudice our staging rights in Bathurst. It wastherefore desirable to try to provide for a continuation of these rightsby means of a defence agreement which would be part of an eventualconstitutional settlement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should notobstruct the gradual development of some association between the Gambia and Senegal if, after constitutionaladvances had been made in the Gambia, that appeared tobe the wish of the Gambian people.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to consider further the timing and nature of any public statement about the future ofthe Gambia.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in considering future constitutional arrangements for the Gambia, to consult the Minister of Defence about provisions for the continuation of staging rights in Bathurst.
