The Cabinet&apos;s discussion then turned to the likely course of future developments in the Congo.The Foreign Secretary said that the most promising development would be a meeting between Mr. Adoula. the P&apos;ime Minister of theCentral Government, and Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of katanga. On paper their views on confederation were already closetogether. If an intermediary could be found who enjoyed theconfidence of them both, it might be possible to advance towardsagreement. The United States were in a position to bring pressure to bear on Mr. Adoula and there was some reason to think that theyhad not yet done enough in this direction.In discussion it was suggested that, while a meeting between mr. Adoula and Mr. Tshombe was obviously desirable, the fact thattheir differences on paper seemed to be small did not necessarilymean that they would be able to reach agreement. Differences ofpersonality entered into the reckoning. It should not, however, be forgotten that in the absence of some agreement and the establishmentof some kind of Constitution for the Congo as a whole it was moreCongo The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nations authorities&quot;Republic       were now pressing their request that we should supply bombs for the(Previous       Indian aircraft operating in the Congo. They had been advised that reference:      the Indian Government had no bombs for these aircraft. We wereCC. (61) 67th   not in a position to disprove this assertion, and there appeared to be/Conclusions.    no other source of supply.  Some of the United Nations troops infrfifute l)      Katanga were now in extreme danger and these included troops from several Commonwealth countries. It was difficult to refuse toprovide what the United Nations authorities regarded as a necessarymeans of safeguarding the lives of these men.  He had reluctantlyreached the conclusion that we ought to agree to supply a limitedquantity of bombs subject to clear assurances in writing that theywould only be used to attack airfields from which aircraft were knownto be operating against United Nations troops and that united nations operations would be limited to protecting their own forces and  to keeping open their lines of communication.   It wasunfortunately only too likely that operations would continue forweeks, if not months, and that bombing would enlarge rather thanreduce their scale. But, even so, he thought that we had no alternative but to supply the bombs on the conditions which he had indicated.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In any statement about the supply of bombs it would be important to adhere closely to the terms of the statement already madeby the Lord Privy Seal that, in the view of the United KingdomGovernment, the United Nations forces in the Congo were fullyentitled to protect themselves when attacked but were not authorised by any United Nations resolution to try to impose a political solutionby force.(b) Since the aircraft which were now attacking United nations forces had been introduced into the Congo by piratical means it wasdefensible that they should be neutralised by bombing. It was,however, vital to avoid any indiscriminate bombing of other targets in Katanga.(c) Any bombs supplied would be transported from this country by aircraft under charter to the United Nations and not in R.A.F.aircraft. The bombs to be supplied would be of a type suitable forattacking airfields and not fragmentation bombs for use againsttroops.Ul) It was important that assurances should be obtained inwriting about the use to which the bombs would be put. especially as it was impossible to establish with certainty who had been responsible for starting the large-scale operations now in progress.
than likely that the whole of the Congo, other than Katanga, would pass under Communist influence. This would be a most unwelcomedevelopment, not only of itself, but in the context of the situation in africa as a whole. The United States Government should, therefore,be encouraged to bring every possible pressure to bear on Mr. Adoulaand on Mr. Tshombe to reach a solution.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to obtain assurances in writingfrom the Secretary-General of the United Nations that anybombs supplied by the United Kingdom for use by theCanberra aircraft in the Congo would only be used toprotect United Nations troops and to keep open their linesof communication.(2) Agreed that, if such assurances were given, a limited numberof bombs suitable for use against airfields should besupplied from the United Kingdom for use by the Indianaircraft operating in the Congo; and authorised theMinister of Defence and the Foreign Secretary to makethe necessary arrangements.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider what further steps could be taken (including greater pressure bythe United States Government) to promote an early meeting between the Prime Minister of the CentralGovernment of the Congo and the Prime Minister of katanga.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th December, 1961.
