Succession toPeerages(previous reference:C.C. (61) 26thConclusions.Minute 1)2. The Home Secretary said that the petition against the validity of Lord Stansgate&apos;s election to represent Bristol, South-East,was to be heard by the Electoral Court on 10th July. On theassumption that the Court upheld the petition, the Governmentwouid, as soon as judgement was given, move the appointment of aJoint Select Committee on the composition and membership of theHouse of Lords with the terms of reference already approved by theCabinet.In discussion it was suggested that the Opposition in the Houseof Commons might be less unwilling to co-operate in the work ofthe Joint Select Committee if the Government were to offer to invitethe Committee to present an interim report on succession to Peeragesand their suspension or termination. Such an interim report mightcover also the special position of Scottish and Irish Peers.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to consider whether theproposed Joint Select Committee on the composition andmembership of the House of Lords might be invited topresent an interim report on succession to, and suspensionor termination of, Peerages.Middle East 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications thatKuwait the Prime Minister of Iraq, General qassim&apos;s, in pursuance of his(Previous       claim that Kuwait was a part of Iraq, might shortly move armouredReference:      forces to Basra, in preparation for an attack on Kuwait.  If suchC.C. (61)31st   an attack were made it would probably be undertaken by a conclusions,    mechanised infantry brigade, with tanks, artillery and air support.Minute 5)       Certain precautionary movements of British forces were already in train, in case it should become necessary for them to intervene in response to a request from the Ruler of Kuwait.   He proposed toinform the United States Government of these developments, witha view to obtaining their prompt support if it became necessary forus to take military action. He would also make it clear to the Ruler of Kuwait that, if we were to be in a position to act with sufficient speed,it was desirable that he should make a formal request for our assistance  forthwith though  this  need  not  be  published  norimplemented until an attack by Iraq materialised.   He would alsoinstruct H.M. Ambassador in Baghdad to inform the Iraqi Govern-ment that we had given the Ruler of Kuwait an assurance that wewould provide him with military support if this were requested: this knowledge might help to deter General qassim&apos;s from launching anattack.Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet were also informed that it would not be possibleto ensure the passage of the Weights and Measures Bill in its present form before the end of the session. &apos; The Bill would be withdrawn and a second Bill, incorporating a considerable number of amend-ments, would be introduced before the summer recess. This shouldfacilitate the passage of the amended Bill in the following session.
South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 34thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Minister of Defence said that, if fighting broke out again in Laos and military intervention under the auspices of the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation became necessary, the CommonwealthBrigade could move rapidly into Thailand. They would however be equipped at a light scale suitable only for operations againstinsurgents; and it would be about 30 days before they could getthe heavier equipment which they would need for more seriousoperations. The United States authorities had already pre-positionedheavy equipment in Thailand for the use of their forces; and it was for consideration whether we should not now do the same for theCommonwealth Brigade. It would be unfortunate if our Brigadebecame involved in heavy fighting, alongside the American forces,with a lighter scale of equipment.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the initial cost of moving this equipment to Thailand might amount to about  525,000,and further charges for maintenance might total  150,000 a month.They were also informed that there was still some possibility that apolitical settlement might be reached in the conference at Geneva.Prince Souvanna Phouma had recently come increasingly under theinfluence of the Communists; but he was now in Paris, and theFrench might be able to bring some pressure to bear on him. Therewould be an opportunity to review the prospects of the conferencewhen the leader of the United Kingdom delegation came to london for consultation in the following week.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was important that, if military action by British forcesbecame necessary, this should receive the clear and public supportof the United States Government. It was therefore desirable to impress on the United States authorities the gravity of the threat andthe serious consequences of a failure to maintain the independence of Kuwait. The United States Government should also be asked touse their good offices to ensure that the Saudi Arabian Governmentcontinued to support the Ruler of Kuwait.(b) It was also important that British support for Kuwait shouldnot have the effect of uniting the other Arab countries in opposingour action. A successful Iraqi attack on Kuwait would be contraryto the interests of the United Arab Republic; and we might succeed in avoiding a hostile reaction from President Nasser if we explained to him in advance that it was our intention to support the Ruler of Kuwait.The Prime Minister said that he would arrange for the DefenceCommittee to meet later in the day to consider detailed plans for providing military support for the Ruler of Kuwait. He would alsoarrange for- a preliminary warning about the situation to be given in confidence to Opposition leaders in the House of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Defence Committee would consider plans for providing military support for the Ruler of Kuwait.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to send appropriateinstructions to H.M. Ambassadors in Washington,Baghdad and Cairo.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a preliminary warning about the situation in Kuwait to begiven in confidence to Opposition leaders in the House ofCommons.
CC. 36 (61)In these circumstances the Cabinet considered that a finaldecision to pre-position this heavy equipment in Thailand should be deferred for a few days. Meanwhile, however, steps could be takento obtain the necessary political approval, from Australia and NewZealand, and from Thailand; and arrangements could also be madeto assemble the equipment and the ships required to carry it.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary and the foreign secretary, respectively, to ascertain whether the Govern-ments of Australia and New Zealand, and of Thailand,were agreeable in principle to the pre-positioning inThailand of heavy equipment for the use of the Common-wealth Brigade.(2) Authorised the Minister of Defence to make preliminaryarrangements for the assembly of this equipment and ofthe ships required to transport it to Thailand.(3) Agreed that a final decision on the question to move this equipment to Thailand should be deferred until a meeting in the following week.South Africa 5.   The Minister of Defence reported to the Cabinet the outcome(Previous       of his recent discussion with the South African Minister of DefenceReference:      on the supply of arms and military equipment. The South AfricanCC. (61) 29th    Minister had withdrawn his request for small arms ammunitionConclusions.    ancj had thus saved us the embarrassment of having to refuse this minute 1)       on the ground that it might be connected in the public mind withSupply of Amis measures to suppress civil disturbances. He had, however, submittedand Military     a substantial list of other requirements, including aircraft.   this equipment      was being examined, with a view to identifying any other politicallysensitive items; but, subject to this, the Minister proposed, inaccordance with the conclusion of the Africa Committee, that thesupply of items required primarily for military purposes shouldcontinue, subject to the usual inter-departmental procedures.   Inreturn, the Simonstown Agreements, which preserved our control ofthe Cape sea routes, would be maintained and the South african government would relinquish the radar sites in the High commission territories to which we were committed under existing defence arrangements. It might, however, be difficult to dissuade them from pressing for the right to send troops through the High commission territories to South-West Africa.In discussion it was generally agreed in the Cabinet that,although some caution must be observed in applying in respect ofthe export of arms a selective policy based on political factors, a distinction could properly be drawn between items required for defence purposes and those which might be used for the suppression of internal disturbances.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the export to South Africa of arms and military equipment which were recognisable as required primarily for military purposes should continue, subject to the usualinter-departmental procedures.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to report to the PrimeMinister on his examination of the list of requirementscurrently submitted by the South African Government.SECRET59440-5 b 3
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (61) 86) about the future of the Southern Cameroons.The Lord Chancellor said that the United Kingdom representa-tives who had taken part in recent discussions in Buea had foundthat there were serious differences between the Prime Minister ofthe Cameroun Republic, Mr. Ahidjo, and the Prime Minister of theSouthern Cameroons, Mr. Foncha, about the relationship betweenthe two territories when the United Kingdom trusteeship came to anend on 1st October. It had not therefore been possible to discussthe establishment of a Southern Cameroon security force to be trainedby the authorities of the Cameroun Republic, and it did not seem likely that Mr. Ahidjo would agree that there should be a separateSouthern Cameroon force. In accordance with the cabinet&apos;s previous conclusions the United Kingdom representatives had announced that the British battalion would be withdrawn on1st October; and, although a formal request for the retention of the battalion had been made, it had subsequently become clear that Mr.Ahidjo would not favour this course. It was likely that, when it was realised that the British battalion was to be withdrawn on that date,officials of the present Administration, including expatriate police officers, would begin to leave and most expatriate employees ofBritish firms would probably do the same. In these circumstances it would not be practicable for us to provide an Aid Mission.As a result of their discussions, the United Kingdom representa-tives had recommended that military action should be taken before 1st October against one camp of 200 terrorists which had been located in an isolated area, that a consular post should be openedat Buea on 1st October, and that the decision to withdraw the British battalion should be announced immediately so that the expatriateofficers and employees who wished to leave might have reasonable time to make their arrangements. These recommendations had since been approved by the Colonial Policy Committee. The Committeehad rejected a further suggestion that the British battalion might bekept in the coastal area for a further year. There were seriousmilitary objections to this proposal which, in any case, would have involved the risk that British forces might become involved indisputes between Mr. Foncha and Mr. Ahidjo. The Committee had also decided that we should offer l\ million aid to the southern Cameroons, to meet their immediate needs on the termination of ourtrusteeship, and that we should proceed with transitional arrange-ments for the ending of Commonwealth preferences in order to assistthe Southern Cameroons over the period during which alternativemarkets for their products could be developed.The Colonial Policy Committee had also considered thepossibility that Mr. Foncha, if he were unable to compose hisdifferences with Mr. Ahidjo, might appeal to the United Nations toextend our trusteeship beyond 1st October. It had been suggestedthat it might be in our interests to encourage Mr. Foncha to make such an appeal, so as to provide a further period in which to workout transitional arrangements to prevent conditions in the territoryfrom developing in a manner favourable for Communist exploitation.It had, however, been pointed out that if this possibility were raised in the United Nations it would arouse criticism and suspicions ofour intentions. In any event there was no certainty that at the endof an extension of our trusteeship the situation in the southern Cameroons would have become less difficult.The Colonial Secretary said that, although it was highly probablethat, with the withdrawal of the British battalion and the departure of expatriate officials and employees, the Administration in theSouthern Cameroons would collapse, thus providing an opportunityfor Communist exploitation, there seemed no alternative but to accept these risks in view of the serious military and financial objections to
Tourism(previous reference:C.C. (61) 26thConclusions.Minute 7)7. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the report(C. (61) 56) of the Committee of Ministers which had consideredmeans of increasing the United Kingdom&apos;s earnings from overseavisitors to this country. They had also before them a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 66) about Exchequerassistance for the building and expansion of hotels; memoranda bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Transport(ffj SECRET 7C.C. 36 (61)continuing our presence in the Southern Cameroons. It would,however, be worth examining a further proposal that had now beenmade, that during the period before their withdrawal the British battalion should train, so far as possible, an additional security forceof some 120 reliable Africans which it was now thought it might bepossible to recruit.The Secretary of State for War said that the British forcecommander was prepared to undertake the military action which hadbeen proposed against a camp of 200 terrorists. In view of thelocal conditions, the chances that this operation would achieve worth-while results were not great. It should only be authorised on theunderstanding that it would not prejudice a firm decision to withdraw the British battalion in any event on 1st October, and provided thata careful explanation of the limited nature of the operation wasgiven to the troops involved.In discussion there was general agreement that the decision towithdraw the British battalion on 1st October should be confirmed.It was also agreed that it would not be in our interests to encourageMr. Foncha to seek an extension of the trusteeship status of theSouthern Cameroons. The proposal that in the meantime the British battalion might train a small locally recruited force of reliableAfricans should, however, be further examined.As regards the proposed operation against the terrorists&apos; camp,it was suggested that it might be inadvisable to risk arousing strongterrorist reactions with which we were not prepared to deal after1st October. It was explained that the operation would be more inthe nature of a police action, and was more likely to result in the dispersal of the terrorists than in their capture. It was also pointedout that we had been asked to deal with this concentration of terroristsby the present Administration; and that, in view of our currentresponsibilities as the trustee Power, the request could not easily be refused. It would be unwise to pursue the operation if this involvedrisking a serious number of British casualties, and it should onlyproceed subject to the conditions mentioned by the Secretary of Statefor War. The operational instructions should be subject to his personal approval and that of the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations made in paragraph 10(a) ofC. (61) 86.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to arrange that the operational instructions for the attack on the terrorists&apos;camp should be subject to his personal approval and thatof the Chief of the Imperial General Staff.(3) Invited the Colonial Secretary to arrange for further examination of the proposal that the British battalion,before 1st October, should train a small locally recruitedforce of reliable Africans.(4) Agreed that the Prime Minister of the Southern Cameroonsshould not be encouraged to seek an extension of the trusteeship status of that territory.
(C. (61) 80 and 81) about the carnet/triptyque system for motorcars; and memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Aviation (C. (61) 82 and 83) about carnets for aircraft.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that the improve-ment and expansion of hotel accommodation could make a largercontribution to the development of our tourist trade than any othersingle factor. In view, however, of the arguments put forward bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer against direct Exchequer assistanceor any form of additional tax concession for hotel projects and inthe light of the current state of the economy, he did not wish topress the recommendations on this subject made by the Committeeon Tourism.The Committee&apos;s other main recommendation concerned thecarnet/triptyque system for motor cars, which they regarded as a significant deterrent to tourists from overseas. We were now theonly country in Western Europe which had not abolished this system,and motoring organisations on the Continent were making itprogressively more difficult for their clients to obtain carnets for thiscountry. There was little or no evidence that the abolition of thesystem had resulted in substantial loss to the revenue in the countrieswhich had discontinued it. The Committee therefore recommendedthat the carnet/triptyque system should be replaced by an alternativewhich would be simpler, cheaper and no less effective in preventing the evasion of import duty and purchase tax. From the Exchequerpoint of view, the only difference would be that the alternativesystem would not provide the guarantee now given by the motoringorganisations against loss to the Revenue consequent on illegal sales of imported cars. But in the previous year the Exchequer hadreceived only  10,000 under these guarantees and this sum would be many times outweighed by the increased earnings of foreign currencyattracted by abolition of the system.Special considerations applied, however, to the import of carsfrom the Irish Republic into Northern Ireland and the special arrangements there, which were a more elaborate form of theordinary carnet system, should be maintained.The Chancellor of the Exchequer questioned whether the costand inconvenience of obtaining a carnet among the other traveldocuments required for bringing a motor car into this countryrepresented any real deterrent. He also feared that the abolition ofcarnets would lead to the organisation of a regular traffic in illicitcars and, in consequence, to a substantial loss to the Revenue.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the cabinet was in favour of abandoning the carnet system, which was less a protection against fraud than a form of insurance for the Exchequer.Any significant loss, which could be readily ascertained from thealternative system proposed, was likely to be outweighed by increasedearnings from tourism. It was, however, agreed that the presentsystem should be maintained in Northern Irebnd.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that aninternational conference was likely to recommend in the near futurethat the present carnet system for private aircraft should be abolished.It would not be difficult to devise an alternative which would be both simpler and cheaper and would apply to all airports in thiscountry. It would secure the interests of the Revenue and, by giving a lead to other countries to simplify their systems of documentation,might enable us to expand our export market for light aircraft.On the other-hand, it was argued that we were already more generousthan most other European countries in our treatment of privateaircraft and that, especially in view of the possible security risks involved, it would be preferable that we should not take the lead inany relaxation. The general view of the Cabinet was that we shouldnot unilaterally abolish the carnet system for orivate aircraft but should be wiHins? to do so if other countries did the same.
GermanyDefenceFacilities inthe UnitedKingdom(previous reference:C.C. (61) 31stConclusions,Minute 6)8. The Home Secretary said that, after further consultationwith the Minister of Defence, he was satisfied that the experimentof allowing a German tank regiment to undertake tank firing trainingin this country could not be carried out unless the Visiting forces act, 1952 and the Application of Law Order had been extended toGermany. In view however of the congestion of the parliamentary time-table he saw no prospect of finding a date on which the Houseof Commons could debate the necessary order before the summer recess.The Minister of Defence said that it would be unfortunate ifthe German Government had now to be informed that these facilities could not after all be provided because of the difficulties of ourParliamentary time-table. Would it not be possible, in co-operationwith the Opposition leaders, to get this order through at a late hourone evening?The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to consider, in consultation withthe Minister of Defence and the Chief Whip, means ofobtaining Parliamentary approval, before the summer recess, for the extension to Germany of the Visiting forces act, 1952 and the Application of Law Order.C.C. 36 (61)The remaining recommendation outstanding in the report of theCommittee on Tourism was that the British Travel and HolidaysAssociation should encourage private enterprise to develop caravanand camping sites. The Minister of Housing and Local Governmentsupported this recommendation but said that he would prefer not to initiate discussions, as had been proposed, with the London CountyCouncil, in whose area suitable land was unlikely to be available,or with the National Parks Commission, who would resist on amenitygrounds any suggestion that camping and caravan sites should be developed in the Parks themselves. There would, however, be advantage in the development of camping sites in areas adjacent tothe National Parks.The Cabinet reached the following conclusions:(1) For the time being, neither direct Exchequer assistance norany additional tax concessions should be provided for theexpansion or building of hotels.(2) Subject to Conclusion (3) below, the carnet/triptyque system for motor cars should be replaced by an alternativesystem on the lines proposed in the report annexed toC. (61) 56.(3) The existing carnet/triptyque system should for the timebeing be maintained in Northern Ireland.(4) The carnet system for private aircraft could be replaced bya simpler system if it were found that other european countries were willing to take similar action.(5) Subject to the reservation of the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, the British Travel and HolidaysAssociation should be invited to encourage the develop-ment of caravan and camping sites.
