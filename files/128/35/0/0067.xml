congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 66thConclusions,Minute 4)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Government would beasked in Parliament to state their view of the circumstances in which Dr.. 0&apos;Brien, the former representative of the United Nations inKatanga, had relinquished his appointment with the United nations and resigned from the Foreign Service of the Irish Republic. Inhis public statements Dr. 0&apos;Brien had sought to lay the whole blame for his removal on the Governments of the United Kingdom andFrance, though there had in fact been widespread disapproval of themanner in which he had discharged his responsibilities in Katanga.The Foreign Secretary said that he did not propose to rebut these statements in detail. He would take the line that the question of dr. 0&apos;Brien&apos;s further employment had been a matter for the united nations authorities and the Government of the Irish Republic; and,for the rest, that the policy of the United Kingdom Government inrespect of the Congo was on record in statements made by ministers in Parliament.It now seemed likely that the United Nations authorities wouldrenew their request that we should supply bombs for the Canberraaircraft which they had obtained from the Indian Government for use by their forces in the Congo. It was understood that they had reasonto believe that the Indian Government would not be willing to supplybombs for these aircraft. In discussion it was suggested that, if wewere seen to be taking a common line on this with the indian government, our action would be less likely to be misrepresented assupport for the irregular forces in Katanga. Our position in theUnited Nations would be strengthened if we and the Indians couldjointly take the line that bombing operations by these Canberraaircraft might have the effect of enlarging the area of conflict in the congo.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the attitude which the foreign secretary proposed to adopt towards questions inParliament about the resignation of Dr. 0&apos;Brien, theUnited Nations representative in Katanga.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in consultationwith the Commonwealth Secretary, whether it would bepossible for the Governments of the United Kingdom andIndia to take a common line towards any further request for the supply of bombs for the Canberra aircraft in use by United Nations forces in the Congo.UnitedNationsColonialism(previous reference :CC. (61) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 203) on the problems of voting in the United nations on resolutions which included propositions running counter to UnitedKingdom policy.The Foreign Secretary said that this difficulty arose largely fromthe efforts of moderate Afro-Asian countries to temper the more extreme resolutions favoured by the Russians and their supporters.As a result we were often left with the choice of voting against sucha resolution, or abstaining, and thereby offending countries whichwished to help us. or of voting for the resolution and therebycompromising our policies and beliefs. This situation arose mostacutely in respect of resolutions bearing on our Colonial policies, butit could also arise in other ways and it was an increasing source of embarrassment. It was difficult to devise any consistent means ofdealing with it.  There seemed to be no better course than to follow
our present practice of judging, on each resolution as it came forward,how best to handle our vote. He would however welcome the views and advice of his colleagues on this question.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat we should continue to judge each such resolution on its merits,with a bias in favour of avoiding the endorsement of propositionsinconsistent with our own Colonial policy. On occasions when therewere other overriding reasons for not voting against resolutionscontaining such propositions, we should be careful to put ourreservations on record in statements made by our representativesbefore the vote was taken. It must however be recognised that this sort of safeguard was less effective in relation to resolutions in theSecurity Council, which could have executive validity.In further discussion it was suggested that the difficulties to whichthis situation gave rise in relation to public opinion in this country might be lessened if steps were taken to secure a clearer publicunderstanding of the balance of forces in the United Nations and the significance of the procedures currently adopted there. It wouldbe useful if informed articles on this question could be published inleading newspapers in this country. A review of the situation might also be included in a White Paper on the year&apos;s proceedings at theUnited Nations. There would be advantage, too, in explaining thedifficulties of this problem in a special message to Prime Ministers ofother Commonwealth countries.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals made in paragraph 11 of C. (61) 203.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider what steps mightbe taken, after Parliament rose for the Christmas recess,to secure a clearer public understanding of the difficulties with which the United Kingdom Government wereconfronted in the United Nations.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary(C. (61) 193) on Chinese representation in the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that the debate on this question inthe United Nations had already started, on a resolution proposing thatthis should be declared to be &quot; an important item &quot;. The cabinet had already decided, on 5th September, that we should support this resolution, which had been engineered by the United StatesGovernment as a means of ensuring that no change in Chineserepresentation could be made without a two-thirds majority.Discussion would then turn to a Soviet resolution (reproduced in the annex to his memorandum) which would have the effect of bringingCommunist China into the United Nations. The United StatesGovernment would oppose this resolution and hoped to prevent it from securing a two-thirds majority. For our part, as we had longrecognised the Peking Government as the Government of China, wecould hardly avoid supporting the substance of this resolution and he proposed that we should vote in favour of it. It was however defectivefrom our point of view in that it made no provision for the futurerepresentation of Formosa in the United Nations. He had therefore been wondering whether we should table a third resolution proposing the appointment of a Committee to consider means by which Formosacould be separately represented if the Peking Government tookChina&apos;s seat in the United Nations. This resolution would fall, if theSoviet resolution were carried; but, in the contrary case, it would atleast provide a constructive alternative to the indefinite continuanceof deadlock of the China seat.In discussion attention was drawn to the offensive language in.which the Russian resolution was framed.  If we were to support it,we should at least dissociate ourselves from the third paragraph which
Tariff Policy(previous reference :C.C. (57) 84thConclusions.Minute 2)ministerial meeting ofthe GeneralAgreementon tariffs and trade. The President of the Board of Trade made a brief report tothe Cabinet on the Ministerial meeting of the General Agreement on tariffs and Trade (GATT) which had been held in Geneva in theprevious week.In the discussion on tariff reductions it had been agreed that theorganisation should concern itself in future with general reductionsrather than detailed negotiations on particular products.On the problems of the under-developed countries it had beenagreed that further outlets for their products were needed in the markets of the more industrialised countries. No specific proposals tothis end were put forward; and the President had made it plain thatthe United Kingdom would be unable to accept any new commitments of this kind until the markets of other countries had been opened aswidely as ours to these products.On agriculture it had been agreed that a study group should beestablished to examine certain French proposals for world-widearrangements for cereals and possibly some other prod-^ts. Therewas a risk that this might be used by the French to delay the progressof the current negotiations between the United Kingdom and theEuropean Economic Community. The President had emphasised thatthese studies under GATT should not be allowed to delay those negotiations.The changing composition of GATT, with its increasing proportion of less developed countries, was altering the character ofits work. Greater emphasis was now being laid on agriculturalproblems and on the need for markets for the products of the less developed countries.The Cabinet Took note of this report by the President of the Board ofTrade.CC. 67 (61)alleged that &quot; representatives of the Chiang Kai-shek clique &quot; were&quot; unlawfully occupying &quot; the place of China in the United Nations.Our representative should point out that this was a criticism, not ofthe Formosa Government, but of the United Nations itself, which had for years allowed the representatives of that Government to occupyChina&apos;s seat at the United Nations. He should, however, go on tosay that we could not contest the claim that the Peking Governmentshould now occupy that seat, and for that reason were prepared tosupport the substance of the Soviet resolution. At the same time we should table a third resolution, on the lines suggested by theForeign Secretary, with the object of drawing attention to the problemof Formosa&apos;s representation and of keeping that issue before theUnited Nations if in the event the Soviet resolution did not command a two-thirds majority.The Cabinet (3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct the United kingdom representative at the Unied Nations (i) to vote in favourof the resolution that any change in Chinese representationwas &quot; an important item &quot;; (ii) to vote in favour of theSoviet resolution, after dissociating himself from its third paragraph; and (iii) to deal with the problem of Formosa&apos;srepresentation, not by making the statement proposed inparagraph 9 of C. (61) 193, but by tabling a third resolutionproposing the appointment of a committee to consider this question, and to bring that resolution forward fordiscussion if the Soviet resolution failed to command a two-thirds majority.
Wages policy  4. The Home Secretary said that the employers&apos; side of theFiremea&apos;s National Joint Council were now prepared to try to reach a settlementWages of the current wage claim of the firemen on the basis of an operative(Previous date of 8th December. If this were accepted, the employers would reference: made a statement emphasising that they regarded the settlement asCC. (61) 66th flowing from commitments entered into before the announcement of conclusions. the Governmenfs policy for a pause in wage increases. the minute 7)      Government could also emphasise this aspect of the settlement and the pressure which had been brought on the employers to securepostponement of the operative date.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he believed that asettlement related to 8th December could perhaps be defended, onits individual merits, in view of the element of pre-pause commitment which was involved.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was agreed that of the three possible dates now in question,1st February, 1st January and 8th December, there seemed to be leastmerit in 1st February. This would be wholly unacceptable to themen. If it were to be regarded as unconnected with commitmentsentered into before the pause, it was too early a date. For settlementsbased on such commitments 1st January was a reasonable date forwhich precedents had already been created by the Wages Councilawards.(h) As between 8th December and 1st January the merit of theearlier date was that it might lead to an agreed settlement. Themen were concerned to get some cash payment before Christmas, andthe employers were not now pressing for any earlier date in viewof the Governmenfs warning about the general grant and the consequent additional cost to them. The date of 1st January was unlikely to be acceptable to the men. If they took their claim to arbitration they might obtain a much earlier date, which would be unwelcome both to the employers and to the Government. It was however by no means certain that the men would go to arbitration;they might prefer to cause trouble, work to rule, and bid for public sympathy and support.(c) It was no longer clear that the threat of withholding grantcould reasonably be used to exert pressure on the employers. Whenthe employers were thinking in terms of an operative date of30th October and the Government in terms of 1st February, this threat had obvious relevance. With the gap now standing at no morethan three weeks the threat to withhold grant could be made to seemarbitrary and unfair.(d) If it were decided to accept a settlement related tooth  December the employers could be informed that such a date was acceptable only because the settlement hinged on commitmentsentered into before the pause, that this would be emphasised in public statements, and that there would be no suggestion from theGovernment that the employers had acted in breach of the government&apos;s known policy.(e) If, on the other hand, it were decided to press the employers to try for a settlement related to 1st January it would be necessaryto take a stronger line. It would have to be pointed out that majorclaims were pending from engineers and railwaymen; that any dateearlier than 1st January would be in breach of the precedents already established that wage increases flowing from commitments acceptedbefore the pause should operate from that date; and that any departure from these precedents would make it much more difficult for the Government to adhere to their wages policy.(/) The employers were trying to help the Government, anddeserved consideration on this account. There were some precedents
CC 67 (61)in other fields where a national pattern of employment existed, e.g.,in teaching, for regarding settlements in one area as creating a moral obligation to award similar increases elsewhere. The gap between13th July and 8th December was not inconsiderable against this background.The Prime Minister said that, before a final decision was taken,the Cabinet should see alternative draft statements which might bemade to the employers&apos; side of the Joint Council relating both tooth  December and to 1st January. The statement on the 1st Januarydate should contain, as a variant, some reference to the general grant.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.commonwealth immigrants(previous reference :CC. (61) 63rdConclusions.Minute 2)5. The Cabinet discussed the tactics for handling the committee stage of the-Commonwealth Immigrants Bill in the House ofCommons. In spite of the efforts made to explain the position tothem, Government supporters were still uneasy about the applicationof this Bill to citizens of the Irish Republic and it was likely that anumber of them would abstain from voting on some of the amendments. This situation should be eased by the Home Secretary&apos;swillingness to shorten the duration of the Bill, so that after31st December, 1963, it would be renewable annually under the expiring Laws procedure, and also by the arrangements which he was proposing to make to secure improved statistics relating to themovement of citizens of the Irish Republic to and from Great Britain.It was however desirable that a full statement of the Governmenfsattitude and intentions on the Irish aspects of the Bill should be madeat the earliest convenient moment in the Committee Stage.After discussion it was agreed that this statement could best bemade in the debate on the question that Clause 1 should stand partof the Bill.The Cabinet-Took note that, at an early point in the Committee stage of the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill, the Home secretary would make a full statement of the Governmenfs attitude and intentions regarding the application of this Bill to citizens of the Irish Republic.Commonwealth 6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Commonwealth Secretary (C. (61) 201) covering a report by an inter-Reference:      departmental committee of officials on Emigration Policy.CC. (61) 19th jj]C (&apos;0,mtu,nweai[h Secretary said that the Commonwealth and conclusions,      r- ... ,   .        ,.nl , ,. , ,.Minute t.) Empire Settlement Acts, ll)22-57, were due to expire on 31st May,Emi ri on 1962. His paper put forward three proposals; that the Acts shouldPolicv&quot;&quot;^ De renewet&apos; fQr a pc1&quot;&apos;0^ Qf f,ve years; the statutory limit cnexpenditure on all emigration schemes should be reduced from 1J million to  750.000 a year; and that our annual contribution tothe Assisted Passage Scheme to Australia should be raised from 150,000 to  300,000 a year. On reflection he had decided towithdraw the second of these proposals. The figure of  750,000 wasno more realistic than that of Cl 1 million: and a reduction, althoughit would have no effect in practice, might be thought to imply that theGovernment were now less interested in emigration to other commonwealth countries.
t a AEducation(previous reference :CC. (61) 57thConclusions.Minute 1)Colleges ofAdvancedTechnology7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Education (C. (61) 191) proposing that colleges of advanced- technology, at present maintained by local educationauthorities, should be transferred to direct grant status with effect from 1st April, 1962.The Minister of Education said that in June, after consultationwith his colleagues and with Lord Robbins, the Chairman of theCommittee on Higher Education, he had announced that he proposedto arrange for these colleges to be transferred to direct grant status,with independent governing bodies. He had since negotiatedarrangements which would enable the transfer to be made in April1962. Transfer would enable better salaries to be paid to the seniorstaff of the colleges and to that extent would increase expenditure;otherwise it would not affect the annual cost of these colleges to public funds. If the transfer were made in April 1962, however, therewould be a net additional charge to the Exchequer in 1962 63 ofabout L&apos;5 million. To defer the transfer for year, as had beensuggested, would secure no real economic advantage. What would be gained would be no more than a short-term advantage to theExchequer at the expense of local authorities and of the colleges andtheir staffs. Postponement would be criticised as an attempt by theGovernment to make the rates bear another year&apos;s share of theexpenditure and would be resented by the local education authorities,who might, as a result, seek to strike a harder bargain. In the end theExchequer might lose a good deal and legislation might be requiredto secure a result which could be obtained now by agreement.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the cost of maintainingthese colleges (now estimated at  81 million for 1962-63) had beenfound to be much higher than had been originally estimated. It wasnot, at this stage, possible to estimate precisely what additional burden would have to be carried by the Exchequer in 1962-63 it might prove to be less than t&apos;5 million if the transfer were made at April 1962;In discussion it was agreed that, while the emigration of skilled labour was likely to become more and more damaging to our economy,this would not of itself justify a departure from the five-year renewalperiod which had now become traditional. It would however benecessary to press the Commonwealth Governments concerned to refrain from attracting skilled labour from sectors of the economywhere we could ill-afford to lose it.It was agreed that there would be no merit and some politicaldisadvantage in reducing the annual limit from  1$ million to 750,000. Considerable doubt, however, was felt about the proposalto increase our contribution to the Assisted Passage Scheme toAustralia by  150,000 a year at a time when painful economies werebeing forced upon us elsewhere. The extra money would be of nohelp to the emigrants; it would merely go to support the Australianbudget. It was not reasonable to consider this proposal in isolation;it should be viewed against the economies in other sectors of public expenditure on which the Cabinet were expecting an early report.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to introduce legislation for the renewal of the Commonwealth and empire Settlement Acts, 1922-57, for a further period offive years.(2) Agreed that no increase should be made for the time being in our contribution to the Assisted Passage Scheme toAustralia, but took note that the commonwealth secretary might wish to raise this question again at some later date.
agricultural policy(previous reference :CC. (60) 65thConclusions.Minute 3)MeatResearchCentre8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president and Minister for Science (C. (61) 198) about means of financing a meat research centre.The Lord President said that the meat research work which was at present being done at Cambridge under the auspices of theAgricultural Research Council ought to be expanded. The premisesat Cambridge would have to be vacated in 1966 and it had been agreedamong the Ministers concerned that a new meat research centreshould be established. It had not, however, been possible to reach agreement on whether the money should be provided by theExchequer alone or in part by a levy on the meat trade. He acceptedthe principle of a levy but was aware of practical difficulties in devisinga scheme and feared that there would be serious delay if an attemptwere made to insist on a levy from the trade. The amount of any possible levy was estimated at  100,000 a year.In discussion it was pointed out that industrial research projectssponsored by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research(D.S.I.R.) were normally financed, at least in part, by contributions from the industries concerned. On historical grounds agricultural research might be held to be in a special position, but there appearedto be no reason why food research, including meat research, shouldbe treated differently from other forms of industrial research. On theother hand, it could be argued that, as the meat trade made no contribution to the costs at present incurred on meat research, itwould be difficult to persuade the trade that it should now make a contribution. The research carried on under the aegis of D.S.I.R.was in the main development research, whereas the meat researchnow proposed would be of a fundamental character. Moreover, thepossible amount of any levy was so small that it would be difficult toapportion and there might, in the result, be more opposition in tradeand scientific circles than adherence to the principle of industrialcontributions would warrant.The general view of the Cabinet was thm in present circumstances the Governments normal principle of securing contributions to research from industry should be applied to meat research. before a decision was announced, however, it would be necessary to be clearthat a practicable scheme could be devised. For this purpose theseveral schemes which had been considered in the past should be examined by the Ministers concerned and a report upon them brought before the Cabinet at an early  date.CC. 67 (61)but the acceptance of any additional burden must, in presentcircumstances, be treated as a serious matter. The Cabinet would shortly be considering the savings in supply expenditure which wouldbe necessary in order to implement the undertaking given by theChancellor of the Exchequer on 25th July to do his utmost to keep theincrease of Government supply expenditure for 1962-63 at a level ofnot more than 2\ per cent, in real terms above that of the estimates for 1961-62. -The addition of several millions to supply expenditurein 1962-63 would make it that much the more difficult to secure these savings; and if the transfer date of 1st April 1962, were approved it might be necessary to seek corresponding savings in other services.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their consideration of C. (61) 191 at alater date, when they could have before them proposals about major savings in Government supply expenditure in1962-63.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, unless it proved impracticable to devise a schemefor the purpose, a contribution to the cost of meat research should be obtained from the meat trade.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, after consultation with theLord President and Minister for Science, the chief secretary, Treasury, the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Scotland, to make an early reportto the Cabinet on possible methods of imposing such alevy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th December, 1961.
