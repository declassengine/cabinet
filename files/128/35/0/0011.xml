Parliament 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Farm Price 3.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterReview 0f Agriculture (C. (61) 33) about the position reached in the current(Previous        farm price review.Reference :C.C. (61) 6th The Minister of Agriculture said that the farmers&apos; representativesConclusions. had countered the offer of an increase of  3 millions in the total levelMinute 4j 0f the price guarantees for the coming financial year with a claim foran increase of  23 millions. The Ministerial Committee on the farm price Review had authorised him to increase the offer to  6^ millions,and the representatives of the farmers had reduced their claim to 10 millions. There would thus be a good chance of an agreed settlement, apart from the fact that the amounts proposed by bothsides did not deal with milk, except in so far as it was commonlyagreed that, under the established formula, the price would be raisedby Id. a gallon for the next year. The farmers&apos; representatives had,in addition, demanded an increase of  d. a gallon in the guaranteed price.The Ministerial Committee had considered the problem of milk production and the unsatisfactory nature of the present pool price arrangements of the milk marketing boards. This system encouragedincreased milk production, which in turn further depressed the poolprice. It was highly desirable for the milk marketing boards tointroduce a different system under which each farmer would be paid the full guaranteed price for a specified share of the milk market and only the manufacturing price for any extra production. In orderto secure this change, the Committee had authorised him to offer theadditional  d. a gallon on milk if the farmers&apos; representatives would first accept a new quota scheme. They realised that a quota schemewas the only solution to the milk problem, but an agreed settlement could not be achieved if the additional offer of Jd. a gallon for milkwere made conditional on their prior acceptance of the new scheme.They pointed out that a resolution advocating such a scheme had recently been defeated by the industry. They were, however, preparedto agree that, if the increase in the price of milk were awarded, itwould be entirely reasonable for the guaranteed price to be reducednext year if the industry had in the meantime failed to implement anew scheme.The Ministerial Committee had now agreed, subject to the cabinets approval, that the additional increase of Jd. a gallon shouldbe offered on the understanding that the farmers&apos; representatives, withthe milk marketing boards, would examine means of devising a newC.C. 11 (61)ThsQueeiPs 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Queen&apos;s tour of India,Visit to India,   Pakistan, Nepal and Iran had been a triumphant success.Pakistan, Nepaland Iran In the course of accompanying the Queen on part of her journey,he had formed the impression that the prospects for maintaining thepresent regime in Nepal were somewhat uncertain. In Iran, however,the Shah was determined to maintain control and follow a policy ofco-operation with the West. It would be in our interests to give the shah our full support, and the Foreign Secretary proposed to consider what additional steps might be taken for this purpose.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of this statement by the foreign secretary.
scheme to meet the Government^ objective, under which it v/ould be clear to individual producers that output beyond a certain level wouldnot be in their interest unless it could be produced profitably at the manufacturing value. The representatives would also have to accept that, if such a scheme were not implemented, they could not claim that it was unreasonable if the guaranteed price for milk were to bereduced in the following year to offset the increase which was nowto be granted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would have preferred that the additional increase in the price of milk had beencontingent on the prior acceptance by the industry of a new quotascheme. Nevertheless, since such a scheme would be of ultimatebenefit to the Exchequer and since it might be of help in our commercial relations with Commonwealth and European agricultural interests, he would agree that the offer should be made on theunderstanding described by the Minister of Agriculture.In discussion it was pointed out that there was likely to be considerable opposition to the introduction of a quota system for milk production. It would protect the small and relatively inefficientproducers, and would not encourage the more efficient farmers toincrease their production. It would also make it more difficult for new farmers to take up milk production. On the other hand, the only alternative solution to the problem of excessive milk production would be to depress prices, which would at first and for a considerable time encourage even higher output, and would encounter bitteropposition from the industry. On balance, it would be best to acceptthe disadvantages of the new scheme, and the addition to the costof living which the proposed increase in the price of milk would entail.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to offer therepresentatives of the farmers an additional increase of  d.a gallon in the price for milk, on the understanding that theywould work for a new quota system for milk production.Malta(previous reference :CC. (61) 10thConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (61) 30) and the Attorney-General (C. (61) 31) on constitutional changes in Malta.The Colonial Secretary said that the doubts that had previously been expressed about the effect in international law of granting tothe Maltese Government concurrent legislative powers and delegatedauthority to conclude certain international agreements had been examined by the Attorney-General, who was satisfied that the implementation of these proposals would not confer on Malta thestatus of an independent sovereign State. The revised terms of thestatement in which it was proposed to announce the governments acceptance of the constitutional recommendations of the BloodCommission were set out in the Annex to C. (61) 30. This statementdid not now contain any reference to subsequent constitutional developments, but he would undoubtedly be pressed for some indication of the Governments attitude on this point. He would first reply: &quot; As I said when the Blood Commission was appointed,we are now concerned with the immediate future. I did not thenand do not now suggest that the constitution I have just announcedwill be the final stage in MaltaS constitutional development.&quot; If it proved necessary to give some further indication about the ultimatefuture of Malta, he would then say: &quot; It is of course no part of HerMajestyS Governments policy to deny to the Maltese people theright to determine for themselves, at the appropriate time, their owndestiny in association, we hope, with the United Kingdom and theCommonwealth family.&quot;
5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 25) about a national theatre.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at their meetingon 28th February, he had put before the Cabinet three alternative methods by which the Government might fulfil the pledge given atthe time of the last General Election that they would &quot; do more tosupport the living theatre &quot;. The first was to decline to finance the plans recently put before him by the Joint Council for the national theatre, which broadly represented the original concept embodied inthe National Theatre Act, 1949, and to concentrate whateveradditional resources could be made available on assistance to theIn discussion the following points were made:(a) Although it seemed clear that the implementation of the blood Commission^ recommendations would not entitle othercountries to regard Malta as an independent sovereign State, it couldbe argued that there would be difficulty in withdrawing responsible government once it had been granted. There seemed, however, no legal foundation for this view, and in the past it had proved possibleto withdraw representative government when it had been necessaryto resume direct rule by the Governor, without challenge.(b) There was general agreement that, on balance, it would be preferable to restrict the grant to the Maltese Government ofconcurrent powers to defence, and to provide powers in the field of external affairs only by specific delegation. The draft announcementof the proposals had been revised on this basis, but the position wouldbe made quite clear if the relevant sentence were on the following lines: &quot; The Maltese Government will be given concurrent powers inthe field of foreign affairs, by specific delegation, and in that ofdefence.&quot;(c\ The proposed introduction of a United KingdomCommissioner, who would be able to overrule the maltese government, although the power to enforce his ordinances would be reserved to the Governor who would retain control of the police,might be a dangerous innovation. On the other hand, thisarrangement might well work satisfactorily unless the maltese government were deliberately obstructive, in which case it would almost certainly be necessary for the Governor to resume direct rule.(d) In view of the strategic importance of the island, it was not likely that Malta could be given the right of self-determination in the foreseeable future. It was therefore desirable that any furtherindication which might have to be given about the future shouldnot refer to the right of the Maltese people to determine for themselvestheir own destiny. On the other hand, it would be valuable to holdout the prospect of some continuing association with the UnitedKingdom and the Commonwealth. The reply which the colonial secretary might make, if pressed to say something in addition to his first response about the future, should be on the following lines:&quot; I hope that Malta&apos;s future will always lie with the United Kingdomand the Commonwealth.&quot;The Cabinet approved a number of drafting amendments to thestatement and supplementary reply which the Colonial secretary proposed to make to Parliament.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce proposals for constitutional changes in Malta, as proposed in C. (61) 30,subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion.
provincial theatres. Alternatively, the Government might accept theJoint Councils plans in principle but subject to further detailedscrutiny and to scaling down of the estimates of cost. There wouldbe considerable pressure in favour of these plans but there was reasonto think that the facade of agreement presented by the various interests on the Joint Council was illusory, and that their proposal for forming a company by integrating the Old Vic and Shakespeare MemorialTheatre companies might involve the Exchequer in heavy and continuing deficits. The third course, which he would favour, wasto increase the present subventions to the Old Vic and the ShakespeareMemorial Theatre to levels which would enable the Old Vic inparticular to attract leading actors and actresses and to send companies of the highest quality on tour in the provinces.Discussion showed it to be the general opinion of the Cabinetthat the emphasis should be on assisting the drama in the provincesin preference to proceeding with the project of a new national theatrein London. Most benefit would be derived from enabling the Old Vicand the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre, which could themselves beregarded as national institutions, to improve the quality of theircompanies and to undertake provincial tours. The question whetherthe two companies should ultimately be integrated, which would in turn lead to renewed demands for the building of a national theatre,could await decision in the light of developments. Provided that asmuch direct assistance as possible were given to theatres in theprovinces and that the subventions to the Old Vic and the ShakespeareMemorial Theatre were increased to levels perhaps rather higher thanthose contemplated in C. (61) 25, the policy could be presented as themost realistic way of meeting the contemporary needs of the drama.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the third method of Exchequerassistance to the theatre put forward in C. (61) 25.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to theamount of the various items of Exchequer expenditurecontemplated in C. (61) 25Northern 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeIreland Secretary (C. (61) 28) on unemployment in Northern Ireland.Unemployment(Previous The Home Secretary said that the Northern Ireland government reference: were perturbed and disheartened by the problem of unemployment,C.C. (60) 64th which was now over 8 per cent, and would probably before long be conclusions. aggravated by a reduction of some thousands in the labour force of minute 7) Messrs. Harlarid and Wolff. They had asked the United KingdomGovernment to agree that the problem was a joint responsibility ofthe two Governments, and they had put forward a large number of detailed proposals, nearly all of which had been found on examination by the Departments concerned to be either impracticable orunacceptable. The Home Secretary proposed to explain this to theNorthern Ireland Prime Minister, and to emphasise that the problem was primarily one for the Northern Ireland Government themselves.He hoped, however, that it might be possible to give them somerelatively small help, by an increase in Government orders fromMessrs. Harland and Wolff and Messrs. Short Bros, and Harland,by agreeing that Northern Ireland should renew their powers to assistnew industry, the cost falling ultimately to the United kingdom excequer; by considering the possibility of subsidising the cross-Channel sea transport services, which were the subject of a currentenquiry by the Minister of Transport; and by increasing the subsidy on industrial coal from the present level of million to  1 million or perhaps  U millions a year.
Tanganyika(previous reference:CC. (59) 60thConclusions,Minute 8)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (61) 32) about the independence of Tanganyika.The Colonial Secretary said that it had hitherto been the aim ofour policy to establish an East African Federation, which mightprecede the achievement of independence by the individual constituentterritories. Mr. Nyerere, the Chief Minister of Tanganyika, had now,however, proposed that Tanganyika should go forward separately to independence and that, until such time as federation could be achieved,Tanganyika&apos;s links with the East Africa High Commission shouldbe preserved. Unless we were able to proceed in full agreement withMr. Nyerere it would be difficult to deter the United Nations fromprematurely terminating the Trusteeship Agreement; and it would therefore be necessary to accept a date for Tanganyika&apos;s independencenot later than March 1962, and possibly as early as December 1961.Meanwhile, he was considering whether it would be practicable toestablish, in place of the East Africa High Commission, a new jointorganisation by agreement between Kenya and Uganda (acting withthe authority of the United Kingdom Government) and an independentTanganyika. This would be preferable to keeping the high commission in being for Kenya and Uganda alone, with Tanganyikausing its services on an agency basis the Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (61) 32.CC. 11 (61)In discussion it was suggested that, with the relatively high costof raw materials and transport consequent on its geographical position,Northern Ireland could not hope to make its economy competitive solong as wages were maintained at the same levels as in the rest of theUnited Kingdom. Differential wage rates had been introduced as a means of attracting industry to Scotland and Wales and this offered the best hope of progress for Northern Ireland. Other possibilitieswere to develop an indigenous source of power by building a nuclear power station in Northern Ireland, and to attract there industries which had a high labour content but a relatively low demand for rawmaterials and transport.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) Messrs. Harland and Wolff were in no worse a position than other shipbuilding firms in the United Kingdom. The contract forthe new Cunard liner must be awarded to the firm submitting themost satisfactory tender.(b) The construction of unessential aircraft was an expensivemethod of relieving unemployment. It was unlikely that further substantial orders could be given to Messrs. Short Bros, and Harland,but this would be further considered.(c) It was doubtful whether a case could be made for subsidisingthe cross-Channel services to Northern Ireland.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary (i) to consult the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned on the four proposals he had put forward for helping to relieve unemployment inNorthern Ireland;(ii) to take account of the points made in their discussion in his meeting with the Northern Ireland Prime- - Minister.
CommonwealthOrganisationsin the UnitedKingdomDiplomaticImmunitiesand Privileges(previous reference:C.C. (60) 30thConclusions.Minute 4)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (61) 27) on the grant of diplomaticimmunities and privileges to Commonwealth organisationsestablishing in the United Kingdom.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the members and officials of international organisations established in this country were, underthe International Organisations (Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950,entitled to certain immunities and privileges subject to two conditions that the organisation must contain at least one foreign country,and that the immunities and privileges must be derived from a formalinternational agreement. Purely Commonwealth organisations, suchas the Commonwealth Economic Committee and the CommonwealthEducation Liaison Unit, were ruled out by both these conditions.There was some pressure for granting exemption from UnitedKingdom income tax to the Chairman and Director respectively ofthese two organisations, and the Commonwealth Secretary proposedthat the Government should introduce legislation to extend to these and similar organisations the immunities and privileges provided bythe Act of 1950.In discussion of this proposal considerable misgivings were expressed. In the first place, the bodies to which the Act of 1950applied were organisations of which foreign Governments were themselves members and which had juristic personalities of theirown. The Commonwealth organisations to which it was nowproposed to extend the advantages provided by the Act appeared tobe much less formally constituted, and this new departure would haveimplications which must be carefully considered. Moreover, theprinciple on which diplomatic immunities and privileges had hitherto been conferred was that, without them, the persons concerned wouldbe inhibited in the full performance of their functions. In the caseof the members and officers of the organisations now proposed to beincluded, there seemed no question of any such inhibition and theproposals were aimed primarily at giving them enhanced status andfinancial benefit at the expense of the Exchequer.The Prime Minister said that the implications of theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposal required further examination,which should be undertaken initially by officials of the Departmentsconcerned.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for acommittee of officials to examine further, in the light of their discussion, the proposals in C. (61) 27 for legislation to conferdiplomatic immunities and privileges on commonwealth organisaitons in the United Kingdom.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,7th March, 1961.
