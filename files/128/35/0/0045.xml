Tunisia 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the French were adopting(Previous an intransigent attitude over Bizerta. They were unwilling to reference: &quot; withdraw their troops to their earlier position, and were showing noC.C. (61) 41st readiness to enter into negotiations with the Tunisians. Meanwhile,a hostile Afro-Asian resolution was being brought forward in theUnited Nations. The United Kingdom representative was beinginstructed to abstain from voting on this, and it was hoped that theUnited States representative would take the same course.Conclusions,Minute 1)Economic 2.   The Prime Minister said that, at the end of the debate on situations the economic situation which had been held in the House of(Previous Commons on the two orevious days, the Government motion had reference: been carried by &quot;a majority of 110.  This was a highly satisfactoryC.C.

The Governmenfs proposals had been endorsed by a two-to-one majority in a poll of 76-8 per cent. 41,949 votes beingcast in favour of the proposals and only 21.846 against.The Prime Minister said that this was an encouraging vindicationof the multi-racial policy which the United Kingdom had advocatedin respect of Africa generally. He took the opportunity of expressinghis appreciation of the untiring efforts made by the commonwealth secretary and the Colonial Secretary in support of that policy.germany berlin(previous reference :CC. (61) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)*4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (61) 116) on the problem of Berlin and two memoranda by the Minister of Defence (C. (61) 115 and 118)describing possible measures to increase the state of militarypreparedness for an emergency over Berlin.The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Khrushchev seemed to bedetermined to conclude a separate peace treaty with the DeutscheDemokratische Republik (D.D.R.) and would probably use theoccasion of the Communist Party Congress on 17th October to announce that the signature of such a treaty was imminent. his main purpose would be to improve the status of the Government ofthe D.D.R., whose economic difficulties, accentuated by the continuingflow of refugees to the West, made it one of the least reliable membersof the Soviet bloc. There were, however, some indications thatMr. Khrushchev might prefer to enter into negotiations with theWestern Allies before concluding a separate treaty with the D.D.R.in the hope that he might thereby enhance the stability of the regime in East Germany and weaken the Western position in Berlin. Therewould be obvious advantage in holding such negotiations at some stage: world opinion would be strongly against the Western Alliesif they appeared to be preparing for hostilities without firstexhausting the possibilities of a settlement by negotiation. This viewnow seemed to be shared by the Governments of the United Statesand of Western Germany. It would, however, be virtually impossibleto enter into substantive negotiations before the German elections on17th September, since the Federal German Government could not before that date allow the impression to be created that they might* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
2S\.be willing to make concessions to the Soviet bloc. The americans were at present inclined towards a policy of allowing Mr. Khrushchevto conclude a separate treaty, in the expectation that this wouldprovide an issue which could be referred to the United Nations andlead to a resolution adverse to the Soviet Union being passed by theGeneral Assembly. It was, however, doubtful whether the signature of a peace treaty would be immediately followed by any provocativeaction by the D.D.R. or whether, even so, a majority could be obtained for an anti-Soviet resolution. On balance it would be preferable to aim at direct negotiations between the Western Allies and the soviet union at some date between 17th September and 17th October.In the course of such negotiations we should be pressed to concedede facto recognition to the D.D.R. as the sovereign authority in east germany, to recognise the present eastern frontiers of Germany, andto give guarantees that missiles and nuclear weapons would not bebrought into Berlin or deployed within a certain distance^of thedemarcation line between East and West Germany. In return we might be able to obtain agreement to the continued stationing of allied forces in Berlin and to rights of access guaranteed by the soviet union. He was to meet the Foreign Ministers of the United States,France and Germany in Paris in the following week and would seek to reach agreement with them on tactics for opening negotiationswith the Soviet Union on the most advantageous basis.As regards military preparations, there had been a significant change in American policy during the last few months. The UnitedStates authorities were now inclined to place more emphasis on theuse of economic measures followed, if necessary, by an airlift,, in response to any obstruction of access to Berlin, and much less onpreparations for land operations. The military measures which theyhad recently announced were directed towards increasing the strengthof the North Atlantic Alliance as a whole in order to provide greater flexibility and a choice of reactions to Soviet provocation.The Minister of Defence said that the United States had increased its defence budget by some  2,000 millions since January. They didnot intend to send major reinforcements to Germany, but proposedto bring their forces there up to the approved (M.C. 70) strengths.They had expressed the view that the United Kingdom should, inconformity with these measures, bring the British Army of the Rhine(B.A.O.R.) up to M.C. 70 strengths, involving an increase of morethan 5,000 men, and to arrange for two brigade groups of the strategic reserve in the United Kingdom to be held available for rapid transfer to Germany.In discussion the following points were made:(a) Neither the Western Allies nor the Soviet Union wouldlightly risk nuclear war on the Berlin issue. There was thus an element of bluff in the position of both sides. In the last resort theWestern Allies should be prepared to resist any proposal for a Berlinsolution which appeared to be simply a move towards Communistdomination of the world, but should be prepared to discuss proposals to end the present crisis on an equitable basis. Mr. Khrushchev&apos;sproposals might appear reasonable to a large body of world opinion,as being directed to establishing the same type of relationship withthe D.D.R. as the West had established with Federal Germany.Although the case for an Allied military presence in West Berlinwas legally sound, the right of access in order to sustain the economy of West Berlin at a high level was not so clearly established. TheWestern Allies would be unlikely to be supported by world opinionif they had made no effort to reach a settlement by negotiation.(b) There might be positive advantages in according de factorecognition to the D.D.R., especially if this led to an increase in itscontacts with the West (including Western Germany) which might serve to undermine the Communist hold on the country.(c) It might be advisable to aim at an interim agreement, perhapsof five years&apos; duration, in which we should undertake to introduce
CC. 45 (61)in West Berlin a regime which would prepare the way for establishingBerlin as a free city, provided that the Soviet Union in turn gaveadequate guarantees of our rights of access. The East GermanGovernment already controlled civil surface traffic to and from berlin, with the tacit agreement of the Federal German Government,and the extension of their authority to other forms of traffic involvedno new point of principle.(d) In the course of negotiations the Soviet Government were likely to insist that the Allies should no longer.assist the movementof refugees from East to West Germany^-It &quot;might be necessary forus to agree that Allied military aircraft-&apos;snould no longer be used for transferring refugees from Berlim-to the Federal German Republic.On the other hand, it was likely that the flow of refugees would diminish if a settlement were reached. We might take the line thatit was within the power of the D.D.R. to control this movement.(e) Our most important immediate aim should be to ensure thatno action was taken by our Allies or ourselves to precipitate action by Mr. Khrushchev before 17th September. We should therefore seek to dissuade the United States &quot;Government from assuming aninflexible negotiating position or taking any military action whichmight&apos; e provocative, &quot;though we should join with them in measuresto incr^ se the military preparedness of the North Atlantic Alliance.At the s\ ie time, the Western Allies should seek by diplomatic actionin Moscow to ensure that the way was kept open for negotiations.In discussion of measures to improve military and home defencepreparedness, the following further points were made:(/) To place B.A.O.R. in a state of full preparedness for war would involve the recall of reservists by proclamation and theembodiment of the Territorial Army. These measures would,however, be useful only for a short-term emergency. At present our military preparations should be limited to a demonstration of our readiness to co-operate with the Americans in strengthening themilitary effectiveness of the North Atlantic Alliance as a whole andshould be limited to the following:(i) Preparations for the despatch 10 Germany of a surface-to-airguided weapons (S.A.G.W.) regiment and possibly ofsome individual reinforcements up to 1,000 in number.The timing of these moves would be determined after theForeign Secretary&apos;s discussions in Paris during thefollowing week.(ii) An urgent examination of the possibility of withdrawing tothe United Kingdom a small number of units fromoversea theatres, e.g., Kenya, the Middle East and HongKong, in order to build up the strategic reserve in theUnited Kingdom..(iii) Measures by the Commander-in-Chief, B.A.O.R. (involvinglittle or no expenditure) to improve the state of readiness of his forces.(iv) An assurance to our Allies that the three Royal Air Force squadrons which were due to leave Germany at the endof 1961 would not be withdrawn while the possibilityremained that they might be required for use in connexionwith the Berlin crisis.(g) If there were a prolonged state of tension over Berlin, and ifwe had also to sustain our present military strength in other theatres,it would be necessary to contemplate the ^introduction of some form of National Service. It no longer seemed likely that such ameasure would be required to maintain the Army at a total of165,000.    -(h) Home defence preparations were not far advanced, since they had necessarily been given a low priority in conformity with
our policy of reliance on the strategic deterrent. A review was inhand of the short-term measures which might be taken to increasethe state of home defence preparedness for an early emergency.The Cabinet (1) Approved the general approach to the problem of Berlinoutlined in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum c. (61) 116.(2) Agreed that it would not be desirable at this stage to call.       up reservists or to contemplate an extension of National&apos; Service.(3) Approved in principle the despatch of an S.A.G.W. regimentto Germany and agreed that the timing of this moveshould be decided later, in the light of the foreign secretary&apos;s forthcoming discussions in Paris.(4) Agreed that no action should be taken at present to withdraw the three Royal Air Force fighter squadrons from Germanyand that our Allies might be informed accordingly.\ (51) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit to the DefenceCommittee his proposals for strengthening the strategic reserve in the United Kingdom by withdrawing units fromother theatres overseas.(6) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to report to theDefence Committee on the measures required to improve the state of home defence preparedness.CivilAviation(previous reference :C.C. (61) 44thConclusions,Minute 4)Middle EastAir Lines5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (C. (61) 120) submitting the recommendations of theEconomic Policy Committee for the disposal of the interests of theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation (B.O.A.C.) in Middle EastAirlines (M.E.A.) and the Middle East Aircraft Servicing Company(M.A.S.C.O.).The Minister of Aviation said that, since both M.E.A. andM.A.S.C.O. were continuing to lose money and made frequentdemands for additional capital, B.O.A.C. were seeking authority tosell their minority interests in both companies, in which their totalfinancial commitment was  15-3 millions. The Lebanese interestsin M.E.A. were now prepared to buy the B.O.A.C. share in bothcompanies. Their offer was a very poor one: at best B.O.A.C. would lose  5-6 millions, and at worst they might lose  15-1 millions, sinceonly  200,000 would be paid in cash and the remainder secured bylocal guarantees or by mortgages on equipment and property. even so, there was no prospect of obtaining a better settlement and therewould certainly be additional heavy losses if B.O.A.C. retained their financial interests in the two companies. The Economic PolicyCommittee had therefore accepted his recommendation that B.O.A.C.should be authorised to accept the offer.If a settlement on these lines were reached, it would become,known during the recess and was likely to attract public criticism. he proposed to arrange for an independent enquiry to be made into thehistory of B.O.A.C.&apos;s connexions with these companies; but he didnot propose to make this known at present or to publish its report.;It might, however, help to meet any public criticism if the fact that -such an enquiry had been held could be made known in due course.The Cabinet :Approved the proposals in C. (61) 120.      .   .
