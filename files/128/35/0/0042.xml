ContentsEuropeCommonwealth Consultation
EuropeCommonwealthConsultation(previous reference:C.C. (61) 35thConclusions,Minute 4)The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the commonwealth secretary, the Colonial Secretary, the Minister of Aviation, theMinister of Labour and the Lord Privy Seal (C. (61) 111, 103, 104, 96and 108), reporting the results of consultations with Governments ofthe other independent members of the Commonwealth and withColonial territories about relations between the United Kingdom andthe European Economic Community (E.E.C.).The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the three countries hehad visited Australia, New Zealand and Canada there were seriousanxieties about the possible consequences of the United Kingdom&apos;sjoining the E.E.C. They were concerned about the changes whichthis would involve in their trading relationships with the UnitedKingdom; but they were even more concerned about its political implications. They feared that an economic union between theUnited Kingdom and the other countries of Western Europe would lead in one way or another to a political union which must weaken the Commonwealth relationship. Canada also feared that this would draw her increasingly into the economic and political orbit of theUnited States. He had tried to reassure all three Governments thatthese fears were unjustified and had pointed out that, if a widerpolitical association became necessary, the United Kingdom wouldbe more likely to favour the larger concept of an Atlantic union than any purely Continental system. On the economic side, the positionof New Zealand was the most precarious and for her at least it wouldbe vital to secure special concessions from the Community. despite their fears, the other Commonwealth Governments had recognisedthat the decision to enter into negotiations with the Community wassolely for the United Kingdom Government, for whom it was muchmore important than for themselves. Thev now expected us to open negotiations, without further consultation, and would be surorisedif we did not do so.There was no disguising the fact that if we did join theCommunity this would be an initial shock to the wholeCommonwealth system. But he believed that the damage wouldnot be irreparable and that the Commonwealth could in the long runbecome stronger from our increased ability to provide capital lordevelopment and to buy more Commonwealth products. If. on theother hand, wc did not join the Community, the decline in our economic and political strength would eventually lead to a permanentweakening of the whole Commonwealth.The Mi/liner of Aviation said that the conclusion he had drawn from his visits to Commonwealth countries in Asia was s nnl.u tothose of thc-Commonwealth Secretary: that, so far as the asian countries were concerned, their recognition that the final decision was for the United Kingdom left us tree to enter into negotiationswith the Community and that they expected us to do so. In Asia,too. there were both economic and political mxicties about theprospect of United Kingdom membership ol&apos; the Community; but since the onl\ exports winch v ere causing concei a were lea. cotton tox-tiles. jute mar facUires and coco.mat products, all of which v. j amththope to be able to safeguard, it ought to be possible to satisfaction-f\ them.In India there had been special emphasis on the political aspects butalso some fear lest the emergence of a powerful economic and politicalunion in Hurope might retard the industrial advance of the under-developed countries. It had been suggested thai whateverspecial arrangements were made should not be such as would divide the Commonwealth into those countries which could, and those whichcould not. accept Associated Oversea Territory (A.O.T.) status out should rather be based on particular commodities. This was, ofcourse, a mailer lor negotiation. All the countries he had visitedrecognised thai  a final judgment of die economic and politic.&apos;l
consequences of our joining the Community could not be made untilnegotiations had taken place. But it was important that we shouldnot only consult the other Commonwealth Governments at every stage but give every appearance of doing so.The Minister of Labour said that in Ghana, Nigeria and sierra leone there was criticism of the allegedly neo-colonial character ofthe E.E.C. and suspicion of the A.O.T. relationship in its present form.This sprang from antagonism to the former colonial policies of theFrench and to the controlling influence which France was thought tobe able to exercise over her former African dependencies throughthe close financial and commercial ties which persisted. The A.O.T.relationship was, however, due to be reviewed in the following yearand was likely to become more liberal. In any event, it offereddecided economic advantages and would for that reason be welcome to the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, where the politicalobjection to it was not felt. In the African countries, as else wherein the Commonwealth, there was the same understanding of ourposition and the same desire for close consultation at all stages.The Minister of Agriculture said that he had had discussions with the President of the National Farmers&apos; Union (N.F.U.) and withother representatives of farmers in the United Kingdom. The N.F.U.were taking the extreme line that the interests of United Kingdomfarmers could be safeguarded only by continuation of the existing system of support, although it was becoming increasingly recognised in Parliament and elsewhere that the Government could not maintainit indefinitely whether or not the United Kingdom joined the E.E.C.Considerable opposition to our applying for membership must therefore be expected from the N.F.U., who would no doubt winmuch support from the farmers.The Prime Minister said that some public statement must bemade before the summer recess.   The effective choice lay between(i) a statement that the Government were now prepared to apply for membership in order to set in motion negotiations which would show whether we could secure satisfactory safeguards for theCommonwealth for our partners in the European Free trade association (E.F.T.A.), and for United Kingdom agriculture; or(ii) a statement that the Government were considering the important issues raised by their consultations with other commonwealth governments and that a decision would not be announced until afterthe recess.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that the right course was to enter into negotiations with theE.E.C. and to announce at once that we intended to do so. This was now expected by the rest of the Commonwealth, by our partners inE.F.T.A.. and by the member Governments of the Community itself and there was. indeed, no other way of finding out whether theinterests of the Commonwealth and the Community could be reconciled. If they could not be reconciled, the Government wouldbe in a stronger position, both generally and in relation to theCommonwealth, if this were clearly demonstrated as a result of genuine negotiations which they were obliged to break off than if theywere to announce that informal soundings had led them to theconclusion that negotiations could not succeed.Delay in announcing the intention to negotiate might mean thatthe opportunity might not recur, and the case for a statement beforethe recess was strengthened both by considerations of domesticpolitics and by the likelihood that adverse pressures would otherwisebuild up at the meeting of Commonwealth Finance Ministers inSeptember.The Cabinet went on to discuss the best way of presenting adecision to enter into negotiations. From the practical point of viewrt should be presented as a necessary step in order to discover whether
Cabinet Office. S.W. i.$1st July. 1961CC. 42 (61)or not we could obtain satisfactory terras. The statement should therefore be as specific as possible on the interests we should seek to safeguard and should make it clear that no commitment would be entered into until the other Commonwealth Governments and the parliament at Westminster had had opportunities to discuss the resultsof the negotiations. But it was equally important to create the rightimpression in Europe: we must embark on the negotiations in good faith, with the intention of making them succeed. If the decision were represented as a purposive one and not as an unwilling surrender to circumstances, it might be expected to bring powerful forces inEurope into play in our favour. At the same time, the wider politicaland even moral aspects of the problem should not be neglected. Theprospect of our membership of the Community might be held out as astep towards the larger concept of a union of the Free World. Frominside the Community, indeed, we might hope to transform it into an outward-looking group of nations, mindful of its responsibilities to theworld as a whole.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that it wasevidently the view of the Cabinet that we should enter into negotiations with the E.E.C. in order to find out on what terms theywould agree to our joining the Community. A decision to negotiatewas a very different matter from the later and much more criticaldecision to join the Community but, since a formal application to accede to the Treaty of Rome was a prerequisite of any negotiations on terms, the distinction might not be easy to make apparent to publicopinion in this country and in the Commonwealth. A decision tonegotiate might be more acceptable to our own public opinion if the emphasis were not all placed on the practical economic advantages of joining the Community (and the inevitable disadvantages of not doing so) but if some appeal were also made to the idealistic elements in British thinking. In announcing the decision it would be necessaryto achieve a delicate balance between, on the one hand, creating theimpression in the United Kingdom, the Commonwealth and E.F.T.A.that we had already decided to join the Community on whatever termswe could obtain and, on the other hand, suggesting to the membersof the Community that we had no real will to join them. With this in mind he would draft his statement and a motion for the purposesof a debate before the summer recess and would circulate them to theCabinet as soon as possible.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting in thefollowing week.
