ParliamentSuccession toPeerages(previous reference:CC. (61) 36th,Conclusions,Minute 2)CC. 40 (61)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that, in connexion with the debatewhich was to take place on 21st July on the appointment of a joint select Committee on the composition and membership of the Houseof Lords, he had come to the conclusion that, on balance, it wouldbe preferable not to offer to invite the Committee to present an interimreport on succession to Peerages.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.Middle East 2.   The Minister of Defence said that the military situation in kuwait Kuwait was now such that the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East,(Previous could reduce his forces there without impairing his ability to protectReference: the country from attack. There was still a possibility of some furtherCC (61) 39th action by the Iraqi Government on the occasion of their national dayConclusions, on 14th July, and the planned reduction of our forces would notMinute 2)       therefore begin until the following week.   H.M.S. Bulwark with theRoyal Marine commando would then move to Singapore, and certain other units would be withdrawn to Bahrain.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Defence.Post OfficeTariffs(previous reference:CC. (60) 14thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C. (61) 93) proposing increases in certain PostOffice tariffs.The Postmaster-General said that in each of the three lastfinancial years the Post Office had earned at least 8 per cent, on capital invested. Now, however, in view of increased wages and shorterhours, and the need for further capital investment, it was estimatedthat the return on capital would be reduced to 5 or 6 per cent, in thecurrent and following year. To meet the need for further investment in the growing Post Office services, especially telephones, and to fulfil the obligations which had been prescribed in the White paper on the &quot; Financial and Economic Obligations of the nationalised industries&quot; (Cmnd. 1337), it was desirable to raise tariffs so as to restore the return on capital to about 8 per cent, next year. For thispurpose he proposed increases in charges, including an increase inthe annual rentals and connexion charges for telephones and anincrease of 6d. in the charges for all parcels. These changes would yield  25 millions in a full year. They would be unpopular, but theywould make most of the Post Office services economic and further increases were unlikely to be necessary within the next two years.He sought the agreement of the Cabinet that the tariff increases shouldbe announced on 18th July.In discussion certain doubts were expressed about the content and timing of these proposals. It was likely that the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer would make a statement to Parliament later that month about the economic situation, and this would probably include a reference to the need for restraint in prices and wages. price increases introduced by the Government would be difficult to reconcile with such an appeal for restraint. They would also, becauseof their effect on costs, be quoted as an argument for not responding to any such appeal. Nor would it be easy to defend a substantial increase in capital expenditure on the telephone service at a time
Trade Union 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterElections        0f Labour (C. (61) 95) about trade union elections.The Minister of Labour said that the recent judgment of theHigh Court in an action against officials of the Electrical TradesUnion (E.T.U.) had shown that the courts could deal effectively withabuses in the conduct of union elections and could provideappropriate remedies. However, the length and cost of courtproceedings would undoubtedly be an obstacle to similar actions inthe future, and it was likely that, failing some means of reform,malpractices could continue, there would be strong public and parliamentary feeling that the Government should take some initiative in the matter. He therefore proposed to invite the Trades UnionCongress (T.U.C.) to try to persuade all unions to adopt model rules,and to agree that their elections should be conducted under the supervision of some independent body. It was, however, doubtfulwhether the T.U.C. would make very strenuous efforts to this end and,even if they did, whether they could be wholly successful. he considered that, failing effective action by the T.U.C., the Governmentshould be prepared to introduce legislation to give the Registrar of friendly Societies powers in respect of the rules and elections oftrade unions similar to those he already possessed in relation totheir political funds i.e., power to hear complaints about breaches of the rules and to make orders remedying any breach. He shouldnot, however, be empowered to approve rules, since this would beregarded as infringing the traditional independence of the unions andas contrary to International Labour Convention No. 87. Heoroposed to discuss this problem with the T.U.C. and the Britishwhen it was proposed to restrict investment in other services. If thePostmaster-GeneraFs proposals were, or were likely to appear, in anyway inconsistent with the policies which the Chancellor of theExchequer would advocate, it would be preferable to reconsider them,or at least to defer announcing them, until the autumn. This would,moreover, be more convenient from the point of view of theParliamentary time-table, although the increased charges could not then come into effect until the New Year and their yield in the current year would be proportionately reduced. If, on the other hand, theproposals were demonstrably compatible with the Chancellor^statement, there might be advantage in announcing them before the recess, either in the Chancellor^ statement itself or immediately thereafter, if that were felt to leave sufficient time for Prayers to be moved against them.In further discussion, on the presentation of increased charges,it was suggested that the announcement might indicate the extent towhich increased costs had been absorbed by increased efficiency inthe Post Office. It might, in addition, have a salutary effect on publicopinion to emphasise the extent to which the new charges were thenecessary consequence of wage increases. On the other hand, this method of presentation might, where a Government monopoly was concerned, be interpreted as setting an example of weakness orunconcern in resisting wage demands.It was also suggested that, if an increased charge were to be madefor parcels, this should be proportionate to the existing charges forparcels of different weights, rather than a flat-rate increase for all.The Cabinet-Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to give further considerationto the content and timing of the proposals in C. (61) 93, andto submit them again to the Cabinet if it was proposed tomake an announcement before the summer recess.
Employers&apos; Confederation, and would then make it clear that theGovernment were prepared to legislate if necessary. He also proposed to make an announcement of the Governments policy inParliament before the summer recess.Discussion showed that there was some feeling in the Cabinetthat these proposals did not go far enough, and that action by theT.U.C. and by the Government should be regarded as complementaryrather than alternative. In the first place^ even if all the unions were willing to adopt model rules for elections, this would not in itselfprovide an effective remedy against breaches of the rules. At thesame time, the limited powers which it was proposed to confer on the registrar would not enable him to remedy rules which were in themselves defective. The recent action had revealed that the rules of the E.T.U. were so drafted that their interpretation was open togreat doubt. While, therefore, election rules should not be made subject to his approval, the Registrar might be given some power toensure that they were comprehensible and workable. Indeed, he might be allowed to disallow rules which did not comply with the requirement in Article 3 of International Labour Convention No. 87that unions should have the right &quot; to elect their representatives infull freedom &quot;. In addition, it was for consideration whether the registrar might not be empowered to arrange for elections to be conducted independently, if requested by a union to do so and at theunion&apos;s expense.On the other hand, it was argued that wider proposals on theselines, though logical and attractive in themselves, would encounterstrong opposition from the unions. It was possible that the T.U.C.might be willing to support legislation giving them the power toensure that rules were comprehensible and workable, but it was important, both from the political and practical point of view, thatthe Government should avoid giving the impression that they weremounting an attack on the unions. It might therefore be preferable to proceed by stages to approach the T.U.C. on the more limitedbasis proposed by the Minister of Labour and to announce at thesame time that the Government intended to ensure, by one meansor another, that the position was remedied. It might be expedientat some stage to appoint an independent person of high status to enquire into the possibility of further measures.Summing up, the Home Secretary said that further considerationneeded to be given to the various proposals put forward in the cabinet&apos;s discussion. Meanwhile, discussions might be opened withthe T.U.C., who could be invited to consider the desirability of theirpersuading the unions to adopt model rules on the understandingthat, if they thought or found this to be impracticable, theGovernment would discuss with them possible lines of legislative action. If it were necessary to make an announcement before the recess, this might be in a written answer, which need not indicatewhat form any legislation might take.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour-(i) to open discussions with the Trades Union congress on the lines indicated by the Home Secretary;(ii) to submit for the Prime Ministers approval a draft announcement in the form of a written answer to a- -Parliamentary Question.(2) Invited  the Attorney-General, in consultation with theMinister of Labour, to circulate a memorandum on possible legislation on trade union elections.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (61) 95 at a later meeting.
Germany(previous reference:C.C. (61) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)Assets in the united kingdom(previous reference:C.C. (59) 51stConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (61) 92) about the disposal ofGerman assets in the United Kingdom.The President of the Board of Trade said that the Distributionof Enemy Property (No. 3) Order, made in 1957, provided that 250,000 should be assigned to the Nazi Victim Relief Trust and thatany further monies accruing from German assets in the UnitedKingdom should be paid to the Exchequer. Since then an additional sum of  1.07 millions had been realised. He therefore proposed tomake a further distribution to the creditors, in accordance with theterms of the Distribution of German Enemy Property Act, 1949, of2^d. in the pound. This would leave a residue of liquid assets ofabout  70,000 which was too small to be included in the distribution.He proposed to make it available for the benefit of certain victims ofNazi persecution the so-called &quot; out of time victims &quot; who met the qualifying conditions adopted for similar purposes in the past.Further German assets would accrue in the future, mainly fromwills and settlements, but these were unlikely to exceed  100,000. Ithad hitherto been felt that it would not be possible to justify to publicopinion the return of any assets to the German authorities whilevictims of Nazi persecution remained without compensation. TheGerman Government had now, however^ gone a considerable way towards fulfilling their obligations by paying compensation toStateless victims of persecution, and the return of these future assetsto the German authorities would facilitate the negotiations whichwere still continuing about compensation for certain British victims.It was therefore proposed to return them to the German authorities,subject to some minor exceptions necessary to enable the Board ofTrade to implement agreements already made with otherGovernments.The Foreign Secretary said that he was in agreement with theseproposals.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C. (61) 92.6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the chairman and members of the Council on Prices, Productivity and Incomeshoped that the Council could be disbanded after the submission of its next report. This would be welcomed by the Trades Union Congress,who had declined to co-operate in the Councils work. He had it inmind, in a statement which he proposed to make to Parliament later that month about the economic situation, to announce his intentionto bring representatives of employers and workers into closerconsultation on current economic problems. There were some indications that consultations of this nature would now be welcomed by industry. If machinery could be established for this purpose, itwould seem natural that the work of &apos;he Council should be discontinued.Discussion showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the Council might well be disbanded if it could be stated thatthis was part of a process of initiating wider consultations with bothsides of industry on current economic problems.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform the PrimeMinister that the Cabinet were in broad agreement with his proposal that the work of the Council on Prices, Productivity&quot;and Incomes should be discontinued on the basis which hehad suggested.Wages and prices(previous reference:C.C.
