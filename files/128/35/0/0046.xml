Tunisia(previous reference:CC. (61) 45thConclusions.Minute 1)CC 46 (61)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Afro-Asian countries were pressing for a special meeting of the General Assembly of theUnited Nations to discuss their resolution on Bizerta. The french would be under strong pressure on this in the Assembly. They hadnot, however, shown any anxiety to concert a line on it with their allies: they seemed determined to handle the situation on their own.9&apos;ft i2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 125) about an application from the organisers of themovement for nuclear disarmament for permission to hold a demonstration in Trafalgar Square on Sunday, 17th September.The Home Secretary said that experience of the previous activitiesof this organisation suggested that it was their intention on this occasion also to obstruct the public highway by sitting down anddeclining to move if challenged by the police. At a similardemonstration earlier in the year over 800 arrests had been made and a repetition on an even larger scale would throw an unacceptable strain on the police. He therefore proposed in agreement with the Ministerof Works that the application should be refused.In discussion some misgivings were expressed on the ground thatrefusal would amount to an interference with the traditional rightsof freedom of assembly and freedom of speech. No application froman organisation for the use of Trafalgar Square had been refused(except when the Square had already been booked) since 1916, whenpermission had been refused for a demonstration against continuing the war. On the present occasion the grant of permission on condition that the demonstrators did not break the law would certainly be ineffective.The fact that the Royal Air Force Association were alreadyplanning to hold a procession in the neighbourhood of trafalgar square on the same day had nevertheless to be taken into account.The danger of consequent public disorder was a sufficient justification for refusing the present application, although it would be preferable to offer no reasons for the refusal. If, however, it were possible toobtain evidence, as distinct from a presumption, of a definite intentionon the part of the organisers to commit breaches of the law. theGovernment would be in a stronger position to refuse any applicationthey might make for the use of Trafalgar Square on an alternativedate. It might even be appropriate to apply to a magistrate, under an Act of 1361, to require the organisers to show cause why theyshould not be bound over to keep the peace.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Works to refuse the application forthe use of Trafalgar Square for a demonstration in favourof nuclear disarmament on Sunday. 17th September.(2) Invited the Attorney-General in consultation with the HomeSecretary, to assess such evidence as could be obtainedof the precise intentions of the organisers of the proposeddemonstration.Demonstrationin TrafalgarSquareParliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week beginning 24th October, when parliament would re-assemble after the summer recess.
4. The Home Secretary said that, following the judgment of theElection Court that Lord Stansgate was a Peer at the time of the recentby-election in Bristol, South-East, and that his election to the House ofCommons was therefore invalid, Mr. Malcolm St. Clair, his opponentin the by-election, had taken his seat in the House of Commons on theprevious day. Mr. St. Clair&apos;s position was an uneasy one and he hadbeen considering the possibility of applying for the Chiltern Hundreds.In discussion it was generally agreed that it would be against theinterests of the electors in Bristol, South-East, that Mr. St. Clairshould apply for the Chiltern Hundreds unless and until anundertaking could be obtained from Lord Stansgate that he would not stand in the ensuing by-election. It was most unlikely that such anundertaking could be obtained, especially since even the judgment ofthe Election Court would not enable the Returning Officer to refuse the nomination of Lord Stansgate. There would, however, be advantage in Mr. St. Clair&apos;s publishing an early statement to the effectthat he intended to resign his seat if Lord Stansgate gave theundertaking.In further discussion the Cabinet were reminded that there wouldnot now be time for a debate in the present Session on the appointmentof a Joint Select Committee on reform of the House of Lords. the complexity of the subject made it desirable that a thorough enquiry should be held before negotiation was introduced to enable a Peerageto be renounced. The enquiry might be more acceptable to certain sections of opinion in the House of Lords if the terms of referenceapproved by the Cabinet at their meeting on 25th April were madesomewhat narrower.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to prepare a draft statement,for publication by Mr. Malcolm St. Clair, of his intentionto apply for the Chiltern Hundreds if and when anundertaking was given by Lord Stansgate that he wouldnot stand in the ensuing by-election(2) Invited the Home Secretary to give further consideration, inthe light of their discussion, to the date on which thestatement contemplated in Conclusion (1) might most appropriately be issued.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to consider further, in the lightof their discussion, the terms of reference of a Joint SelectCommittee on reform of the House of Lords.Succession toPeerages(previous reference:CC.

They had also been minute 4) asked to report by 13th October on what was likely to be involved incarrying out the announced objective of containing supply expenditurein 1962-63 within 21 per cent, in real terms of the Estimates for1961-62; and they had been asked to report by 20th October on theplan for public expenditure up to 1965-66.The Prime Minister said that this paper dealt only with internalexpenditure. In addition he had issued a directive on 28th July onthe need to reduce Government expenditure overseas. The objective was to reduce that expenditure to an annual rate of  400 millions.Economic aid would have to be restricted to about  180 millions a
a5CC 46 (61)year. Military expenditure overseas would have to be substantially reduced, and for this purpose a general review of defence commitments had been initiated. The Departments concerned would consider means of reducing expenditure on diplomatic, administrative and information services overseas by 10 per cent., and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, would submit a report on this by the end ofSeptember.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of C. (61) 123.(2) Took note of the directive issued by the Prime Minister on government expenditure overseas.Housing Policy(previous reference :CC. (60) 62ndConclusions,Minute 8)Birmingham6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (61) 121) reporting the conclusions of aCommittee of the Ministers principally concerned which had enquiredinto the means of meeting the future housing needs of birmingham and other congested towns in the West Midlands.The Paymaster-General said that within the boundaries ofBirmingham itself, where one-fifth of the population were still living in slums, nearly all the available land had already been used and,unless sites could be found elsewhere, slum clearance would comevirtually to a halt in 1964. After considering a number of alternatives,the Committee proposed that the local authorities of Redditch,Worcester and Daventry should be encouraged to undertake townexpansions there; that 600 acres of the Birmingham green belt shouldbe released for housing at Wythall; and that, since these schemestogether would not suffice, a new town should be provided in addition.The site provisionally proposed for the new town was at Dawley inShropshire, a derelict area of old mineworkings. but further investigation would be needed before it could be finally established that this site was physically practicable. These proposals taken together would meet the housing needs of Birmingham and the west midlands for the next 20 years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recognised that anew town was the only feasible means of relieving Birmingham.When, however,-the time came for a final decision as between Dawleyand an alternative site considered by the Committee at Swynnerton inStaffordshire, it must not be overlooked that both the capital and running costs of a new town at Dawley would be materially greaterthan at Swynnerton.Discussion showed that the proposals put forward by theCommittee were generally acceptable to the Cabinet. On planning and financial grounds, Swynnerton would have been the preferablesite for a new town but there were serious industrial and agriculturalobjections to its use. It was suggested that a new town at Dawleywould compete with the development districts for the transfer ofindustry from Birmingham and the West Midlands. There were,however, many small firms in the area which could not be transferredto the development districts but could move to Dawley; and it shouldbe possible to prevent firms which could reasonably be transferred toa development district from going instead to Dawley. As theGovernment had already announced that they were considering theestablishment of a new town at Dawley and that a survey of the area was to be undertaken, there was no need for any further announcementuntil the survey had been completed towards the end of the year.
CommercialPolio&apos;Pigmcat(previous reference:C.C. (60) 28ihConclusions.Minute 6)7. The Cabinet had before thetn a memorandum by the lord president (C. (61) 122) on the import of bacon from Poland.The Lord President said that the Economic Policy Committeehad considered a proposal by the President of the Board of Trade thatwe should conclude an arrangement with the Poles under which theywould buy. on live years credit, three ships and some heavy motor vehicles, to a total value of  5 millions, on condition that they were granted additional quotas of 3,000 tons of bacon and  200,000 worth of canned ham over and above their existing quotas under the annualtrade agreement of 48,500 tons of bacon and  1 -7 millions of cannedham. It was an essential part of the bargain that these additionalquotas would be continued for several years, to provide Polishearnings sufficient to liquidate the cost of their purchases of ships andlorries.Apart from the political importance of extending trade with poland, there were strong commercial arguments for accepting theproposed arrangement. It would provide a new and possiblyexpanding market for ships and lorries, which might be of particularbenefit to industry in Northern Ireland and Scotland. The additionalquota for bacon would amount to less than 1 per cent, of ourconsumption, and the additional imports from Poland would tend todisplace other bacon imports rather than domestic production. Onthe other hand, while the Minister of Agriculture would be preparedto agree that the existing quotas for bacon and canned ham should beincreased by the amounts proposed for the current year, if this would secure the Polish contracts for ships and lorries, a continuingcommitment to import these increased quantities for six or seven years would be unacceptable, in view of the effect on other suppliers and onthe domestic producer.The Minister of Agriculture said that an undertaking to continuethe quotas for these additional quantities of bacon and canned hamwould make it impossible in practice to reduce the existing quotas overthe next few years. It would thus amount to a &quot;ong-Urm guarantee toaccept 51.500 tons of Polish bacon, since the Polish authorities wouldnot hesitate to sell the full amount on the British market even if theprice were uneconomic. Imports of Polish bacon of this order would lead to unacceptable repercussions on other oversea suppliers, sinceDanish and Dutch production was likely to rise, as well as on Britishproducers of pig meat. Unless we retained freedom to limit supplies from overseas, it was likely that the subsidy cost to the exchequer would rise from the present level of about  20 millions a year to theformer level of some  40 millions a year. Since we could not imposequantitative limitations on the other main sources of supply fromabroad, any restriction must in practice fall on Poland. Moreover,a long-term commitment of the kind proposed would present special difficulties at a time when we were likely to become involved in negotiations with the European Economic Community about acommon agricultural policy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Housing to approve the building ofnouses for Birmingham on 600 acres at Wythall and to urge the local authorities concerned to proceed as rapidly as possible with town expansions at Redditch, Worcesterand Daventry.(2) Agreed in principle that a new town should be establised for the relief of Birmingham.(3) Invited the Minister of Housing to proceed with a detailed investigation of the practicability of establishing a newtown at Dawley and to bring this question before themagain in due course.
8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at a meeting withrepresentatives of the local authorities later in the day. he would seek to impress upon them the need for carrying out the policy forcontaining wage increases which he had outlined in the statement onthe economic situation which he had made to Parliament on 25th July.In explaining that increases in income should not precede or outstripnational productivity, he proposed to say that in the field of publicemployment, including local government services, it would benecessary to ensure that account would be taken in future of theGovernment^ views on whether there could be an increase and, if so. how much could be justified in the national interest. In view of thegreat variety of procedures for wage negotiation in publicemployment, no uniform approach could be followed, but he wouldexpress the hope that discussions with the local authority associationsabout this problem could take place in the autumn.The Minister of Housing said that it would be preferable thatthe statement proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer should beon the basis that the Government wished to establish a common front with the local authority associations in this matter. this approach, at least in those cases in which the Government had no statutory power to intervene in negotiations in the field of localgovernment, was likely, in his judgment, to be the most acceptable to local authorities sienerallv.Wages Policy(previous references :CC. (60) 16thConclusions.Minute 5 and cc. (61) 40thConclusions.Minute 6)CC 46 (61)The President of the Board of Trade suggested that the proposed arrangement could be considered on its merits apart from the quotas for bacon and canned ham which were fixed under the annual trade agreement with Poland. It would not in any case be possible toreduce the current quota of 48,500 tons of Polish bacon within thenext few years without serious damage to our commercial relationswith Poland, and to accept the additional quota now proposed wouldnot in practice involve any further limitation on our freedom of negotiation with other countries.The Minister of A aviation said that if it were decided to accept anarrangement on the lines proposed, there would be advantage inurging the Polish authorities to include aircraft in their purchase ofour capital goods.In further discussion it was pointed out that, while it was of greatimportance to increase exports, it would not on balance be worthdoing so if the result were a substantial and disproportionate additionto the burden of Exchequer support for agriculture. It seemed highlyprobable that British and European farmers would increase theirpigmeat production in the near future. Some accommodation overbacon supplies would be bound to be a major feature of thenegotiations which were now likely to take place between the UnitedKingdom and other members of the European Free Trade association and the European Economic Community. It was the view of theCabinet, on balance, that to accept the additional quotas on the longer term basis now proposed would make it more difficult to adjustquotas under the annual trade agreement with Poland, and that this might well reduce our freedom of action in any negotiations arisingout of our application to join the Treaty of Rome. It would thereforebe necessary to decline the arrangement which the Polish authorities had proposed.The Cabinet Agreed that it would be inexpedient to pursue the proposal,outlined in C. (61) 122, for the sale of British capital goodsin exchange for an additional long-term quota for Polishbacon and canned ham.
The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consult theMinister of Housing on the precise terms in which he would explain to  the local authorities&apos; representatives the government&apos;s policy for containing wage increases.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st August, 1961.
