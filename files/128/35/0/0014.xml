CC. 14 (61)The Prime Minister said that in the last few days a number ofdifficult discussions had been held with Sir Roy Welensky, the PrimeMinister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, about theproposals set out in the White Paper on Proposals for constitutional change in Northern Rhodesia (Cmnd. 1295). Sir Roy Welensky had put forward several different proposals for the election of the.Legislative Council all based on the principle that political control in Northern Rhodesia should remain in &quot; responsible hands &quot;. Hehad maintained that the major influence in the election as a wholemust remain with the upper roll electorate; that there should be nodownward adjustment in the income or educational qualifications forthe upper roll; and that the principle of cross-voting should beintroduced in order to give voters on both rolls an influence in theelection in each constituency. He was opposed to the concept of a group of unreserved &quot; national &quot; seats for which candidates would be elected by equalising the votes cast by the voters on each of the upperand lower rolls.It might be possible within the framework of the White paper to meet Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s views on the number of members to be elected by the upper and lower rolls, and to include some measureof cross-voting which would give both rolls an influence on each ofthe seats to be contested. Furthermore, the adjustment of the upperroll qualifications might not be an insuperable problem since Sir roy welensky was willing to consider the addition of certain categories,such as graduates, to the roll. But it would not be possible to acceptthe principle that the electors on the upper roll should have adominant influence in the election as a whole.It had been made clear to Sir Roy Welensky that it would notbe proper for the United Kingdom Government at this stage tonegotiate a settlement with the Federal Government, and he had been advised to arrange for the United Federal Party to put forwardalternative proposals for consideration in the course of the discussions which the Governor of Northern Rhodesia would be holding inLusaka with the main political groups in the territory. The UnitedKingdom Government would, in accordance with the undertakingthey had given, consult with the Federal Government before final decisions were reached on the recommendations made by theGovernor in the light of those discussions. In view of the forthcomingreferendum on constitutional changes in Southern Rhodesia it was important that Sir Roy Welensky should accept this procedure, andshould also avoid making any public statement which might causeembarrassment to the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia in regardto the referendum.The Commonwealth Secretary said that in further discussion that,day he had again made it plain that the United Kingdom Governmentcould not enter into negotiations with the Federal Government onthe constitutional changes to be made in Northern Rhodesia, and hehad given no assurances that the points raised by Sir Roy Welenskywould be met. He had advised Sir Roy Welensky to arrange for all his proposals to be put before the Governor by the local UnitedFederal Party representatives in Lusaka, and had stated that at those discussions the Governor would be prepared to consider any other possible constitutional arrangements which fell within the framework of the proposals put forward in the White Paper. He had assuredhim that we should be ready to consider any alternative proposalswhich would produce the same result. Sir Roy Welensky appearedto be conscious of the serious situation which could arise if public statements were made which induced the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia to propose secession from the Federation or influenced theSouthern Rhodesia electorate against the constitutional changes which had recently been agreed in Salisbury and were to be the
subject of the referendum. He had suggested that a jointcommunique should be issued on that day to the effect that the UnitedKingdom Ministers and. the Federal.Prime. Minister had taken theopportunity of the. Meeting of. Commonwealth Prime Ministers tohold, further consultations about constitutional changes in northern rhodesia, that there had been a valuable exchange of views, that theUnited Kingdom Government had confirmed that they would be willing to consider any proposals which might be put forward by thepolitical groups in Northern Rhodesia within the framework andgeneral spirit of the White Paper, and that due regard would be paidto the considerations which the Federal Government had brought tothe attention of the United Kingdom Government.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the course whichhad been proposed to Sir Roy Welensky. In discussion it waspointed out that if he were to agree to this course there should belittle difficulty in prolonging negotiations until the southern rhodesian referendum had taken place. If, on the other hand,Sir Roy Welensky declined to accept this course and issued astatement likely to prejudice the result of the referendum it wouldbe necessary to consider urgently what statement should be madeby the United Kingdom Government in reply.It was suggested that on detailed examination the scheme forthe composition of the Legislative Council set out in the White Papermight not achieve the objective of providing a majority of membersof moderate views if the addition of a number of Asians and Africansto the upper roll had the result that candidates of extremist views were successful in many of the seats. It would therefore be expedient that the Governor should examine Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s latest proposals in Lusaka, together with any other proposals put forward,with the object of formulating a scheme which would provide agenuinely multi-racial solution.The Cabinet Endorsed the course of action put forward by the PrimeMinister and the Commonwealth Secretary in their discussions with Sir Roy Welensky.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st March, 1961.
