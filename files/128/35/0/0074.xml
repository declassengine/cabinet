congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 71stConclusions.Minute 4)2. The Cabinet were informed that, in the light of their earlier discussions on the military and political situation in the Congo, ithad been decided to submit to Mr. U Thant, the acting Secretary-General of the United Nations, a formal proposal for an immediatecease-fire in Katanga. Mr. U Thant had referred this proposal to hisadvisory committee on the Congo, which was to discuss it on thefollowing day. Meanwhile, the United States Government had declared that in their view no cease-fire was feasible until theminimum objectives of the United Nations had been attained. Thesethey had defined as the capacity to protect their forces and tomaintain their freedom of movement and communications in order todischarge the task assigned to them by the Security Council and theGeneral Assembly; but they had added that force should be used only to the extent necessary to achieve those limited &quot;objectives. the wider aim must be to bring Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of katanga, and Mr. Adoula, the Prime Minister of the central CongoGovernment, together to seek agreement on means of re-integratingKatanga within the Congo and of consolidating the whole country under a suitable government. From private communications it was clear that the differences between the United States and UnitedKingdom Governments were not so wide as might appear from thepublic positions which they had taken up. The United StatesGovernment were ready for a cease-fire if it could be combined, andsimultaneous, with a reliable assurance of an early meeting between mr. Tshombe and Mr. Adoula. The latest proposal was that thismeeting might be held at Kitona and that Dr. Bunche, an assistant secretary-General of the United Nations, might himself accompanyMr. Tshombe to the meeting as a guarantor of his personal safety.Meanwhile Mr. U Thant had withdrawn his earlier request for thesupply of British bombs for the Indian aircraft in use by united nations forces in the Congo.The Cabinet then discussed the handling of the debate on the congo which was to be held in the House of Commons later in theday. The Lord Privy Seal would open the Government case and thePrime Minister would reply to the debate. There now seemed agood prospect that the Government motion would be carried by asubstantial majority.The Cabinet-Took note of the developments which had taken place since their last discussion on 12th December, and of thearrangements for handling the debate in the House ofCommons.Parliament l.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week and in the weekfollowing the end of the Christmas recess.Before the House rose a motion would be tabled for a compulsorytime-table for the remaining stages of the Commonwealth ImmigrantsBill.  This would provide for three more days on the committee stage and two days for the Report Stage and Third Reading.Succession to There was now good prospect of agreement between thePeerages Opposition leaders and Government supporters on the scope of the(Previous proposed enquiry on House of Lords reform.

Goa(previous reference:CC. (61) 71stConclusions.Minute 1)The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.International 4.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at a meeting inMonetary Fund Paris on the previous day Ministers from the nine principal countries(Previous        of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and DevelopmentReference:      an(j from Japan had agreed, subject to reference to governments, to. (60) 50th   participate in a scheme designed to produce additional resources for conclusions,    the International Monetary Fund. In view of the recent comparativeMmutc 10)      weakness of the dolhr, the Fund had been short of effective resources and its total holding of currencies of the six Common Marketcountries amounted at present to less than $1 billion. The agreement which had been reached provided for supplementary resources ofabout $6 billion to be made available to the Fund.   The UnitedStates would contribute $2 billion, the United Kingdom $1 billion,the six Common Matket countries $21 billion, anj there would befurther contributions from Canada, Japan and possibly Switzerland.These figures represented maximum commitments and, throughcareful arrangements which had been made for the voting rights ofparticipants, each country would be free to decide for itself how muchit could lend if a call were made.  The United Kingdom would becalled upon to lend only in conditions in which the United Statesneeded a drawing, the Fund was short of sterling and our balance ofpayments position enabled us to lend as it would if there were aflow of funds from the dollar to sterling.   We would be under no obligation to&quot;lend while we still had an outstanding drawing from theFund.Details of the scheme were being worked out, but in broad outline the commitment for the United Kingdom was reasonable and.3. The Lord Privy Seal said that, in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 12th December, representations had been made to theIndian Government with a view to dissuading them from launchingan armed attack on Goa. These representations had been conveyedin a note which the High Commissioner in Delhi had deliveredpersonally to Mr. Nehru on the previous day. Mr. Nehru had however given no assurance that force would not be used; and theUnited States Ambassador, who had made similar representations,had been given to understand by a senior official of the indian government that, unless the Portuguese made some conciliatorymove within the next two or three days, the Indians might feel obligedto take forceful action. The approach by the High Commissionerwas now being followed up by a personal message from the PrimeMinister to Mr. Nehru. It would be made known in London that afternoon that these representations had been made to the indian government.Meanwhile, the Portuguese Government were suggesting thatindependent observers should be sent to Goa. We should let it be known that we would support this suggestion, if it were acceptable to both sides.Steps had also been taken to ascertain what military reinforcements the Portuguese desired to send to Goa. They wishedto send within the next few days one aircraft containing about 130troops and another aircraft carrying equipment some days later. Upto now we had been able to avoid any final refusal of staging facilitiesfor these aircraft. We had explained that there was no precedent for allowing any allied Power to stage aircraft through Gan, and thatit was most unlikely that the Libyan Government would allow these aircraft to be staged through El Adem. We should not be asked for facilities at Mauritius if, as seemed likely, these aircraft had not the range to fly from there to Goa. We had however undertaken that,if the Portuguese could suggest some other practicable route, wewould consider whether we could assist them.
CommercialPolicyTrade with poland(previous reference:CC. (61) 62ndConclusions,Minute 5)Trade uiihRoumania5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 214) about quotas for Polish bacon and Roumanianmeat and fruit pulp.The Prime Minister recalled that the Polish Government had offered to buy British aircraft costing about  1J million in return foran increase of about  1^ million in the current year&apos;s quotas for imports from Poland. The increase would consist of 4,000 tons ofbacon, canned ham and other canned meat. It had been found that acceptance of this proposal would have only an insignificant effect onthe size of subsidy payments but there would be difficulty in defendingany measure, such as this, which would have the appearance ofdepressing the bacon market, particularly at a time when the Ministerof Agriculture was presenting to Parliament a Supplementary vote for about  78 million largely due to the collapse of the meat andbacon markets during the current year.In discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet thattrading policy with the Iron Curtain countries, which often involvedacceptance of agricultural products not required in this country,would have to be thoroughly reviewed in the context of the common market negotiations. It was particularly unfortunate that we shouldbe called upon at this stage to increase the Polish bacon quota, sinceto do so would prejudice such slender prospects as there were ofsecuring agreement with Denmark and Ireland for voluntary controlof bacon imports. On the other hand, acceptance of the Polishproposal would enable the aircraft industry, which was in great need of more outlets for exports, to enter a new and probably expandingmarket. On balance, it would be expedient to apply to this case the directive given by the Prime Minister on 27th September, I960(C. (60) 135), in which he had said that &quot; in the interests of securinggreater exports we must be prepared to accept imports which may cause some problems domestically or in the Commonwealth &quot;. Itwould, however, be desirable to consider carefully whether the government&apos;s agreement in principle should be expressed in a &quot; once for all &quot; increase in the quota or by over-licensing.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that this increase in imports of Polishbacon should be accepted.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider withthe Minister of Agriculture the best means of giving effect to this decision.The Cabinet were informed that under trade and financialagreements negotiated with Roumania in the previous year there hadbeen a rise in exports from  3 million in I960 to  10 million in thefirst three quarters of The Roumanians had, however, saidthat they would not renew the agreements unless they were given a quota for meat and fruit pulp.   They had asked for a quota ofCC74(6l)subject to the approval of the Cabinet, he would like to inform theFund authorities during the following week that the scheme was accepted in principle by the Government. The necessary Bill wouldbe short and need not be passed by any specified date so long as roomcould be found for it in the current session.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to inform theauthorities of the International Monetary Fund that theGovernment were prepared in principle to accept the borrowing scheme which had been provisionally approved at the meeting in Paris on 13th December.
20,000 tons of meat but it was thought that they would accept5,000 tons provided that they could also be offered a token quantity(50 tons) of fruit pulp. As the Roumanians had not taken up theexisting quotas provided for by the trade agreement, it would bedifficult to justify establishing a new quota for meat imports at thepresent time, when the meat market was heavily over-supplied.In discussion it was agreed that, despite the favourable financial agreement and the value of the growing trade with Roumania, itwould not be expedient to give the Roumanians a quota for meat.The Cabinet (3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to inform theRoumanian authorities that approval could not be givenfor a quota of meat imports from Roumania into thiscountry.Wages Policy 6.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer circulated to the Cabinet(Previous       the draft of a statement which had been prepared by officials as a reference:      basis for his speech in the debate in the House of Commons on 18thCC. (61) 68th   December on the economic situation. The Chancellor suggested thatConclusion.     the Cabinet should discuss the main points of principle raised by thisMinute4)       draft.  The first was whether he should announce at this stage the ending of the wages pause.  He believed that the trades unions werenot at present expecting him to set a date for the end of the pause,though they would like him to recognise that in its present form it had given rise to injustice.   The second main point was whether any indication should be given, in terms either of money or of a percentage,of the extent to which economic conditions would allow of any increase in personal incomes in 1962.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) TlurPrime Minister suggested that more emphasis should belaid on the constructive side of the Governments policy, which shouldbe put first in any statement. The fact was that, as a nation, we wereearning too little and spending too much. The first duty of theGovernment was to make it possible for the country to earn more;and this would be the primary task of the new planning machinery.People must be made to see that measures taken to increase thecountry&apos;s earning power were in their own interests. The secondproblem was how to avoid spending too much while production wasbeing built up. The pause in wages had been a rough and readyinstrument to this end; it had been introduced as an emergencymeasure and inevitably involved some inconsistencies and injustice.But on the whole it had worked well. It would have to be replaced by longer-term arrangements but it would take time to work theseout in consultation with the two sides of industry. Some interim arrangement was needed to bridge the gap. The pause would haveto be phased into a period of continued restraint during which therise in the national wages bill would be kept in step with the rise inprod uctivity.(/n The timing of any change in present policy would need careful thought. Unless some modification of the pause .vasannounced soon, a number of trades unions would have taken up firmpositions on wage claims and it would then be more difficult fororganised labour to co-operate with the Government on a long-term policy. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would have to make afurther statement when figures for the country&apos;s economicperformance in 1961 were available. The best hope of avoidingprecipitate action by some unions might be for the Chancellor to meetrepresentatives of the Trades Union Congress on 20th December and again in mid-January, when more would be known of the 1961 out-turn, and to make a definite public statement as soon as possible thereafter.
CC 74 (61)(c) It would be dangerous to give the impression at this stage that the pause was coming to an end. This would release a flood of wage claims and might force the Government to take deflationarymeasures. This would run counter to their expressed aim of encouraging growth and would prejudice the prospect of getting bothsides of industry to co-operate in long-term planning. There was moresupport for the policy of the pause than had been generally admitted;the recent wage increase award by British Oxygen had beenunpopular with ,other employers, and the flat rejection of theengineering claim on the previous day was also encouraging.(d) In order to secure economic growth positive measures mighthave to be taken to secure special wage incentives in industries whichcould show increased productivity without increase in prices. A fairmethod would need, however, to be devised for dealing with thosewho were not productive in the narrow sense, e.g., government employees, railwaymen and workers in service industries.(e) To avoid the danger that the ending of the pause would leadto a further period of inflation it would be necessary to move fromthe pause in its present form into a second stage in which, whilethe pause could still be held to be continuing, room could be found for modest increases where they were most justified. The main difficulty would be to prevent such increases getting out of hand;a reference to a specific percentage, e.g., 2\ per cent., would encourage everybody to demand increases of that order. A referenceto a specific sum, e.g.,  500 million, which might be available duringthis period for salary and wage increases would encourage everybodyto get their claim in before the sum was exhausted. It might be of help in restraining these pressures if the Government issued some general direction to all nationalised industries about the size of the increases which could be tolerated.(/) In spite of the danger of setting a definite limit to wage increases in the interim period it would not be enough for theChancellor of the Exchequer to speak in purely general terms. Hecould state the facts without necessarily drawing specific conclusionsfrom them. He might, for example, say that national productivitywas at present rising at the rate of per cent, a year; that thenational wage bill was running at the rate of  16.000 million a yearand that it followed from this that the rise in national productivitywould, if reflected in the wage bill, produce wage increases of  500million. These facts were already known.(g) The reference in the draft statement to arbitration mightbe better omitted at this stage, and the paragraphs dealing withcomparability and with Government services should be reconsidered.It was difficult to deal with comparability until more progress hadbeen made with a long-term policy for incomes, and any referenceto Government services at this stage would be likely to carry the implication that the pause was to be brought to an end on a definitedate.(/0 The Governments policy would be judged less by words thanby action. The handling of the claim for increases in railwaymen&apos;swages would be of special importance. The view was expressed that in present circumstances any substantial award to the railwaymenwould seriously endanger the general policy of the Government.Moreover, if the railwaymen took their case to arbitration, theGovernment should avoid putting themselves in a position in whichthey might be held to have an obligation to accept the results ofarbitration. In this connexion it might be of particular help if ageneral direction could be given to the nationalised industries thatwage increases should not be granted which could not be recoupedby savings or by higher charges.
&quot;secret the Cabinet- -&apos;.  &apos; ....(1) Invited the Chancellor of. the Exchequer to arrange forfurther consideration to be given, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, to the possibility of a general direction to the nationalised industries about the scope for wage increases in 1962.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to be guided bytheir views, as expressed in discussion, in dealing with the debate on economic policy in the House of Commons on18th December.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,14th December, 1961.
