CC. (44) 61Europe(previous reference:CC. (61) 42ndConclusions)1. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of relations betweenthe United Kingdom and the European Economic Community(E.E.C.).They confirmed the view, with which there had been generalagreement at their previous discussion, that a formal application foraccession to the Treaty of Rome should be made without delay inorder that negotiations might be opened with the Community witha view to ascertaining whether satisfactory arrangements could bemade to meet our requirements, particularly in respect of british agriculture and of the needs of the other Commonwealth countries and the other members of the European Free Trade Association(E.F.T.A.).They then considered the draft of a statement to this effect,which would be made by the Prime Minister in the House of commons on 31st July, together with the draft of a Government motion whichwould be the subject of debate in the House of Commons on 2nd and3rd August.Discussion first centred on the terms in which it should be explained that a formal application to join the Treaty of Rome wasnecessary as a means of entering into negotiations with the E.E.C.There was general agreement that this might best be put in thefollowing terms:&quot; We have reached the stage where we cannot make further progress without entering into formal negotiations. I believethat the great majority in the House and in the country will feelthat they cannot fairly judge whether it is possible for the UnitedKingdom to join the European Economic Community until thereis a clearer picture before them of the arrangements designed tomeet our special needs. Only negotiations can reveal this. Inorder to enter into negotiations it is necessary under the Treatyof Rome to make formal application to join the european economic Community, although the ultimate decision whether to join or not must depend on the result of the negotiations &quot;.It was suggested that it should also be brought out that Article 237of the Treaty of Rome envisaged that the conditions of admission fora new member should be the subject of an agreement between themembers and the applicant State. It was suggested that, after thisexplanation, the Governmenfs decision might be announced in thefollowing terms:-&quot; Her Majesty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusionthat it would be right for Britain to make such an applicationto join the European Economic Community preparatory toentering into negotiations with a view to securing satisfactory arrangements to meet the special needs of the United Kingdom,of the Commonwealth and of the European Free trade association &quot;.Alternatively the decision might be expressed as follows:&quot; Her Majcsty&apos;s Government have come to the conclusionthat it would be right for Britain to make such an applicationunder Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome for negotiations witha view to joining the European Economic Community if satisfactory arrangements can be made to meet the special needs of the United Kingdom, of the Commonwealth and ofthe European Free Trade AssociationThere was general agreement that the Prime Minister should be askedto consider which of these forms of words would be preferable. Theterms of the Government motion would have to be consistent withwhichever of these alternatives was chosen.The Cabinet were informed that a motion had been tabled onthe previous day. and had now been signed by more than 30Government  supporters,  expressing opposition  to  any  material
derogation of British sovereignty, resulting from the entry of theUnited Kingdom into the E.E.C., and urging that an agreement withthe E.E.C. should not endanger the future expansion of trade withthe Commonwealth and E.F.T.A., or the prosperity of british agriculture. It was pointed out that the act of joining the E.E.C.would inevitably entail some derogation of sovereignty and that, while this might -not be harmful, it might well be represented as material.Nevertheless, the statement to be made by the Prime Minister wouldmake it clear that the Government would not conclude any agreement to enter the E.E.C. without reeking the prior approval of Parliament,and there was accordingly no reason why the signatories of this motion should not also support the proposed Government motion.At the same time, it would be helpful if the Government motioncould include a specific undertaking to consult Parliament about any agreement which affected the special interests of the United Kingdom,in particular agriculture, and of the Commonwealth and E.F.T.A.,or involved British sovereignty. There was general agreement thatthe draft motion should be amended to this effect.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a formal application to join the Treaty of Romeshould now be made for the purpose of enablingnegotiations to take place with a view to ascertaining wether the special needs of the United Kingdom, theother Commonwealth countries and the other membersof the European Free Trade Association could be met.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the drafts of thestatement to Parliament and the Government motion tobe revised in the light of the Cabinefs discussion and tobe submitted to the Prime Minister for his consideration.Parliament 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.There would not now be time before the recess to debate theappointment of a Joint Select Committee on reform of the Houseof Lords.The present intention was that Parliament should reassembleafter the summer recess on 23rd October; that it should be proroguedon 26th October: and that the new session should be opened on31st October.EducationTeachers&apos;Salaries(previous references :C.C. (61) 31stConclusions.Minute 9 andC.C.(61)43rdConclusions)3. The Minister of Education said that the Government^decision to contain the increase in teachers&apos; salaries in England andWales within a total of 142 millions had provoked, as he had expected,a strong adverse reaction from the teachers. This situation would bemore difficult to handle if the teachers continued to believe that theyhad been singled out for discriminatory treatment. He hoped that hiscolleagues would lose no opportunity to bring out the fact that the salary increases represented by this total of 142 millions were generally in line with the increases recently made in other parts of the publicservice. It was, however, even more important that the Governmentshould make plain their intention to secure that increases in salaries and wages in the public sector should not in future exceed the amountsjustified by the average increase in national productivity. It wouldnot be possible to gain general acceptance of this particular decisionon teachers&apos; salaries unless it could be seen as part of a general policywhich the Government were resolved to apply throughout that sector of the economy over which they exercised control. He hoped that something to this effect could be said on behalf of the government when the debate on the economic situation was resumed in the Houseof Commons that afternoon.
CC. *44) 61The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, inconsultation with the Education Ministers and the Ministerof Labour, what further statement could be made in the debate in the House of Commons that afternoon about theGovernment^ policy for securing a pause in wages increases in the public sector.Civil AviationAirportPolicy(previous reference :CC. (61) 31stConclusions,Minute 11)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Aviation (C. (61) 113) covering a draft White Paper on CivilAerodromes and Air Navigational Services.The Minister of Aviation recalled that the Cabinet had approvedhis proposals for the establishment of an independent statutory authority for the international airports at present owned and operated by his Department, for the progressive municipalisation of airportsserving the main centres of population and for the introduction of anew separate charge for technical services. As it was unlikely thattime could be found for the necessary legislation in the following session, the Cabinet had doubted whether it would be expedient to publish the details of these proposals in a White Paper. The Ministerconsidered, however, that early publication would be of substantialvalue especially, as effect could be given to some of the proposalswithout legislation or in legislation which would be required for other purposes.In discussion it was generally agreed that the balance of advantagenow lay on the side of publishing the White Paper before the recess,as a basis for renewed consultations with the local authorities andother interests. Various drafting amendments were suggested and approved, including a reference to the fact that the legislation would need to wait until Parliamentary time could be found for it.The Cabinet Approved, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion, the draft White Paper on Civil Aerodromes andAir Navigational Services annexed to C. (61) 113; and authorised the Minister of Aviation to present it before the recess on a dat; to be agreed with the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster and the Chief Whip.Ken-Va 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theJomo Kenyatta Colonial Secretary (C. (61) 114) proposing the early release of Mr.(Previous        Jomo Kenyatta.Racrcni-e^ jjw ^0ionuii Secretary said that the Colonial Policy CommitteeConclusions naL* aPProvcd a proposal by the Governor of Kenya that KenyattaMinute6) should be moved to Kiambu about the middle of August, when thehouse which was being built for him would be ready, and that a fewdays thereafter he should be released from all restrictions. The newKenya Government was now working well; all sections of it were infavour of Kenyatta&apos;s early release; and the Governor was sitistiedthat any security risk which that might entail could be accepted and contained. Indeed, in the Colonial Secretary&apos;s opinion, further delay would provoke a serious situation in the territory. He thereforeinvited the Cabinet to endorse the decision to release Kenyatta andsought their authority to announce it before the recess and to publishas a White Paper a despatch from the Governor setting out thereasons which had led to it.The Kenya Constitution disqualified from standing for election to the Legislative Council anyone who had served a sentence of morethan two years&apos; imprisonment.   There had been some pressure for
this prohibition to be revoked. This was a matter for the UnitedKingdom Government. It must, however, be assumed that if theprohibition were revoked Kenyatta would shortly be elected to theLegislature and it might then be difficult to resist pressure for his appointment as Chief Minister. This would be unacceptable to asubstantial body of opinion in Kenya. The Colonial Secretaryaccordingly supported the Governor&apos;s view that consideration of this amendment of the Constitution should be deferred. It might even bepossible to postpone it until some other member of the Governmenthad been appointed Chief Minister.Discussion showed that, although there were misgivings overKenyatta&apos;s imminent release, the balance of opinion in the cabinet was that there was no alternative to this course. The timing ofthe announcement, however, presented certain difficulties. TheGovernment would be strongly criticised if they made theannouncement during the recess, and there were serious objectionsto making it on the last day before the recess not least that theHouse of Lords would not then be sitting. On the other hand, theannouncement would not be well received by a section of theGovernments supporters and, if it were made earlier in the following week, it must be expected to add to the Government^ difficulties inthe debate on the Common Market. It was the general view of theCabinet that the announcement must be made before the House ofLords rose for the recess.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Kenyatta should be moved to Kiambu about themiddle of August and released from restrictions a few- - days thereafter.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to announce this decisionon a date to be agreed with the Prime Minister, inconsultation with the Home Secretary and the lord president; and to publish as a White Paper a despatchon the subject from the Governor of Kenya.(3) Agreed that consideration should not be given at present toany amendment of the disqualification provisions of the kenya Constitution.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.27th July, 1961.
