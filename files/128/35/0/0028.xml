Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (61) 14thConclusions)2. The Colonial Secretary said that the Governor of northern rhodesia was continuing discussions with representatives of the main political groups in the territory on the basis of the proposals for constitutional change which the Government had announced inFebruary (Cmnd. 1295). It had not yet been possible to work outwithin the framework of these proposals modifications which wouldmade them acceptable to the United Federal Party leaders. It would shortly be necessary to decide whether these discussions should bebrought to a conclusion, even if the proposals remained unacceptable to the United Federal Party, before the referendum on theconstitutional proposals for Southern Rhodesia took place. this might have serious implications for the future of the Federation. Itwas possible that the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia might inany case find it necessary to defer the date of the referendum. Hewould keep in close consultation with the Commonwealth Secretary,and would bring the matter before the Cabinet at an early date.EducationTeachers&apos;Salaries(previous reference:C.C. (61) 27thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum oy theMinister of Education (C. (6i) 63) about the current negotiations onteachers&apos; salaries in England and Wales.The Minister of Education said that in England and Wales thelocal authorities had originally offered a basic scale of  550-  1,100,representing an increase of 10 per cent, on the total cost of salaries.This had been rejected by the teachers, whose claim had been for a36 per cent, increase. Following the offer by the Secretary of Stateof about 12-1 per cent, in Scotland, the English local authorities had made a revised offer of a little over 13 per cent.; but this also hadbeen rejected by the teachers. A strong element among theauthorities now had it in mind to offer a scale of  600-  1,200, which represented an increase of 17-18 per cent, and would cost  61 millions a year. This the teachers would probably accept. The figure wasrelated to the 17 per cent, offered by the Secretary of State (within his over-all offer of 12+ per cent.) to male graduates in Scotland,where there were separate scales for men and women and for graduateand non-graduate teachers. In England and Wales, on the otherhand, there was a single basic scale with differentials for posts ofspecial responsibility, with the result that it was impossible to makethe same offer to male graduates as had been made in Scotlandwithout giving an equivalent and unjustifiable inciuvse to all teachers.Unlike the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister had not powerto modify, but only to accept or reject, an agreed Burnhamrecommendation; and to reject such a recommendation for the first time would arouse much indignation throughout the education service. There was a reasonable chance that at their next meetingon 29th May the local authorities might fail to agree among themselves and would seek the Minister^ advice. It might bepossible to persuade them to make an offer of  575-  1.200,representing an increase of 16 per cent. The cost of this would beabout  58 millions a year, of which about  32 millions would fall onthe Exchequer. If there were a breakdown in the negotiations, thelocal authorities would be tempted to put upon the Government theresponsibility for the failure to reach a settlement and for thewidespread teachers&apos; strikes which must be expected to follow.Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Whitsun recess.
ISIn discussion it was recognised that it would be almost impossibleto reconcile a concession of more than about 14 per cent, in Englandand Wales with the Government&apos;s decision, which had attractedconsiderable public support, to offer only 12i per cent, in Scotland.The only alternative, however, was for the Government to take responsibility for the damaging consequences either of a breakdown in the negotiations or of rejecting an agreed recommendation. Atleast at the.present stage it would be unwise to alienate the authorities by indicating in advance that the Minister would not approve a recommendation for a greater increase. If, however, they failed toagree among themselves or made an offer which was rejected by the teachers, it might be possible to make some progress towards resolvingthe situation by calling the two sides of the Burnham Committeetogether to meet the Minister.The present dilemma illustrated the unsatisfactory nature of the negotiating machinery. Similar embarrassments must be expectedto recur unless in the future the negotiations and settlements inEngland and Wales and in Scotland could be synchronised. It wasalso for consideration whether the Education Act, 1944, should notbe amended so as to empower the Minister, like the Secretary ofState, to modify agreed recommendations. In addition, it was most desirable that the whole salary structure for teachers in Englandand Wales should be reorganised so as to dispense with the singlebasic scale upon which it had for some years been founded.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that in the dilemma with which the Government were faced the best courseseemed to be to await the outcome of the local authorities&apos; meetingon 29th May. Meanwhile it would be as well to give furtherconsideration to the possibilities of reorganising the negotiating machinery and to warning the local authorities that, if the burnham committee submitted an agreed recommendation which theGovernment could not approve, the future of the existing machinerymight be called in question.The Cabinet (I) Invited the Minister of Education to inform themimmediately of the outcome of the meeting on 29th Mayof the local authorities&apos; side of the Burnham Committee.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Education, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to put before them in due course proposalsfor reorganising the machinery for negotiating teachers&apos;salaries.industrial disputes(previous reference:CC. (61) 26thConclusions,Minute 6)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (61) 64) about current problems of industrial relations.The Minister of Labour said that the major problem of industrial relations in recent years was the prevalence of unofficial strikes,frequently arising out of petty grievances, particularly in fourindustries-coal mining, shipbuilding and repairing, motormanufacturing and the docks. There was little scope for the Ministryof Labour to exercise its conciliatory functions openly in unofficialdisputes. Legislation against strikes would be undesirable, since itwould be strongly opposed by the trades unions and would do serious damage to industrial relations generally. Moreover there would be great practical difficulties of definition and enforcement. The bestapproach was to seek to strengthen the authority of the responsibleelements in the trade union movement, and to encourage betterindustrial relations at all levels, by improved management and greater co-operation from labour, especially in the strike-prone industries.
This policy was already achieving encouraging results. Followingdiscussions with the motor industry* there were indications that theunions were prepared to exercise their authority in unofficial strikes.In shipbuilding the recommendations of the Shipbuilding advisory councils Sub-Committee on Prospects should be pursued, and theEmployers&apos; Federation were at present working out proposals forsecuring improved relations in the industry. As regards the docks,the employers would shortly formulate a plan to provide greatercontinuity of employment, which would facilitate better relations;and steps were being taken to improve the organisation and thequality of the officials of the unions concerned. In coal mining, itwould be appropriate to seek the views of the new chairman of theNational Coal Board on industrial relations in the industry.When the result of the current law suit against officials of the electrical Trades Union became known, it would be necessary toconsider whether any further steps could be taken to deal with abusesof trades union procedures. His inclination was to avoid legislation,since this would be resented by trade unionists generally, and to use the case primarily to expose Communist influences in the movement.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The Commonwealth Secretary said that he was not convincedthat there were insuperable practical difficulties in amending tradeunion law so as to remove some of the existing protections given to workers and unions. For instance, it might be made possible forunion funds to be attached if damage could be proved as a result of astrike, whether official or unofficial, if it were supported by the union,in breach of a labour agreement.In reply, it was pointed out that the result of legislation on theselines would be to make all strikes unofficial. Unofficial strikes werein most cases not supported by the union, and rarely arose from the breach of any specific agreement. To render unions&apos; funds liable toattachment would be unfair to responsible elements in the unions andwould undoubtedly provoke deep resentment.(b) The possibility of legislation to improve the supervision oftrade union affairs ought not to be ruled out. The Electrical TradesUnion case might show that the existing powers to deal with abuseswere sufficient, and it might be decided to bring criminal proceedings.The case would provide an opportunity to consider whether theexisting powers of the Registrar of Friendly Societies to intervene in trade union affairs should be strengthened.(c) There was great variation, not only between industries butbetween firms in the same industry, in the attention given to themanagement of labour. Management study ought to be an importantsubject in technical and university education in this country, as italready was abroad. The efforts of the British Institute of management in this field should be encouraged.(cl) The problem of industrial relations was inseparable fromthat of restrictive practices in the labour field. The multiplicity ofunions was a particularly serious disadvantage. Consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of devising some means of exposingrestrictive labour practices. It would probably be undesirable, on human grounds, for these to be made subject to judicial decision, as were commercial agreements in the Restrictive Practices Court, butthey might be made the subject of enquiry by an administrative bodyanalogous to the Monopolies Commission.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate a memorandumabout&quot;the implications of the Electrical Trades Union lawsuit, when judgment had been given in that case.
(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Education, to give further consideration to the encouragement of management study.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to give further considerationto means of enquiring into restrictive practices in thelabour field.(4) Subject to the above conclusions, took note of C. (61) 64with approval.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th May, 1961.
