congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 50thConclusions.Minute 1)1. The Lord Privy Seal said that the exact terms of theprovisional agreement for a cease-fire, which appeared to have beenreached between representatives of the United Nations and theKatangan Government, were not yet known. It was understoodthat United Nations forces were to remain in their present positions,and that there was no question of the disbandment of Katanganforces. In particular, it was not clear whether the Prime Ministerof the Provincial Government of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, had accepted the condition previously proposed by the United nations that he should enter into talks with the Prime Minister of the CentralCongo Government to reach a constitutional settlement. Moreover,the United Nations secretariat had not yet approved the terms ofthe cease-fire.In view of the unsatisfactory attitude of the Prime Minister ofthe Central Congo Government, there was no point in prolonging the visit of the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs, Lord Lansdowne, and he would return to this country as soon as possible. Increasing criticism was being expressed inIndia and in a number of other Commonwealth as weil as african countries of the part which the United Kingdom Government was thought to have played in the Congo. Although this criticism wasunwarranted, and indeed arose largely from misconceptions, it wouldbe advisable for an authoritative restatement of our policy towardsthe Congo to be made without delay. This should recall our support for United Nations intervention for the purpose of achieving a united Congo by peaceful means, and should stress our anxietyfor an effective cease-fire and negotiations between Mr. Tshombeand the Central Congo Government. In view of the accusation thatthe United Kingdom was in some way responsible for the accidentin which Mr. Hammarskjoeld had been killed, it was also desirableto ensure that the enquiry which the Government of the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland had initiated should establish the truefacts in an authoritative way which would convince internationalopinion.The Prime Minister said that he had sent a message to the PrimeMinister of India in answer to his criticism; and he proposed to send a personal message, justifying our policy in the Congo, to the PrimeMinister of Nigeria.In discussion it was agreed that the Government of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland should be urged to acceptinternational assessors at the enquiry, and to consider whether the findings of the enquiry might be published under the aegis of theUnited Nations. In addition to our sending a British expert of thehighest technical experience in aircraft accidents, who would he ableto protect our own interests, we should suggest to the United Nationsauthorities that they should also appoint an independent technicalexpert, of high international repute, to participate in the enquiry.Even with these precautions, it was likely that the belief would persistthat the United Kingdom Government were in some way responsiblefor the accident.There was general agreement that a restatement of our policy towards the Congo was desirable, and that this could best be madeby the Lord Privy Seal in a speech which he was to make in his constituency that evening. This authoritative statement shouldreceive the widest publicity and should be disseminated to theCommonwealth. The Foreign Secretary would have an opportunityof speaking in similar terms in the debate at the General Assembly.The forthcoming meeting of the Commonwealth Parliamentary-Association would provide occasions on which misapprehensionsabout our attitude towards the Congo and the United Nationsoperations Ihere could be corrected.5QQIO-.3n 2
324       ^Tj*The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the Ministerof Aviation and the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations, to arrange for aBritish technical expert to be available at the enquiry into- -the accident in which Mr. Hammarskjoeld had lost hislife; to suggest to the United Nations authorities thatthey should appoint an independent technical expert tobe ready to join in the enquiry; and to arrange forrepresentations to be made to the Government of theFederation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland that they should announce that the enquiry would include internationalrepresentation, and that they should consider whether the findings of the enquiry might be made public under the aegis of the United Nations.(2* Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with the joint parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations, to prepare a restatement of UnitedKingdom policy towards the Congo and to submit it tothe Prime Minister for his approval.(3) Invited the Joint Parliamentary Under-Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations, to submit to the PrimeMinister for his approval a draft message which he mightsend to the Prime Minister of Nigeria.united nations(previous reference:CC. (61) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that it had not been possible to pursue the proposal that the new President of the General Assembly,Mr. Slim, should act as Secretary-General, since he was unwilling to accept this responsibility in the face of the opposition of the SovietHoc. Various other candidates were under consideration, and theUnited States Government were inclined to favour the appointmentof Mr. U Thant of Burma.Parliament(previous reference:CC (61) 50thConclusions.Minute 7)3. The Prime Minister said that the Leader of the opposition had asked for the recall of Parliament to discuss international affairs.He had not pressed for this to be done immediately or even in theearly part of October, but had proposed that Parliament shouldhave a proper opportunity of debating foreign affairs at some dateearlier than the opening of the new session on 31st October.In discussion there was general agreement that this suggestion was reasonable and ought to be met. An immediate meeting, apartfrom creating an undesirable impression of panic, would hardly be practicable because of the early opening at Westminster of theConference of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Itwould be possible to resume on 23rd October instead of 24th october and to rearrange the business already announced before Prorogationon 26th or 27th October; Alternatively Parliament might 1:reconvened to resume during the preceding week, with the intentionof advancing the date of Prorogation, leaving a break of a week or10 days before the opening of the new session.The Cabinet(1) Invited the Chief Whip, in the light of their discussion, toagree with the Opposition that Parliament should be recalled on 23rd October or on a convenient date in thepreceding week.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce the dateof recall in a statement to be issued that evening.
EconomicSituationPlanning(previous reference:CC. (61) 50thConclusions.Minute 6)4. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Prime Minister (C. (61) 136) covering a draft letter from theChancellor of the Exchequer to the two sides of industry. they also had before them a memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (C. (61) 138) on economic planning.The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion on the Chancellors draft letter he had given furtherconsideration to the problems which had been raised about thestanding and functions of the National Economic development council and of the office to be attached to it. It would be wrong to suppose that any form of organisation would resolve the fundamentaldifficulties of economic planning in a free society, but progress mightbe made in practical respects if the co-operation of industrialistsand the trade unions could be secured in the studies and investigationswhich the Council would promote. The object should be, not to dictate or enforce measures of economic planning, but to influence the attitudes and independent decisions of employers and unions.He had been impressed by the general welcome given by publicopinion to the Chancellors statement to Parliament that theGovernment were thinking of setting up an organisation for economic planning and, while it would be necessary to make clear from the outset that the Government would remain the final arbiter of policy,he thought it important not to inhibit unduly the initiative and independence of the Council and the planning staff.In discussion it was suggested that the planning office shouldbe responsible to the Council and not independent of it and shouldnot publish material except under the direction of the Council. there ought, however, to be nothing to prevent the office from initiatingbusiness before the Council. The office should make full use ofexisting Government and quasi-government channels but it wouldbe unnecessarily restrictive to make these the sole channels for consultation with industry.Some misgivings were expressed lest the functions and status of the Director of the office, as proposed in the draft letter, wouldbe exaggerated, to the detriment of the responsibilities which onlythe Government could exercise in the field of economic policy.It was realised that, whatever terms were used in the letter, it mightnot be possible to prevent misapprehensions of this sort. But itwas agreed that it would be helpful if the relevant part of the draftwere amended to read as follows:&quot; The effectiveness of the Councils work would depend onthe establishment of a full-time staff of the right calibre. Thisstaff, whjch would work under a Director to be appointed from outside the Civil Service, although under the aegis ofGovernment, would not be part of the ordinary government machine. It would act under the general direction of, and beresponsible to, the Council. The Government for their part would be prepared to make available from the Civil Servicean appropriate portion of the staff. I would hope that the restwould be drawn from both sides of industry, the commercialworld and elsewhere. Normally individual members of the staff would be regarded as on temporary secondment for, say, two to three years.The function of this staff would be to examine the plans for development of the main industries in the private sector and,in the light of such examination and of discussions with government Departments about other sectors of the economy,e.g., the nationalised industries, to prepare, for the considerationof the Council, studies of the kind envisaged in the second paragraph of this letter &quot;
IllCabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st September, 1961.In discussion, various other amendments to the draft were approved.The Cabinet Approved, with the amendments agreed in discussion, thedraft of the letter on economic planning which theChancellor of the Exchequer was to send to the two sides ofindustry.
