South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 9thConclusions.Minute 2)I. The Lord Privy Seal said that the proposal made by theKing of Laos, with the approval of the United States Government,for a commission of neutral countries had failed, since Cambodiaand Burma were unwilling to participate. Although the SovietGovernment might be prepared for the International control commission to reassemble in Delhi for some preliminary proceduraldiscussions, they would not allow the Commission to begin work inLaos unless some international conference had first been convened.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Law of the 2.   The Lord Privy Seal said that, on the previous day, theSea Icelandic Government had submitted for the approval of theirIcelandic        Parliament the proposed fisheries agreement under which the UnitedFisheries        Kingdom would no longer object to a 12-mile exclusive fishing zone(Previous        round Iceland and, during a transitional period of three years,Reference:      Iceland would not object to fishing by British vessels in certain partsC.C. (6!) 2nd    of the 6-12-mile zone at certain times of the year.   The baselinesConclusions,    from which these limits were to be measured had been re-drawn in minute 2)       Iceland&apos;s favour and the Icelandic Government had undertaken togive six months&apos; notice before claiming any extension of exclusive fishing rights beyond 12 miles and to accept the jurisdiction of theInternational Court of Justice in any dispute about any such claim in the future.  Immediately after the announcement by the icelandic government the above information had been released to the press in this country.  Parliament were, however, expecting a statement onthe subject and the Lord Privy Seal proposed to say, that day, that agreement had been reached with Iceland on the proposals already announced.   As soon as these had been approved by the IcelandicParliament there would be an exchange of notes between the twoGovernments, which would bring the agreement into operation.In discussion it was agreed that nothing must be done which,after the long and difficult negotiations with the icelandic government, could in any way prejudice the conclusion of an effectiveagreement. Any statement in the United Kingdom parliament should, therefore, be strictly confined at the present stage to what had already been announced to the Press and even this should besubject to confirmation that the Icelandic Government would see no objection. If, in the light of what they had put before their ownParliament, they saw any difficulty in a limited statement to the UnitedKingdom Parliament, this should be deferred.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Sea! to ascertain that the icelandic government would see no objection to an immediatestatement in the United Kingdom Parliament on theproposed fisheries agreement, on the lines of the statementalready issued to the Press.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, authorised the Lord privy seal to make such a statement that day.Europe(previous reference:C.C. (61) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)3. The Cabinet were informed that misleading accounts had appeared in the Press of the statement which the Lord Privy Seal had made on the previous day to the Council of Ministers of the western european Union about economic relations with the european economic Community. The impression had been given that theUnited Kingdom Government were now prepared to make newconcessions, and that in particular it would be open to other
Parliament 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Home Secretary said that the obstructive tactics of theOpposition on the National Health Service Bill made it necessary toobtain an allocation of time order (the &quot; guillotine &quot;). Without this it was unlikely that an effective agreement could be obtained from theOpposition to complete the Bill in that time. The &quot; guillotine &quot; wouldprobably be required also for both the Housing Bill and the national health Service Contributions Bill and, when the time came, a single&quot; guillotine &quot; motion might be introduced to cover these together.In discussion it was agreed that the application of the&quot; guillotine &quot; to the National Health Service Bill was necessary andwould be generally welcomed. The balance of opinion was, however,that it would be preferable to apply the &quot; guillotine &quot; jointly to that bill and the National Health Service Contributions Bill and toconsider whether it should be applied separately to the Housing Billimmediately after the Easter recess.The Cabinet Agreed that a motion for an allocation of time order,relating to both the National Health Service Bill and theNational Health Service Contributions Bill, should beintroduced in the following week.Minute 7)Malta 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Colonial(Previous Secretary about constitutional changes in Malta following the reportReference: of the Commission under the chairmanship of Sir Hilary BloodC.C. (58) 84th (C. (61) 26) together with a comparison of the Singapore Constitution^onclusi,ons&apos; and the Commission^ proposals (C. (61) 24).The Colonial Secretary said that doubts had been expressed inthe discussions in the Colonial Policy Committee and the DefenceCommittee about certain features of the proposals, namely the MalteseGovernmenfs concurrent powers in defence and external affairs, the delegation of authority to conclude certain international agreements,and the division of responsibilities and functions between the GovernorCommonwealth countries to discuss with the members of theCommunity possible reductions in tariff preferences which the UnitedKingdom at present enjoyed in those countries.The Lord Privy Seal said that the explanation of the government&apos;s policy which he had given to the Council did not represent any change from the position which had been taken in the recent discussions withthe German, Italian and French Governments. Certain Common-wealth Governments in any case had room to negotiate tariff reductions with other countries which left the agreed preference infavour of the United Kingdom intact; it had not been suggested thatany reductions which went beyond this would be acceptable to theUnited Kingdom except in principle as part of a comprehensive settlement with the Community which we would regard as satisfactory.He would arrange for guidance to remove any misapprehension to begiven to the Press, and he would circulate the text of his speech to theCouncil of the Western European Union to the Cabinet for their information.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.
(or Head of State) and the United Kingdom Commissioner. It had also been suggested that the proposals, and the terms in which it was proposed to announce them, would encourage the pressure for subsequent constitutional advance which would be premature havingregard to our defence interests.It was unlikely that there would be much scope for legislation by a Maltese Government on external matters other than the localimplementation of international agreements, for which the Maltesehad authority under their previous constitution; the power of aMaltese Government to legislate on other external affairs would besubject to the over-riding authority of the United KingdomGovernment. The principle of delegation was in no sense a newconcept in Colonial government, and it would be for the UnitedKingdom Government to define and control the extent of it. Inview of the fact that it had now been agreed that the governor should remain a non-Maltese at least as long as we considered itnecessary, and that he should retain in his hands the ultimate controlof the police, the proposals provided full safeguards for our defence interests. It was beyond question that the constitution proposed formaltality would be safer in these respects than the arrangementsobtaining in Singapore, where the security risk was greater.As regards subsequent constitutional development, the BloodCommission, who were precluded from making recommendationsexcept for the first stage, nevertheless thought that some indicationabout the Governments long-term intentions would greatly improve the chances of success of the new constitution. Although theGovernor of Malta would prefer that nothing should be said in thisrespect, on balance it was very desirable, in the interests of rallyingmoderate Maltese opinion, to make it clear that it was not theGovernments intention to deny to Malta, at the appropriate time, theright of self-determination. Such a statement would be consistent with the description which had been given to the United Nations ofour policy for the advancement of dependent territories.In discussion the following points were made (a) It was suggested that, although it would be both difficult and expensive, it might be possible for us to relinquish Malta and yetfulfil our defence responsibilities in the Mediterranean. But it would still be necessary to deny the facilities of Malta to the Soviet bloc and for this purpose our continued presence in the island seemedessential.(b) It was likely, though by no means certain, that Mr. Mintoffwould achieve office under the proposed constitution. Our defence facilities were so closely connected with the ordinary life of the islandthat there would be innumerable opportunities for him to beobstructive, if he so wished. It had to be accepted that, in thesecircumstances, the proposed constitution might have *o be suspendedand direct rule by the Governor reimposed.(c) The Secretary of State for Air said that the introduction of a united Kingdom Commissioner, separate from the Governor, might give rise to great difficulty. It would be for the Commissioner toover-rule the Maltese Government, although he himself would haveno power to enforce his ordinances. At the same time, theestablishment of a Commissioner would be bound to weaken to someextent the authority of the Governor, who would then be less able to rely on the loyalty of the police and civil service.It was suggested that, from this point of view, it might be preferable to reduce the Commissioner^ responsibilities by reserving the power to over-rule the Maltese Government directly to the UnitedKingdom Government, acting through the Governor, and not to their local representative.

national theatre(previous reference:C.C. (60) 61stConclusions,Minute 6)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61)25) about a National Theatre.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at their meetingon 17th November, 1960, the Cabinet had invited him to considermethods of Government assistance to the theatre which might beadopted as alternatives to the project embodied in the national theatre Act, 1949. He had since met representatives of the joint council for the National Theatre, who had put before him anambitious plan for the building of a new theatre on the South bank and the integration of the Old Vic and Shakespeare Memorial Theatrecompanies into one which would play in the new theatre atStratford-on-Avon and on tour. This plan would cost  2-3 millions for the new building and  470,000 by way of annual subsidy. It was generally endorsed by the Arts Council, who considered, however,that the annual subsidy might be substantially reduced.The Government would in any case by obliged to agree to new expenditure of some  150.000 a year on contributions through the arts Council to the building of new theatres and the renovation ofexisting theatres in the provinces. As regards additional expenditure,there were three courses open to the Government. First, to decline to finance the Joint Councils plans for a National Theatre and to confineany additional support to provincial theatres. Secondly, to accept theIt was pointed out, on the other hand, that the introduction of a commissioner would help to insulate the Governor from politicalconflict. This, indeed, had been one of the main objects of the BloodCommission and the principle might even be carried further byentrusting control of the police and the responsibility for internal security to the Commissioner rather than to the Governor. Thepresent Governor was, however, satisfied that the proposed divisionof functions between the Governor and the Commissioner would not give rise to serious difficulty.(fiO It seemed reasonably certain that, since the United KingdomGovernment were to retain the power to over-rule the maltese government, the grant of concurrent powers in defence and external affairs and-of delegated authority to conclude certain international agreements would not give Malta an &quot; independent&quot; status in international law. The opinion of the Law Officers should, however,be sought on this point.(e) It was suggested that the introduction of a United KingdomCommissioner tended to prejudge the question of subsequentconstitutional development. Unless, moreover, it was seriouslycontemplated that Malta might at some time be given the right ofself-determination, it might be unwise to indicate the possibility ofthis in any public statement. For these reasons, it might be preferable to substitute for the last three sentences of the draft reference whichthe Colonial Secretary proposed to make to the future status of Malta(in Annex C of C. (61) 26) a less specific reference to the future. this alternative would be more acceptable to the Governor.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to consider whether theproposals in C. (61) 26 would give Malta &quot; independent&quot;status for the purposes of international law.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to give further consideration,in the light of their discussion, to the proposed references to the future status of Malta in the draft statement in annex C of C. (61) 26; and to circulate a revised draft.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (61)26 at a later meeting.
CC. 10 (61)Joint Councils proposals in principle subject to further detailedscrutiny and to scaling down of the estimates of cost. This wassuperficially attractive but the cost would be high and the Exchequermight well become involved in an open commitment to meet anydeficits with which the National Theatre was faced. The third coursewould be to increase the present subventions to the Old Vic and theShakespeare Memorial Theatre and to work towards the formationof a National Theatre Company, which should be developed before any decision was taken to build a new theatre. Meanwhile the sitereserved for the theatre on the South Bank should, if possible, be keptavailable for the purpose. He was inclined to favour this course,although it would be necessary to devise some strict form of controlover the financial relations between the Government, the two theatresand the Arts Council.In a preliminary discussion it was suggested that there was muchto be said for concentrating whatever resources were available on theprovinces in preference to London, and that the first course putforward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer was therefore the bestline of approach.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (61)25 at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th February, 1961.
