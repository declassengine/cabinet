Middle East 2.  The Cabinet were informed that the military situation in kuwait Kuwait was satisfactory.   British forces were now deployed in(Previous       sufficient strength, and there was no indication of an imminent IraqiReference:      attack.  The political situation was becoming more difficult.   OurCC. (61) 38th military intervention was subject to increasing criticism, especiallyConclusions)    from Arab countries, and the presence of our forces was puttingsome strain on our relations with the Kuwaitis.  In the debate inthe Security Council our action had been condemned by therepresentatives of the Soviet Union and the United Arab Republic,but there was some chance that the upshot would be a reasonableresolution calling for consideration of the type of United nations force which would be most suitable to maintain the independence of Kuwait.  Meanwhile, the Egyptians had allowed a substantial forceof British warships to pass through the Suez Canal.The Minister of Defence said that plans were being preparedfor the gradual withdrawal of some of the British forces from Kuwait,as circumstances allowed. In the longer term, the right course mightbe to leave a considerable quantity of equipment and heavy weapons in Kuwait, under conditions which would prevent their being usedwithout our authority, and to limit British land forces there to one battalion which would guard the airfield. This, together with a token United Nations force, and some increase in the local Kuwaitiforces, should suffice to maintain the integrity of the territory.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.South-East 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that, while the cease-fire in LaosAsia Treaty was being generally observed, no progress was being made towardsOrganisation a political settlement. The three Laotian princes were to meet againLaos in two weeks&apos; time, but there was little hope that they would agree(Previous on the formation of a national Government.

The Foreign Secretary said that it was proposed in the nextfew days to despatch replies from the Government of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and France to the aide-memoire on berlin which Mr. Khrushchev had presented to President Kennedyin Vienna. These replies would make it clear that, while the western governments were prepared to negotiate for a settlement of theSECRETParliament 1.

Berlin problem, they would not do so on the basis that their rights in West Berlin could be abrogated unilaterally, as the SovietGovernment purported to be able to do by signing a peace treaty with the East German Government.The Cabinet-Took note with approval of this statement by the foreign secretary.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster-General (C. (61) 91) on the development of nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.The Paymaster-General said that the tenders which, inaccordance with the Cabinefs decision of 17th December, 1959,Reference: had been invited from five British firms for a complete merchantC.C. (59) 64th nuclear propulsion unit had now been examined by an expertConclusions. committee, which had also considered reports by the Atomic EnergyMinute 5) Authority on the studies which they had independently undertakenabout the feasibility of marine nuclear propulsion. this examination had shown that, while it would be technically feasible to build a nuclear ship now, such a ship could not with existingtechniques be developed to operate as economically as a shippowered by conventional means. A Sub-committee of the economic policy Committee had therefore recommended that a nuclearmerchant ship should not now be built, but that a vigorous research and development programme should be undertaken with the objectof producing an economic marine nuclear propulsion unit as soonas possible. The cost of such a programme might be some  25millions over six years; but it would not be necessary initially to commit the Government to expenditure of more than  3-4 millions to determine whether marine nuclear propulsion would be likely tobe worth while. The Sub-committee had also recommended thatwe should at the same time co-operate, without commitment, in the studies of the European Nuclear Energy Agency, which was atpresent examining the possibility of a European marine nuclear propulsion project. The research and development programme forthe marine nuclear propulsion unit should be carried out by the atomic Energy Authority in conjunction with industry, but it shouldbe distinct from the Authority&apos;s existing research and development programme. Nearly a year had elapsed since the tenders for amarine nuclear propulsion unit had been received and it was desirable that the Minister for Transport should make an early announcement to Parliament, if possible before the summer recess,on the lines of the draft in the Annex to C. (61) 91.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not yetconvinced that it was justifiable in our present economic circumstances to incur expenditure on the scale proposed. He was also unwilling to consider this point in isolation from the forthcoming review ofthe other expenditure of the Atomic Energy Authority on research and development. The Authority&apos;s proposals, which had just beenreceived, envisaged expenditure on civil research and development projects of about  50 millions a year. In addition at least  6 millions a year would be spent by the National Institute for Research inNuclear Science. The Authority so far envisaged spending only 150,000 a year on civil marine nuclear propulsion, which indicated that they did not attach a high priority to this project.Discussion showed that there was general agreement that theGovernment should not at present authorise the construction of a nuclear merchant ship. It was also agreed that, although there were strong arguments for competing with other countries in the field of marine nuclear propulsion, the amount of expenditure on researchAtomicEnergyNuclearMerchantShip(Previous,j
&quot;   243&apos; 0 SECRET 5C.C. 39 (61)and development for this purpose should not be decided apart fromthe review of the Authority&apos;s civil research and development programme as a whole. It was to be hoped that this review wouldbe completed in time for a statement to be made on marine nuclear propulsion before the summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the construction of a nuclear merchant shipshould not be authorised at present.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister for Science, to proceed with the review ofthe civil research and development programme of the atomic Energy Authority.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at afurther meeting later in the month.LocalGovernmentOrganisationGreaterLondon(previous reference :C.C. (57) 49thConclusions,Minute 8)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and Eocal Government and the Minister of Education(C. (61) 85 and 90) about the report of the Royal Commission on local Government in Greater London.The Minister of Housing said that the Royal Commission had reached the conclusion, which he fully accepted, that the present structure of local government in Greater London, which had been devised in the totally different circumstances of the late 19th century,was now administratively inefficient and had led to the gradualdevitalisation of representative government throughout the area.The Commission had recommended that certain functions notablytown planning, traffic, main roads and overspill which needed tobe planned and operated over the area as a whole, should be madethe responsibility of a directly elected Greater London Council,whose area would comprise the counties of London and Middlesexand parts of Essex, Kent, Surrey and Hertfordshire. It was furtherrecommended that this authority should have certain concurrentpowers, particularly in relation to education; but that, subject to this,all the remaining functions should be exercised by borough councilswhich would be the primary units of local government. TheCommission had provisionally proposed that the existing 95authorities should be reduced bv amalgamations to 52, with a population range of about 80,000 &quot;to 250,000.From preliminary consultations with the interests concerned itappeared that, while there was general agreement that the present structure could not be allowed to remain unaltered, there was somedivision of opinion about the solution recommended by the RoyalCommission. Among the Ministers departmental concerned, itwas generally agreed that certain functions must be exercised by asingle executive authority responsible for the area as a whole, butthat the boroughs into which the area was to be divided should be larger, and therefore fewer in number, than had been recommended.He had come to the conclusion that, subject to some special arrangement for the education service, the area should be dividedinto some 40 boroughs each having a minimum population of about200,000. He suggested that, subject to this modification, theGovernment should accept the report of the Royal Commission inprinciple, and should set out their conclusions in a White Paper, tobe published before the end of the year, with a view to renewedpublic discussion and legislation in the Session of 1962-63. On thattime-table the new authorities would be elected in the autumn of1964 and assume their responsibilities in April 1965.
The Minister of Education saw great difficulty in accepting theRoyal Commission^ recommendation that there should be a two-tier system of education under which all responsibility for policy and planning would rest with a Greater London Council and the localauthorities would be responsible only for the day-to-day operationof the service. Experience had shown, for example in Middlesex,that such a system was unsatisfactory. On the other hand theeducation service in the Greater London area now envisaged couldnot be handled satisfactorily either by the Council for the whole area or by the boroughs, even if the latter were enlarged to the extentproposed by the Minister of Housing and Local Government. Theproblem was especially difficult in London, where the siting of theexisting schools and institutions of further education had been determined by considerations other than borough boundaries. Thepolicy of establishing links between the secondary schools and further education would be frustrated by the multiplication of educationauthorities, and the consequent curtailment of the free choice of school would provoke ill-feeling among parents. He therefore proposed that the Greater London authority should have no educationfunctions at all; that for the central London area, with a populationof at least 1 -1 millions and preferably 11 to 2 millions, there shouldbe a single education authority constituted as a joint board of the borough councils in the area, which would inherit the nucleus of theLondon County Council service; and that outside the central area the borough councils should be similarly combined for the purposesof education into joint boards, each dealing with copulations of theorder of 300,000 to 400,000.Discussions showed that, except for education, the general pattern recommended by the Royal Commission was acceptable tothe Cabinet. It was the only satisfactory basis for dealing with town planning, traffic and certain other functions, although it would be unwelcome in the county areas which would be absorbed into theGreater London area.On the number and size of the boroughs, however, there was some division of opinion. The amalgamations of existing authoritiesrecommended by the Royal Commission must be expected to meet with strong local resistance, and this would be stronger if theGovernment were to propose an even greater degree of amalgamation.On the other hand, the larger boroughs proposed by the Minister of housing and Local Government would make more satisfactory units for the local health and welfare services (although it would be preferable that no rigid maximum size should be adopted) andresistance to amalgamation would be mitigated by the grant of the greatly increased powers and responsibilities which the localauthorities had desired for many years.In further discussion on the education service, the disadvantages of a two-tier system and the case for establishing joint boards on thelines proposed by the Minister of Education were generally recognised.Misgivings were, however, expressed about the effects of dismantlingthe London County Council education service, which was widelyacknowledged to be a good one. It was also suggested that to deprive the Greater London Council of all responsibility for education mightleave them with functions inadequate both in quality and quantity.On the other hand, the plan as a whole was likely to be more acceptable to the borough councils if the Greater London authority had no education functions. The other functions of the greater london authority would involve a great deal of important work and,if too many duties were entrusted to it, people still in active life wouldbe unable to serve as members. A compromise by which the greater london Council became the education authority for a central areaalone had certain attractions and might be further examined.Whatever decision was ultimately reached on the education service should be applied also to the organisation of the youth employment service.

CoventGardenMarket(previous reference :C.C. (61) 59thConclusions,Minute 9)7. The Lord President said that, on 3rd July, the House of Lords,in the Committee stage of the Covent Garden Bill, had adopted bya narrow majority an amendment which would empower the newMarket Authority to propose, and the Minister of Agriculture to order, that the market should be rebuilt in an area other than covent garden itself. Not only was this incompatible with the whole structure and intention of the Bill but the Bill as thus amended would almost certainly be held not to comply with Standing Orders forhybrid legislation. The Lord President therefore proposed, afterconsultation with the Minister of Agriculture, that the Governmentshould seek to have the amendment removed on the Report stage of the Bill.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the lord president.South-West 8.   The Lord Chancellor said that the South-West AfricaAfrica Committee of the United Nations Organisation had sought permission(Previous       to visit Bechuanaland, where there were settled a number of peopleReference:      whose origins were in South-West Africa, and had made requests forCM. (56) 20th transport and other equipment and supplies for the purpose of a visitConclusions,    to the yrust Territory.   Visas for Bechuanaland had been grantedMinute 7)       an(j ^ facjiities promised on the understanding that the Committeewould not enter the Trust Territory without the permission of theSouth African Government as the administering power.   We had,however, been unable to secure a written undertaking to this effect and there was reason to believe that the Committee, who were expected to arrive in Salisbury on the following day and inBechuanaland very shortly thereafter, intended to proceed to thefrontier of South-West Africa, where their presence was likely to leadto disorder. The Lord Chancellor therefore proposed that, unless asatisfactory undertaking could be obtained before the Committeeleft Salisbury, their visas for Bechuanaland should be cancelled.In discussion it was recognised that to refuse the Committeefacilities for a visit to Bechuanaland, to which in itself there couldbe no objection, would give rise to hostile criticism in the united nations.   On the other hand, to make it possible for them to enterSumming up, the Prime Minister said that it appeared to be thegeneral view of the Cabinet that, except as regards education, theGovernment should accept the main pattern proposed by the RoyalCommission. No final decision should, however, be taken until further consideration had been given to the size and number of thenew boroughs and to the whole question of the organisation of theeducation service, in relation both to the proposed Greater london council and to the new boroughs. This would probably make itdifficult to publish a White Paper before the summer recess.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Housing and Local Government and Ministerof Education, the Minister of Transport and the Minister ofHealth, to give further consideration in the light of their discussion to the proposals in C. (61) 85 and 90 for there organisation of local government in Greater London; andto bring the matter again before them as soon as possible.
South-West Africa from a territory for which we were responsiblemust be expected to involve us in great difficulty with the SouthAfrican Government over the status and future of the high commission Territories. Since we were to some extent already committed by our demand for an undertaking that the Committeewould not enter South-West Africa without the permission of theSouth African Government, the course proposed by the LordChancellor seemed on balance to be right. It should be explained tothe United Nations authorities that any attempt on the part of theCommittee to enter South-West Africa without permission was likelyto provoke incidents on the frontier and that this would not be inthe interests of the people of Bechuanaland, for whom we were responsible.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to instruct the United Kingdom HighCommissioner in Salisbury to inform the South-West AfricaCommittee of the United Nations that, unless they gave a specific undertaking not to enter South-West Africa fromBechuanaland without the permission of the South african government, their visas for Bechuanaland would be cancelled.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th July, 1961.
