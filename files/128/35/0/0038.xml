East.Kuwait.(previous reference:CC. (61) 37thConclusions,Minute 2).The Prime Minister said that in the course of 30th Juneinformation had been received which indicated that Iraqi forces were making preparations which would enable them to launch an attackon Kuwait at short notice. He had therefore decided, in consultationwith the Ministers most directly concerned, that the United kingdom should respond to the request for assistance which had been made bythe Ruler of Kuwait by placing at his disposal certain British forces.The first contingents, including No. 42 Royal Marine Commando, a squadron of Centurion tanks and ten Hunter aircraft, had arrived in kuwait on the morning of 1st July and the build-up of forces had continued over the week-end. There had been a serious risk thatIraqi forces might have occupied the city of Kuwait in the course ofthe night of 30th June, thus making our intervention much morehazardous, and the position of our forces had remained somewhatprecarious during the period of build-up throughout the nights oflst-2nd and 2nd-3rd July. Some delay had been caused by the initialrefusal of the Turkish Government to allow military aircraft to overflytheir territory en route for Kuwait; but permission had eventuallybeen granted, for night flights only, shortly before midnight on30th June. Our forces in Kuwait had now reached a strength whichshould enable them to deal with the likely scale of attack, and furtherunits would arrive over the next few days. H.M.S. Bulwark would remain in the vicinity of Kuwait for the next few days and wouldprovide the main source of logistic support for the force until stockscould be built up on land. Special precautions had been taken tolessen the possibility of her being attacked by night by Iraqi motortorpedo boats, some of which might be manned by Russiantechnicians. When the aircraft carrier H.M.S. Victorious arrived inthe Persian Gulf on 7th-8th July, she would be able to provide a greatly improved measure of air cover for our naval and supplyoperations. The whole movement had been smoothly conducted,and the Services had been quick to adapt their pre-arranged plans totake account of changes caused by the short notice at which theoperation was mounted and by the difficulties encountered over rightsof overflying.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation might develop inone of two ways. If, as their Foreign Minister had stated, theGovernment of Iraq had no intention of using force to pursue their claim to Kuwait, the situation would be the subject of internationaldebate and it would be necessary to retain our forces in Kuwait untilother arrangements, possibly the provision of a United Nations force,could be made to guarantee its security. Meanwhile increasingcriticism of our military presence in Kuwait might be expected fromother Arab States. If, on the other hand, the Iraqis were determined to use force, it was possible that they would do so during the courseof the next two weeks when their army could be assembled undercover of the preparations for the celebration of Independence Day.There were, indeed, some grounds for thinking that they had beenplanning to make an attack at that time, and that General Qassimhad been surprised into premature action by the conclusion of our agreement with Kuwait on 19th June. It was. however, unlikely,though not impossible, that an attack would occur while the subject was under debate by the Security Council. No reports had yet beenreceived of reactions within Iraq, though there was clearly some riskof action against British lives and property. The Governments ofthe other Commonwealth countries and of the United States, whohad been informed beforehand of our action, had supported it.The Minister of Defence said that climatic conditions in Kuwaitwere most severe and it would be necessary to relieve units at frequent intervals if the force were required to remain there for a long period.Fortunately H.M.S. Bulwark had air-conditioned accommodation and an air-conditioned hospital was available in Bahrain.   The
operation had demonstrated both the value of amphibious forces in providing military assistance at relatively short notice and the political difficulties which might be expected in obtaining overflying rights,even from allies, when there was a risk of actual hostilities.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,3rd July, 1961.
