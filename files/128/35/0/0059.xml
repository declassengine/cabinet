2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 175) describing the stages reached in various aspectsof Allied planning for possible contingencies in Berlin.Allied Access to East BerlinThe Foreign Secretary said that the latest difficulty had arisenfrom the insistence of the East German police that United states officials who were entitled to free access to East Berlin should showtheir documents before entering. British officials with similar rightshad for some years past been willing, if requested, to indicate thatthey held documents. There was now some prospect that this difficulty might be overcome by requiring Russian officials to showtheir documents on entry to West Berlin and at the same time reducingto one trie number of points of access open to them.In discussion some concern was expressed at the military measures taken by the United States authorities in Berlin in response to this action by the East German police. This had produced a dangerous situation in which Russian tanks faced American tanks in the cityat very short range. To the extent that it was one of the objects ofthe Allies to demonstrate that the Russians remained responsible forEast Berlin, this action had been successful, but it was disturbing thatsuch a dangerous situation had been allowed to develop over a minorpoint of procedure on which the Allies were not in accord. Thedifficulties arose to some extent from the special powers which werebeing exercised in Berlin by General Clay.Access to BerlinThe Foreign Secretary said that the most important aspects ofthis contingency planning were those for dealing with the closing ofair or land access to Berlin from Western Germany. Agreement hadbeen reached with General Norstad, Supreme Allied Commander,Europe, that, if a civil aircraft were subjected to interference by east german or Russian fighters, it should return to its starting point anda civil aircraft manned by a military crew and escorted by fighterswould then fly over the same course. If this second aircraft were attacked, the fighters would return fire. This procedure would beadopted without prior reference to Governments. A similar planmust now be made for dealing with interference to our aircraft fromthe ground. General Norstad had proposed that in this case also a,second civil plane should be sent out escorted by fighters, which shouldbe authorised to attack any ground station which fired on it.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were doubtful about the expediency of authorising automatic retaliation against groundtargets. If civil aircraft were attacked with surface-to-air guided weapons they would certainly be destroyed and we should be facedwith war if we intervened to restore the situation by force. attack by anti-aircraft guns on the other hand would clearly be intendedonly as a warning, to which it would be inappropriate to reply, by action which would make the West the aggressor. It should be made clear to General Norstad that in these circumstances we could not agree to fire being opened by Allied aircraft without specific political authority.The Foreign Secretary said that, if access by the autobahn wereblocked, General Norstad&apos;s plan was to despatch along it a smalltripartite force equipped with a few vehicles and bulldozers to removeGermanyBerlin(previous references :C.C.

2msecret . ;,;obstacles. Its object would be to compel the East Germans orRussians to fire first; it would not itself open fire until attacked andthen only for the purpose of covering its withdrawal. Its purpose would be to provide a demonstration of protest against the denial of access and to identify the intentions of the East. It was important that Western reaction should be immediate, since it was possible thatthe East Germans might announce that the road was blocked simplyin order to test our reactions; and it would not be practicable to insist on prior political authority before the despatch of the force.The operation was being planned and would be controlled by GeneralCassels, Commander-in-Chief, Northern Army Group, who could be instructed to inform Ministers immediately the need for the operationarose. Current plans represented a considerable improvement onthe earlier conception of operations to be undertaken by a much larger force.In discussion there was general agreement that this course couldbe approved, provided that the Minister of Defence was satisfiedabout the size and composition of the force.
2$ IANegotiations with the Soviet Union*The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and the United States were now agreed on the desirabilityof early negotiations with the Soviet Government on the problemof Berlin and on the substance of the aims which should be pursued in such negotiations.  It was recognised that we should have to beprepared, as part of a satisfactory settlement, to  accept theOder-Neisse frontier and de facto recognition of the East GermanGovernment, to agree that West Germany would neither manufacturenor be given full control of nuclear weapons, and to support theestablishment of a substantial United Nations presence in west berlin. We should expect in return Soviet guarantees of allied access to West Berlin, which might be recorded in any peace treaty the SovietGovernment might make with the East German Government.  Sucha treaty should be registered with the United Nations.  The FrenchGovernment were still, however,  opposed to the  opening  of negotiations and had declined to be associated with the currentattempts to find a basis for negotiation.  Their view was that, asthe Soviet Government wished to avoid war, they would restrain theEast German authorities from taking any action which entailed a risk of war, and that it would accordingly be preferable for the west to await developments.   They believed that negotiations would inevitably result in some concessions by the Western Powers andthey considered that such concessions might be smaller, and wouldbe more easily justified to public opinion, if they were made undera more immediate threat of war. The position of the West GermanGovernment would not be clearly defined until a new Governmenthad been formed.   There was some prospect that the politicaldeadlock in Bonn might be resolved within the next week. It wouldthen be possible for President Kennedy to try to persuade the Headof the new German Government that the Western Powers shouldinitiate negotiations for a realistic settlement of the Berlin problem.The French attitude was dangerous, since it might result in our having to negotiate on the brink of war and it was certainly arguable that it would then be even more difficult to reach an acceptablesettlement.    If the immediate problem of the Friedrichstrassecrossing into East Berlin could be settled, it might be possible forthe United States Ambassador in Moscow to proceed to probe theRussian position, but in doing so he could act only on behalf ofthe United States Government and not for the other Powers.Unfortunately, the most recent speeches by Mr. Khrushchev andMr. Gromyko had been discouraging, and it was also disquietingthat the Soviet Government now seemed ready to extend the areaof threat, for instance by their recent approaches to Finland andtheir troop movements near the Persian border.In discussion the following points were made:(a) In addition to the concessions mentioned, it was probablethat the Soviet Government would insist that West Berlin shouldnot be regarded as in any sense a part of West Germany and that itshould not be used for any activities directed against the Soviet bloc.(b) The negotiating position of the Western Powers was weak,because their position in West Berlin was militarily indefensible. Themain Soviet objective was to foster differences within the North* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET60060-4 k ?
Atlantic Alliance and they might prefer to do this by exploiting the uncertainties of the present situation rather than by bringing the crisisto a head.(c) It must be apparent to the French Government that theWestern Powers would eventually be compelled to make some concessions. It seemed to be their object to place the responsibilityfor these on the Governments of the United States and the UnitedKingdom. It was suggested that greater efforts might be made inthe North Atlantic Council to impress on the French Governmentthe dangers of delaying negotiations.(d) There might be advantage in direct discussions between thenew Government of Western Germany and the Soviet Government,though there was less chance that these might be successful ifDr. Adenauer remained Chancellor.   There were some signs thatthe West Germans were now more ready to accept a formula whichwas tantamount to de facto recognition of the East GermanGovernment.  The West German Defence Minister had also statedthat they would not use force to effect their aim of reunifyingGermany.   It would be valuable in securing a settlement if a joint declaration could be made by the Western Powers to the effect thatthere should be no alteration of the frontiers of Germany by forceand that, if and when Germany were finally united, they would recognise the Oder-Neisse line as the eastern frontier of a unitedGermany.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that itshould be our prime objective to maintain the cohesion of the north atlantic Alliance. It could be argued that, from this point of view,the attitude of the French Government was logical, since it seemedevident that no settlement could be achieved without some form of recognition of the East German Government and the Oder-Neisseline, and to force either of these upon the West German government at present might well produce a split in the Alliance; while, on theother hand, if we were to allow events to take their course, the WestGermans would eventually become reconciled to the realities of that position without being in a position to blame their allies for it. Butthis view disregarded the great dangers of delay. There would begrave risk in allowing the situation to deteriorate without someattempt at negotiation. This applied particularly to the UnitedKingdom, since our financial stability depended largely on confidence.The best course would be for the West Germans themselves to takethe initiative in approaching the Soviet Government. In default ofthat, we should continue to seek Four-Power agreement to the initiation of negotiations. If the Governments of the United Kingdomand the United States proposed negotiations against the wishes ofFrance and Germany, this might lead to a split in the Alliance;indeed, from that point of view, an initiative by the United Kingdomalone might be less objectionable to the French than an Anglo-Saxoninitiative. The next practical step was for further preliminarysoundings to be made in Moscow on behalf of the United StatesGovernment, and for the results of such soundings to be consideredby a meeting of the Foreign Ministers of the four Western Powers.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Prime Minister and of the points made in thediscussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to resist any proposal toauthorise attacks on ground targets in Eastern germany without prior reference to Governments.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultationwith the Foreign Secretary, whether any adjustmentsshould be proposed in the size and composition of the
Nuclear Tests(previous reference :CC. (61) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)Effect onHealthProgramme,19623. The Minister of Housing said that he had been asked by the Prime Minister to consider whether some official statement should be made to re-assure the public in this country about thehazards to health arising from fall-out from the recent Soviet nuclear tests and about the Governments readiness to take precautionaryaction if circumstances made this necessary. He was satisfied that,as a result of the statements already made on behalf of theGovernment and the information published by a number of scientificauthorities, public opinion was reasonably re-assured. Even so, hethought it desirable to make available to the public through bodies concerned with health and welfare a simple factual description ofthe effects of radio-active fall-out on health, and a draft statement for this purpose was being prepared by the Government agenciesconcerned. It would be appropriate that this factual statement should be made by the Minister for Science, in reply to a WrittenQuestion in Parliament, and it could then be publicised through the government&apos;s information organisation.Whether any Government action would be required (such as thedistribution of dried milk for children less than a year old) would depend on the extent and rate of fall-out from the large tests recentlycarried out by the Soviet Government. It would be two or threeweeks before the effects of this fall-out and scientific findings about it would be available.In discussion it was urged that the factual explanation of thehazards to health of radio-active fall-out should be made availableto the public as soon as possible. Many people were confused aboutthe tolerable levels of radio-active iodine, since they did not understand that a dose of considerably more than the tolerable yearlyaverage could be accepted over a short period. It was important that uncertainty on this point should be cleared up, particularly inview of the variation in radio-active iodine levels in different regions.In this connexion the Cabinet were informed that plans for thedistribution of dried milk could be put into effect on a regional basis.This action should not, however, be taken without scientific advice that it was justified.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister for Science, in consultation with theMinister of Housing, to arrange for a factual statement to be made about the hazards to health from radio-activefall-out.*The Prime Minister said that the United States Government had decided to continue the development and production of the airborneballistic missile (SKYBOLT) with which our strategic bomber force was eventually to be equipped. It had always been envisaged that,in service with the Royal Air Force, this missile would have a british war-head; and a design had been prepared which should providea war-head more efficient and more safe than that designed for use force intended for the probe along the autobahn if roadaccess to Berlin were blocked.(4) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister ofTransport and the President of the Board of Trade toinform the Foreign Secretary which economic counter-measures might be suitable for automatic applicationwithout previous reference to Ministers.
The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the United States Government should be askedto include a test of the British device for a war-head forSKYBOLT in the series of underground nuclear testswhich they were to hold in the early part of 1962.*4. The Prime Minister recalled that, when the Cabinet had discussed on 10th October the question of The Queen&apos;s forthcoming visit to Ghana, they had agreed to review this again, nearer the timeof her departure, in the light of any further developments in the localsituation. Since then the head of the Special Branch of theMetropolitan Police had, by arrangement with President Nkrumah,made a special visit to Ghana; and the security authorities in thiscountry had also been asked to submit an appreciation of the risks to the personal safety of The Queen which this visit might entail.He had carefully considered the results of these further enquiries, andhe was satisfied that they disclosed no new information orconsiderations which affected the provisional conclusion which theCabinet had reached on 10th October. He and the commonwealth secretary were satisfied that the political situation in Ghana wouldnot entail any substantial additional risk to The Queen&apos;s personalsafety.The Cabinet discussed at some length the risks to which the queen might be exposed by this journey and the means by whichthese might be mitigated. This discussion confirmed their earlierconclusion that there were no sufficient grounds for advising her majesty to cancel this visit on account of the personal risks whichit might involve.In further discussion, however, attention was drawn to reportsnow circulating in London that Ghana might decide to withdraw from the Commonwealth after The Queerfs visit. These reports were based in part upon the assumption that a White Paper now in preparation in Accra on the causes of the recent strikes at Takoradiwould include allegations that these strikes had been instigated byBritish agencies. The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had some reason to believe that political factions in Ghana which were opposed to the continuance of the Commonwealth connexion might seek to give currency to unfounded allegations that these strikes hadbeen fomented by British agencies. He was, however, satisfied that president Nkrumah himself had no wish to sever the Commonwealthconnexion.It was recalled that, when the possibility of a Royal visit to Ghanahad first been raised in 1958, President Nkrumah had been very frank :;in disclosing his plans for introducing a Republican form of constitution in Ghana. It was therefore for consideration whether he should now be asked, in connexion with The Queen&apos;s forthcoming visit, whether he had any immediate intention of proposing any further constitutional change in Ghana. &apos;Ghana(previous reference:CC. (61) 55thConclusions,Minute 4)The Queen&apos;sVisitby the United States Air Force. In order to prove this war-headit would be necessary to carry out a low-yield nuclear test, whichcould be made underground. It was therefore proposed that theUnited States Government should be asked to include this test, asa joint project, in the series of underground tests which was to beheld in the United States in the early part of 1962. There would beno need to make any public statement about this test until shortly before it was made.
commercial policy(previous reference:C.C. (61) 47thConclusions,Minute 3)Japan5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (61) 173) about the trade negotiations with Japan.The President of the Board of Trade said that the negotiations had reached a critical stage and that it would be necessary to make further concessions if we were to avoid Japanese discrimination against our exports. United Kingdom exporters had benefited morethan had been expected from the liberalisation of Japanese imports which had so far taken place, and the increase in our trade had greatlyexceeded the increase in our imports of Japanese goods. It was important that we should be able to consolidate this improvement and to benefit from the further measure of liberalisation which japan would introduce in December. He therefore proposed to improveon the offers previously made to the Japanese to the extent indicatedin Annex A of C. (61) 173. This would mean that a number of commodities (artificial pearls, pencils, ships and boats, umbrellas,motor scooters and electron microscopes) would be placed on open general Licence and that further increases would be made in the quotas for a number of other items of particular interest to theJapanese. The Economic Policy Committee had considered theseproposals and had recommended that these further concessions should now be made.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in C. (61) 173.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1961.The Cabinet (1) Re-affirmed their earlier decision that there were no sufficientgrounds for advising The Queen to cancel her forthcoming visit to Ghana on the ground that her personal safetywould be endangered.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to consider whether PresidentNkrumah should be invited to give an assurance, beforeThe Queen&apos;s visit, that he had no immediate intentionof proposing any further constitutional change in Ghana.
