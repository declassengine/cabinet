2. The Cabinet were informed that the Committee of 100were planning to stage on 9th December demonstrations against theuse of bases in this country by the United States Strategic Air Force.Large numbers of demonstrators were intending to present themselves on that day at the United States Headquarters at Ruislip and at theair stations at Wethersfield and Brize Norton. There was a risk thatserious incidents might occur, especially if the demonstrators tried to interfere with aircraft armed with nuclear bombs or with the bombstores.The Secretary of State for Air said that no great difficulty was likely to arise at Ruislip, which was an administrative headquarters.At the two air stations elaborate precautions had been taken, inconsultation with the United States authorities. It had been agreedthat the Royal Air Force should be responsible for guarding the perimeter fence, and large numbers of the Royal Air Force Regimentwould be deployed for this purpose. If any of the demonstratorssucceeded in gaining access to the airfield, forceful action (includingthe use of fire hoses and police dogs) would be taken to prevent them from approaching bombed-up aircraft or bomb stores. It was only if they attempted to interfere with these that United States personnel would be directly involved; and it was hoped that the Royal AirForce Regiment would be able to prevent that situation from arising.The Attorney-General said that these installations wereprohibited places under the Official Secrets Act, and thedemonstrations planned by the Committee of 100 would thereforeinvolve offences under the Act. As a result of searches made by thepolice on the previous day at the headquarters of the Committee andat the homes of some of its leading members, evidence might become available which would warrant the immediate arrest of some of themain organisers of the demonstrations on charges of conspiracy to commit those offences. In addition, he had advised the local policethat he would be ready to authorise proceedings under the Actagainst persons who tried to force their wav into these air stations;and he hoped that, with this knowledge, the police might be able to arrest some of the ringleaders at an early stage in the demonstrations.Notices drawing attention to the provisions of the -\ct had beenprominently displayed around the perimeter fencec.In discussion the following points were made.(a) It would be made plain, in the course of the reply to a private notice Question in the House of Commons that afternoon, thatthese demonstrations would involve offences under the official secrets Act. - ,(h) The United States Ambassador in London had undertaken to see that the officers in charge of the United States squadrons at these two air stations were aware of the political dangers of any direct clash between their men and the demonstrators.(ri It would be useful if loudspeaker vans could be available on the airfields to assist in controlling the movements of any personswho might succeed in gaining access to them.NuclearDisarmament(previous reference:CC. (61) 50thConclusions,Minute 8)Demonstrationsat AirfieldsParliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Christmas recess on21st December and would re-assemble on 23rd January.Before the House of Commons rose for the recess time wouldprobably have to be found for two general debates, one on foreignaffairs and the other on the economic situation.
3. The Cabinet had before them three alternative drafts of statements to the employers&apos; side of the National Joint Council for local Authorities&apos; Fire Brigades. The first related to a settlementfrom 8th December, the second to a settlement from 1st January andthe third to a settlement from 1st January with the addition of a reference to the withholding of general grant.The Prime Minister said that a settlement from 8th Decemberwould have to be justified on the ground that the settlement for london and Middlesex which would date from 13th July had createdan obligation to award consequential increases elsewhere, that the gap between 13th July and 8th December was substantial and thatit would not be reasonable to expect the men to wait longer. Theadvantage of 1st January was that it was consistent with awardsalready made in the vVages Council field in which there had been an element of pre-pause commitment. The advantage of including a reference to the general grant was that the grant was available as asanction by which the Government might impose their views on thelocal authorities and they would be expected to invoke it.The following points were made in discussion:(a) A settlement on 8th December would be bound to have repercussions on other claims now pending, since it could not berepresented as flowing exclusively from the pre-pause commitment.It should for this reason be rejected.(/;) The view was reaffirmed that 1st February need not beconsidered as an alternative date. There would be little money tobe saved by a month&apos;s postponement, and the date had no significancein itself. The only practicable alternative date to 1st January wouldbe 2nd April. This, however, had been used for awards into which no pre-pause element had entered and would for that reason do lessthan justice to the firemen&apos;s case.(c) To withhold general grant would involve London andMiddlesex as well as the other counties and might result in a greaterburden on rate-payers and the injection of the argument into localpolitics Nevertheless the threat should be used. It would be taken as a sign of weakness on the Government^ part if it were not used.Moreover, it was possible that without this threat the employersmight settle for 30th October.The Cabinet then considered the draft of a statement basedon a settlement date of 1st January, with the inclusion of a referenceto general grant, and agreed that their views should be transmitted to the employers&apos; side of the National Joint Council in the following terms:&quot;The Government recognise that the offer made by the&apos;local authorities to firemen in London and Middlesex on13th July implies an element of pre-pausc commitment also to(d) Many of the demonstrators were to travel to London bymotor-buses. It might be possible to prevent this, either by warningthe owners of the &apos;buses that they would be contributing to thecommission of offences under the Official Secrets Act or by dispersingthe &apos;buses from their pre-arranged assembly points in London.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the arrangements for containing thedemonstrations which were to be made on 9th Decemberat Ruislip, Wethersfield and Brize Norton.(2) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of transport to&quot; consider what steps could be taken to discourage the&apos;bus companies concerned from transporting personsintending to take part in these demonstrations.
Wages Policy 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellor(Previous of the Fxcheque? (C. (61) 202) and the Minister of TransportReferences: (C. (61) 207) and a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C. (61) 205)C.G (61) 67th covering a draft statement prepared by officials on a policy for conclusions. wages, salaries and other incomes.Minute 4 and cc. (61) 49th The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there seemed to be conclusions. general agreement that he should make an early statement, even ifMinute 6) onlv an jntcrim one, about the future of the policy of ensuring apause in increases of wages and salaries. The policy in its present form was likely to be eroded by wage settlements already made ordue to be made in the next few months, and some expression of theGovernment^ view on the longer-term now seemed to be urgently needed. There was also general agreement that it would be impracticable to establish legal control over wages, profits, dividendsand prices, and that any new policy would require the support ofCC 68 (61)improve the pay of firemen in the rest of the country. Incertain other cases, however, where there was some pre-pausecommitment, it has been thought right that the increases should run from 1st January, 1962. This course has been followed in wages Council awards.It will be clear from this that any settlement for the firemenoutside London and Middlesex which was related to a dateearlier than 1st January could not be regarded as justified bythe existence of commitments entered into before 25th July andwould have to be considered as a breach of the government&apos;s policy on the wages pause. The Government believe that themaintenance of this policy is essential to the national economy.If therefore the Joint Council proceed to make a settlementrelated to a date earlier than 1st January, the Government will feel obliged to make it publicly plain that this was contrary to theview of the national interest which they had placed before theCouncil. They also feel obliged to make it plain that the localauthorities must not proceed on the assumption that there wouldbe an increase in the general grant in respect of the additionalamount involved if an earlier date for settlement were chosen.&quot;The Cabinet then considered what publicity should be given tothis statement of their views. They agreed that, if the meeting of theNational Joint Council on the following day resulted in an adjournment, nothing need be said on behalf of the Government.If the employers accepted the Governmenfs views and were ableto secure a settlement from 1st January, it should be made known that the Government had given the advice indicated in the first paragraph of the statement. If the employers settled for an earlier date, the Governmenfs statement should be published in full.The Cabinet (I) Agreed that a statement in the terms set out above shouldbe transmitted to the Secretary of the employers&apos; sideof the National Joint Council for Local Authorities&apos;Fire Brigades.(2) Agreed that if the Joint Council reached a settlement related to a date earlier than 1st January, 1962, the text of this statement should be published in full simultaneously withany announcement issued by the Joint Council.
public opinion and the respect of both sides of industry if it wereto succeed.The report by officials (Annex A of C. (61) 205) proposed thatthe Government should provide, possibly in a White Paper, a&quot;guiding light&quot; which would be their view of the average rate of increase of total money incomes per head which was consistent witha healthy and competitive economy; and that as a counterpartthe Government should undertake to keep aggregate profits from increasing out of proportion to aggregate pay over a period of years.The report suggested that over the next two or three years theadmissible average rate of increase in incomes might be put at 2 per cent. An alternative would be to issue this kind of guidance interms not of percentage increases but of money. If this approachwere adopted, the statement might forecast a total growth of about 700 millions within the coming year, of which about  500 millionsmight be available for increases in wages and salaries.In view of the need for consultation with both sides of industry,it would not be possible to make a full statement on long-term policy for some time. The content of any interim statement (whichmight have to be made in a Supply debate on 18th December) wouldhave to be determined in the light of the view taken by his colleaguesabout long-term policy.Discussion confirmed that there was general agreement in theCabinet on the importance of an early statement. There were,however, differences of view about the nature of the long-term policy to be adopted. The proposal for a &quot; guiding light&quot; was open to theobjections that the percentage given would tend to be regarded asthe minimum in all negotiations; that employers, particularly in areas where labour was scarce, would find means of supplementingnegotiated rates; that, every time an award was made in excess ofthe average, the Government would have to face the criticism thattheir policy was being frustrated; and that, even if agreement couldbe reached with representatives of the Trades Union Congress, thiswould not be binding on individual unions. Some Ministers were inclined to think that the &quot; guiding light &quot; would be quite ineffectiveand to conclude that the best method of securing control overincomes would be to adopt deflationary policies and expose industryto greater competition. Restriction on home demand would help to keep prices down, would limit profits and would make employersless disposed to tolerate high levels of earnings. Other Ministersfelt, however, that a solution on these lines would be politicallyimpracticab^ as involving higher unemployment, higher taxation and damage to economic growth.It was argued, on the other hand, that further delay in announcing a long-term policy would damage the reputation of theGovernment. The use by trade unions of their organised strength to obtain more than their fair share of the national income was widely resented, and the &quot; guiding light &quot; should have the effect of bringing public opinion to bear on both sides of industry to exerciserestraint. Even if the policy were only partinlly effective it would produce better results than any other which had been suggested.Some of the objections could be met by adopting the arithmeticalrather than the percentage approach, and the policy might carrygreater conviction with work-people if it were made plain that theGovernment attached importance to maintaining comparability asa basis for remuneration in the public services and would give firstattention to remedying the injustices which the policy of the pausehad produced.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) It would be desirable, in order to secure the co-operationof both sides of industry, to relate the proposed interim statement to conditions to be expected in 1962. This would avoid prejudicing the discussions which would soon have to start on long-term policy.
CC 68 (61)(b) Any. statement of long-term policy should include referenceto the effect on total earnings of the willingness of employers in areas where labour was scarce to supplement rates which had beennationally agreed. There were some areas and some parts of the economy which were far from fully stretched; and it would bedesirable that any deflationary measures which might have to betaken should not bear as hardly on such areas as on the rest.id) There was strong feeling in the trade union movement thatthe injustices of the pause were its most unwelcome feature, and itmight be useful in preliminary discussion with the General Secretaryof the Trades Union Congress to lay special stress on theGovernments awareness of this point.id) Although exhortation had been tried before, it need not beregarded as wholly ineffective. The problem was to educate opinion and constant publicity would be required for that purpose.ie) If a full exposition of long-term policy had to be madewhile the Trades Union Congress were still considering whether toco-operate in the National Economic Development Council, sometrade union elements might be strengthened in their reluctance toco-operate in this. It should, however, be possible to present toParliament and the public the basic material provided in the reportby officials and to indicate that the problems raised by this materialwere already the subject of consultation with the other interests concerned. There might be some presentational gain if thestatement of policy could be made about the same time as any announcement of the Governmenfs decisions on public expenditure.if) It would be necessary for the Government to make cleartheir intention to recover, by taxation or other means, the amountsby which awards actually made exceeded in any given period the levels laid down.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on along view the most important requirement was to establish theproposed new organisation for economic planning. Discussions tothat end would take time and to avoid prejudicing them incomes policy should not be presented in terms which might lead employersand work-people to think that the main purpose of the organisation was to secure restraint in wage claims. An agreed policy on incomescould only be expected to grow from co-operation on other economic problems. Similarly, while an incomes policy might in time be expressed in percentage terms, it might be better at the outset to rely on estimates of economic growth expressed in money terms.In spite of inflation, there had in recent years been substantialgrowth in real incomes and it should be stressed in public that the aim for the future should be to increase production and promoteeconomic growth; this was the main and the constructive objectof the machinery now to be created. The only alternative wouldbe the adoption of a fully-regimented economy. A purelydeflationary policy would not meet the needs of the situation.Deflationary measures, such as an increased budget surplus, could make a contribution; but these should, as far as possible, be madeselective in their impact, so that more unemployment was not created in those areas of the country and in those parts of the economywhere the pressure of demand was least.The Cabinet--Invited The Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration, in the light of their discussion, to the formof a statement on long-term policy on wages, salaries andother incomes.
Wages Policy(previous reference:CC. (61) 67thConclusionsMinute 4)Railwaymen&apos;sWages5. The Minister of Transport said that the British transport commission would shortly have to deal with a substantial wagesclaim from the railway unions which had been with them since23rd November. The Chairman^ present view was that, when hehad to reply, he should offer a 6 per cent, increase to date from2nd April. The Minister of Transport said that he would regard this offer as reasonable; the fact that the money would have to beraised from taxation was an argument for delaying the effective dateuntil 2nd April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he and the Ministerof Transport were due to meet the Chairman of the commission that afternoon. It might be helpful to the Cabinet to have furtherknowledge of his views before taking a decision. As no date forreply had yet been set there was no objection to a slight delay.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at anearly meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th December, 1961.
