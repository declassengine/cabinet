France 1.   The Prime Minister said that the discussions he had held with(Previous President de Gaulle at Rambouillet on 28th and 29th January gaveReference: some grounds for thinking that it might now be possible to make someC.C. (58) 87th further progress towards a settlement of our economic and politicalConclusions, relations with Europe. President de Gaulle was content with the resultMmute i) 0f the recent referendum on Algeria, and his general attitude was morePrime Ministers relaxed and confident. With the successful establishment of theR1Sltb0 &apos;ii European Economic Community French industrial interests might beam oui e     jegs strongiy opposed to some wider European trading arrangements.There were powerful influences in favour of the development of a closepolitical federation in Europe, which would be unwelcome to us; and,as President de Gaulle was himself opposed to such a development, itmight be to our advantage to reach a settlement in Europe while he was still in power in France. It would therefore be advisable for theCabinet to give further consideration at an early date to the problemsof the United Kingdom&apos;s relations with Europe.As regards military matters, President de Gaulle was resolved toestablish France as a nuclear Power. He continued to be critical ofthe North Atlantic Alliance in its present form.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 2ndConclusions.Minute 1)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that there was a lull in militaryoperations in Laos. The Soviet Government had not yet replied toour request for their help in reviving the International Commission.So far, we had succeeded in resisting the suggestion of the Governmentof Laos that the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation should send a fact-finding commission to Laos, but we might eventually have to agreethat the Ambassadors in Laos of the member countries of theOrganisation should prepare an agreed report on the situation.Unfortunately, there seemed little chance at present that theGovernment of Laos could be broadened so as to include PrinceSouvanna Phouma, as a means of establishing a genuinely neutraladministration.congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (61) 1stConclusions.Minute 3)3. The Lord Privy Seal said that arrangements had now beencompleted for the withdrawal of the contingents which the united arab Republic and Guinea had provided for the United Nations forcesin the Congo. The Government of Yugoslavia had indicated their intention to withdraw their contingent also. These developmentswould not give rise to any great difficulty; but if the large Moroccancontingent and the Indonesian contingent were also withdrawn, theSecretary-General would be faced with a difficult problem in findingreplacements. The Government of Ghana had not so far announcedthat they would withdraw their troops.The United Nations authorities had intimated that they could not guarantee the evacuation of Europeans from Stanleyville ifdevelopments made this desirable. Although it did not at present seem likely that the situation in Stanleyville would deteriorate to an extent which would make this necessary, the United Kingdom government must consider how best to protect British lives if an emergency wereto arise.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to arrange for consideration to begiven to the best means of protecting British lives inStanleyville in the event of an emergency.
Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (60) 57thConclusions,minute 3)4. The Colonial Secretary recalled that the Monckton Corn-mission had recommended that there should be an African majority inthe Legislative Council of Northern Rhodesia. A compromisesuggested by the Prime Minister in a personal message to the PrimeMinister of the Federation, to the effect that the Africans should be offered either parity among the elected members in the LegislativeCouncil or only a token majority, had provoked strong reactions. TheUnited Federal Party in Northern Rhodesia, together with theDominion Party, had so far refused to participate in the &quot;northern rhodesia Constitutional Conference which had resumed its proceedings in London on the previous day.In these circumstances it might well be preferable for the UnitedKingdom Government to impose a settlement rather than to accept one that had been agreed with the remaining groups at the Conference.While there would be advantage in prolonging the discussions as longas possible in order to avoid prejudicing the Constitutional conference which was being held concurrently in Southern Rhodesia, a decision could not be too long delayed for fear of a deterioration in the security situation in Northern Rhodesia. It would probably be necessary todecide at short notice early in the following week what settlement should be made.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Colonial Secretary.Newspaper 5.   The Home Secretary said that, in consequence of the proposedMergers amalgamation of Odhams Press with either the Thomson group of newspapers or the Daily Mirror group, there was considerable pressure for the Government to institute some form of enquiry. Therewere serious objections to a general enquiry into the Press. Before theGovernment committed themselves to any course of action it would bedesirable to await developments both in the political field and in thenegotiations between the various interests concerned in the currentdeal. In any statement to be made in Parliament there might be some advantage in undertaking to consult the Opposition.In discussion doubts were expressed whether any form of enquiry would serve a practical purpose. The facts about the current negotiations were already known, and the Government had no effectivepower to intervene to prevent those negotiations from being broughtto a conclusion. A general enquiry into the problem of preventingundue concentration of ownership of newspapers could haveembarrassing consequences. And if the case for such an enquiry wereconceded it would not be easy to resist the extension of such an enquiry so as to include the whole question of the increasingconcentration of financial control in the capitalist system.On the other hand, there was ground for concern about thepresent economics of newspaper publishing in particular, thearrangements for the supply of newsprint and its cost, the restrictive practices of the trade unions and the level of advertising rates. indeed it was arguable that these factors were largely responsible for thecurrent and prospective mergers, whose possible effect on the freedomof the Press was causing increasing apprehension. While these were primarily matters for the newspaper proprietors themselves, a limitedenquiry related strictly to the economics of newspaper publishingmight be of value and should not be wholly ruled out.In view of the large number and variety of national and provincialdaily newspapers, it was out of the question to regard any amalgama-tions in prospect as creating a monopoly referable to the monopolies commission. The position was different in the case of periodicals: the amalgamation of Odhams Press with the Daily Mirror group would
BroadcastingDevelopmentSubscriptionTelevision(previous reference:C.C.(60) 65thConclusions.Minute 6)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade and the Postmaster-General(C. (60) 191) about a proposed experiment in subscription television.The President of the Board of Trade said that it would be difficultto defend prohibiting an experiment which would be carried out by itspromoters with their own equipment and at their own expense andmight be expected in due course to lead to the development of a valuable export market for the equipment required for subscriptiontelevision.The Postmaster-General said that the report of the Committee on broadcasting under the Chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington was expected in about 12 months&apos; lime and before the proposed experimentcould show conclusive results. Nevertheless, if the experiment were successful, the Government could hardly hope to be able to resist pressure for the introduction of a general service of subscriptiontelevision, even if the Pilkington Committee had recommendedagainst it. To that extent the Committee, who felt very strongly onthe subject, were right in their view that their work would be prejudiced by a decision to allow the experiment to go forward at thepresent stage.C.C. 3 (61)transfer into single ownership over 90 per cent, of the periodicalspublished in this country and, although the public interest would hardly suffer if there were some reduction in their number, the concentration of control could be open to political objection.Reference to the Monopolies Commission of this aspect of theproposed amalgamation would be legally possible and, while there was considerable doubt whether it would produce any useful result, thiscourse should be further considered in the light of developments.In further discussion the following points were also made:(a) The effect of newspaper mergers on contracts under the television Act was within the terms of reference of the Committee on broadcasting, which might be asked to give early attention to it.(b) The technique, as distinct from the underlying principles, ofmergers and take-over bids generally was within the scope of theCommittee on Company Law under the chairmanship of Lord Jenkins.The Prime Minister said that he would make it clear, in thestatement he proposed to make in Parliament that day, that theGovernment were not in a position to take any action on the current negotiations concerning the future of Odhams Press. He wouldmention the possibility that, if a very large proportion of magazinesand periodicals came under single ownership, circumstances might arise in which it would become expedient to refer this aspect of theproblem to the Monopolies Commission. He would also refer to thefact that some other aspects of the problem were within the terms ofreference of the Broadcasting Committee and of the Committee onCompany Law. He would not at this stage indicate any support forthe suggestion of a more general enquiry; but, if this suggestion were strongly pressed, he might offer to consult the Opposition before reaching a final decision.The Cabinet Took note that in replying to Parliamentary Questions in theHouse of Commons that afternoon the Prime Minister wouldmake a statement on newspaper mergers on the lines whichhe had indicated at the end of their discussion.
industrial disputes(previous reference:C.C. (60) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3)Tally Clerks7. The cabinet minister of Labour (C.the London docks.had before them a memorandum by the(61) 10) about the position of the tally clerks inThe Minister of Labour said that the report made on25th November by the committee which he had appointed during thecourse of the unofficial strike of tally clerks in the London docks had strongly criticised the strikers and had made a number of recommenda-tions directed towards increasing efficiency in the docks. The london dock Labour Board, consisting of representatives of employers and unions, had considered the report and had now informed the national dock Labour Board that (apart from one matter which was not inquestion) they accepted the committee&apos;s recommendations. They had expressed the view that the implementation of some of therecommendations, particularly the proposal to allocate tally clerks tospecified sectors of the docks, might cause renewed industrial unrest.The National Dock Labour Board were prepared to implement therecommendations provided they were assured that, if industrial troublewere to occur, the Government would not force them to retreat fromtheir proposals. It was likely that the Transport and General WorkersUnion would support the National Board, but the Stevedores Unionmight well resist the reforms.It was difficult to assess the chances of industrial unrest ifthe recommendations were implemented. But it was of greatimportance to reduce the stranglehold which the tally clerks had overthe docks, and it seemed better to accept the risk of trouble now whenpublic opinion would fully support the action proposed by theNational Board. The Economic Policy Committee had accordinglyagreed that the National Board should be assured of the Governmentssupport.The Cabinet were in general agreement with the course proposedby the Minister of Labour.Discussion showed that there was a division of opinion in theCabinet on the question whether this experiment should be allowed.To refuse might be held to be incompatible with the Governments aim to develop all possible export markets. On the other hand, the wholecomplex of problems presented by the future of broadcasting hadbeen referred to a Committee specially appointed to advise on them;and it was difficult to contest the Committee^ view that a decision toallow what would be, in effect, the first step towards the introductionof a particular form of third television service (which was no doubt thereal aim of the promoters of the experiment) would prejudice their work and would be inconsistent with the purpose for which they hadbeen appointed.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that theCabinet would need to give further consideration to this question ata later date. There would be obvious difficulty in authorising theproposed experiment in the face of determined opposition from the pilkington Committee. It would therefore be helpful if at some stage,the Home Secretary were to discuss the matter further with Sir HarryPilkington.The Cabinet Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of theproposal in C. (60) 191 for an experiment in subscriptiontelevision.
national health service(previous reference:C.C. (61) 2ndConclusions,Minute 4, andC.C. (61) 1stConclusions.Minute 4)8. The Minister of Health recalled that, at their meeting on17th January, the Cabinet had approved proposals that the charges forspectacle lenses should be increased to 12s. per lens (and 18s. forbifocal lenses) and that the maximum charge for amenity beds in hospitals should be increased from 4 gns. to 1\ gns. a week.Further examination of the costs showed that it would bedefensible to increase the charges for lenses to 12s. 6d. and 20s. andhe sought the agreement of the Cabinet to the adoption of these higherfigures.As regards the charges for amenity beds in hospitals, patients were required under the existing regulations to pay half the actual cost ofthe service provided or 4 gns. a week, whichever was the less. in proposing to the Cabinet that the maximum charge should be raised from 4 gns. to 1\ gns. He had had it in mind also to increasethe proportion of the cost which the patient might be required to pay as an alternative to the maximum. On further consideration, however,he had decided that this would hardly be practicable and he nowproposed, therefore, that the charge recoverable should be half thecost, as at present, or 8 gns. (instead of 1\ gns.) whichever was the less.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the second ofthe Minister^ revised proposals would bring in rather less revenue thanthe proposal originally approved by the Cabinet, the first would yieldsome l\ million a year more than the original proposal. He wascontent to accept both the revised proposals.The Cabinet Agreed (i) that the charges for spectacle lenses should be increased to12s. 6d. per lens (20s. for bifocal lenses);(ii) that the maximum charge for amenity beds in hospitals&apos; should be increased to 8 gns. a week.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st January, 1961.The Minister of Transport said that, as public opinion was activelyinterested in this matter, he would, take an early opportunity to announce his intention to establish an enquiry into the efficiency of ports in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Labour should inform theNational Dock Labour Board that the Government would support them in implementing the recommendations of thecommittee which had reported on the tally clerks strike.
