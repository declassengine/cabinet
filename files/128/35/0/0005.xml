congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (61) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)Aid toCountriesOverseasEstablishmentof a newDepartment2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. (61) 11) proposing the establishment of a new Departmentof Technical Co-operation to take over the existing functions of theForeign Office, Commonwealth Relations Office and Colonial Officerelating to the provision of technical assistance to countries overseas.In discussion there was general support for the proposal toestablish a new Department for this purpose. Many existingagencies, both official and unofficial, were concerned with recruitingpeople for service overseas. The new Department would not takeover the work of all those agencies. In particular, the EducationDepartments would retain their present functions in respect of thesupply of teachers for oversea countries; and the functions of theBritish Council would remain undisturbed. The new department would however concert the activities of these agencies and wouldprovide a central focus and impetus for their work.One of their objectives, in establishing this new Department, wasto ensure that the advisory services which had been built up underthe Colonial Office would continue to be available to the independent countries of the Commonwealth. There was, however, a danger that,in some Commonwealth countries which had recently attainedindependence, the new Department might be represented as a devicefor continuing &quot; Colonial &quot; rule. Emergent countries, in the early stages of tbeir independence, were apt to be specially sensitive on thispoint. With a view to reducing this risk two suggestions were putforward:(a) The forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime ministers would provide an opportunity to explain the need for the new department and to avert unnecessary suspicions of its purpose.While it would be wrong to appear to be consulting other commonwealth Governments about a change in the domesticmachinery of government in this country, it would be expedient totake this opportunity of explaining the change to commonwealth prime Ministers before any public announcement was made. TheGovernments of the older Commonwealth countries were likely tosupport the project the Canadian Government had already madea similar change in their domestic arrangements.   The Asiatic1. The Foreign Secretary said that the United Arab republic and Guinea had now withdrawn their contingents from the united nations forces in the Congo. The control which Mr. Gizenga, who supported the claims of Mr. Lumumba, exercised over the areasurrounding Stanleyville was now somewhat weaker, since he was runnin short of money and of petrol. President Kasavubu was at last making some progress towards establishing a constitutional conference but it would not be easy to secure the co-operation ofMr. Tshombe, to whose administration in the Katanga the Belgianauthorities were now apparently providing direct assistance, includingarms.The Secretary-General of the United Nations was seeking some means of neutralising the armed forces of the various administrationsin the Congo. The United States authorities had been consideringproposals to this end. They now recognised that it would benecessary to secure the co-operation of President Kasavubu andMr. Tshombe, and that this would be a matter of great difficulty.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
AISECRETitOmembers of the Commonwealth were unlikely to raise objection toit. It should be possible to allay any anxieties which might initiallybe felt by the African members.(b) It would be easier to present this plan to the newest membersof the Commonwealth, and in particular to Nigeria, if the new department were not to assume from the outset any administrative responsibility for the Overseas Civil Service. This aspect of the plan would be specially open to misrepresentation. While it was desirablethat this function should eventually be transferred, the new department was more likely to be acceptable to the other independent members of the Commonwealth if it were not burdened initially withthis responsibility.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals, outlined in C. (61) 11,- for the establishment of a new Department of technical co-operation.(2) Agreed that no public announcement of this project shouldbe made until after the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the possibility of postponingfor the time being the assumption by this new Departmentof responsibility for the administration of the OverseasCivil Service.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (61)3rdConclusions.Minute 4)3. The Cabinet were informed that it was likely that some agreement of principle would shortly be reached at the southern rhodesian Constitutional Conference which was being held in salisbury. The Commonwealth Secretary had also made some progress in his discussions with the Prime Minister of the federation on the reasons why the United Kingdom Government thought itnecessary to propose, in the Northern Rhodesian Conference inLondon, that the Africans should be offered parity among the elected members in the Legislative Council.The Colonial Secretary said that the continued absence from that conference of representatives of the United Federal Party and theDominion Party could not fail to prejudice the hope of maintaining a multi-racial federation in central Africa. He had succeeded in keeping the Conference in being, but it would probably be necessaryto decide within two days on what terms to bring it to a conclusion.The Cabinet would need to consider the situation on 10th February.The Cabinet Agr^d to consider at a meeting on 10th February thesituation reached in the Conference uii the constitution ofNorthern Rhodesia.NewspaperMergers(previous reference:C.C. (61)3rdConclusions,Minute 5)4. The Prime Minister said that he had made it clear in recentstatements in Parliament that the Government had no intention of taking any action on the current negotiations for the merger ofOdhams Press with either the Thomson group of newspapers or the daily Mirror. The question that remained was whether there shouldbe a more general enquiry into the economics of the newspaperindustry. In favour of this it could be argued that there was realpublic anxiety about the present state of the industry and about thedifficulty of financing even important national daily newspapers with large circulations. The problem was likely to recur in the near future and an enquiry into the economics of the industry might be of
Germany(previous reference:C.C. (60) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)DefenceFacilitiesin theUnitedKingdom5. The Minister of Defence recalled that he had circulated amemorandum (C. (60) 178) to the Cabinet on 29th November, I960,about the possible requirements of the Federal German Governmentfor training and other facilities outside Germany for their militaryforces. The German Government had now submitted a detailedrequest for facilities in the United Kingdom for the storage ofammunition, oil and general supplies for their army and navy; for maintenance facilities for naval aircraft and vessels of British origin:for training facilities for up to ten armoured regiments annually; andfor facilities for shore target firing, amphibious training and exercisesassistance to the industry itself. On the other hand, if theGovernment were to institute an enquiry at the present stage, theymight appear to be giving way to pressure and they would run therisk that the enquiry would extend embarrassingly into the wholeworking of the capitalist system.A tribunal of enquiry would not be appropriate. A departmentalcommittee would have no power to send for papers and summonwitnesses. The best form of enquiry might therefore be a smallRoyal Commission with limited terms of reference.Discussion-showed that it was the general view of the Cabinetthat, although the political pressure was already diminishing, therewas a case on merits for an enquiry into the economics of the newspaper industry and, more particularly, into the restrictive practices of the trade unions concerned. It would, however, be preferable that the terms of reference should not make any explicitmention of the relationship between management and labour, and itwould be necessary to ensure that the enquiry did not overlap thework of the Committee on Broadcasting under the chairmanship ofSir Harry Pilkington, which had already been invited to submit an interim report on certain aspects of the relations between the press and the television programme companies. The effect of appointing a Royal Commission might be to accelerate, to the detriment of thepublic interest, certain further mergers or take-over bids which werein prospect and it was for consideration whether, after the enquiryhad been set on foot, the Government should not make an unofficialrequest to the interests concerned to defer action until it had beencompleted.Summing up the discussion The Prime Minister said that itappeared to be the general view of the Cabinet that there would be advantage in appointing a small Royal Commission to examine and make recommendations on the economic aspects of newspaper andmagazine publishing.  The terms of reference might be &quot; To examine the economic and financial factors affecting theproduction and sale of newspapers, magazines and other periodicalsin the United Kingdom, including (a) manufacturing, printing,distribution and other costs; (b) efficiency of production; and(c) advertising and other revenue, including any revenue derived fromI.T.V. Programme Companies to consider whether these factorstend to diminish diversity of ownership and control or the number or variety of such publications, having regard to the importance, inthe public interest, of the accurate presentation of news and the free expression of opinion; and to report.&quot;The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would recommend the Queen to appoint a Royal Commission to examine theeconomic and financial factors affecting the production and sale of newspapers, magazines and other periodicals in theUnited Kingdom.
with naval aircraft. Discussions were due to begin on 22nd Februarybetween British and German officials under the auspices of themilitary authorities of the North Atlantic Alliance.The Minister suggested that we should, in principlet be readyto meet these requirements, so far as they were reasonable, in theinterests of the interdependence of the members of the North atlantic alliance. But some of the requirements might seem excessive tocertain sections of public opinion in this country, and it would benecessary to examine carefully what they would entail.It was the general view of the Cabinet that no difficulty would arise over the grant of storage facilities or maintenance facilities for aircraft and vessels of British origin. Nor need objection be raised to facilities for shore target firing, amphibious training and exerciseswith naval aircraft, so long as these were not unduly obtrusive.Training facilities for armoured regiments were, however, a different matter. If these entailed tank manoeuvres over wide areas of thecountry, people might reasonably ask why these should not takeplace in Germany, and it would not be easy to explain why thiswould be impracticable. If the facilities were for range firing bytanks, this would be open to less objection: but it was hard tounderstand why it was necessary for the German forces to seekfacilities in the United Kingdom for this limited purpose.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to ascertain what would beentailed in granting the military facilities requested by theGerman Government, particularly the training facilitiesfor armoured regiments.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to obtain a report, on Frenchreactions to the training of German military units inFrance.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion, at a meeting in thefollowing week, in the light of the information to beobtained under Conclusions (1) and (2) above.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 14) proposing an enquiry into the law relating toSunday observance.CC. (60) 44th The Home Secretary recalled that on 21st July, 1960. the cabinet conclusions. had approved in principle his proposal for the appointment of a JointMinute 4) Select Committee on the law of Sunday observance in England andWales, but had suggested that before any announcement was madethe opinion of Government supporters should be sounded. Soundingshad now been taken and, while opinion was divided on the expediency of undertaking such an enquiry, there was general agreement that itwould be undesirable to introduce legislation, or even to set an enquiry on foot, after the end of the current Session.The Home Secretary said that, as the Government had already undertaken the reform of the law on betting and gaming and onlicensing, there was much to be said for turning their attention next to Sunday observance. He now proposed that, instead of appointing a Joint Select Committee, the Government should appoint a departmental committee, which might be expected to spend 18 to 24months on their enquiry. This would still leave time for legislationbefore the end of the present Parliament, though this would notnecessarily be the result of the enquiry.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the law on Sunday observance in Scotland was materially different from that in Englandand Wales and he would therefore wish that Scotland should be excluded from the scope of any enquiry on the subject.Sunday observance(previous reference:
Expenses ofMembers ofParliament(previous reference:C.C. (60) 37thConclusions,Minute 1)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 15) about a proposed schemefor the repayment of the road travel expenses of Peers and Membersof Parliament.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, at the requestof the Opposition, a scheme had been prepared under which peers and Members of Parliament could claim their expenses in travellingby car between home, constituency and the House, up to the costof first-class railway travel. The Opposition had at that stageindicated that they no longer felt able to support the proposal, butthey had now come forward in favour of a scheme on the lines proposed. He therefore suggested, in agreement with the HomeSecretary, that the Chief Whip might be authorised to discuss it withthe Opposition with a view to its introduction at the beginning ofthe next financial year. It was known that the House authoritiesconsidered that the scheme could be operated satisfactorily. Itwould apply only to cars owned by Peers or Members or their wives.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (61) 15.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th February, 1961.Discussion showed that there was some support in the cabinet for the view that the law on Sunday observance, some of which nolonger reflected contemporary public opinion, should be brought upto date. On the other hand, it was argued that this was a matter onwhich there were irreconcilable differences of opinion, and that therewas little evidence of any strong or widespread demand for reform.Any initiative by the Government would stimulate active opposition and it would be unfortunate if a report recommending relaxation ofthe present restrictions were received shortly before the end of thepresent Parliament.Summing up, The Prime Minister said that it would help theCabinet to reach a decision if they could have before them a summaryof the existing law relating to Sunday observance, and an indication of the areas in which some change was urgently required.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to circulate a memorandum onthe effect of the existing law relating to Sunday observancein England and Wales.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of (C. (61) 14) at a later meeting.
