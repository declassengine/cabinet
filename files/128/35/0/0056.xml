germany berlin(previous reference:C.C. (61) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)1. The Foreign Secretary said that the French Government had declined to participate in the meeting of senior officials of the fourWestern Governments which was to have been held in preparation for the conversations which the United States Ambassador to theSoviet Union was to hold in Moscow with the Soviet Foreign Minister.This was a discouraging development, since it seemed to imply thatGeneral de Gaulle was not in favour of seeking a negotiated settlement. President Kennedy had delayed his Ambassadors returnto Moscow, evidently in the hope that he might be able to persuadeGeneral de Gaulle to acquiesce in the procedure favoured by the other western Powers for finding a basis for negotiation. Meanwhile, theForeign Secretary thought it would be necessary to assure parliament in the forthcoming debates that it was the view of the United KingdomGovernment that the search for such a basis, which was begun in thediscussions held with the Soviet Foreign Minister in the United Statesand in London, should be continued. He had obtained authority to add that this was also the view of the United States Government.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Europe(previous reference:C.C. (61) 53rdConclusions,Minute 9)2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Privy Seal(C. (61) 162) covering a summary of his opening speech at the meeting with representatives of the European Economic Communitv in Parison 10th October.The Lord Privy Seal said that the response to his speech had been reasonably favourable. The representatives of the Community had,however, been impressed by the complexity of the Commonwealthissues which were involved, and by our commitment to take accountof the needs of our partners in the European Free Trade Association.The members of the Community had now to co-ordinate their replyto the statement, and negotiations would be resumed on 8th November.The Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:C.C. (61) 52ndConclusions.Minute 8)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home Secretary(C. (61) 158) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament.The Cabinet were informed that it might not be possible to reach an early decision on the scope and timing of legislation to providefor the taxation of short-term capital gains. Although early legislation would strengthen the Government s economic policy, itcould not be assumed that a Bill would be ready for Second Readingbefore Christmas; and in that event it might be preferable to includethe necessary provisions in the Finance Rill. In these circumstances it would be preferable that no reference to separate legislation on thissubject should be included in The Queerfs Speech.It was also suggested that reference to the Weights and MeasuresBill should be omitted. It was agreed that this would be regarded asan indication that the Government had decided not to proceed withthis measure, which was already fully prepared and had a wide appealin the country, especially for local authorities and for consumers&apos;organisations. On the other hand, the legislative programme for thecoming Session was already heavy; and although, if it became evidentthat time could be found, the Bill could be introduced without delay, itwould be preferable to avoid a definite commitment to introduce it.
The Cabinefs view was that, on balance, it would be better to make no reference to this Bill in the Speech but to make it clear in the debate on the Address that this omission did not imply that the Bill had been abandoned.In further discussion various amendments of drafting were suggested and approved.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would submit for theapproval of The Queen a draft of the Speech on the Openingof Parliament, revised on the lines agreed in their discussion.Defence(previous reference:CC. (61) 7thConclusions.Minute 5)ArmyManpower4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence and the Secretary of State for War (C. (61) 160) on the manning of the Army.The Minister of Defence said that, although there had recentlybeen some improvement in recruitment, it was by no means certainthat a regular Army of 165,000 would be achieved by January 1963.Even with an Army of 165,000, there would be serious shortages insome of the administrative corps, such as doctors, medical orderlies,signal operators and drivers, and the Army as a whole would not bea fully effective fighting force. Moreover, the decision to rely on a voluntary Army from 1963 had been taken on the assumption thatour commitments would diminish and that the number of unitsoverseas could be reduced. This assumption had not been realised.We were under pressure from our allies in the North Atlantic Allianceto increase the strength of the British Army of the Rhine (B.A.O.R.);and, while our long-term aim should be to reduce it to a four brigade-group basis (40,000 men), we would be obliged to maintain it at leastat the present strength of 51,000 men so long as the present crisis over berlin continued. On present prospects a deficiency in B.A.O.R. of11,000-15.000 would begin to be revealed in April 1962 when the lastbatches of National Servicemen would leave.Various measures to fill this prospective gap had been examined.The best course would be to take power to retain for an extra periodof six months those National Servicemen whose two-year period of full-time service would come to an end during the period April-October 1%2. and to recall for service those National Servicemen whohad completed their full-time service but were still liable for 31 yearspart-time service. It was virtually certain that the power to retainserving National Servicemen would have to be used, but a decisionto recall National Servicemen liable for part-time service could betaken in the light of circumstances obtaining in the latter part of 1962.To enable the reserve forces which could at present be called up without a Proclamation to be used in a period of continuing tension,and to enable other reserves to be used without the need for a proclamation, it was desirable to undertake a complete reappraisalof our reserve requirements and the organisation best designed to meet them. This, however, would take some time and would requirecomplex legislation, and in the meantime there would be advantage in taking power to create a reserve of men willing to be called up fora limited period in time of tension to strengthen the regular Army.This might be done by revising the conditions of service of the ArmyEmergency Reserve Class I. throwing it open to all arms instead ofconfining it to specialised administrative units, and raising its presentceiling. To secure volunteers on this basis it would be necessary toincrease the present bounty substantially.The Secretary of State for War said that, even if the current reviewof defence commitments and expenditure enabled reductions to bemade in our forces overseas, the redeployment could not be carried through in time to avoid the shortage in B.A.O.R. in 1962.  Legislative
powers to obtain temporary additions to Army manpower were therefore essential. It should be recognised that the response to anappeal for volunteer Reservists willing to be called up in a time of tension, as distinct from imminent war, was bound to be uncertain;but it would be useful to make a start in this way with the task ofreorganising the reserves.The Foreign Secretary said that it did not seem likely that our commitments overseas could be substantially reduced during the next two years. Even if the Berlin situation were to improve, it would benecessary to consider carefully whether it was in our true interests tosecure a large reduction in our land forces in Europe, having regardto the future strength of West German forces. In the longer term theprospect that serious shortages, particularly in certain administrativesections, would persist in our forces overseas gave cause for anxiety.Nevertheless he agreed that it would be inexpedient at this stage to contemplate the reintroduction of National Service, since this would prejudice any chance of securing regular forces of an adequate size.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that, despite theadditional expenditure involved, it was necessary to take power toretain serving National Servicemen and to recall part-time national servicemen in order to provide temporary additions to Army man-power. The proposal to keep B.A.O.R. up to a strength of 51,000after April 1962, could only be accepted however, on the assumptionthat some financial contribution towards our oversea expenditure would be provided by our allies.Discussion showed that the Cabinet agreed that the policy ofrelying on regular forces should be maintained, and that it would be inexpedient to reintroduce National Service unless voluntary recruitment had clearly failed. We could not, however, expect to recruit regular forces on a scale sufficient to meet all our present commitments; and. if the reintroduction of National Service was tobe avoided, some reduction would have to be made in these commitments. In view of the uncertain situation in South-East asia and the need to retain substantial forces in the Arabian Peninsula, itwould be difficult to meet our commitments with regular forces unless some reduction could be achieved in B.A.O.R. Our aim should therefore be to reduce B.A.O.R. to a four brigade-group basis as soonas possible in view of the Berlin situation; and we should seek to persuade our Allies that this reduction would be more than offset byearmarking for the North Atlantic Alliance forces which would be stationed in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet also agreed that, to provide temporary additions toArmy manpower, legislation should be introduced as soon as possibleto give permissive power to prolong by six months the full-time serviceof National Servicemen due for release between April and October1962, and to recall part-time National Servicemen for further full-time service outside the United Kingdom for up to six months. these powers could be justified by reference to the critical situation in Berlin,and to the inevitable difficulties which the maintenance of our present commitments was about to involve during the transition to all-regular forces. The additions which could then be made to Army manpowerwould incidentally help to provide adequate forces in this country inthe event of serious industrial disturbances during the coming months.As regards the reorganisation of the reserves, it was suggested thatit was unlikely that there would be a worth-while response to an appeal for voluntary reservists willing to be called up in a time of tension.On the other hand, it could be argued that the critical situation over berlin was of such a special nature as to justify the experiment of creating a voluntary reserve of this kind. If the situation were to deteriorate further, however, it might become appropriate to issue a proclamation enabling reserves in general to be called up.
ShippingCunardLiners(previous reference:CC. (60) 47thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (61) 161) reporting that the Cunard Company had decided to announce that commercial prospects no longer justifiedthem in proceeding with a replacement for the Queen Mary.The Minister oj Transport said that since his memorandum hadbeen written he had learned from the Chairman of the cunard company that the Company now wished to announce, not that theywere abandoning the project for a replacement ship, but that theywere postponing it for the time being. The Company&apos;s reasons forwishing to defer a final decision were principally that, while recentoperating conditions had been so bad that they could hardly justifyto their shareholders a decision to go ahead, there was some prospectof improvement in conditions; and that from the information obtainedfrom tenders and otherwise they thought that, given more time, theycould design a substantially better ship than the one hitherto envisaged.The Chairman had said that he hoped it would be possible to holdopen the question of the proposed financial assistance pending a finaldecision.The terms of the Company&apos;s announcement, which was to bemade on 19th October, and drafts of possible statements to be madeon behalf of the Government were circulated to the Cabinet.In discussion it was agreed that there would be no advantage in seeking to influence the terms of the announcement to be made bythe Company. As regards the statement to be made on behalf of theGovernment, it was agreed that, in view of the explanations given inParliament when the North Atlantic Shipping Act. 1961, was underconsideration, it would be wrong to concede now that government assistance would be made available for a different proposition. Theright course would be to make it clear that, as the Company were notat present proceeding with their original proposal, the Governmentcould no longer be committed to provide financial assistance, but must reserve their right to consider afresh any proposals which theCompany might put forward at a later date.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster, to give further consideration in the lightof their discussion to the terms of the Governmenfsstatement about the Cunard Company&apos;s postponement of adecision to order a replacement for the Qwen Mary.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for War, in consultationwith the Minister of Defence and the Minister of Labour,to arrange for legislation to be prepared to give permissivepower to prolong by six months the full-time service ofNational Servicemen due for release between April and october 1962, and to recall part-time National Servicemenfor further full-time service outside the United kingdom for up to six months.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theSecretary of State for War, to submit to the Prime Ministerfor inclusion in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament a form of words foreshadowing the legislationmentioned in Conclusion (1) above.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State forWar to give further consideration to the question of including in this legislation powers to create a voluntaryreserve to be called up in a time of tension.
 dotation 6.   The Minister of Education said that he had held a series of teachers&apos; meetings, first with representatives of the teachers, then withSalaries representatives of the local education authorities and, finally, with(Previous representatives of the two interests together, about the GovernmentsReference: proposal to introduce legislation to alter the system for fixing teachers&apos;CC. (61) 49th salaries. At the outset the representatives of the National Union of conclusions. Teachers (N.U.T.) had declared their intention to withdraw teachersMinute 7) from the schools for a single day, and hold a public demonstration,on 23rd October, and to withhold, with effect from 1st November,their services in the supervision of schools at lunch-time. Therepresentatives of the local authorities had been disturbed at theconsequences of the latter proposal, since it might prove necessary to close the schools altogether at mid-day, and they had brought allpossible influence to bear on the teachers to get them to abandon thiscourse. At the joint meeting the local authorities had proposed thatthe teachers should call off their proposed strike action, should acceptthe  42 millions increase in salaries offered by the Minister and shouldtake part in a new negotiation of salaries in July 1962, which would come into effect at the end of March 1963. Although the minister had made it clear that he could not associate himself with a promise of new negotiations in 1962, the N.U.T. representatives had agreedto propose to their Executive at a meeting the following day that the 42 millions should be accepted and the strike action called off. Theyhad it in mind, as had the local authorities&apos; representatives, that theintroduction of legislation might be postponed until after Christmas,when the progress of negotiations on other salaries in localgovernment service could be assessed. If the N.U.T. Executiveapproved the recommendations which were to be put to them, therewould be an immediate meeting of the Burnham Committee at whichthe  42 millions would be accepted. The N.U.T. would then have to summon a delegate conference at which they would seek to rescindthe instruction to strike on 23rd October and to withdraw from mealsservice on 1st November.It seemed clear that a growing number of teachers would welcome the abandonment of the strike threat by their leaders. He thoughtthat in this improving atmosphere there would be nothing to be lost by postponing the introduction of legislation until immediately after christmas though it could not, of course, be postponed much longer.The Cabinet Took note of this statement bv the Minister of Education.Eusion 7.   The Minister of Transport recalled that the Home AffairsStation Committee, at their meeting on 30th June, had decided that in theDoric Arch forthcoming reconstruction of Euston Station it would be unnecessary to preserve the Doric Arch. The cost of removing and le-erectingit elsewhere-had then been estimated at  il)0.000. Though thisdecision had been announced early in July, it had not occasioned any public protest until late in September, when the scaffolding for theremoval of the Arch began to be erected. The Royal Fine art commission had then pronounced against the decision; a scheme for removing it on rollers at a cost of only  90,000 had been put forward;and an attempt was being made to raise a fund for this purpose from private sources. The Minister said that he was doubtful whether this sum would be raised; nor was he satisfied that it would be technicallyfeasible to remove the Arch by this means for re-erection elsewhere.Meanwhile, the contract for the work at Euston Station had been letand the British Transport Commission would suffer inconvenience and financial loss if the removal of the Arch were delaved.
The Minister of Works said that the Arch was of some historicalinterest and should not perhaps be destroyed if it could be preservedwithout expense to public funds.In discussion there was some support for the view that theGovernment should not prevent the preservation of the Arch if those concerned to preserve it were willing to raise the money for itsremoval and re-erection elsewhere. On the other hand it was recognised that, if the Government indicated any readiness to modify their earlier decision, there would be a substantial delay before apractical plan was devised for re-erecting the Arch on another siteby public subscription. Indeed, it was likely that the exchequer would be called upon to defray some part, at any rate, of the cost.It was the general feeling of the Cabinet that such advantages as there might be in allowing the Arch to be preserved would be outweighed by the consequent delay, and increased cost, of the reconstruction ofEuston Station.The Cabinet Confirmed the decision that the Doric Arch at Euston stations should be demolished.Cabinet Office. S.W. 1,17th October, 1961.
