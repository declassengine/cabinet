C.C. 18 (61)Souiii-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 17thConclusions,Minute 1)*The Cabinet were informed of the circumstances which had ledto the meeting between the Prime Minister and the President of theUnited States at Key West, Florida, on the previous day. In thelight of the Cabinet&apos;s discussions on 23rd March the Prime minister had sent a personal message to the President about the situation inLaos (Foreign Office telegram No. 1715 of 24th March to washington); the President had felt that this message revealed certaindifferences of view between the Governments of the United Statesand of the United Kingdom; and he had suggested that the PrimeMinister should meet him urgently in Florida in order to resolvethese differences before the opening of the meeting of the South-east asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) at Bangkok on 27th March.At this meeting it had been made clear that the United StatesGovernment would prefer that, if it became necessary to intervene in Laos, this should be done under the auspices of SEATO and withreal participation from the Organisation. The Prime Minister had accepted this view, but had made it clear that he could not commit the United Kingdom Government to provide assistance, other thanmoral and diplomatic support, except with the specific approval ofthe Cabinet. He had also made it plain that the United KingdomGovernment would be reluctant to give approval for an unlimitedmilitary commitment. President Kennedy had agreed that anyintervention should be of a limited character and had proposed thata plan on the lines of SEATO Plan 5/61 should be studied urgentlyby the United Kingdom and United States military authorities inBangkok. The Prime Minister had agreed to this, subject to theapproval of the Cabinet and on the understanding that no plan wouldbe put into operation without a specific political decision by theGovernments concerned.The Prime Minister had informed the Foreign Secretary inBangkok of these developments. He had suggested that the foreign secretary&apos;s immediate purpose should be to maintain morale at theSEATO meeting and to create a sense of unity and determinationwhich would help to induce the Soviet Government to adopt a constructive attitude towards the proposals which the UnitedKingdom had made for a political settlement. The Prime Ministersought the Cabinefs endorsement of his agreement that intervention,if this became necessary, should be under the auspices of SEATO andof the proposal that joint planning between the United Kingdom and united States military authorities in Bangkok should now take place.The Minister of Defence said that the purpose of Plan 5/61 wasto introduce a SEATO force, including the Commonwealth brigade,into Laos in a counter-insurgency role. The force would secure someof the main centres of communication and would thus free theLaotian army to fight the insurgents. It now seemed, however, thatthe United States authorities were thinking in terms of holding anumber of bridgeheads, including Vientiane, on the Laotian side ofthe frontier with Thailand, and it seemed clear that the United states would have to provide the major military contribution.In discussion there was general recognition that, in view of theattitude of the United States Government and of the views whichwere likely to be expressed on behalf of other Governments at theSEATO meeting, any overt intervention in Laos would have to be under the auspices of SEATO. Unilateral intervention by the UnitedStates Government might have entailed less danger of an extensionof the conflict. But, if we were to be asked to participate in anyintervention, it would be easier to justify this to public and parliamentary opinion in this country and also in the United Nations,if the action were taken in pursuance of our treaty obligations.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
lOlplanning should now take place urgently betweenthe United Kingdom and United States military authorities inBangkok for intervention on a limited basis, on the understandingthat no operations would take place without specific political approval by the Governments concerned. The policy approved by the cabinet was based on our treaty obligations and assumed that a request forassistance would have been made by the Laotian Government. TheForeign Secretary should also consider whether, as a first step, theGovernment of Thailand might invite SEATO to send in troops tosafeguard the integrity of their country. Messages in this senseshould be sent to the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet expressed anxiety about the consequences ofmilitary intervention. If we were expected to participate in this,we should know what plans the United States authorities had inmind in the event of any extension or prolongation of the conflict.There seemed to be some doubt whether the Laotian Governmentwould be prepared to request intervention by SEATO. In theabsence of such a request it would be difficult to justify intervention.The Council of SEATO should avoid expressing any intention to intervene in Laos before an appeal for help had been received. Ifthe military, situation deteriorated, the need for intervention might arise before the Soviet Union had replied to the latest proposals fora political settlement. It would be more difficult to justifyintervention if these proposals had not previously been rejected by the Soviet Union. Many of these difficulties would bereduced if substantial SEATO forces, perhaps including theCommonwealth brigade, could be invited into Thailand forthwith.Such reinforcements would give valuable support to the morale ofthe Laotian Government and would demonstrate the resolve ofSEATO to contain the extension of Communist influence. Since itwas out of the question to give political approval in advance formilitary intervention, the most acceptable conclusion of the presentSEATO meeting might be a decision to reinforce Thailand.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The Commonwealth Secretary said that the reference to his conversation with Mr. Krishna Menon which had been included inparagraph 1 (ii) of Foreign Office telegram No. 75 to Trinidad was somewhat misleading. Mr. Menon&apos;s attitude towards military intervention had not in fact been helpful, and this should be made clear to the Prime Minister. On the other hand, the Prime Ministerof India had expressed to Mr. Khrushchev his strong support for theUnited Kingdom proposals for a political settlement.(b) The Prime Minister of Australia had expressed the view that,if intervention became necessary, there would be advantage if thistook place under the auspices of SEATO. There was no reason to doubt that Australia and New Zealand would honour their treaty obligations to the Organisation.(c) The Lord Privy Seal said that urgent study was being givento the handling of this question in the United Nations. Thecircumstances were likely to be such that intervention could bejustified under the terms of the Charter, and in that event the best course would be to inform the Security Council of any action taken.It would be expedient to avoid any course in the United nations which would lead to debate in the General Assembly.The Home Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that it was clear that the Cabinet agreed that our first objective was to securethe acceptance by the Soviet Union of our proposals for a political settlement;
binet Office, S.W.1,27th March, 1961.Meanwhile, the Minister of Defence should instruct UnitedKingdom military representatives in Bangkok to take part in joint planning urgently with the United States representatives there, andhe would have authority to take such measures as were necessary tobring the Commonwealth brigade to a state of greater readiness.The Government would be pressed to undertake not to commitUnited Kingdom forces to military operations in Laos without priordebate in Parliament. It would be sufficient for the present to saythat the Government hoped for a favourable response to their proposals from the Soviet Government, but that they must beprepared to honour their obligations to SEATO.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, if intervention in Laos became necessary, thisshould take place under the auspices of SEATO.(2) Agreed that joint planning for limited military intervention in Laos should now take place urgently between theUnited Kingdom and United States military authorities inBangkok.(3) Took note that the Home Secretary, in consultation with theLord Privy Seal, would arrange for the Cabinefs views and decisions to be conveyed to the Prime Minister andto the Foreign Secretary.(4) Invited the Minister of Defence to send appropriateinstructions to the United Kingdom military authoritiesin Bangkok, and to take such measures as were necessaryto bring the Commonwealth brigade to a state of greaterreadiness.
