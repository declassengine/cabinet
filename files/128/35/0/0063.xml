Commonwealth       2.   The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had alreadyimmigrants     agreed that, in the Second Reading debate on the Commonwealth(Previous        Immigrants Bill, he should make a statement about the application ofReference:      the Bill to the Irish Republic. He now had authority from the PrimeCC. (61) 6ist    Minister of Northern Ireland to make it plain in debate that theConclusions.    Government of Northern Ireland would resent the imposition of anyMmute .)       control over immigration to Great Britain at ports in NorthernIreland.   This might go some way to convince critics of theGovernment that there was no way of controlling immigration fromthe Irish Republic, since it would be generally accepted that it wouldbe impracticable to control the land border between the Irish republic and Northern Ireland.  He had also learned that the Irish RepublicanGovernment would be willing to introduce legislation to enable themto control the admission of immigrants from other commonwealth countries in transit for the United Kingdom, provided that the UnitedKingdom Government refrained from enforcing the provisions in theBill against Irish citizens.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that, in spite of the political pressure, the Government shouldcontinue to stress the practical difficulties of imposing control overimmigration from the Irish Republic. Care should, however, betaken to emphasise that under the terms of the Bill it would be opento the Government to impose this control and that they must reserve the right to do so. It could be pointed out that in the british nationality Act, 1948, Parliament had recognised the special positionof Irish citizens, who were treated for many purposes, includingvoting in elections, as if they were British subjects.The Government would also be open to the criticism that therehad been inadequate consultation with other commonwealth governments on this question. On this point it would be advisable to admit that the extent of consultation had not been as great as could have been wished and to explain that over a long period theGovernment had sought to avoid imposing this control. They hadpostponed a decision to the last possible moment, when terms ofthe Opening Speech had to be settled: and it had not been possibleto give earlier notice of their intentions to other commonwealth governments. In fact, however, those Commonwealth governments which were most affected had not been left in ignorance of thepossibility that this control might have to be introduced.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in the debate on the SecondReading of the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill, to speak on the lines approved in their discussion.Congo 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the congo republic had deteriorated seriously in the last few days.   There had been a previous weakening in the position of Mr. Adoula. the Prime Minister of the reference: Central Government, who had not only failed to secure a meetingCC.(61)62nd with Mr. Tshombe. the Prime Minister of Katanga, about theConclusions. constitutional relations between Katanga and the Central GovernmentMmute 2) jH1, ;,.uj a(s0 ios( control over the Deputy Prime Minister, Mr.Gi/engaments. who was understood to be organising subversive activitiesParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Nuclear *4:    The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumTc$u by the Foreign Secretary (C. (61)1791 about a suggestion by the(Previous United States Government that they might conduct atmosphericReference: nuclear tests at Christmas Island. They had before them a draft of aCC. (61) 6jnd message from the Prime Minister to President Kennedy replying to conclusions.      ,his suggestion.the Prime Minister said that in the light of the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion and of meetings which he had since held to* 1&apos;roviousK icconlcd in a Confidential Annex.Minute 3)in Albertville, in North Katanga. United Nations troops had beensent to Albertville and were seeking to disarm Mr. Gizenga&apos;ssupporters, but this action was resented by the Government of katanga as a violation of their sovereignty. It had also been reportedthat in Kivu Province a number of Italian airmen, who had beenferrying supplies under United Nations auspices, had been attacked by troops under the nominal control of the Central Government.The United Nations authorities were striving to restore order both inAlbertville and in Kivu Province, but the situation generally waschaotic. There was some hope that their influence would be used tobetter effect with the departure of Dr. 0&apos;Brien and the arrival ofMr. Urquhart who, with Mr. Khiari, might have greater success in persuading Mr. Tshombe to co-operate with the Central Government.Opinion at the United Nations in New York had been inflamedby publication of the report of the commission which had inquiredinto the death of Mr. Lumumba, since this placed responsibility forthe murder of Mr. Lumumba partly on the Katanga Government andpartly on President Kasavubu. A resolution had been brought beforethe Security Council which would authorise the United Nationsauthorities to use force for the immediate apprehension and deportation of all foreign mercenaries and hostile elements fromKatanga. This, if passed, would extend the powers of the united nations beyond their present mandate to restore order, and couldnot be supported by the United States Government or by ourselves.The United Kingdom representative was in consultation with hisUnited States colleague on an alternative resolution which would deal with the situation in the Congo more generally and would notconcentrate on Katanga; it would stress the need to use all possible means of conciliation without insisting on further military action.It was not yet clear, however, that agreement could be reached on a formula which would be acceptable to public opinion in this country.On the other hand, in the present atmosphere of the discussions in new York, the prospects of securing support for conciliatory action were not good.In &quot;discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet thatthe best course would be to induce the United States Government tosponsor a resolution which the United Kingdom representative wouldbe able to support. Failing that, the possibilities of deferring actionon anv more violent form of resolution would have to be considered.The Secretary-General had already initiated useful action in the congo, and he might be able to follow this up with more effectiveproposals for conciliation.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.
The Cabinet -Approved the terms of the reply which the Prime minister proposed to send to President Kennedy about the suggestionthai the United States Government might use the facilities at Christinas Island for conducting atmospheric nuclear tests.consider the technical aspects of this problem, he had come to theview that, since any overt preparations on Christmas Island wouldgive rise to criticism from many sections of world opinion, includingpublic opinion in this country, he and President Kennedy should haveconsiderably more information about the nature and purposes of theproposed atmospheric tests before a decision was taken to begin workon Christmas Island. The draft reply which he had prepared was inno sense a commitment to make the facilities at Christmas Islandavailable. It proposed that a small reconnaissance party, composedof two or three representatives from each of the two countries, shouldbe sent forthwith to Christmas Island in strict secrecy to study whatpreparations would be necessary; that expert advisers from both countries should meet at once to prepare a report about the proposed programme of tests; and that on the basis of that report he and president Kennedy should make their individual political judgmentswhether such tests would fall within the public statements which theyhad made on 31st October and 1st November respectively. the message also indicated that his own judgment of this matter would bea stringent one, and that the tests which he had had in mind, whenmaking his statement, were tests directly related to preserving thebalance of the deterrent, e.g., by protecting nuclear weapons againstcounter-measures or by developing anti-missile missiles. The draft message further emphasised that it was of the highest importanceto avoid prejudicing the moral predominance of the West byindulging in nuclear iests which were not absolutely essential. it also indicated that if it were decided, in the light of the judgmentswhich he and President Kennedy would make on the basis of the experts&apos; report, to make the facilities at Christmas Island available,it would then be necessary to conclude a formal agreement whichwould settle the financial and administrative terms of what would ineffect be a joint enterprise and would provide for our experts to have access to the information which the tests would yield.The Cabinet expressed their approval of the terms of the draft message, tit was suggested that it might be desirable to warnPresident Kennedy explicitly that it would be advisable for theUnited States authorities to make alternative arrangements elsewhere,in case Christmas Island could not in the event be made available:but it was agreed that, having regard to the difficulties of president kennedy^ position, this would on balance be inexpedient.It was pointed out that if in due course it were decided tomake the facilities available, a period of several months of preparation and subsequent testing would then ensue during which theGovernments of the United Kingdom and United States would be subjected to keen criticism from public opinion in this and many other countries. It would not be easy to explain convincingly whyfurther tests were essential on military grounds. Moreover, if theUnited States authorities were to undertake atmospheric tests, it was probable that the Soviet Government would in turn resume furthertesting. All these were considerations which should He borne inmind when the experts&apos; report was considered by the Prime Ministerand President Kennedy.
Kenya(previous reference:CC. (61) 61stConclusions.Minute 6)5. The Colonial Secretary said that the minority tribes in Kenyawere increasingly fearful of Kikuyu domination and the Europeansettlers were increasingly concerned about their own future. Theeconomic situation was deteriorating and capital investment waslessening with the growing loss of confidence. In this situation theonly alternative to continuing colonial rule, and providing thenecessary troops to enforce it, was to work for a constitutional conference which would lay down adequate safeguards for minorityinterests. These safeguards should be enshrined in the constitution in such a way as to make it as difficult as possible to override themafter the country achieved independence. A constitution that gaveadequate protection to the African minorities would be likely to afford reasonable protection to the European settlers. He wouldbe in a better position to consider what form these essential safeguardsshould take after his forthcoming visit to Kenya. His aim was tohold the constitutional conference in the early months of 1962.If this constitutional conference was to have any prospect ofsuccess, it would be necessary to remove the disqualification whichat present prevented Kenyatta, and others who had served a sentence of imprisonment of more than two years, from becoming membersof the legislature. Subject to the Cabinet&apos;s agreement, he proposedto announce just before his departure for Kenya that thisdisqualification would be abolished.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement that thebest hope of resolving the potentially dangerous situation in Kenyalay in working for a constitutional conference in the early part of 1962.They also agreed that, if such a conference were to have any prospectof success, it was necessary to remove the disqualification which applied to Kenyatta, repugnant though this step would be to manysections of opinion in this country.Serious doubts were however expressed about the likelihood that agreement would be reached, at a constitutional conference,on safeguards which would be regarded as satisfactory by the minority interests in Kenya. Moreover, even if safeguards wereentrenched in a constitution, there could be no assurance that theywould rjot be illegally overthrown by the majority party once Kenyahad become independent. Nevertheless, a satisfactory constitution,which might in some respects follow the United States model, wouldprovide at least a legal obstacle to the abolition of minority rights, anda study should be undertaken urgently of the best form of constitution for this purpose.It was recognised that the African minorities, and certainly theEuropean settlers, were likely to feel that the only reliable safeguardwould be the continuing presence of British troops or of security forces under the control of British officers. But. given the leadership of the majority African party, it was unlikely that British personnel would want or would be allowed to remain after independence. Thesituation would he different from that in Tanganyika, where thePrime Minister was prepared to rely on British officers to maintainlaw and order.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The possibility of maintaining some British forces in Kenyaafter independence should be seriously considered. Even if theywere retained only for training purposes, and even though their value in an emergency might be limited to rescuing European settlers,their presence would give some degree of confidence.ih) It was suggested that no reliable safeguards could beprovided for European or other minorities after independenceunless provision were made for land resettlement which the majorityAfrican party accepted as equitable. European settlers could not hope to retain their existing holdings intact, even though it was truethat the economy of Kenya depended on the agricultural productionof these holdings.
MalayaGreaterMalaysia(previous reference:C.C.(61)55.!Conclusions.Minute 5)6. The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had previously agreed that discussions should be held with the PrimeMinister of Malaya about the project for a Greater Malaysia. this project had now been examined by the Ministers concerned, andexploratory discussions with the Prime Minister of Malaya were to begin on 20th November.Broad agreement had been reached between the Governmentsof Malaya and Singapore about the terms for a merger. The mainremaining problems which would arise in the coming discussions were first, the need to retain our defence facilities in the territories concerned, including those necessary for the fulfilment of our obligations to the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation and for the deployment of the Commonwealth brigade; and, second, the meansof securing the agreement of the Governments and peoples of north borneo and Sarawak, in addition to the concurrence of theGovernment of Brunei, to their association in a Greater Malaysia.As regards the former, the Prime Minister of Malaya no doubtrealised that our ability to fulfil our obligations to the South-east asia Treaty Organisation was an essential element in the defence ofthe whole area, including Malaya, but he had indicated that he would seek to impose limits on our freedom in the future to use our existing facilities in Singapore for this purpose. It might be that i* would bemore acceptable to him if these facilities were to be regarded in future as available to Commonwealth forces in the context of a defence agreement for the whole area in which Australia and New Zealandwould join.The Prime Minister said that it seemed desirable to proceed without delay with the exploratory discussions since an associationof all the territories concerned, if it could be secured by agreement and in such a way as to provide for our defence requirements,represented the best hope of providing for the future stability of thearea and avoiding a deterioration of the position in Singapore.The Cabinet -Took note of these statements.CC. 63 (61)(c) If the European settlers decided to leave, through fear of thefuture or because their land was expropriated, the Governmentwould be under heavy pressure to pay them compensation. Thiswould be a precedent for similar claims by settlers displaced fromthe Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland.(d) The financial implications of the various courses whichevents might take in Kenya would have to be worked out by thetime a constitutional conference was held. The cost of maintainingBritish forces there, meeting claims for compensation, and providingfinancial assistance to an independent Kenya could involve, in theaggregate, an intolerable burden to the Exchequer.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the disqualification from membership of thelegislature which applied in Kenya to anyone who had served a sentence of imprisonment of more than twoyears should be removed; and authorised the colonial secretary to make an announcement to this effect in thefollowing week.(2) Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should aim at conveninga constitutional conference on Kenya in the early part of1962, with the object of reaching satisfactory safeguards for minority interests.
industrial disputes(previous reference:CC (61) 28thConclusions,Minute 4)Airport Strike7. The Minister of Aviation said that the British overseas airways Corporation had recently granted to loaders and other staffconcerned with apron services at London Airport a wage increase of2\d. per hour. Men engaged in comparable work for his department had gone on strike because of the Governmenfs refusal to grant thema similar increase. In agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Minister of Labour, he had maintained that the grant ofthis pay increase would involve a breach in the Governments policyof the wage pause. A proposal was now under consideration by theunions concerned which would enable a number of the men concerned to be graded as baggage masters, which would entitle them to increased pay. It was possible that this solution might be accepted and that the men might be recommended to return to work on thefollowing day.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Aviation.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,16th November, 1961.
