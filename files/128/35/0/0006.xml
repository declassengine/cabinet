industrial 1.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterDisputes        of Labour (C. (61) 19) about the organisation of the tally clerks inTally Clerks    the London docks.(previous reference: The Minister of Labour said that, when the London Dock LabourC.C. (61) 3rd Board informed union officials of their intention to allocate tallyConclusions. clerks and docker-checkers to particular sectors of the London docks,Minute 7) there was much more resistance to this proposal than had been expected. The Stevedores Union had said that they would instruct their members to refuse allocation, and this might well cause a strikethroughout the London docks. Despite the assurances previouslyreceived from the leaders of the Transport and General WorkersUnion, the regional officials of the union had informed the LondonBoard that in the event of a further strike they would support thetally clerks. The Government had no power to direct the national dock Labour Board to bring this scheme into operation and in viewof the unions&apos; attitude it was unlikely that the National Board would urge the London Board to do so. It might therefore be preferable to rely on the alternative course of increasing the number of tallyclerks in order to break the strength of their monopoly. It might bepossible to pursue this alternative without the risk of a widespreadstrike in the London docks.The Minister of Labour said that he was meeting Mr. Cousinslater in the day to discuss the attitude of the Transport and general works Union to this problem, but he had no reason to suppose that he would be able to recommend any different course to theCabinet as a result of that conversation.The Cabinet-Agreed that, in the absence of official support from theUnions concerned, the Government could not press for theintroduction of the scheme for allocating tally clerks to particular sectors of the London docks.2. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were greatlyindebted to the Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretaryfor their patience and perseverance in working out proposals whichcould be put to the Northern Rhodesian Constitutional Conference.The Colonial Secretary was expected to table the governments plans at the Conference on the following day: further delay in doing so would increase the risk of disorder in the territory. It wouldnot be possible to satisfy either the claim of the African representativesfor a clear African majority in the Legislative Council or the desire of the Europeans that effective control of the Government of theterritory should remain in the hands of locally-elected Europeans.In seeking a middle course between these points of view regard mustbe paid to the danger of prejudicing the constitutional settlement for Southern Rhodesia which had still to be approved by a referendum.In all these circumstances the Ministers concerned had agreedto support a plan under which the Legislative Council of northern rhodesia would include 45 elected members, of whom 15 wouldbe constituency members elected by upper roll voters, 15 would beconstituency members elected by lower roll voters, and 15 would benational members elected by voters of both rolls combined. Theelection of the national members would be determined by averagingthe percentages of votes secured on each of the two rolls, subject tothe proviso that each candidate would have to obtain a minimumpercentage of the votes cast on each roll. This scheme would notexplicitly provide either parity or a majority for either race: on theSECRET58960-1 b 2Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (61) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)
contrary it would make it necessary for the political parties to seeksupport from both races; it would encourage a non-racial political system, in accordance with the concept of a multi-racial society, andwould discourage extremism by any party. The Prime Minister ofthe Federation, Sir Roy Welensky, had been brought to see the merits of this proposal. He was now trying to persuade the Prime Ministerof Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, to accept the scheme.It was likely that the results of their private discussions would be known later in the day.The Colonial Secretary said that the present proposals or somesimilar variation of parity between Europeans and Africans weredistinctly preferable to a scheme which embodied the racial conceptby giving a majority, or token majority, to either race. He had alwaysbelieved that Sir Roy Welensky would not persist in his oppositionto a scheme that gave parity of treatment to both races. Indeed, thepresent proposals were a challenge to the United Federal Party, whichpurported to be a moderate multi-racial party. Apart from the composition of the Legislative Council a number of difficult questions would still have to be settled, including the extent of the franchisefor the lower roll, which it was thought might be increased to about70,000, and the composition of the Executive Council.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Sir Edgar Whiteheadwas understandably concerned lest the proposed constitutional settlement for Southern Rhodesia should be rejected in the referendum, which had to be held on the basis of the existingelectorate. This settlement included safeguards against racial discrimination in the form of a bill of rights and a constitutionalcouncil which could delay discriminatory legislation. If the settlement where rejected in the referendum Sir Edgar Whitehead&apos;s Governmentwould be replaced by the Dominion Party, who were pledged tosecession from the Federation.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the proposals outlined for the composition of the LegislativeCouncil in Northern Rhodesia. The electoral arrangements wereadmittedly somewhat complex, and it would be important to ensurethat the advantages of the scheme were properly presented. It wasin accordance with the concept of a multi-racial partnership in central africa for which the Government were pledged to work. nevertheless it was recognised that African reactions to the proposals might behostile. Every effort would be made to get them to examine theproposals with moderation, but there was bound to be some risk ofan emergency developing in Northern Rhodesia. There was alsoa danger that Sir Edgar Whitehead might feel that, if he were to acquiesce in these proposals, he would lose his referendum; and he might decide to anticipate this situation by forcing the immediatesecession of Southern Rhodesia. If, on the other hand, he decided to await the referendum, the Dominion Party might be brought to power; and again secession was likely to result. There was also thedanger that, if a Southern Rhodesian Government decided to secede,they might attempt to seize control of the copper belt in northern rhodesia.The Prime Minister said that, despite the serious dangers thatthe situation held, it was the view of the Cabinet that, subject to furtherinformation about the views of Sir Roy Welensky and Sir EdgarWhitehead, the Colonial Secretary should put forward proposals onthe lines indicated at the plenary session of the Conference on northern rhodesia on the following day. The proposals would not at thisstage be presented as an imposed solution, and they would not bemade public Jt would however be advisable to be ready to presentthe advantages of the scheme, as the best compromise that could be worked out in the interests of moderation and the concept of a multi-racial partnership.

In the light of any further messages fromSir Roy Welensky and Sir Edgar Whitehead, it might be necessary for
the Cabinet to consider the proposals again at a meeting on thefollowing day before they were tabled at the Conference.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would consider, in thelight of further information on the likely reactions in theFederation, whether the Cabinet should give furtherconsideration, at a meeting on the following day, to thelatest proposals for constitutional development in northern rhodesia.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, agreed that those proposalsafforded a reasonable basis for constitutional advance inNorthern Rhodesia.capital punishment(previous reference:CM. (56) 69thConclusions,Minute 2)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 20) on capital punishment.The Home Secretary said that he was subject to continuingpressure on this subject both on the general question of amending the law and on individual capital cases.The Cabinet first considered the general question. On this therewere conflicting pressures from people who urged that the death penalty should be available for a wider range of murders, and fromothers who believed that capital punishment should be abolishedaltogether and the feelings on either side were strongly held. Inthe present Parliament there would be no clear majority for eithercourse. In these circumstances the Government had no alternative but to leave the existing law unchanged for the time being.It had been contemplated that the position would be reviewedafter an experimental period of five years from the passing of theHomicide Act, 1957. The Government should not however becomecommitted to holding a fresh enquiry in 1962. Nothing further shouldbe said to encourage the assumption that a further review wouldbe undertaken as soon as this five-year period had ended.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the Home Secretary&apos;s view that the existing law relating to capital punishment must be left unchangedfor the time being; and agreed that nothing should besaid to encourage the assumption that a further reviewwould be undertaken in 1962.The Cabinet next considered the Opposition amendment to the criminal Justice Bill, which would have the effect of raising theminimum age for the death penalty from 18 to 21. They agreed that,in view of the prevalence of crimes of violence by young people, this amendment should be resisted. They were informed that theamendment might be carried against Government advice on theCommittee Stage of the Bill. In that event the Cabinet should considerwhether this proposal should be contested further on the Report Stage.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that during the Committee Stage of the criminla justice Bill the Government spokesman should resistamendments designed to raise the minimum age for the death penalty from 18 to 21 years.The Cabinet then discussed the demand for a fresh enquiry intothe case of Timothy John Evans. The Colonial Secretary said thatit was arguable that Evans would not have been convicted of the murder of his child if the court had had before them evidence now
available which suggested that his wife had been murdered by Christie.More generally, it seemed possible that Evans would not have been convicted if the court had been aware of the other murders committed by Christie at 10, Rillington Place. The Home Secretary said that,even if this were so, there could be no possibility at this date ofestablishing that Evans was innocent of the murder of the child.There could therefore be no question of giving him a Free Pardon,and there seemed to be no point in holding a fresh enquiry.Discussion showed that there was general support in the cabinet for the view put forward by the Home Secretary. It was howeversuggested that, in any public statement, it would be inexpedient torefer to a need to establish Evans&apos; innocence. It would be preferable to refer to the representations on his behalf as directed to proving that he had been wrongfully convicted.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that no fresh enquiry should be held into the case ofTimothy John Evans.Finally, the Cabinet took note of the growing tendency in theHouse of Commons to seek opportunities to debate the exercise of the prerogative of mercy in particular capital cases. On this theyendorsed the view expressed in paragraph 7 of C. (61) 20.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that every effort should be made to avoid discussions in Parliament on the exercise of the prerogative of mercyin capital cases.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had agreed withthe Minister of Agriculture that the representatives of the agricultureindustry should be offered an increase of  3 millions in the total levelof the price guarantees for the coming financial year. this represented an estimated increase of  10 millions in support costs forthe coming year over the estimated out-turn for the current year.This offer seemed necessary in order to prevent a breakdown of negotiations at the outset of the review.The President of the Board of Trade said that this offer wouldbe regarded by other countries as additional protection for ouragriculture and would be harmful to our commercial relations andour export prospects.The Minister of Agriculture said that the farmers&apos; representatives were likely to claim full recoupment of the increase of  19 millions which was expected in their costs. It was unlikely that an agreed settlement could be reached on the basis of the offer which it was now proposed to make and he would probably need to seek authorityto increase it at a later stage in the discussions. It was not likely that a settlement on this basis would prejudice negotiations with othercountries, since it was intended to reduce the guaranteed prices ofmany commodities and to concentrate the increase in subsidy onbeef production.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Agriculture to report in due courseon the progress of the annual review of farm prices.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th February, 1961.Farm price review,19.61-62
