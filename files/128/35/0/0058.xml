C.C. 58 (61),Foreign 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that tension in Berlin hadAffaire increased on the previous day, when East German authorities hadBerlin sought to prevent American civilians from crossing into East Berlin(Previous without passes. Allied troops had made a show of force in protestReference: against this action; but a meeting was to be held that day in BerlinC.C. (61) 56th to discuss the situation. The United States authorities believed that conclusions. it would be resolved, in view of the assurance they had received fromMinute l)       the Soviet Foreign Minister that existing procedures in Berlin would remain unchanged so long as discussions were proceeding with a viewto finding a basis for negotiation.The Foreign Secretary added that it had been the practice forBritish civilians voluntarily to show passes when crossing into EastBerlin.congo republic(previous reference :C.C. (61) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)Laos(previous reference :C.C. (61) 55thConclusions.Minute 1)The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Ministerof the provincial Government of Katanga, had now sent two juniorofficials to Elizabethville. Though this was not a very forthcomingapproach there were indications that Mr. Adoula, the Prime Ministerof the Central Congo Government, might be ready to negotiate now,because he was becoming apprehensive about the intentions of Mr.Gizenga, the Deputy Prime Minister. Steps were therefore beingtaken to ensure that Mr. Tshombe realised that this might be afavourable moment for negotiations.The Foreign Secretary said that the King of Laos was nowwilling to accept Prince Souvanna Phouma as Prime Minister of a united Laotian Government. He was however reluctant to makeany public declaration to this effect until decisions had been taken on the allocation of portfolios in such a Government.Nuclear Tests(previous references:C.C. (60) 28thConclusions.Minute 2 andC.C. (61) 49thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister referred to the widespread public anxietyaroused by the recent Russian series of nuclear tests culminating inthe explosion in the atmosphere of a bomb with a yield of between30 and 50 megatons. In the forthcoming Debate on the Address hewould be expected to define the attitude of the United Kingdomtowards the resumption of nuclear tests. He was in consultation with president Kennedy, and he hoped that it might be possible to reach an Anglo-American agreement on the line to be taken publicly onthis question. His own provisional view was that the Western powers should not stage further nuclear tests in the atmosphere for the mere purpose of outbidding the Russians in propaganda terms. Theyshould confine themselves to such tests as were strictly necessary, on military grounds, to preserve the balance of nuclear deterrence.Many of these could be conducted underground.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theview expressed by the Prime Minister. E\en if it were necessary forthe Western Powers to make further tests in the atmosphere formilitary purposes, it would be preferable that these should be deferred for a time so as to avoid giving any impression that they were beingmade for propaganda purposes. It was understood that the testswhich the United States authorities might wish to make in the nearfuture could be made underground.The Cabinet-Took note of the view expressed by the Prime Minister andof the points made in discussion.
The Cabinet (I) Approved in principle the proposal of the Secretary ofState for War for the creation of a voluntary Reservewithin the Territorial Army for service in a time of tension.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War. in consultation withthe Minister of Defence, the Chief Secretary, Treasury,and the Minister of Labour, to formulate a detailed plan for this purpose.MethaneGas(previous reference :CC (61) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandumby the Minister of Power (C. (61) 144) about a proposal by the gas council to import liquefied methane gas from French North Africa.They also had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary(C. (61) 165) reporting the conclusions reached by a meeting ofMinisters which he had been asked to convene to give furtherconsideration to this proposal.The Home Secretary recalled that in the Cabinets earlier discussion particular doubts had been expressed about the cos? of thisproposal in foreign exchange and about the security of.Algeria as a source of supply. It had since been ascertained tint, if liquid methanewere not imported, i( would probably be necessary to import insteadpetroleum-based gases which would be at least as costly in terms offoreign exchange. If the Algerian supplies should be cut o!T. the installations in this country could be converted to use petroleum-based gases or. in the longer term, supplies of methane gas fromNigeria and other sources. Treasury Ministers had satisfied themselves that there was a good case, on economic and financial rounds, for the methane project. Its rejection would be inconsistent with the Government&apos;s declared policy that the nationalised industries should have the greatest possible commercial freedom consistent withtheir other obligations. Private industry could import methane freelyand it would be wroini to denv this freedom to the Gas Council.Defence 3.   The Secretary of State for War said that, as a result of army further consultation with the Minister of Defence, he now proposedManpower      to seek power to create within the Territorial Army a special Reserve(Previous       of volunteers willing to be called up for service in a time of tensionReference :     without the need for a Proclamation. This Reserve would be open,CC. (61) 56th   up to a total of 15,000 men, to National Service volunteers in theConclusions.    Territorial Army or other members of the Territorial Army who had minute 4)       completed at least a year&apos;s service. They would be required to accept,for periods of one year at a time, a liability to be called up for service at home or abroad for a maximum of six months. There would be advantage in forming this Reserve within the Territorial Army, whichhad a well-founded training organisation, rather than in the ArmyEmergency Reserve. The Chairman of the Council of Territorial and auxiliary Forces Associations would support the plan.   It wouldprovide fully trained men who would form an effective reinforcementfor the British forces in Germany.Provision for the creation of this Reserve could be included inthe forthcoming legislation for the retention of National Servicemenin full-time service and for the recall of part-time National Servicemenfor further full-time servicj.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the details of this plan should be considered by the Treasury. It seemed likely to involvecontinuing expenditure of about  4 million a year, and this should be accomodated within the total already approved for defence expenditure as a whole. The Minister of Defence said that he would do his best to secure this and hoped it could be done.
CoalPrice Policy(previous reference:CC. (61) 35thConclusions.Minute 3)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C. (61) 166) on coal prices.The Minister of Power said that the accumulated deficit of theNational Coal Board was now far greater than their internal reserves and there were continuing losses in a number of divisions, which were particularly heavy in Scotland, Wales and the North-West of England.The Board had therefore proposed to increase coal prices in scotland by an average of nearly 15s. a ton from 1st January, 1962, to increasethe price of South Wales anthracite and boiler fuel by 30s. a ton (ofwhich &apos;0s. would become effective at the beginning of the followingmonth and  1 would be added in the course of next year), and toincrease the price of coal in the North-Western division by 6s. a tonfrom 1st January, 1962. These increases should lead to some reduction in demand, which would make it easier to close downhigh-cost pits. The Board were also considering whether otherselective price increases should be made to eliminate other losses onits operations.Although the selective price increases proposed were admittedlysevere, it should be borne in mind that substantial differences inprices, both at-the pithead and for delivered coal, already existed.The Chairman of the Board was strongly opposed to any generalincreases in coal prices, on the grounds that such an increase would impair the confidence of industry in the stability of coal prices and encourage more users to turn to oil. and that it would also increasethe difficulties of the low-cost coalfields in competing with other sources of energy. In the light of (he White Paper hi the financialand Economic Obligations of the Nationalised Industries (Omul.1337) it would be difficult to deny the Board commercial freedom tomake price increases which they thought necessary.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that urgent action was needed to check the increasing losses of the Board. The Scottish division was losing 117 million a year, which meant in effect that the industrythere was being subsidised at the rate of t-liX) a year for each minor.In view of (he existing differences in prices, the Boards proposals didnot involve am change of principle. The Government had recognised,in the While Paper, that nationalised industries nuiot have freedom tomake upward price adjustments especially where their prices wereartificiall\ low. Nevertheless he recognised th it the proposed increases were severe particularly in respect of Scotland.   It might be possible6006G-6D 3CC. 58 (61)particularly when their aim was to secure a substantial reduction in costs.In discussion it was noted that the Chairman of the national coal Board had seemed to be unaware that this project for importingmethane gas would not displace the need for a Lurgi plant. It shouldbe made clear to him that there would still be room for a large Lurgiplant in the Gas Councils programme.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal put forward in C. (61) 144 for theimport of methane gas by the Gas Council.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to consult with the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster on the form in which thisdecision should be made known to Parliament.(3) Took note that the Minister of Power would explain to theChairman of the National Coal Board the basis on whichthe decision had been reached.
to impose them gradually, and to phase some to a later date forexample, an increase in the price of house coal could be introducedwith less hardship during the summer. The increase proposed in theNorth-Western division would make it clear that Scotland was notbeing singled out for exceptional treatment.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the Board&apos;s proposals would have most serious social and economic implications forScotland. The present programme of pit closures envisaged thereduction in the number of jobs in Scottish coalfields from 69,000to 60,000 by 1965, but the price increases now proposed, which wouldmake further closures inevitable, would entail a reduction to 40,000by that date. The consequences of higher coal prices would be mostharmful to the Governmenfs policy for encouraging industry to settle in Scotland. For instance, it would add about  1^ million a year tothe cost of Messrs. Colville&apos;s new strip mill. Moreover these increases would come at a time when Scottish industry was having to bear theburden of revaluation and rerating. There would be substantialadditions to the cost of gas and electricity, and also cement. Theeffect on private householders, including old age pensioners and those on national assistance, would be particularly severe. While it was truethat price differentials already existed, these were based in the mainon quality differences or on historic grounds; they did not arise fromdifferences in the costs of production. The uneconomic prospects ofthe Scottish coal industry arose from the existence of the nationalwage structure.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The increases in coal prices which the Cabinet had authorised in the past had not secured the financial stability of theindustry. The Cabinet had previously rejected proposals fordifferential prices, on the ground that it was undesirable for a nationalised industry to discriminate sharply, in its prices, betweenthe different sections of the community.(/)) The proper long-term solution lay in the elimination of uneconomic high-cost production. This pointed to the need for amore extensive programme of closing uneconomic pits. But theexisting programme was already on a considerable scale; andsomething Tike three-quarters of the Scottish pits would have to be closed if Scottish coal production as a whole were to be madeeconomic. Moreover, there was a danger that, if demand were notreduced, the closure of uneconomic pits would lead to the import of coal, which would either be at a high cost because of transport charges or would be of disadvantage to the balance of payments.(c) A rapid run-down of the coal industry in Scotland wouldmean that much of the heavy social investment that had been madein certain areas would be wasted. On the other hand, it would be unreasonable to burden the coal industry with the expense ofmaintaining uneconomic production for social reasons.id) It was possible to exaggerate the effect which increases in coal prices would have on the policy of attracting industry to Scotland.There was a good prospect that industries which did not depend on coal would settle there. This represented the best hope for theindustrial future of Scotland.(c) There was genera) agreement that the objections of theChairman of the Board to a general price increase were well founded.It would be undesirable, especially in view of the promise of greatercommercial freedom for nationalised industries in the recent white paper, to urge him to change his view on this point.if) The possibihu should be considered &quot;hat the Trades UnionCongress might he persuaded to accent some adjustment in thenational wage sirucluie so as to improve the economic prospects ofcoal production in Scotland and similar areas.
national insurance(previous reference :CC. (59) 11thConclusions,Minute 5)FamilyAllowancesforApprentices6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Pensions and National Insurance (C. (61) 167) and the Minister ofLabour (C. (61) 170) on a proposal to fix a limit of earnings above which family allowances would not be payable in respect of apprentices.The Minister of Pensions and National Insurance said that forthe purposes of family allowances an apprentice was defined as aperson &quot; not in receipt of earnings which provide him, wholly orsubstantially, with a livelihood&quot;. The National InsuranceCommissioner had ruled that a child could be regarded as notin receipt of earnings providing him wholly or substantially with alivelihood if his earnings were less than, for example, 89s. 6d. a weekwhen under 18. The Minister proposed, as an economy measure,that provision should be made in the National Insurance Bill to specify for this purpose an earnings limit of 40s. This would reducethe number of apprentices qualifying for family allowances from75,000 to about 20.000 and would result in a saving to the exchequer of a little over  1$ million a year. This proposal would provokecontroversy in Parliament. It would be represented as contrary tothe Governments policy of encouraging apprenticeship in skilledtrades. On the other hand, the decision of the National InsuranceCommissioner gave rise to serious anomalies in the comparison between family allowance arrangements and other arrangements inthe field of national insurance and national assistance in particular the earnings rule for national insurance purposes which pre uued a wife earning more than 4()s. a week from being treated :is a dependent.It was plainly not in accordance with the spirit of the original family allowances scheme that allowances should be paid to children who could make a substantial contribution to the family income; andas the amount of the-allowance was not large (8s. a week where theapprentice was a member of a two-child family and His. in other cases) it was open to doubt whether many prospective apprenticeswould in practice be discouraged from learning skilled trades.In discussion attention was drawn to the danger that the proposal would affect adversely, not only the tlow of apprentices, but also thenumber of apprenticeships provided, which was a matter of special importance in helping to secure employment lor the large numbersof school-leavers who would be entering industry in the next fewCC. 58 (61)The Prime Minister said that a combination of measures wouldprobably be required for the solution of this difficult problem. on balance, the Cabinet seemed ready to accept some differentiationsin coal prices based on variation in costs of production. But theproposed increases were exceptionally severe, and should if possiblebe limited or phased, even if this entailed a direct government subsidy specifically attributable to the high cost of production incertain regions. It might also be necessary to consider specialconcessions for certain industries, including those which had been encouraged to settle in Scotland, for whom the proposed increases would have serious industrial effects.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Power, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;discussion, to consider this problem further, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Chief Secretary,Treasury, the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and theMinister without Portfolio, and to submit revised proposalsfor consideration by the Cabinet.
ShippingNuclearPropulsionforMerchantShips(previous references :C.C. (61) 39thConclusions.Minute 5 andC.C. (61) 56thConclusions,Minute 5)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (61) 169) about nuclear propulsion for merchant ships.The Minister of Transport recalled that the Cabinet had already decided against the construction of a nuclear-powered ship at thepresent stage. The Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Minister for Science, had reviewed the civil research anddevelopment programme of the Atomic Energy Authority and had approved the inclusion, within the Authority&apos;s programme, of an initial programme of some  3 million in respect of marine nuclear propulsion. He proposed to make an appropriate announcement inParliament early in the coming session.In discussion it was agreed that the announcement should takethe form of a written answer to a Parliamentary Question and thatin its wording care should be taken to avoid any implication that theGovernment were committed to the development of a prototypevessel.The Cabinet(I) Endorsed the approval given by the Chancellor of theExchequer for an initial programme of some  3 million for research on marine nuclear propulsion.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to consult the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy ufLancaster on the terms in which this decision should be announced in a written reply to a Parliamentary Question.years. Any action which might increase the tendency for young people to seek high wages in unskilled employment was socially and economically undesirable: apprentices were not, and should not be,treated as if they were normal wage-earners. Would it not be bettereither to fix in the Bill an earnings level which would have a lessdrastic effect or to take power to fix the limit by regulation?The general view of the Cabinet was that, if any action were tobe taken on the lines of the proposal, it would be better to fix thelimit of 40s. in the Bill itself. To adopt any-other level would reducethe saving to the Exchequer and would not remove the anomalies.Regulations would provide recurring occasions for pressure anddebate.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the proposal ought tobe considered in the light of the Governments general policy ofsecuring reductions in supply expenditure. &quot;If the opportunity wasnot taken of making savings such as this, there would be smallprospect of attaining the objective of reducing supply expenditure by  100 million in 1962-63. The adoption of an earnings limit of40s. would do no more than bring family allowance arrangementsinto line with the arrangements for child allowances in income taxlaw.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C. (61) 167 that provision shouldbe made in the National Insurance Bill for a specificearnings limit of 40s. for family allowances for apprentices.(2) Invited the Minister of Pensions and National Insurance, inconsultation with the Minister of Labour, to arrange forthe Trades Union Congress to be informed, shortly beforethe introduction of the National Insurance Bill, that itwould include such a provision.
wages policy(previous reference :CC. (61) 53rdConclusions.Minute 7)8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the wage increases proposed by a number of Wages Councils which could claim that commitments had been accepted before his statement of 25th Julywere to be brought into operation from 1st January, 1962. TheMinister of Labour was now proposing to confirm a wage increaseawarded by their Wages Council to workers in the sack and bagmaking trades. This would be the first occasion on which the minister had confirmed a Wages Council award on a claim in respect of which no commitment had been accepted before 25th July. He proposedthat this increase should be effective from 2nd April, 1962. Thiswould support the argument that the recent Orders for increasesoperating from 1st January were special cases in which a priorcommitment had been accepted. It would also help to avoid any impression that the period of the &quot; pause &quot; in wage and salary increases was not to last beyond the end of 1961.The Cabinet Approved the proposal of the Minister of Labour that the wage increase awarded to workers in the sack and bagmaking trades should become effective from 2nd April, 1962.Euston 9.   The Prime Minister said that, since the Cabinefs discussionStation on 17th October, he had received an influential deputation, led byDoric Arch the President of the Royal Academy, which had urged that the(Previous demolition of the Doric Arch at Euston Station should be postponedReference: so that further consideration might be given to the possibility ofCC. (61) 56th re-erecting it on another site.   It was evident that, if the cabinet conclusions. adhered to their earlier decision to demolish this Arch, they would minute 7) encounter strong criticism from persons interested in the preservation of buildings of historical or architectural interest.Discussion showed that, despite this development, it remained the view of the Cabinet that the balance oi public advantage lay onthe side of proceeding with the demolition of this Arch.The Cabinet Reaffirmed their earlier decision that the demolition ofthe Doric Arch at Euston Station should not be delayed.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,26th October, 1961.
