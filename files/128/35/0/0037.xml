EconomicSituation(previous reference:C.C. (61) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)C.C. 37 (61)*1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (6J) 89) on the current economicsituation. A further memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C. (61) 88) covering a five-year plan for public expenditurehad also been circulated to the Cabinet.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the economic situation was more serious than at any time during the past ten years. Theinternal pressure was already high and was likely to increase considerably in the coming year; and at the same time the strain on the balance of payments had led to a rapid deterioration in the external monetary position, which had so far been concealed by theassistance we had received from the European central banks. Thecentral banks were anxious to maintain the stability of sterling, andwould be likely to be willing to continue to help, provided that wewere seen to be taking adequate steps to bring the situation under control.The Chancellor of the Exchequer made a full statisticalpresentation of the current and prospective difficulties of the economicsituation. He then explained the various remedial measures discussed in C. (61) 89 and gave his preliminary views on each.In the discussion which followed the main points raised were as follows:(a) The Foreign Secretary said that he saw serious objection tothe suggestion that we might announce that we could not afford to spend more than  25 millions in 1962-63 in foreign exchange tomaintain our troops in Europe. The implication /that we might haveto withdraw our forces would weaken the North Atlantic Alliance,at a time when it was specially important that it should present a united front in the crisis which was likely to arise over Berlin. Itwould also weaken the influence which we could otherwise exercisewithin the Alliance to secure a reasonable approach to that problem.He would, however, be prepared to put our balance of payments difficulties to the North Atlantic Council, in accordance with theprovisions of the Western European Union Treaty. The Minister ofDefence supported this view. It would not be possible for us, in the face of current Soviet policies, to abrogate our responsibilities underthe Treaty. It might be preferable to seek to meet our financial difficulties by proposing some foreign exchange pooling arrangementwithin the North Atlantic Alliance. Hitherto we had hesitated tosuggest this, since our foreign exchange receipts on account of forces stationed in this country were at present in excess of the paymentswe made on account of our troops in Europe. An analysis had beenmade of the possible means of reducing oversea military expenditure to about  200 millions a year. He hoped that further examinationmight show that the saving which the Chancellor required on this account might be achieved by a radical change in our military strategywhich would allow us to reduce certain existing commitments abroad;but it was evident that no substantial saving could in any event beachieved quickly.l^he Prime Minister said that, while it would not be expedient atthe present time to threaten to reduce our forces in Europe, it wouldbe possible to give notice to our allies that, because of our adverse balance of payments, we could not continue to bear in the next financial year the full cost of our existing commitments. In sayingthis, we would make it clear that we would not act in any way whichwould weaken the Alliance in the face of Soviet threats over Berlin.(b) There was general agreement that, since it would take at least two months to re-create the necessary machinery to operate import
controls, even on a limited scale, and since restriction of importswithout a rationing scheme might actually add to the inflationary pressure, it would not be practicable to secure by import controls any immediate reduction in oversea expenditure. On the other hand,there was some doubt whether balance of payments difficulties of thecurrent order could be surmounted in the long run without somecontrol over imports. The Government might also be open to criticism if foreign currencies continued to be used for the import ofluxury goods when severe internal restrictive measures were being applied. It was suggested that it might be possible to limit certainluxury imports by selective quotas.(c) The Minister of Agriculture said that he could not accept thenecessity of announcing a standstill on agricultural support, as partof a policy of restraining the growth of public expenditure to keep pace with that of the gross national product. The rise in the cost of exchequer support for agriculture was due to higher production athome, which was beneficial to the balance of payments, and to thereduction of market prices which was a consequence of the increasing pressure of supplies from abroad. The decline in world food pricesmade it necessary to contemplate adjusting the basis of our agricultural support policy; and such an adjustment would benecessary in any case if we were to join the European economic community. But, unless our policies were adjusted, for example,by the introduction of import levies, a decision to hold exchequer support to agriculture at the present level would entail a disproportionate reduction in the income of the farming community.This view was supported by a number of other Ministers.The President of the Board of Trade said that, while there was no existing power to control imports on general grounds, anti-dumping duties could be imposed in appropriate cases. He proposed in thecoming week to subject imports of barley to anti-dumping duties if the exporting countries, notably the Soviet Union, would not acceptvoluntary restrictions.(d) There was general agreement that, since the necessary machinery existed, it would be advisable to control the growth of direct investment in the non-sterling area, on the lines indicate a inC. (61) 89. Furthermore, for psychological reasons at least, it wouldbe helpful to encourage a higher level of remittances of profits fromoversea investment. It might be possible to arrange that suchremittances would not be taxed in this country unless they were distributed.(e) It was generally agreed that measures to encourage invisibleearnings, especially from shipping, should be examined. Retaliatorydiscrimination against foreign shipping might be advisable, and wecould insist on British shipping being used more widely for tradearising from our provision of oversea aid.(/) There was genera! agreement with the view expressed by theChancellor of the Exchequer that, with the prospect that the nextwage round would otherwise result in a 6-7 per cent, increase in wage rates, the Government should make a further appeal for the exerciseof restraint in wage claims. Although the Governmenfs hands wereto some extent tied by existing arbitration and other agreements, itwas most important that a firm lead should be given in wage negotiations in the public sector. Some means should be found of presenting the Governments view on this question; but it would beeven more valuable if exhortation could be supplemented by firmaction by the Government on some wages claim in the public sector.The Minister of Education suggested that further thought shouldoe given to the possibility of an announcement that the Governmentwould, over the next two years, put a specified and arbitrary limit towage increases in the public sector. He would be prepared toconsider withholding his agreement to the increase in teachers&apos; salaries
*2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Ruler of Kuwait had now made a formal request for our assistance to prevent a threatenedattack by Iraqi forces. This would enable us to make certainprecautionary dispositions of our military forces, which would give us a chance of beating back an attack by Iraqi forces at or near thefrontier of Kuwait. He had also received a message from the UnitedStates Secretary of State to the effect that the United StatesGovernment were in full agreement with our views about the situationwhich had been offered by the local authorities, and of insisting on a lower minimum salary which would restrict the increase in Englandand Wales to the level already conceded to teachers in Scotland.(g) It was pointed out that wage restraint would be less necessary if a substantial increase in productivity could be secured. A maincause of our recurring difficulties was that our economy was not sufficiently competitive, especially in certain sectors, such asshipbuilding. Standards of management had not improved as fast asin other countries. It would be necessary for the Government tofollow policies designed to reduce production costs, even though suchpolicies would involve discriminating between industries.(h) Several Ministers expressed the view that our longer-termbalance of payments difficulties could not be corrected without theintroduction of a floating exchange rate for sterling. This was theonly device which would bring home to both sides of industry, andto the public in general, the overriding need to maintain the value ofthe currency. As against this it was pointed out that, even if a floating rate were introduced, it would still be necessary to adopt firmremedial measures to reduce the internal pressure on the economy.Moreover, a floating exchange rate was open to grave internationaldisadvantages; and this possibility would need much moreconsideration.(/) There was general agreement with the view expressed inC. (61) 89 that the remedial measures which were immediatelyrequired should be presented as part of a constructive and positiveapproach to the future development of the economy. Our ultimate objective should be to secure more rapid economic growth and greatercompetitive power. But there were certain particular projects forwhich the public would be prepared to bear some increased burden.e.g., the maintenance of law and order and the expansion of education services. It should be made plain that any restrictive measures whichwere introduced were necessary on balance of payments grounds inorder to enable us to fulfil our international aims, including theprovision of reasonable help to under-developed countries, and themaintenance and protection of our national interests throughout theworld.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in the light of theviews expressed in the Cabinefs discussion, he would give furtherconsideration to the various remedial measures that were available.He would consider the timing of any announcement and theintroduction of any measures in the light of developments in the external monetary position.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider further,in the light of their discussion, what measures should betaken to remedy the internal and external economic andfinancial position.
in Kuwait and would give their full political support if military action by British forces became necessary.The Prime Minister said that he would arrange for the plans for providing military support for the Ruler of Kuwait to be reviewedlater that day by the Ministers concerned.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th June, 1961.
