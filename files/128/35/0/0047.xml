wages policy(previous reference:C.C. (61) 46thConclusions.Minute 8)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 128) on wages policy.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that, in asking for apause in increases in wages and salaries generally, the Governmenthad undertaken to give a lead by securing a pause in those sectors forwhich they were directly responsible. Unless such a pause could beachieved in the employments under the Government^ direct control,particularly the Civil Service and the National Health Service, itwould not be secured elsewhere. A difficult problem arose, however,in respect of arbitration in the public sector. If this continuedunchanged, there could be no assurance that the arbitrators wouldtake sufficient account of the policy announced by the Governmentand so secure a pause by their own awards. Moreover, unless somesteps were taken to control arbitration, there was a great danger thatthe policy would result in discrimination against those employees whohad no right to arbitration, for example, the teachers and the armed forces.One course would be to continue to allow access to arbitrationbut to be prepared, without any announcement in advance, to rejectawards or to defer their implementation. This course would arousemuch criticism and opposition, and the Government would be accused of duplicity. A second course would be openly to suspend arbitrationfor a period. This would involve the suspension of the Whitleyagreement on arbitration in the Civil Service, and it would beconsonant with such a policy that pay negotiations should also be suspended in those sectors where arbitration was not applicable,including the proposed review of the pay of the armed forces. Thiscourse also would provoke great unrest and there would be serious danger of long-term harm to the currently accepted machinery of negotiation. A third possibility would be to allow the negotiating machinery to continue to function but to announce that, while access to arbitration would continue, the Government intended to control the timing and if necessary the stages of the implementation of any increases awarded. While this course would be a breach of existingunderstandings, it would enable the Government honestly to make their position clear and would maintain the principle of arbitration.It would also be flexible in operation, and was consistent with thephilosophy of a pause, as distinct from a freeze, in wages and salaries.On the other hand, it might lead arbitrators to discount the possibility that the Government would defer implementation of their awards,and so result in a number of higher awards which would have to beaccepted after an interval.On balance, this last course seemed to be the one open to leastobjection. It would in any case in accordance with the policy announced by the Government, be necessary to fulfil existing pay-commitments; these would include cases where pay settlements hadalready been reached in negotiation or where awards had alreadybeen made or were awaited under arbitraticr. proceedings. a commitment should also be recognised in a case where an offer hadbeen made and rejected and a claim was on the way to arbitration;for example, any arbitration award made to the Post office engineering Union which did not exceed the S\ per cent, increasealready offered should be put into effect, though any award in excessof that amount might be deferred during the period of the pause.The Minister of labour agreed that the third course proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to be preferred. Even this might do considerable harm to the machinery of arbitration, but itwould at least enable the Government to continue the process of negotiation, by discussing the timing and phasing of an arbitration award. An announcement of this policy would have the advantageof making it clear to arbitrators that the Government intended tocarry out their policy of a pause.
Discussion showed that there was general agreement that thepractical choice was between this course, in which the Governmentwould seek to maintain the principle of arbitration but reserve controlover the timing and phasing of awards, and that of continuing toaccept the results of arbitration as at present in those cases in whichawards were binding, whether by formal agreement or by longunderstanding, while at the same time concentrating the Governmentsefforts on imposing a pause in all other cases over which they hadcontrol.In favour of the latter course it was pointed out that only about per cent, of wage claims were decided by arbitration. The best means by which the Government could influence the great mass of wage negotiations, which were not subject to compulsory arbitration,lay in refusing to agree to excessive claims in those cases in the public sector in which arbitration was not binding. These would includeclaims in the National Health Service, where the Minister of Healthcould reject arbitration awards. The Minister of Labour, also, couldreturn or delay recommendations from Wages Councils. It was urged that the Government ought not now to assert their freedom to control the implementation of arbitration awards in those cases inthe public sector in which arbitration had previously been regarded,by formal agreement or long understanding, as binding. It was, onthe other hand, pointed out that the Government had always reservedthe right to withhold cases from arbitration &quot; on grounds of policy &quot;;this right had been invoked only in relation to equal pay, family allowances, cost-of-living bonuses, and the balance of civil pay inwar-time. There was considerable support for the view that, as theGovernment had decided as a matter of policy that there must be apause in increases in wages and salaries, this justified reserving forthe Government^ decision the timing and phasing of awards madeat arbitration.It was also pointed out that there was a serious danger that private employers and local authorities would regard the government as having failed in their duty to give a lead in restraint if they tookno steps to control arbitration in the public sector. There would thenbe virtually&quot; no chance of securing their co-operation in theGovernment^ policy. Wage restraint was crucial if the balance ofpayments difficulties were to be overcome and the future of the economy restored. One of the main purposes of a pause was toallow time to formulate a longer term policy for containing increases in profits, wages and salaries within the growth of productivity.There would be great difficulty in deciding what average increase in incomes should be allowed, and there was the further problem ofproviding, within an average increase, for the betterment of certain sections. It was hoped that in the forthcoming consultationsconcerning the better co-ordination of economic planning meanswould be found of securing objective and authoritative advice onthese matters.In further discussion it was suggested that the adoption of thecourse favoured by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Ministerof Labour might enable the Minister of Education to state, consistently with the policy of a pause, that, while salary increases for the teacher?must for the moment be contained within the total of  42 millions, itshould be possible at a later stage to accept the addition of the further 5\ millions which the local education authorities had been ready tooffer. This would ease relations with the teachers.The Cabinet were, however, informed that any course involvinginterference with arbitration arrangements might lead to acutedifficulties in the nationalised industries, with a serious risk of strikes in the railway and power industries later in the year.The Home Secretary said that there were great difficulties in adopting a policy which encroached substantially upon the existingarbitration arrangements in the public sector, especially since it did
SouthAfrica(previous reference :CC. (61) 36thConclusions,Minute 5)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (61) 126) on future relations between the UnitedKingdom and South Africa.The Lord Chancellor said that the Africa Committee had considered a wide range of questions on which decisions affectingour future relations with South Africa were needed. They had adopted as the guiding principle that we should avoid continuing togive South Africa &quot; Commonwealth treatment &quot; unless it was clearly in our own interests to do so.On the question of nationality, the Committee considered thatin future most South Africans must be treated as aliens. Anarrangement on the lines of that applied to citizens of the irish republic (under which, though aliens, they were not subjected tothe ordinary restrictions applicable to aliens) would be unjustifiablein relation to South Africa and unacceptable to most of the othercountries of the Commonwealth. The Committee recommended,however, that South Africans who were living in the United kingdom or Colonies, or were in employment directly based on the UnitedKingdom, or having connexions by paternal descct with the UnitedKingdom and Colonies, intended in the future to live there shouldbe at liberty, up to the end of 1965 to register as citizens of theUnited Kingdom and Colonies.Our financial and economic interests in South Africa were ofgreat value and. in order to safeguard them and to keep South Africawithin the sterling area, it was recommended that we should aim atmaintaining our present trade relations as nearly as possibleunchanged.We should also aim to keep unchanged the present relationsbetween the High Commission Territories and South Africa, thoughit might be possible to improve the working arrangements betweenthem. The South Africa Act. 1909. contemplated the possibility of transferring the High Commission Territories (and also the Rhodesias)to South Africa, but the Committee recommended that a decision to not seem possible to announce this before Parliament rose for the summer recess. It was important to show that the Government wereapproaching the questions of wages policy and the related economic problems on a national basis, and there would be great advantage from this point of view if there could be early legislation to bringshort-term speculative capital profits into the field of taxation.The Prime Minister said that it would clearly be inadvisable tointerfere with arbitration arrangements in cases where commitmentshad already been made, and it would be important to define clearlywhat these were. But as regards new cases, there were strong arguments to justify the Government in asserting control over the timing and phasing of arbitration awards on the ground that a pausewas an essential element in the Governments policy. It would,however, be necessary to consider very carefully how such a policy,if it were adopted, should be announced. It would be desirable forthe Cabinet to resume their discussion on the following day, whenthey could have before them a draft of the statement on wages policyin the public sector which the Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldlike to make.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare a draft statement on wages policy in the public sector.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on the following day.
repeal the Act, which might exacerbate feelings in South Africaagainst the Territories, should be deferred until the balance ofadvantage could be more clearly assessed.South Africa should cease to be a member of the commonwealth sugar Agreement after the end of the year. It was, however,recommended that we should be prepared to negotiate a bilateral agreement under which we might offer to buy from South africa the amount of&quot;sugar guaranteed under the Commonwealth agreement at the present or future Commonwealth price, whichever was thelower, and to buy an additional quantity at the world price. Anagreement on these lines would be worth some  2\ millions a yearto South Africa and should not only make the general negotiationseasier but should also safeguard the Swaziland sugar industry.Finally, it was recommended that we should avoid a comprehensive negotiating conference with South Africa but shouldtake up with them in series the various questions on which agreement was required. The negotiations should be conducted by H.M.Ambassador in Pretoria and should begin, if possible, in the early part of October.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the recommendations put forward by the AfricaCommittee. The proposed sugar agreement might seem a heavyprice to pay for the advantages we hoped to secure in other fields,especially since an embarrassing surplus of sugar was produced inthe Commonwealth and we did not need to import it from SouthAfrica. Provided, however, that we did not commit ourselves to theproposed agreement until we were reasonably sure of securing our other objectives, and since we should otherwise have to take fromSwaziland the sugar which at present enjoyed a guaranteed market in South Africa, the proposal might be regarded as a reasonably satisfactory bargain.The Prime Minister said that he was contemplating rearrangingMinisterial responsibility on the basis that the Foreign secretary should become responsible for our general relations with SouthAfrica, that the Colonial Secretary should become responsible forthe administration of the High Commission Territories and that.M. Ambassador in South Africa should continue to combine thatfunction with his function of High Commissioner for the Territories.The timing of these changes would, however, require further thought.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (61) 126.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would give furtherconsideration to the timing of changes in ministerial responsibility for relations with South Africa and theHigh Commission Territories.CommercialPolicyJapan(previous reference:CC. (r-())65lhConclusions.Minute 7)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 127) on trade with Japan.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the United kingdom had benefited more, and Japan less, than had been expected from thecurrent trade agreement which expired on 30th September. In order,therefore, to maintain and develop the improved export market wehad found, we must offer the Japanese considerably greater opportunities for their exports in return. The Economic PolicyCommittee had accepted proposals by the President of the Boardof Trade that, on the understanding that the Japanese would enterinto a new agreement lasting for a further )car, wc should removeall restrictions on a wide range of their imports and offer considerableincreases in the quotas for most other goods on which we imposed
CC 47 (61)restrictions. These increased quotas would include Japanese textiles,but the negotiations for a textile agreement with Hong Kong wouldhave been concluded before the time came to announce the proposed arrangements with Japan.The Cabinet had already agreed that we should resume negotiations for a commercial treaty with Japan, giving her most-favoured-nation rights in respect of quantitative import restrictions,subject to the safeguards that we should maintain restrictions on certain sensitive products and that both sides would have the rightto impose or reimpose restrictions on other products if this became necessary to deal with disruptive competition. The Japanese were unwilling to accept these safeguards without a time limit and were proposing that they should have the same duration as the commercial treaty in their suggestion, five years with provision for automaticextension. The Economic Policy Committee had agreed that a time limit could be accepted in principle but that we should seek to ensurethat the treaty had an initial life of seven years.The Cabinet Endorsed the conclusions of the Economic Policy Committeeon commercial relations with Japan, as set out in C. (61) 127.UnitedNationsFinances(previous reference:CC. (61) 35thConclusions.Minute 5)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 119) on the financial situation of the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary recalled that, at their meeting on22nd June, the Cabinet had decided that the United Kingdom shouldnot join in any initiative for providing interest-free Government loansin order to relieve the financial difficulties of the United Nations.The Cabinet had felt that, if other countries were to take the initiative in proposing loans, we might perhaps agree to contribute but that our contribution should be considerably less than the $15 millionsoriginally contemplated.Subsequent investigations had disclosed that the sum needed by the United Nations was not $75 millions but $120 millions, andthat the prospect of raising commercial loans on this scale was negligible. The only practical means of restoring the finances of theOrganisation lay, therefore, in advances or loans by Governments.The United States Government had made it clear that, if the UnitedKingdom did not participate in a solution on these lines, there wouldbe little chance that other countries would do so and that it was thenmost unlikely that the United States would be able to bear thecost alone.On further consideration, since his memorandum had been circulated, the Foreign Secretary proposed that he should himselfdiscuss the whole question with the United States Secretary of State,with a view to reaching some agreement in principle without beingcommitted to a large contribution.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to discuss the financial situation of the United Nations with the United states secretary of State, on the basis that the United kingdom would pay the assessments to which we were morallycommitted and would be ready to make available sometoken assistance over and above that sum.Cabinet Office, S.W. I.3rd August. 1V61
