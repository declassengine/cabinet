South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:CC. (61) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had accepted our requirement that a cease-fire should precede theinternational conference planned to begin at Geneva on 12th May. Itwas encouraging also that Souvanna Phouma had said that he expected the cease-fire to coincide with his arrival in Laos on26th April. Despite some American suspicions of the good faith ofthe Communist bloc, there were reasonable prospects of reaching apermanent settlement if the Conference proved able to set upmachinery for the international control of the supply of military andeconomic aid to Laos, and if the United States Government could bebrought to acquiesce in the establishment of a broadly based LaotianGovernment. The Pathet Lao troops had recently gained some ground, but there had been no decisive change in the military position.Angola 3.   The Cabinet discussed the situation in Angola. The Africanmovement against the Portuguese had developed more quickly than had been expected, possibly as a result of the activities of an agencyestablished by certain African States in Leopoldville. Even if thePortuguese Government were willing to abandon their colonial policyof assimilation, they would need many years, and considerableeconomic assistance, before they could effect constitutional changesin their African territories. It was not likely that they would themselves abdicate responsibility as the Belgians had done in the congo; the loss of their Colonies might result in the collapse of theSalazar regime and its replacement by a Government of the extremeLeft. In that event Spain might be similarly affected. On the otherhand the Portuguese might be tempted to respond to tentative SouthAfrican suggestions for establishing an area of white domination inSECRET59250-5 is 2CC. 23 (61)Algeria 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that a junta of dissident FrenchGenerals, headed by General Challe, had seized power in Algiers on22nd April with the declared object of opposing General de GauhVspolicy of granting autonomy to Algeria. It seemed that GeneralChalle now controlled all Algeria, although there were reports thatsome of the -military units there had not joined the rebellion.The French Government were in a position of some difficultysince neither the Police nor the Army in France were fullyreliable: on the other hand, it appeared that the Navy andAir Force remained unaffected, as well as the Army inGermany, on whose defection it was possible that the rebels hadcounted. General de Gaulle, who had assumed emergency powers, had not the means to restore the situation in Algeria by force:he was therefore relying on denying supplies of money and material from France. It was probable that General Challe had no intentionof invading France, but was seeking rather to undermine public confidence in General de Gaulle&apos;s administration by the threat of invasion. His next step might be an intensive campaign against theFront de Liberation Nationale (F.L.N.) which could lead to an attackon their base in Tunisia; he might consider that, if the French Armybecame actively engaged in hostilities against Tunisia, General de gaulle would find it impossible to continue to withhold supplies from them.
Parliament 4.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was suggested that, unless an early date couldbe arranged for the Second Reading of the Weights and Measures Bill,there would be great difficulty in completing all its stages before theend of the Session. It would be unfortunate if the Bill were lost,especially after the work already done on it in the House of Lords.The obstructive tactics of the Opposition had, however, had the resultthat the Government would be unable to complete all the legislationthey had planned for the Session. Various expedients were beingconsidered shortening the Whitsun recess, resuming the Session for a relatively long period after the summer recess and even deferring theopening of the new Session until towards the end of the year. In theend, however, the Government were likely to find it impossible tosecure the passage even of all the Bills they had already introduced.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to give further consideration tothe prospects of the Governments legislative programme forthe present Session, and to bring the matter again beforethem in due course.ParliamentSuccessionto Peerages(previous reference:C.C. (61) 22ndConclusions,Minute 3)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C. (61) 57) about the appointment of a Joint SelectCommittee on the membership of the House of Lords.The Lord Chancellor recalled that, in connexion with the case ofMr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn, the Cabinet had agreed at their meeting on 20th April that the Government should move for theappointment of a Joint Select Committee of both Houses of Parliamentto consider questions relating to the membership of the House ofLords. After consultation with those of his colleagues mostimmediately concerned, he sought the approval of the Cabinet to thedraft statement annexed to his memorandum, which incorporated thefollowing proposed terms of reference for the Joint Select Committee:&quot; To consider, having regard among other things to the need to maintain an efficient Second Chamber (a) the composition of the House of Lords;(b) whether any, and if so what, changes should be made inthe rights of Peers and Peeresses in their own right inregard to eligibility to sit in either House ofParliament and to vote at Parliamentary elections;(c) whether any, and if so what, changes should be made inthe law regarding the surrender of Peerages;(d) whether the number of Peers and Peeresses entitled to sitand vote in the House of Lords should be limited, andif so to what extent and in what manner;(e) whether it would be desirable to introduce the principleof remuneration for members of the House of lords and, if so, subject to what conditions;and to make recommendations.&quot;South Africa, Angola, Mozambique and the Rhodesias. It would bein our interest to encourage them as far as possible to adopt more liberal policies directed to the eventual grant of autonomy to their overseas territories.
SSCIRET5CC. 23 (61)In discussion it was suggested that to include in the terms ofreference the composition of the House of Lords and, in particular, thepossibility of limiting the number of Peers and Peeresses entitled to sit and vote in it (paragraphs id) and id)) was almost certain to resultin acute controversy, attacks on the principle of hereditary succession to the House of Lords and political embarrassment for theGovernment. To move for an enquiry on so wide a basis might,moreover, be regarded as showing too marked a lack of sympathy withMr. Wedgwood Benn, who would derive no retrospective advantage from any change in the law which might emerge from it.On the other hand, the Government could hope to deriveimmediate political advantage from taking the initiative in a proposal which could open the way to reform on a front rather wider than the issues raised by the case of Mr. Wedgwood Benn and would, in any event, find it difficult otherwise to deal with an Opposition proposalfor an enquiry into these narrower issues alone. Indeed, in orderto avoid giving more prominence than was necessary to the position ofMr. Wedgwood Benn, there would be some advantage inamalgamating the second and third paragraphs of the proposed termsof reference. Moreover, reference to the composition of the Houseof Lords would help to emphasise that its powers would not be withinthe scope of the enquiry and an express reference to the possibilityof limiting hereditary membership might forestall criticism of thefact that the majority of members of the House of Lords seldom ornever attended its sittings.In further discussion of the draft statement the following main points were made:(a) It might be preferable to announce the proposed terms ofreference of the Joint. Select Committee at the beginning rather thanat the end of the statement.ib) The statement might include a reference to the invitation todiscuss the composition of the House of Lords which had been rejected by the Opposition in 1953.(c) The preparation by officials of material for the Joint SelectCommittee should be mentioned as a form of assistance rather than as a part of the enquiry itself.id) The statement should, if possible, be made on the following day and the Opposition Parties should be informed jn advance of the government&apos;s intention.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that theCabinet recognised the political dangers of making the terms ofreference of the Joint Select Committee wider than the immediate situation demanded. The balance of feeling appeared, for this reason,to be in favour of omitting any express reference to the possibility of limiting hereditary succession to the House of Lords, though makingthe terms of reference wide enough to cover its composition. Thedraft statement might be further considered to take account of thisview and of the additional points made in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the amalgamation of paragraphs (b)and (c) and the omission of paragraph id), the terms ofreference proposed in C. (61) 57 for a Joint SelectCommittee on the composition and membership of theHouse of Lords.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to make an early statement, onthe lines agreed in their discussion, on the government&apos;s intention to move for the appointment of the committee referred to in Conclusion (1).
Battle of britain:PermanentMemorial(previous reference:C.C. (60) 50thConclusions,Minute 1)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (61) 51) about the desirability of providing memorialsto victories in the second world war.The Minister of Defence said that he had found no evidence thatthere was any general demand for such memorials, but the Battle of britain was in many ways a special case, and a memorial to it mightwell attract public support. If it were approved, the memorial shouldbe dedicated to all those who had helped to make victory possible,including, as well as the Royal Air Force, civil defence services,aircraft workers and the civilian population at large. He suggestedthat the Secretary of State for Air might be invited to test publicopinion on the project by consultations and perhaps by initiating acorrespondence in The Times. If the response were generallyfavourable a small committee might be appointed to decide on theform the memorial might take. He had not in mind the traditionalstatue, nor the naming of a street; he was greatly attracted by asuggestion for an additional hall of residence at a new university if, as seemed likely, there was to be a new University of Kent, that wouldbe a specially appropriate site.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were doubtful whether therewas any appreciable demand for a Battle of Britain memorial andwhether it would be fitting to select that particular victory as the onemost appropriate for commemoration by a national memorial. Itwould be undesirable to commit public funds to the project, nor would it be appropriate for the Government to take the initiative inappealing for subscriptions. If, however, it were decided to establish a University of Kent, further consideration might be given to thepossibility of providing within it some suitable commemoration of the battle of Britain.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it was undesirable in general to provide nationalmemorials to victories in the second world war.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, if the University of Kentwere established, to consider whether the opportunitymight be taken to arrange for some suitable commemora-tion of the Battle of Britain within it.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th April, 1961.
