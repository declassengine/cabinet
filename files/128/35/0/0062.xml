congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 58thConclusions.Minute 1)2. The Foreign Secretary said that it had so far proved impossibleto persuade the Prime Minister of Katanga, Mr. Tshombe, to meetthe Prime Minister of the Central Congo Government, Mr. Adoula,for negotiations about the future relations of Katanga with theCentral Government. He had himself joined with the Prime Ministerof the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Sir Roy Welensky, inan appeal to Mr. Tshombe to seize what might be the last opportunityof resolving this constitutional problem by peaceful means, and similar representations had been made on behalf of otherGovernments, including Belgium. Mr. Adoula insisted, however,that any such negotiations should be held in territory over which hehad control, and this Mr. Tshombe, in view of his earlier experiences,was not prepared to accept. It had been suggested that the best hopeof achieving such a meeting would be through the good offices of aconciliator. The Nigerian Prime Minister had declined to act in this capacity and it would be difficult to find anyone suitable, but it mightbe worth asking the Secretary-General of the United Nations to try to select a conciliator.Meanwhile it was likely that the Security Council would be askedto give the United Nations representatives in the Congo further powers to enable them to assist Mr. Adoula to enforce the authorityof the Central Government on Katanga. It was likely that therepresentatives of India and Ceylon would propose a resolution which, though in relatively mild terms, would have this effect. any extension of the role of the United Nations in the Congo would,however, be highly objectionable to many supporters of theGovernment.The United Nations authorities had asked us to supply bombsfor the Canberra aircraft which their forces in the Congo nad obtainedfrom the Indian Government, and they had given assurances thatthese bombs would only be used against Katangan aircraft on theground or against their bases. In view of these assurances, and ofthe terms of the United Nations resolution calling on member countries to meet the needs of the United Nations forces in the Congo,it would be difficult to refuse this request; but, if it were granted, therewas bound to be keen criticism in this country.In discussion it was argued that we should oppose any further attempt by the United Nations to interfere by force in the internal affairs of the Congo. It would not be in our interests, nor would ithelp our multi-racial policies in Africa, if Mr. Tshombe wereoverthrown. His apprehensions about meeting Mr. Adoula inLeopoldville were understandable, in view of the treatment accordedGermany 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the German Ambassador inBerlin Moscow had suggested, at a meeting with Mr. Khrushchev on: Previous       9th November, a possible procedure for negotiations on the BerlinReference:      question.  He was understood to have suggested that an agreementc.c. (61) 6ist   should first be reached between the Soviet Government and the threeConclusions.    Western Powers about the freedom and viability of West Berlin,Minute7)       including access to it and the presence of allied troops; that thisshould be guaranteed by a subsequent agreement between the soviet and East German Governments; that discussions should then be held between the East German and West Berlin authorities on matters of mutual concern; and that these should be followed by Four-Powernegotiations about a German peace treaty and disarmament. this had appeared to be a significant initiative, and the Soviet Governmenthad reacted favourably to it. Unfortunately, reports of it had becomepublic; and the Federal German Government were now disowning it.The United States Government would, however, have an opportunityto ascertain Dr. Adenauer&apos;s attitude towards it when he visitedWashington in the following week.
3)3)sNnclcarTests(previous reference:C.C.(ol)5*)ihConclusions.Minute 3)to him when he had undertaken discussions with the Central CongoGovernment at an earlier stage.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that there could not beany political future for an independent Katanga, and that the best hope for a satisfactory settlement in the Congo lay in an agreementbetween Mr. Tshombe and Mr. Adoula which would have the effectof weakening the influence of Mr. Gizenga, the Deputy Prime minister in the Central Government, and the Communist interests. It was significant that Sir Roy Welensky had now come to this view. Thepresent deadlock arose from the fact that Mr. Adoula was unwilling to negotiate with Mr. Tshombe outside the Congo, since this mightbe regarded as conceding separate sovereignty to Katanga; while Mr. Tshombe, who was under the influence of advisers who did not want a settlement with the Central Government, was unwilling tonegotiate in Leopoldville.It should be borne in mind that we had supported theintroduction of a United Nations force in the Congo in order toprevent Communist interests from dominating the CentralGovernment. If he could not reach agreement with Mr. Tshombe,Mr. Adoula might not be able to maintain his position, and in that event a state of confusion would arise which Mr. Gizenga could turn to the advantage of the Communists. On these grounds, it was argued, it would be justifiable to bring further pressure on mr. Tshombe to enter into discussions with Mr. Adoula.In further discussion it was suggested that, in addition to seeking a conciliator, some way should be found of satisfying Mr. Tshombethat his physical safety could be assured at a meeting withMr. Adoula. A special contingent of reliable United Nations troops,such as Canadians or Swedes, might be provided; or the meeting might be held in a suitable Embassy in Leopoldville.There was general agreement that the political difficulties in thiscountry would be increased if it became necessary for us to supplybombs for the Canberra aircraft in use by the United Nations forcesin the Congo. It would be preferable that the Indian Government,who had supplied the aircraft, should provide the bombs for them.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Aviation to ascertain whether therewould be any technical difficulties in providing bombs forthe Canberra aircraft in use by the United Nations forcesin the Congo.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in the light of their discussion, what suggestions could be made to theSecretary-General of the United Nations about theappointment of a conciliator between Mr. Adoula andMr. Tshombe. and about the means of assuringMr. Tshombe of his physical safety at a meeting withMr. Adoula.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider vhat instructions should be given to the United Kingdom representatives at the Security Council, in the light of further informationof the resolution to be tabled about the Congo.*3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (61) 179) discussing a suggestion by the UnitedSuites Government that they might use the facilities at christmas island for conducting atmospheric nuclear tests.The Prime Minister said that the statement which president kennedy had made on 1st November about the resumption of nucicartests in the atmosphere had been in similar terms to that which he
himself had made in the House of Commons on 31st October. Eachhad made it clear that he would only conduct or support such testsif they were necessary to maintain the security of the free world.President Kennedy had, however, added that, as a matter of prudence,the United States Government would make the necessary preparations for atmospheric tests so as to be ready in case it became necessaryto conduct them. The United States Government had now informed us that they would not wish to carry out nuclear tests at Eniwetok orBikini, since these were Trust territories. They had thereforeenquired whether it would be possible for them to make use ofChristmas Island for this purpose, indicating that they would be willing to bear the cost of bringing the installations there (which were now on a care and maintenance basis) into a state of full operational efficiency. They suggested that a combined reconnaissance teamshould go there at once to review the situation with a view to startingconstruction work in a few weeks&apos; time. It might take about four months to complete the preparations; and, if it were then decided tohold the tests, of which twenty or thirty were contemplated, these would be spread over a period of another three to four months. Thisindication of the scale of the tests which might be undertaken hadbeen obtained from United States technical experts: there was noreason to believe that any firm programme had yet been approvedby President Kennedy.It could not fail to become known that construction work wasbeing undertaken to bring the facilities on Christmas Island to a stateof operational efficiency; and this would give rise to public criticismin this country which would have to be withstood for a considerable period. In the United States public pressures might be mainly infavour of tests. But in both countries the interval would make thefinal decision, whether it was to hold the tests or not, considerably more embarrassing.The Foreign Secretary said that, from the point of view ofdefence and of our relations with the United States, the balance ofadvantage lay in making the facilities of Christmas Island available,but only on very strict conditions which we could justify to the UnitedStates Government on the ground that the preparations for and stillmore the holding of atmospheric tests would give rise to severe criticism in this country. We should have to be satisfied that theproposed tests met the strictest criteria of military necessity, and thiswould involve our obtaining full information about the devices to be tested.In discussion the view was expressed that it would be difficult tojustify to public opinion in this country a series of atmospheric testson the scale envisaged in the programme of the United States experts.It was suggested that ordinary people increasingly expected theGovernment to devote their energies to securing a complete cessation of tests at least in the atmosphere. It would be difficult to convince them that tests on this scale could be brought within the terns of thestatement made by the Prime Minister on 31st October though theymight be brought to accept the need for tests to develop an anti-missilemissile for defensive purposes. If tests were to be held in british territory they would have to satisfy the criteria laid down by thePrime Minister. For this purpose it might be helpful if UnitedKingdom and United States experts could jointly define in scientificterms what types of tests could be justified within the general criteriawhich had been laid down by the Prime Minister and the President.There was general agreement that we should need to be provided with full information about the military and scientific justification for the United States programme of tests in order to satisfy ourselvesthai it feli within the Prime Ministers statement of 31st October. Itwould be preferable if this information could be obtained, and a provisional view taken on it. before overt work on the facilities at christmas Island was begun.
Post Office a.    I he    Cabinet    had    before    them    a    note   by    the(Prosions Postmaster-Genera! (C. (61* 176) covering a draft White Paper aboutReference:       the practicability of a Post Office Giro system in the United Kingdom.CC (t.l) 4 IsiConclusions. The l&apos;o\tnuister-(!cneral said that he had been invited by the minute 3) Home Affairs Committee to bring before the Cabinet his proposal toGiro System publish a White Paper in order to test public reaction to the idea ofa Post Office Giro. The purpose of a Giro was to provide cheap and simple facilities for the transfer of money; this would be achieved through arranging for deposits and payments to be made at PastOffices ami b\ setting up a central or regional transfer organisationsimilar to the credit transfer system now operated by the banks.   TheIn further discussion it was argued that, if the United states authorities,could make out a case for conducting further atmospherictests, it would be advantageous for the United Kingdom to be associated with them, as they would if the tests were held at christmas island. President Kennedy had already agreed that a test of a Britishdevice could be included in the forthcoming series of undergroundnuclear tests in the United States. If tests were held at christmas island, we should have full access to all the resulting information.As allies of the United States, we should in any case be obliged todefend their resumption of tests; and. if we offered them the use ofour facilities at Christmas Island, we should be in a better positionto influence their policies on testing.The Prime Minister said that he understood the deep anxietiesto which the prospect of further atmospheric tests gave rise. It wouldbe wise to explain frankly to President Kennedy the difficulties whichthis request for facilities at Christmas Island involved. He therefore proposed that he should reply on the following lines. It would benecessary for the President and himself to be satisfied, on militaryand scientific grounds, that each test met the criteria laid down intheir public statements and that it could be justified to world opinionon that basis. He would make it clear that, at this stage, there couldbe no certainty that he would necessarily concur in the President^judgment whether a particular test was necessary on military and scientific grounds; and he would warn the President frankly that other circumstances might make it impossible for him, when the time came,to agree that the test should be held. It might therefore be advisable for the United States Government, as a precaution, to make some additional arrangements which would not involve the use of british territory in case when the time came it was not possible to agree thatthe facilities on Christmas Island should be used. Meanwhile theprogramme of tests proposed by the United States experts should bemade the subject of a joint scientific examination to enable thePresident and himself to decide whether they met the criteria theyhad laid down. It might be possible for them to reach a conclusionabout this towards the end of the year. He would express the hopethat overt preparation of the facilities on Christmas Island need notbe undertaken at present, since it was desirable that a conclusionabout the justification of the tests should first be reached; but a strictly secret reconnaissance party, consisting of two United Statesand two United Kingdom officials, could go at once to christmas island to examine what programme of work would be necessary.The Cabinet (I) Took note that the Prime Minister would prepare a reply to president Kennedy about the request for facilities on christmas Island for United States nuclear tests on thelines which he had indicated.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameetinu later in the week.
Commercial 5.  The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PresidentPolicy of the Board of Trade (C. (61) 181) and the Minister of AgricultureTrade with (C. (61) 182) about a proposal to increase the quota for Polish baconPoland and other commodities during the current year in return for a Polish(Previous ofTer to purchase British aircraft.Reference:CC. (61) 46th The President of the Board of Trade said that, following theConclusions. Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion of quotas for imports of Polish foodstuffs.Minute 7) the Polish Government had offered to buy for cash a fleet of british aircraft costing about  \\ million in return for an increase of abouti\ \ million in the current year&apos;s quotas for imports from Poland.This increase would consist of 4.000 tons of bacon, some canned hamanil other canned meat. As the Poles had borrowed part of thecurrent quota for bacon at the end of the last quota year, the increaseof 4.000 tons in the bacon quota would add only 1.200 tons above thecurrent quota of 48,5(H) tons; this would be an insignificant increasein a market of nearly 60().(XX) tons a year in which uncontrolledfluctuations could be much larger The arrangement would havethe advantage that no undertaking need be given about the level ofquotas in future years and it would result in a favourable balance tous which the Poles would have to find out of their other resources.Exports of civil aircraft would, moreover, be of great benefit to theaircraft industry at the present time and might lead to furtherpurchases by other Communist countries as well as by Poland.establishment of a Post Office Giro might involve a capital outlay ofabout  5 million and running costs of about  3 million per annum.These costs would be recovered from users of the system the Chairman of the Committee of London Clearing Bankers,who had been consulted, was inclined to regard a Post Office Giroas a rival to the credit transfer system now operated by the banks.The bank facilities were, however, comparatively slow and expensiveand were not greatly used by the large number of wage earners who might, with advantage to themselves and to the national economy,use a Post Office Giro. Without testing public opinion it was difficultto say what the demand for a Giro would be, and it would be useful,before deciding whether to establish such a system, to stimulateinformed discussion by publication of the White Paper.Discussion showed that there was some division of opinion inthe Cabinet, both on the merits of a Post Office Giro and on theadvantages of publishing a White Paper about it. It was suggestedthat the experience of European countries in the use of similar systemswas not wholly encouraging; that the provision of transfer facilitieswas properly the business of the banks, who were still in the courseof expanding their services; and that the establishment of a Giromight be attacked as an unnecessary extension of nationalisation.Publication of a White Paper would be taken to mean that theGovernment were prepared to go ahead with the project and the eventual decision whether or not to go ahead would be prejudicedto some extent. On the other hand, the encouragement of smallsavings would be valuable to the national economy, and it was truethat the facilities provided by the banks did not meet the needs of wage-earners for current account facilities.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to obtain the viewsof the Bank of England on the desirability of establishing a Post Office Giro.(2) Agreed to resume at a later date their discussion of theproposal to publish a White Paper on this question.
The Minister of Agriculture said that the Polish offer was incertain respects attractive. In the past few months, however, therehad been a drastic deterioration in the bacon market in the UnitedKingdom, due to excessive supplies from home producers, from denmark and from Ireland. Danish producers, unlike the Poles,enjoyed an unrestricted right of free entry to this country and withthe increase of their breeding herd there would be even greaterpressure on the home market in the months ahead. The only way in which market conditions could be improved without large increases in Exchequer subsidy (possibly amounting to  10 million) would beto secure a voluntary agreement from all suppliers, including thePoles, to reduce their exports. This would raise the market price,and consequently the financial return to the Poles on their presentquota would then not be very different from the return they would obtain on a larger quota at lower prices. To announce an increasein the Polish bacon quota at the present stage would effectivelydestroy any possibility of securing an agreement on voluntaryrestriction.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There were technical and political, as well as economic,advantages in securing a foothold for the aircraft industry behind theiron curtain. China and Czechoslovakia were already showinginterest in buying British aircraft.(b) Although the effect on the subsidy to bacon producers athome was difficult to calculate owing to the large number of variablefactors involved, it seemed likely that from the economic point ofview the trading advantages of accepting the offer would outweigh thefinancial disadvantage of an increase in support costs. It would,however, be desirable to obtain if possible a firmer indication of theeffect on subsidy payments of increasing the Polish bacon quota.(c) Bacon producers at home and in Europe could not beexpected to understand a decision to import more bacon from poland. It would be particularly difficult to convince home producers of the need to do so in the light of the announcement shortly to bemade about the decision to save  li million by postponing theprogramme for eradication of swine fever.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in consultation with theChief Secretary. Treasury, and the President of the Boardof Trade, to submit to them an estimate of the effect onsubsidy payments of increasing the quota for Polish baconfor the current year.(2) Agreed to resume at a later date their discussion of Polishbacon quotas.Cabinet Office. S.W. I.14th November, 1961.
