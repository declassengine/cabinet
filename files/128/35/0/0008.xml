Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (61) 7thConclusions.Minute 4)The Prime Minister said that the African representatives at theNorthern Rhodesian Constitutional Conference had been unwilling to accept the constitutional plan which, in accordance with the cabinets earlier decision, the Colonial Secretary had put before theConference on 14th February. They believed that the UnitedKingdom Government had adopted this plan under pressure fromSalisbury; and the Press and public opinion in this country were underthe same impression. In fact, however, the Prime Minister of theFederation, Sir Roy Welensky, and the Prime Minister of SouthernRhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, and their associates were stronglycritical of many aspects of the plan. The truth was that both the african Parties and the United Federal Party were suspicious of any.constitutional change which did not offer them a sure prospect of majority control in the government of the territory.The Cabinet had now to decide whether to publish the plan anddefend it on its merits, or to defer announcing any constitutional proposals in the hope that the representatives of the Africans and ofthe Europeans could be brought more nearly to agreement in further discussion and negotiation. There were great risks in either course.If the Government declared their intention to go forward with this plan, it was possible that Sir Edgar Whitehead might feel that theprospects of carrying his referendum were so far prejudiced that itwould be safer for him to take Southern Rhodesia out of theFederation. It was even possible that, in an attempt to avert this,Sir Roy Welensky might declare the Federation to be independent ofthe United Kingdom. The consequences in either event would begrave, and it would not be possible for the United KingdomGovernment to restore the situation by military means. On the otherhand, if no statement of Government policy were made at this time,there was serious risk that the feelings of the Africans would beexacerbated and that rerious disorder would break out in northern rhodesia and perhaps in other parts of the Federation. TheGovernments task in controlling the political difficulties of such a situation would be greatly increased by the fact that they had not made any announcement of their policy. In these circumstances it seemed preferable for the Government to announce their plan and todefend it as fulfilling the concept of a multi-racial partnership in central Africa to which they were pledged, unless this entailed an overwhelming risk to the future of the Federation.The Colonial Secretary said that it had always been recognisedthat we could not put forward constitutional proposals for northern rhodesia which would meet in full the wishes of both the Africansand the Europeans. The present plan would not be accepted by either side. But there was some ground for hoping that, although itwould evoke strong criticism, it would not provoke violence from either side. The plan, in so far as it embodied the multi-racial concept,was preferable to the type of settlement envisaged by the monckton commission. It would still leave some room for manoeuvre, and thedecisions on many points of detail were left open for discussion.Postponement of any announcement of the Governments proposals would be regarded by the Africans as a betrayal of their interests,would not give any great satisfaction to the Europeans, and would greatly increase the Governments political difficulties at home. he hoped that the Cabinet would authorise him to make an early statement in Parliament in the terms of the draft which had been circulated to the Cabinet (telegram 327 of 18th February to Salisbury)and to publish the proceedings of the Conference in a White Paper,the draft of which had also been made available to the Cabinet.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, if the concept of a multi-racial partnership in central Africa were to have any chance ofsuccess,   the   transition    in    the   constituent   territories   from
Europearrcontrol to constitutional arrangements in which african representatives played a dominant part would have to proceed at areasonable pace. Opportunity had to be provided for the developmentof co-operation between African and European representatives, andthis was a feature of the present plan. Criticism of it from both sideswas only to be expected. It had to be accepted that the proposals would in practice leave a considerable degree of uncertainty and were unlikely to produce a strong government. But at this stage of the transition this was inevitable and probably right. In the light of thelatest reactions from the United Federal Party representatives and theattitude of the African representatives, there was good hope that publication of the Governments plan would not provoke the europeans to think in terms of secession or give rise to widespreaddisorder by the Africans.The Foreign Secretary said that the danger of a violent reaction from the United Federal Party representatives should not be under-estimated. They might well believe that the plan would lead to thepremature transfer of power to irresponsible African representatives.Nevertheless, on balance it seemed preferable to publish the plan. Itwas, however, most important that the proposals should be announced in such a way as to leave a considerable field for adjustment, so as toallow the moderate European representatives sufficient time duringthe next few years in v/hich to secure the co-operation of moderateAfricans.A full discussion followed in which all members of the Cabinetexpressed their view. From this it emerged that the Cabinet were inagreement that the Governments plan should be made public withoutdelay. It offered the best hope of future constitutional progress inNorthern Rhodesia, and gave the Government a strong position in thepolitical controversy which had already begun. It was agreed that anearly announcement should be made in Parliament, on the lines of thedraft which had been circulated, and that a White Paper should be presented at the same time describing the proceedings of theConference.In further discussion the following points were made -(a) It was suggested that the plan might be too complicated towork in practice. It was pointed out that complex franchises wereappropriate to the circumstances of territories emerging towardsindependence and were in fact common in Africa. It would, however,be necessary to ensure that the complications of the plan did notobscure the multi-racial concept on which it was essentially based.Nor should such details be left open for discussion as would cast doubt on its multi-racial character.(b) It was generally agreed that there would be advantage in announcing the plan to Parliament, and publishing the white paper, on the following day. The absence of any statement of theGovernments policy had already caused some confusion, and it was desirable that it should be made known at once t.^at the Cabinet had approved the plan and the genera! lines of the statement which wouldbe made on the following day. when the text of the White Paper wouldalso be available.ic) Despite the fact that the African representatives hadrepudiated the statement of policy which had been agreed at the recentSouthern Rhodesian Constitutional Conference, Sir Edgar Whiteheadhad indicated his intention to adhere to the constitutional settlementproposed for Southern Rhodesia. It was agreed that the UnitedKingdom Government should support him in this course. It offeredsome hope that, despite his electoral difficulties, he would not make theGovernments plan for Northern Rhodesia a cause for advocatingsecession.The Cabinet then considered the terms of the announcement which the Colonial Secretary proposed to make to Parliament. They
inet Office, S.W. 1,20th February, 1961.were informed that Sir Roy Welensky had asked that this should omitany definition of the way in which the national members were to be elected, that qualifications of literacy in English and a minimum ageof thirty should be retained in the lower roll, that the qualifications for the upper roll should not be reduced, and that specific reference should be made to the establishment of a Constitutional Council.The Colonial Secretary said that it would be possible to meet thelast two of these points, and also to explain that a literacy requirement,in the sense that voters would have to complete an application formin English without assistance, was included over the major part of thelower roll. It v/ould not however be possible to omit the proposal that the election of national members would be determined byaveraging the percentage votes cast on each of the upper and lowerrolls: the most that could be conceded here was some change ofwording, e.g., that this was the method which was contemplated.Sir Roy Welensky had also asked that it should be made clear that theannouncement of the plan did not represent the United KingdomGovernmenfs full thinking at this stage. The statement would makeit clear that many matters still remained to be settled, for example the delimitation of constituencies, the way in which national members were to be returned and matters relating to the franchise, and that theGovernor of Northern Rhodesia would now be asked to consult thepolitical groups in that territory about the proposals.The Cabinet agreed that the statement should be modified and explained to Sir Roy Welensky on the lines indicated by the colonial secretary. The Prime Minister undertook to send a message to that effect, and to inform Sir Roy Welensky that the statement of theGovernments policy would be made to Parliament on the following day.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to present to parliament on the following day a White Paper describing theproceedings of the Northern Rhodesian constitutional conference.(2) Authorised the Colonial Secretary to make an announcementof the Government^ plan for constitutional development in Northern Rhodesia in the terms of the draft embodied in Telegram No. 327 of 18th February, subject to the minor adjustments suggested in the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Agreed that the text of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s statement should also be published in the form of a White Paper asa statement of the Governmenfs policy on this question.
