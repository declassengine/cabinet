CC. 26 (61)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed that it was probable that LordSuccession      Stansgate, if he secured a majority of the votes in the by-election atto Peerages     Bristol, would attempt to take his place in the House of Commons on(Previous       8th May. It was the intention of the Speaker to prevent this, on the reference:      ground that he was a Peer, and it was proposed that the government cc. (61) 24th   should move a resolution in support of the Speakers ruling.  TheConclusions.    Opposition were likely to move that Lord Stansgate be heard at the minute l)       gar 0f tne House.   It would be necessary to resist this; for,while Parliamentary time might be saved if Lord Stansgate were allowed to make a statement, this would be both contrary to the correctview of the precedents and unacceptable to the Government^supporters in the House.The Cabinet were also informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.2. The Prime Minister said that great public anxiety had beenaroused by the case of George Blake, who at the Centra! CriminalCourt on the previous day had pleaded guilty to five charges underthe Official Secrets Act and had been sentenced to terms of imprisonment totalling 42 years. The Speaker was unwilling to allow a Private Notice Question about this, as several Questions hadalready been placed on the Order Paper for answer in the following week. The Prime Minister felt however that, in view of the strengthof public feeling, it would be expedient for him to make a statement inthe House of Commons after Questions that afternoon; and a similar statement might be made in the House of Lords. He outlined to theCabinet the general lines of the statement which he was proposing tomake. This would make it clear that Blake, though he had been temporarily employed under the Foreign Office, had never been an established member of the Foreign Service; that, after being a prisonerin Communist hands in Korea, he was subjected to full securityvetting before being re-employed; that he had never joined theCommunist Party or any of its affiliated organisations; that he hadreceived no payment for the information which he had conveyed tothe Russians; and that what he did had been done as a result of conversion to a genuine belief in the Communist system. The trial hadbeen held almost wholly in camera. If therefore he were pressed to disclose the nature of Blake&apos;s official duties or to indicate what information had been passed to the Russians, he would take the line that it would not be proper for him to say in Parliament more than had been said in open court. It must be expected that there would be pressure for some sort of enquiry. He proposed to resist this. Hewould, however, offer to discuss the case with the Leader of theOpposition and one or two Privy Councillors from the Opposition sideof the House.The following points were raised in discussion :(a) As a result of this case there would be strong pressure for some further strengthening of security procedures in the public service. ThePrime Minister said that on this point he could say that he was awaiting the report of the Committee under the Chairmanship of Sir CharlesRomer, which was considering the security aspects of the recent caseof espionage at an Admiralty establishment at Portland. He couldpromise that, in the light of that report, he would consider whether any further and wider review of security procedures should be made.(/?) It was also suggested that the anxiety aroused by this casemight provide an opportunity for taking fresh measures to restrict theleakage of official information to the Press. The Prime Minister saidthat this was quite a different issue, but he would consider whetherthis was a favourable opportunity for taking further measures to dealwith it.Security inthe PublicService(previous reference:CC (61) 19thConclusions,Minute 2)George Blake
The Cabinet Took note of the general lines of the statement which thePrime Minister would make in the House of Commons that afternoon about the conviction of George Blake of offencesunder the Official Secrets Act; and agreed that the lord president should make a similar statement in the House ofLords.South-East 3.   The Lord Privy Seal said that progress was now being madeAsia Treaty towards an effective cease-fire in Laos. It could therefore be expectedOrganisation tnat the SEATO Council, whose meeting had been postponed, wouldLaos not press the suggestion that military dispositions should be made to(Previous       prepare for intervention in Laos.  It was also likely that the SovietReference:      Government would now agree that the International ControlC.C. (61) 25th   Commission should proceed at once to Laos. It would be advisable to conclusions.    resist the suggestion of the French Government that the internationalMinute 1)      conference, which was due to commence on 12th May, should be postponed for a few days in order to overcome the reluctance of PrinceSihanouk, who had been rebuffed by the King of Laos, to participate:it was desirable that the conference should commence its proceedingswithout delay.The United States Government were now concentrating onsecuring an effective cease-fire in Laos. If the truce were made andsubsequently broken, they were now inclined to favour an approach to the United Nations on the basis of a resolution calling for thedespatch of observers to report on any breach of the cease-fireconditions in Laos; and work was in hand on the preparation of a draft resolution, which, might be jointly sponsored by ourselves and theRussians. On military planning we continued to keep in close touchwith the United States authorities both in Washington and in South-East Asia.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Europe(previous references:C.C. (61) 24thConclusions,Minute 3 andC.C. (61) 10thConclusions,Minute 3)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that the recent discussions between officials of the United Kingdom and French Governments about thepossibility of forming a wider political and economic association inEurope had been more encouraging. The French representatives had seemed ready to recognise that any settlement must be acceptable toour partners in the European Free Trade Association, and had shownspecial interest in the possibility of an agreement on agricultural policy.He would arrange for an account of the meeting to be circulated.In discussion it was pointed out that we should not know for sometime, perhaps not until the end of June, whether the French Govern-ment would be prepared to enter into genuine negotiations on this problem. Only then would it be possible for the Cabinet to decide whether, preferably with some of our partners in the European free trade Association, we should seek to join with the countries of theCommon Market in forming a wider political and economic association. In reaching that decision, it would be essential to take full account of the pledges which had been given to British agriculture. Itwould be important that the farmers should be taken fully into consultation on our policy as it developed.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate an account of thediscussions which had taken place between officials of theUnited Kingdom and French Governments on 2nd and3rd May.
congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (61) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)5. The Lord Privy Seal said that there was so far no confirmation of reports that a number of Ghanaian soldiers and two British officers,who were in the United Nations force in the Congo, had been killedby Congolese troops. We had represented that Mr. Tshombe, who hadbeen taken into custody by Congolese forces after his refusal toco-operate with other Congolese leaders in the constitutional conference, should be released in order that he could play a constructive part in these discussions. It had not yet been possible to persuade the United Nations authorities to intercede on his behalf.The problem of financing the United Nations operations in the congo was becoming urgent. He proposed, after consulting theChancellor of the Exchequer, to circulate a memorandum on thissubject.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.industrial disputes(previous reference:C.C. (61) 25thConclusions,Minute 2)LondonDocksMerseyside6. The Minister of Labour said that the unofficial strike in theLondon docks had now come to an end, and the men concerned had returned to work without having obtained any concession from theLondon Dock Labour Board or the employers. It was to be hopedthat this result would lessen the influence of the unofficial leaders, andthat advantage could be taken of the fact that the position of the union representatives had been strengthened.No progress had been made, however, towards a settlement of thelong-standing official dispute on Merseyside, the real cause of whichlay in inter-union rivalry. A meeting was to be held that day betweenthe interests concerned, under the chairmanship of the regionalconciliation officer of the Ministry of Labour.The Minister said that he would circulate to the Cabinet amemorandum on current problems of industrial relations. He wouldalso arrange for the appropriate inter-departmental committee of officials to examine the current trend of Communist influence in industry.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Tourism(previous reference:C.C. (60) 62ndConclusions.Minute 13)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the duchy of Lancaster (C. (61) 56), to which was annexed the report of aCommittee of Ministers appointed to consider means of increasing theUnited kingdom&apos;s earnings from oversea visitors to this country.The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said that, although thelast few years had seen a rapid increase both in the number oftourists and other visitors from overseas and in the earnings derivedfrom them, a number of Western European countries had achieved an even greater increase in their tourist traffic. The Committee had considered what were the principal factors deterring tourists fromcoming to this country and what might be done to mitigate their effects.The principal deterrent was the lack of hotel accommodation, inparticular for visitors in the middle income groups. Many were unableto find the accommodation they required and it was estimated that by1965 there would be a shortage of 18,000 good-class hotel bedrooms.The Committee therefore recommended some form of tax relief, e.g. 
the application to hotels of the present industrial building allowance to encourage the building of new hotels and the provision of newbedrooms and bathrooms at existing ones. Exchequer loans at the ruling rate of interest might also be made for projects of the same kind,for which it was at present difficult to obtain credit on acceptableterms.Secondly, it was recommended that the carnet/triptyque system should be suspended for a trial period of two years, on theunderstanding that it would be reintroduced if the experiment resultedin a significant evasion of duty and tax. This could be measured bya simple check on the number of cars imported and exported byvisitors from abroad.Other deterrents were the conditions for passengers at the packetports, the meagre facilities for camping and caravanning in thiscountry and the lack of provision of &quot; all-in &quot; holidays of the typefamiliar on the Continent. This and other aspects of the wholequestion were now to be more energetically handled by theBritish Travel and Holidays Association, under its new Chairman and deputy Chairman.Discussion showed that there was some division of opinion in theCabinet on the proposal for some special form of Exchequer help forthe building and extension of hotels. A substantial building programme was already in progress and any form of subsidy to private enterprise was unwelcome to a section of the government&apos;s supporters. It would, moreover, be difficult to resist pressure for extending the principle to other undertakings, such as shops and offices, which would justly claim that they were contributing totourism and other forms of export trade. On the other hand, therewas relatively little profit to be made from building and operatinghotels below the luxury class, and the demand would certainly not bemet unless some special stimulus were offered. Tourism was the one form of export which could legitimately be subsidised and, if theobjections to an Exchequer subsidy were too great, assistance might perhaps be provided by the local authorities.On the question of the carnet/triptyque system, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer said that this served a dual purpose: by enabling theCustoms to trace cars which were sold after being imported withoutthe payment of either duty or purchase tax, it acted as a deterrent toevasion; and it provided at the same time a means by which theRevenue could recover any losses which might be incurred. Once thesystem was suspended it could hardly be reintroduced, and the consequent loss to the Revenue was estimated as upwards of  1 million a year.On the other hand, it was pointed out that all other western european countries had abandoned the system without, apparently,incurring serious loss of Revenue. The primary reason might havebeen that the volume of road traffic across land frontiers madethe system administratively unworkable and the different systems oftaxation on the Continent offered less inducement to the smuggling of motor cars. Nevertheless, our retention of the system, like the elaborate documentation which we alone still required for privateaircraft, was much criticised by visitors from abroad and almost certainly constituted a significant obstacle to the expansion of ourtourist trade. A number of simpler alternatives had been consideredby the Committee; but while these, together with the contactsdeveloped between the car licensing authorities and the Customs, couldserve for the tracing of smuggled cars, they all lacked the element of insurance for the Revenue which the present system provided.Further discussion showed that there was general agreement inthe Cabinet on the need for improving the passenger facilities at the ports. At many of them, however, expenditure was inhibited byuncertainty about the prospects of a Channel tunnel and a finaldecision on this was desirable.   Meanwhile, a tour of the ports was
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th May, 1961.shortly to be undertaken by the Joint Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Transport, Lord Chesham, who might be accompanied by representatives of the Home Office, the Ministry of Works and theBritish Transport Commission.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that before final decisions were reached further consideration should be given tothe issues in the report which had not been resolved (including thequestion of camping facilities in the National Parks). The cabinet should also have the opportunity to consider a report by LordChesham on conditions at the ports. Subject to these points, the reportappeared to be acceptable to the Cabinet and action might be initiatedon the lines recommended.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to give furtherconsideration to the proposal for some form of Exchequerassistance for the building and extension of hotels.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Transport to give further consideration tothe possibility of abandoning the carnet/triptyque system.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Aviation, to consider the documentationrequired for private aircraft arriving from abroad.(4) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate a report on theimprovement of the facilities for passengers at the mainpassenger ports.(5) Subject to further consideration of the matters mentioned in conclusions (1), (2) and (4) above, and of the question ofcamping facilities in the National Parks, approved therecommendations in the report annexed to C. (61) 56.(6) Agreed-to resume at a later meeting their discussion of the outstanding questions on the report.
