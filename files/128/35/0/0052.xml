&amp; 2 iMiddle East 1.   The Lord Privy Seal said that a revolt of elements of the(Previous Syrian Army, which had been subject to Soviet subversion in the reference: period before the union with Egypt, had apparently achieved ac.c. (61) 49th considerable measure of initial success. Egyptian forces had been conclusions. ordered to intervene and the eventual outcome was uncertain. Therewas no reason to suppose that the revolt had been instigated byneighbouring Governments, and it was unlikely that these wouldintervene.Our aim, in concert with the United States Government, shouldbe to encourage restraint on the part of neighbouring Governments,and our public attitude should be that we were anxious about any development that endangered the peace and stability of the middle east.Minute 5)United ArabRepublicCongoRepublic(previous reference :CC. (61) 51stConclusions.Minuie 1)2. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Prime Minister of theCentral Congo Government, Mr. Adoula, was under increasing pressure to invade Katanga, but his advisers were doubtful of their ability to subdue Katanga by military means. There was aconsiderable danger in any case that the Central Congo Governmentwould come increasingly under the influence of Mr. Gizenga, the deputy Prime Minister, and it was therefore important to encourageMr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of the provincial Government of katanga, to enter into negotiations with Mr. Adoula. The PrimeMinister of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, Sir roy welensky, and also the United States and French authorities, were co-operating to this end. Mr. Tshombe had undertaken to dispose of his remaining European military advisers, and he had also offered to meet Mr. Adoula on neutral territory. The main difficulty in theway of negotiations was that, while Mr. Adoula did not necessarilyreject an eventual settlement on federal lines, he maintained thatconstitutional discussions could only take place on the basis thatKatanga was a provincial Government.Germany 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the discussions betweenBerlin the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk, and the Soviet(Previous Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, had not so far revealed any basisReference: on which negotiations could be arranged, but they were to have aCC (6h 50th further meeting on 30th September.   The Foreign Secretary, whoConclusions. had throughout been in very close touch with Mr. Rusk, would minute 3) shortly return to this country.In discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in seeking to expand the scope of any negotiations beyond the narrowquestion of Allied access to Berlin. While the Soviet Governmentwere now prepared to guarantee access to Berli:- for the western powers, this was only on the understanding that the Western powers would have lo negotiate an arrangement with the East GermanGovernment and that Berlin should be a free, demilitarised city,garrisoned only by token contingents of Allied troops on a temporary basis and accompanied by an equivalent contingent of Soviet troops.Such a negotiation would involve delicate problems such as the recognition of the East German regime and the frontiers of the east german State, notably the Oder-Neisse line. It would also have tocover the problem of the continued freedom and viability of WestBerlinThe Cabinet -Took note of these statements.SECRET59910   4 &quot; -
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in his discussions with the Prime Minister ofJamaica, the Colonial Secretary should accept in principlethat, after the necessary preparations had been made,Jamaica should have full independence and that in due course Her Majesty&apos;s Government would sponsor theadmittance of Jamaica to Commonwealth membership.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to submit for their consideration at a later meeting a report on the prospects of establishing an Eastern Caribbean Federation whichmight include British Guiana.West Indies 4.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous       Colonial Secretary (C. (61) 142) on the implications of the referendumReference:     in Jamaica which had resulted in a decision that the territory shouldCC. (61) 3ist withdraw from the West Indies Federation.Conclusions.Minute 8) The Colonial Secretary said that there could be no question ofJamaica repudiating this decision which, although reached on a narrowmajority of a low poll, was accepted both by the Prime Minister,Mr. Manley, and by the Opposition Parties in Jamaica. Given the precedents of Cyprus and Sierra Leone, and having regard to the size of the population, economic viability and relative stability ofthe territory, a request from Jamaica for full independence withinthe Commonwealth could not reasonably be resisted. He proposed,therefore, that in the discussions he would have with the PrimeMinister of Jamaica in the following week he should indicate that theUnited Kingdom Government were willing in principle to agree that,after the necessary preparations had been made, Jamaica should become independent and would sponsor her application for membership of the Commonwealth. As some time would berequired to resolve a number of legislative and administrative problems created by the withdrawal of Jamaica from the Federation,it would be possible to avoid a firm date for independence at thisstage, but this would probably take place in the latter half of 1963.The implications of the decision for the other islands in theFederation could not yet be clearly seen. He was discussing this problem with Sir Grantley Adams, the Federal Prime Minister, and hoped shortly to have the views of Dr. Williams, the Prime Ministerof Trinidad and Tobago. Subject to these consultations, it mightbe possible to establish an Eastern Caribbean Federation whichmight include British Guiana. A conference with representatives ofthe smaller islands might be desirable when opinion had had timeto crystallise.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) It&quot; would be important to maintain, in discussions withrepresentatives from all the West Indian territories, the cautiousattitude which had so far been adopted about financial assistance by Her Majesty&apos;s Government. There did not seem any case for providing assistance for Jamaica, and the poorer islands should notbe allowed to suppose that in independence they could expect fullfinancial support from the United Kingdom.(b) The withdrawal of Jamaica from the Federation might makethe inclusion of British Guiana in a federation of all the remainingislands a little easier.(c) As the British Overseas Airways Corporation were losingsubstantial sums annually in supporting the West Indies airline,which aspired to the status of an international airline, it might nowbe possible to cut the rate of loss by reducing operations to the more modest level of an inter-island air service.
Uganda(previous reference:CC. (60) 10thConclusions.Minuie 5)5. The Colonial Secretary said that the prospects for theUganda Constitutional Conference, in which the discussions had sofar been difficult, were now a little more encouraging. But there remained a serious danger that the Baganda representatives wouldnot accept a reasonable compromise, on the basis of a constitutionalformula which he had now proposed, and in that case it was morethan likely that the Conference would break down.Ghana 6.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that there had recently(Previous        been   a   marked   deterioration  in   relations  with  the  GhanaReference:      Government, particularly following the speeches made by PresidentCC. (58) 82nd Nkrumah in the course of his visit to the Soviet Union in which he conclusions.     had criticised the United Kingdom Government and the policies of minute 2)       tjie West.   There had also been the abrupt dismissal of general alexander, the British Chief of the Defence Staff of Ghana.President Nkrumah had now sent a reassuring message to the PrimeMinister, in which he disavowed any intention of adopting pro-Sovietpolicies and asserted his desire to maintain friendly relations.Nevertheless, in view of the forthcoming visit of The Queen to Ghana,it was desirable that the apprehensions which were widely felt in thiscountry about the policies of the Ghana Government should befrankly, though privately, expressed to President Nkrumah.   he therefore proposed to visit Ghana in the following week for thispurpose.The Cabinet agreed that it would be undesirable for theGovernment to take any action which would worsen relations withGhana. There was a considerable volume of opposition there to president Nkrumah. as was shown by the recent labour troubles.There was some chance that a more sympathetic attitude to thiscountry would in the end prevail. Subject to the overriding need to ensure The Queen&apos;s safety, it seemed that it would be advisable for her visit to Ghana to take place, though it might be possible to curtail its length.The Cabinet were informed that, although certain difficulties had still to be overcome, it seemed likely that the aid which theUnited States Government had proposed to contribute for the VoltaRiver project would be made available. Some delay in this matter might help to induce President Nkrumah to be more reasonable inhis policies and speeches.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet welcomed the intentionof the Commonwealth Secretary to visit Ghana for frank but privatetalks with President Nkrumah. In the light of the outcome he would submit considered advice to The Queen about her proposed visit.Wages Poiiey 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Labour (C. (61) 141) about the operative date of statutoryReference orders to give effect to proposals of certain Wages Councils to. (6D 50th increase minimum wages.The Minister of Labour said that he had drawn the attention ofall Wages Councils known to be considering wage claims to theterms of the statement by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on25th July in the House of Commons. He had no power to amend the proposals of a Wages Council and. although he could refer themback, he was bound to make an order to give effect to them ifre-submitted, and it would be improper to delay doing so. for practical reasons, the operative date which he had to specify andwhich was not open to argument by the councils was normally fromConclusionsMinute 5)WiiitesCouncils
6 SECRET (one to two months after the proposals had been received; but theWages Councils Act did not specify what factors were to be takeninto account in settling operative dates. He understood that it wouldbe open to him to defer the operative date by a period longer thannormal; a,period of six months would probably not be held by thecourts to involve a breach of statutory duty, but a longer periodprobably would.He had received proposals from the four Wages Councils dealingwith industrial and staff canteens, waste reclamation, road haulageand licensed hotels and restaurants, and had referred them back.In all these cases the councils could claim that they had agreed ontheir proposals before the statement on 25th July and they had infact re-submitted their proposals unchanged. He felt justified inacknowledging at least some degree of commitment and he thoughtthat the choice of 1st January as an operative date, being about two months later than normal, would be appropriate.In discussion there was general recognition that, even if a datelater than 1st January could be defended against challenge in thecourts, it would be undesirable to run the risk of proceedings. a date in 1962 might be an inducement to those affected to take strike action which, particularly in the road haulage industry, might doserious damage to the economy. The choice of 1st January wouldalso have the disadvantage that, despite any disclaimer at the timeof the announcement, that date would be regarded by the public asthe Governments forecast of the end of the pause.For practical purposes, therefore, the choice lay between fixing a normal date in the earlier part of November and a slightly deferreddate at 1st December. From the point of view of the pause,1st December would be better. On the other hand, to make the increases operative on the normal date would be justifiable in thelight of the action taken within the field of Government employment,where commitments were being honoured which, before 25th July,were no more than offers. Moreover, to adhere to the normal date would not make matters more difficult for the Government in the irrelations with other groups of work-people and might make themeasier. It would mean that those Wages Council proposals whichcould not be held to be the subject of commitments could, inpursuance of the policy of the pause, be deferred a substantial wayinto 1962. This would have the particular advantage of helping tostagger payment of the substantial number of increases which would otherwise become due at the end of the pause.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider, in the light oftheir discussion, whether 1st December would be the most satisfactory operative date for the wage increases proposed to him by the four Wages Councils which couldclaim that commitments had been entered into before25th July.Industrial Tlw Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after discussion with civil Servants lnc Prime Minister, he had futher considered whether the M ralepay agreement for industrial civil servants should be implemented.He had come to the conclusion that to implement the agreement would damage the policy of the wage pause more seriously than hehad at first thought. It seemed evident that the Civil Service staff associations attached greater importance to maintaining theprinciple of comparability than they did to the procedures by whichcomparability was established. They had. of course, been seriously disturbed by the Governmenfs decision to withdruw operative datesfrom the scope of arbitration, but their adverse reaction to a refusal to implement the M rate agreement would not be increased by thefact that that agreement had been committed to writing and was for a fixed period.  They would be more likely to take the view that
The Queen&apos;1 8. The Home Secretary said that the Committee on The Queen&apos;speeches on Speeches had met to consider preliminary drafts of the speeches andthe Prorogation he would shortly submit revised drafts for consideration by theand Opening Cabinet. As the Prorogation of Parliament would this year takeplace a full week before the opening, he had it in mind that the draftProrogation Speech might be considered by the Cabinet on10th October, and the draft Opening Speech on 17th October.Some uneasiness had been felt by the Committee lest theGovernment might be attempting a heavier legislative programmethan would prove manageable, and the suggestion had been made inthe course of their discussions that the simplest means of lighteningthe programme would be to exclude the Weights and Measures Bill.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.Cabinet Office. S.W. 1,28th September. 1961.CC 52 (61)to implement this agreement whilst withholding increases claimedfor other Government employees on a footing of comparability withoutside employment would amount to unjustifiably preferential treatment to the M rate employees; and they would increase their opposition to the wage pause, with the danger that the government&apos;s policy would be frustrated. He had accordingly come to theconclusion that the agreement should be repudiated.The Cabinet (2) Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.
