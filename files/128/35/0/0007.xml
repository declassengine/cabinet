commonwealth immigrants(previous reference:C.C. (60) 59thConclusions.Minute 8)2. The Lord Chancellor said that, while in 1958 and 1959 the flow of coloured immigrants into this country had slackened, thenumbers had risen in 1960 to nearly 60,000. There were now some300,000 coloured British subjects living in this country and it was estimated that in twenty years the total might rise to X% millions.The Commonwealth Migrants&apos; Committee had, earlier that day,considered the effect of this large increase and, in particular, what course the Government should follow in the debate which was totake place in the House of Commons on the following day on a motion calling for legislation, which was sponsored by a Governmentsupporter. The Committee had concluded that the extent of colouredimmigration gave no cause for serious disquiet at present, in relationto employment or the preservation of law and order. But, in the areas where the majority of the immigrants tended to congregate, housingproblems were becoming increasingly acute and there was also cause for some anxiety on grounds of public health. The Committeerecognised that, apart from the objections of principle to legislation which would limit the traditional right of British subjects to admission to the United Kingdom and would be seen to have the purpose ofdiscriminating against coloured persons, there would be special difficulty in introducing such legislation at the present time, when theGovernment were striving, in the constitutional discussions with southern Rhodesia, to secure safeguards against racial discrimination and when, in the West Indies, progress was being made towards the holding of a constitutional conference leading towards theindependence of the Federation. They had therefore agreed with theHome Secretary&apos;s proposal that the Government spokesman in the debate should say that they were watching the position with great care; that they would welcome a full expression of Parliamentaryopinion; but that they would not reach any final decision until theyhad taken account of it.In discussion it was pointed out that the Motion on the order paper was neither acceptable in its present form nor easy to defeat.There should, however, be no undue difficulty in arranging for it tobe talked out.The Prime Minister said that it appeared to be the general viewof the Cabinet that there was no need to decide at once whether legislation should be introduced to control immigration from other commonwealth countries and that in any event an early indication of the Governments intention to do so would be inopportune. the content and form of such legislation should, however, be considered,in order that the Government might be in a position to reach adecision and, if necessary, to take action early in the following Session.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the conclusion of the Commonwealth Migrants&apos;Committee that the Government spokesman shouldtemporise in the debate on this subject on a private member&apos;s Motion on the following day.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committeeto consider the form which legislation to control immigration from other Commonwealth countries might take, and to bring the matter again before the Cabinet indue course.58960-2C.C. 7 (61)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Iron and SteelIndustry(previous reference:C.C. (60) 54thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an announcement would be made on 20th February that the Iron and Steel holding and Realisation Agency would on 27th February formally advertisethe terms on which they were offering to sell the major part of theGovernments holdings of prior charges in the steel industry. Theproposed terms would enable it to be said that the sale would not result in a loss to the Government on the book value of these assets.Nevertheless, there would be criticism from the Opposition on theground that nationalised assets were being realised for&apos; the benefit ofprivate investors to the detriment of the Exchequer.Federation of rhodesia and nyasaland(previous reference:C.C. (61) 6thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Colonial Secretary said that the proposals which he had now tabled at the Northern Rhodesian Constitutional conference had met with considerable criticism, not only from the african representatives at the Conference, but also from the United FederalParty in Northern Rhodesia and the Federation. Each groupsuspected that the purpose of the plan was to enable control to begiven to the other side. The African representatives, with some justification, resented the fact that consultations were in progress with the United Federal Party representatives who had absentedthemselves from the Conference.The Conference would that afternoon insist on discussing the franchise for the upper roll, about which, in accordance with the plan,it was not proposed to reveal any details. The remaining sessions ofthe Conference would no doubt be very difficult, and it would bedesirable to conclude proceedings by the week-end. This wouldenable a statement to be made to Parliament on 20th February, andit was proposed to present at the same time a White Paper giving an account of the Conference and of the Governments proposals. Itwas likely that this would be followed by some disorders in northern rhodesia; but, since the dissatisfaction of the Africans would betempered by the knowledge that the European element were no lesscritical of the Governments proposals, there was some hope that aserious emergency would be avoided.The Prime Minister said that to prolong the Conference beyondthe week-end would only increase the risk of disturbances. Theproposals which the Government had tabled did not constitute afinal decision but would be open to further consideration. It wastherefore right that they should remain in general terms. In particular,discussion about the details of the franchise for the upper roll shouldbe resisted, since it was our intention that the qualifications for thatroll should remain very much as at present, and the Prime Ministerof the Federation had been so informed.The Cabinet Agreed that the Colonial Secretary should conduct the concluding stages of the Northern Rhodesian constitutional conference on the lines agreed in their discussion.Defence(previous reference:C.C. (59) 60thConclusions,Minute 6)Exchange ofInformationabout AircraftMovements5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 17) about the exchange of information on aircraftmovements between Gibraltar and Spain.The Foreign Secretary said that a scheme had been worked outby the Royal Air Force authorities in Gibraltar and the United states air Force authorities in Spain, under which information on hostileair activity would be passed from the Spanish Air defence organisation to Gibraltar and information on friendly aircraft usingor overflying Gibraltar would be passed by the Royal Air Force tothe Spanish and United States Air Defence Organisations, which were about to be integrated.  From the political point of view it would
Germany(previous reference:C.C. (61) 5thConclusions,Minute 5)defence facilities inthe UnitedKingdom6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Defence (C. (61) 12 and 22) about theprovision of defence facilities in the United Kingdom for forces ofthe Federal German Government.The Minister of Defence recalled that on 7th February theCabinet had invited him to ascertain what would be entailed in granting certain military facilities in the United Kingdom which hadbeen asked for by the Federal German Government. Requests hadbeen submitted for the following facilities:(a) storage of ammunition, petrol, oil and lubricants, and generalsupplies for both the army and navy;(b) maintenance facilities for naval aircraft and vessels of Britishorigin;(c) facilities for shore target firing from naval vessels and facilitiesfor amphibious training and exercises with naval aircraft;(d) range facilities for one armoured regiment at a. time, covering a period of about 30 weeks in the year.The Cabinet had already agreed that no objection need be raised to the first three of these requests. The request for facilities for tanktraining presented some political difficulties. On the one hand itwas important that we should accord to Germany the treatment dueto a member of the North Atlantic Alliance: on the other hand,acceptance of their request would be unwelcome to certain sectionsof public opinion in this country and might involve the Governmentin political difficulty at home. There was, however, no question ofmanoeuvres over wide areas, but only of making available to theGermans part of the capacity of an existing training area for simpletactical exercises and for the firing of guns. The facilities at the range in Germany (which belonged to the North Atlantic Alliance)were fully occupied by our own and other forces of the Alliance andthe alternative of transferring our own tank regiments for trainingin this country would be technically less satisfactory and considerably more expensive. Discussions with the Germans were due to takeplace in the following week under the auspices of the North atlantic alliance; and the Minister considered that, on balance, the best course was to instruct our representatives to offer the facilities wecould spare under the first three headings and to explore with theGermans the practical possibilities of providing them with facilitiesC.C. 7 (61)be preferable not to approach the Spanish authorities on the scheme;but it might have certain practical advantages and the risk of embarrassment might be reduced if the arrangements were made ata technical rather than a political level.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposed arrangements would only be of significant practical value in the event or threat ofglobal war. There was always some risk that an approach to theSpanish authorities would become public. It would be particularlyembarrassing if a suggestion were to meet with a rebuff. Since any approach towards the establishment of closer relations with theSpanish Government was likely to have disproportionate politicaleffects in this country and the arrangements contemplated could inany event be made very quickly in any period of tension precedingglobal war, it would be preferable that the proposal should not beadopted unless and until the threat of war became more imminent.The Cabinet-Agreed that for the time being no action should be taken togive effect to the proposals in C. (61) 17.
St-0fCommonwealthYouth Trust(previous reference:C.C. (60) 64thConclusions,Minute 8)7. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (61) 3) covering a revised draft of a Government statementarising from the recommendations made in the Templer Report forthe establishment of a Commonwealth Youth Trust. This revised draft had been prepared in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of15th December, 1960, and in the light of their discussion at that meeting. The Cabinet had then contemplated that it might become necessary to publish a summary of the recommendations of theTempler Committee, and a draft of such a summary was also annexed.The Prime Minister said that every effort should be made to avoidpublishing even a summary of these recommendations. The TemplerCommittee had been asked to submit a report for the confidential information of the Government; and it was important, as a matterof principle, that the Government should hold themselves free to withhold publication of the reports of such enquiries.The Commonwealth Secretary supported this view. Indeed, forhis part, he would prefer that the statement should deal only with the steps which the Government were themselves proposing to take,especially in relation to the provision of hostel accommodation, andshould not refer to recommendations in the Report which the for tank training. We could not offer as much as they had asked and,when they realised this and the other drawbacks inherent in their proposal, they might prefer to withdraw it and to arrange for additional tank training in France (where, the Cabinet were informed,there had been no adverse public reaction to the arrangements already in operation).The Home Secretary said that the political difficulty of grantingthe German Government^ request would be accentuated if it were necessary to extend to their forces in this country some of the powers,privileges and exemptions afforded by the Visiting Forces Act, 1952.This would require an Order in Council which was subject to affirmative resolutions of both Houses of Parliament, and opposition might well be voiced in either House especially as the GermanGovernment had not ratified the North Atlantic Treaty Status of forces Agreement.In discussion there was general agreement that we should avoidaction which would prejudice the full integration of Federal Germanyinto the North Atlantic Alliance and that public opinion in thiscountry must be brought to accept that fact. On the other hand,we must be in a position to make a convincing case for whateverfacilities were to be extended to the Germans. The request shouldbe presented as originating with the Alliance itself, in discharge ofits responsibility for the distribution of training throughout its area.The proposal might, indeed, be more acceptable if it were possibleto broaden it so as to include also forces other than those of western germany.In further discussion it was agreed that it would be preferable not to offer the German forces the benefits of the Visiting forces act unless we were under some definite obligation to do so.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (61) 22 on the provision ofdefence facilities in the United Kingdom for the federal german forces.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Ministerof Defence, to consider further whether it would benecessary in this connexion to extend to German unitscoming to this country for tank training the privileges ofthe Visiting Forces Act, 1952.
congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (61) 5thConclusions,Minute 1)8. The Foreign Secretary reported the latest developments inthe Congo. The Soviet Government had reacted very strongly to the news of Mr. Lumumba&apos;s death, and they must now be expected todo their utmost to strengthen the position of Mr. Gizenga. Theymight try to persuade some of the countries which had military forcesin the Congo to put them at Mr. Gizenga&apos;s disposal, but in this theywere not likely to be successful. Alternatively they might themselvestry to provide him with arms and supplies by means of an air-lift toStanleyville. The United States Government had asked us to consider what could be done to forestall such a manoeuvre. Meanwhile theSoviet Government were intensifying their efforts to undermine theposition of the Secretary-General of the United Nations. their communications to the organisation were now being sent, not to theSecretary-General, but to a Russian member of the secretariat.In the Cabinets discussion special emphasis was laid on theimportance of preventing the establishment of a Soviet air-lift intoStanleyville. It was suggested that the Chiefs of Staff might be askedto prepare a technical appreciation of the difficulties which theRussians would encounter in organising such an air-lift. The foreign secretary should also consider whether it would be practicable for united Nations forces in the neighbourhood to create suchobstructions as would deny the use of the airfield to the Russians.The Secretary-General of the United Nations would presumably bejustified in instructing United Nations forces to take passive steps toprevent unilateral intervention in the Congo by any foreign Power.The Cabinet Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider, inconsultation with the Minister of Defence, what steps itwould be practicable to take to prevent the organisation ofa Soviet air-lift into Stanleyville; and that, in the light ofthis, he would consider whether the Secretary-General ofthe United Nations could properly be pressed to instructUnited Nations forces in the area to take action to this end.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th February, 1961.Government were not proposing to accept.
