The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Tshombe, the PrimeMinister of Katanga, accompanied by the British, French and UnitedStates Consuls, had gone to Ndola to meet Mr. Gullion, the UnitedStates Ambassador, who was to accompany him to the meeting atKitona with Mr. Adoula, the Prime Minister of the central CongoGovernment. Before leaving Elisabethville Mr. Tshombe had himselfcalled for a cease-fire.

The Foreign Secretary made a brief report to the Cabinet onthe course of the recent discussions in Paris on the Berlin question,in the four-Power meetings the French had continued to argue againstthe initiation of any negotiations with the Soviet Government on thisquestion at the present time. In the discussions in the North atlantic council this view hud commanded no support from any quarter; and.60200   13!. The Foreign Secretary said that, despite the representations made to them, the Indian Government had undertaken militaryoperations against Goa. It seemed likely that the Portugueseopposition would soon be overwhelmed. A motion to place thisquestion on the agenda of the Security Council had been carried bythe bare minimum of seven votes, Russia and Ceylon having voted against it and Egypt and Liberia having abstained from voting. Itwas evident that the Soviet Government intended to support India&apos;transaction and to veto any resolution calling for the withdrawal of forces or for a settlement by negotiation. If India&apos;s action were notcondemned in the United Nations, Indonesia would be encouraged to launch a similar attack on West Irian.In discussion it was pointed out that, if the United Nationsfailed on such occasions to uphold the rule of law, the long-termconsequences would be very grave. If therefore the Russians usedtheir veto in the Security Council, it was for consideration whether some initiative should be taken to bring this issue before the Assembly,either generally or in relation to some specific incident.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would in the firstinstance invite the views of the United kingdom delegation in New York on the further handling of thesequestions in the United Nations.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss the problem with President Kennedy during their forthcoming meeting in Bermuda.
but for the French, a much stronger resolution would have beencarried. In the event the French had reluctantly acquiesced in theproposal that further soundings should be taken in Moscow to see whether a basis for negotiation could be found. In these furtherprobings the lead would be taken by the United States ambassador in Moscow, who would keep in close touch with his British andGerman colleagues. The French Government were not, however,prepared to associate themselves with this initiative and it was likely that they would raise further difficulties as soon as the conversationsbegan to touch on questions of substance.The Prime Minister said that the United States government might be willing to bear a special responsibility for ascertaining, inthis next phase, whether a basis for negotiation could be found. ^ If so,it might be expedient that they should do so in order to avoid theappearance of leaving the French in isolation.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would discuss with president Kennedv, at their forthcoming meeting in bermuda, how best to deal with the reluctance of the FrenchGovernment to contemplate negotiations with the SovietGovernment on Berlin.NorthAtlanticCouncil(previous reference:CC. (59) 39thConclusions.Minute 4)ministerial meeting inParis5. The Foreign Secretary said that the North Atlantic Alliancewas at present under some strain. The French were being generallyunco-operative; and the pressure of events in Berlin and the Congohad made it difficult for the larger Powers who were working closelytogether lo bring the smaller countries of the Alliance into consultation. The recent meeting of Foreign Ministers had donesomething to restore confidence; and the decision that colonial powers who were members of the Alliance should concert their plans for action in the United Nations was a useful step. There was,however, continuing uncertainty about defence problems especially the control of nuclear weapons and the size of the United kingdom forces to be stationed in Europe. The Government of the UnitedStates had now said that they would consider any proposals whichthe European members of the Alliance could formulate for controlof nuclear weapons assigned to the Alliance. His impression wasthat in making this offer the Government of the United St ttes wereassuming that it would be difficult if not impossible to get agreement;the French in particular would refuse to bind themselves to any measures of collective control, partly because they wanted to buildup their own striking force and partly because they did not want to exclude the possibility of some bilateral agreement with the Germans.The following points were made in discussion:(a) The difficulties of the United Kingdom position had been generally recognised. There had been little pressure .m us to increasethe si/e of our forces in Germany in advance of an agreement onsupport costs. Since it was unlikely that we should get a generoussettlement from the Germans, the Government could probably holdto their present plans without attracting criticism.(h) The difficulty over nuclear weapons derived not so much from the position of the French or the absence of plans for the controlof weapons by members of the Alliance collectively, but rather fromthe absence of any agreed strategy for the Alliance. A necessary first step to this would be agreement between the Governments of theUnited Stales and the United Kingdom. This would not be impossiblebut there was much work still to be done.(c) With the build-up of Russian capability and the growth ofconfidence in their own strength, the European Powers were not so
Kenya 6.   The Colonial Secretary said that, while there were still(Previous        differences of view between them, the Kenya African National UnionReference:       and the Kenya African Democratic Union were making a determinedC.C.(6l)(i?rd   effort to narrow the gap. There was now some hope that workableConclusions.     proposals would be put forward from the African side before the minute 5)        opening of the constitutional conference in February.    If theconference went well it would be possible to envisage elections in the later part of 1962 leading to independence in 1%3.  The position ofBritish forces in Kenya after independence might be difficult.   the africans would be reluctant to become involved in a conflict betweenthe great  Powers;  but they were  anxious to remain  in  theCommonwealth and it might be best to leave this question until theconstitutional conference had been held and in subsequent discussion to emphasise the Commonwealth rather than the British purposes ofthe military facilities which we wished to retain.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The future of the European settlers would turn on the safeguards to be written into the Constitution. These would not,however, be sufficient to re-assure them unless there was a reasonable prospect that they could be enforced. Though progress was beingmade with the training of African officers for the King&apos;s African Riflesit wouhl be impossible to produce by l-%3 enough middle-rank and senior olficers to be sure of maintaining disciplined forces underAfrican control. It would be preferable to plan for the retention ofa proportion of European officers. To re-assure the European settlersit was also desirable that we should be able to retain at least some british troops.(/;) The breakdown of law and order in the Congo had awakenedopinion in other African countries to the dangers of conferringindependence tooquiekly. The Nigerian Government were sponsoringa resolution in the United Nations suggesting ten years as the period within which it might be reasonable to aim at independence for allCC. 75 (61)much afraid that the Americans would use the nuclear deterrentirresponsibly, as that they would not use it because they would be unwilling to place their own country in jeopardy. It was for thisreason important to develop the idea of bringing some part of theWestern deterrent under joint control; there was otherwise a danger that the European members of the Alliance would retreat into a purely defensive strategy. One difficulty here was that the forms ofcontrol hitherto considered were designed rather to prevent weaponsbeing fired without general consent than to guarantee their use in a crisis.(d) Any control system would involve German participation andit was to be expected that the Russians would re-act sharply to this.They would not believe that control could be effective and would regard such an arrangement as tantamount to handing over nuclear weapons to the Germans.(e) The importance of preventing the spread of nuclear weaponsto other countries was already dominant and was increasing. this in turn underlined the importance of a general detente with Russia.It might be worth accepting some rough division of the world intospheres of influence if as a result the Russians could be brought tojoin with us in concentrating on stopping the spread of nuclear weapons.The Cabinet took  note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints raised in the discussion.
CommonwealthOrganisationsin the UnitedKingdomDiplomaticImmunities and privileges(previous reference:C.C.(61) 11thConclusions.Minute 8)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (61)215) and a note by the Secretaryof the Cabinet (C. (61)216) covering a report by officials onimmunities and privileges for Commonwealth organisationsestablished in the United Kingdom.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that, when the cabinet had previously considered his proposal, they had asked that officials should report on the implications of conferring diplomatic immunityon such Commonwealth organisations and their staffs as might beestablished in London. In the report which had now been circulatedit was argued that the international organisations whose members and officials enjoyed immunities differed from commonwealth organisaitons because the immunities were derived in all cases from a formal international agreement. He did not find this distinctionconvincing and considered that as a matter of principleCommonwealth organisations should not appear to have lower statusthan international organisations. He also thought it important toshow that we were determined to build up the machinery of commonwealth co-operation. There had been some difficulty in persuading officials of other Commonwealth countries, who had previously enjoyed the advantages of diplomatic status, to acceptposts in London which did not carry those advantages and he would now like to make it known to the two bodies who were pressing for action the Commonwealth Education Committee and theCommonwealth Education Liaison Committee that the Governmentwere prepared to legislate for this purpose.In discussion it was pointed out that the grart of immunityinvolved the possibility that justice would be denied to some ordinarycitizen and each extension of immunities made resistance to subsequent proposals more difficult. In the case of international organisations the grant of immunities depended on the agreement ortreaty establishing the organisation and it was often possible to secure a waiver of immunities in defined circumstances. The normal criterionwas how far the work of the organisation would be inhibited ifimmunities were not granted. In the case of the commonwealth organisaitons which had been mentioned it could not be said thatimmunities were necessary; nor could it fairly be said that exemption from United Kingdom tax was essential for the staffs of the organisations.African States. It was possible that a move on our part to slowdown the timetable for the independence of Kenya might commandmore support than had been assumed hitherto. There was, however,a serious risk that such a course would lead to an explosion. Thebusiness community in Kenya were in favour of an early settlement,which they believed to be preferable to a continuation of the present uncertainty.(c) It would not be easy to maintain that British military installations in Kenya were meeting the needs of Commonwealthdefence; nor would it be acceptable to do so if this resulted inrestrictions on our use of these facilities. It might be better to abandon the idea of keeping a base in Kenya and to rely on periodical training to maintain some British military presence in the country.The Cabinet Invited the Colonial Secretary to circulate before theopening of the constitutional conference in February a paper setting out his proposals for a Constitution in kenya and assessing the risks involved in delaying independencebeyond 1963.
Cabinet Office. S.W.1,19th December, 1961.It was argued, on the other hand, that if the United Kingdomdid not grant this immunity, Commonwealth organisations which ought to be established in London either would not be established atall or would be set up in other Commonwealth countries. other commonwealth Governments would be ready to grant immunityand they would find it difficult to understand why similar treatmentcould not be given in this country particularly if, as was to beexpected, immunity had to be accorded on a large scale to Europeansas the result of our entry into the European Economic Community.If it were thought necessary, a general agreement might be negotiatedwhich would govern the practice in all parts of the Commonwealth.Alternatively, it might be possible, without serious breach of general principles, to arrange for particular Commonwealth organisations to waive immunity from suit and legal process except where immunitycould be shown to be necessary for the purposes for which theorganisation was founded, and to explore the possibility that commonwealth organisations might adopt internal tax systems oftheir own.Summing up the discussion the Prime Minister said that,because of the importance of fostering co-operation in theCommonwealth, the idea of extending to commonwealth organisaitons and their staffs the impiunities enjoyed by international organisations should not be abandoned. Before a decision could betaken, however, it would be desirable to have further information onthe nature and scope of the legislation which would be required andon the extent to which a satisfactory result could be obtained bymeans not involving legislation for example, by attaching membersof the organisations to the offices of their respective high commissioners in London. The Cabinet should also be furnished with a list of the Commonwealth organisations which had been created and were likely to be created in the United Kingdom and astatement showing the extent to which international organisations andtheir staffs had in practice been permitted to enjoy the full range ofimmunities provided for by the International Organisations(Immunities and Privileges) Act, 1950. Meanwhile it would be inappropriate to undertake a commitment in principle in favour of granting privileges and immunities to Commonwealth organisations.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for officials to submit a further report covering the points mentioned by the Prime Minister in summing up thediscussion.
