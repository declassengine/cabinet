The Prime Minister said that he had now discussed the case ofGeorge Blake with representatives of the Opposition in the House ofCommons, and had decided, after consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Lord Privy Seal, to appoint a committee of enquiry into security in the public service. The committee, which would begiven broad terms of reference, would not consist of Privy Councillorsas such. He would appoint an independent chairman of high status and would consider whether it was desirable to include any Membersof Parliament. The committee would submit their report to the PrimeMinister, who would then have further consultations with the leader of the Opposition. This course should go some way to alleviatepresent public anxiety and might strengthen the Governments hand ifthey decided that there was a case for improving security procedures.2. The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he proposed to reaffirm, in a debate in the House of Commons that day on teachers&apos;salaries in Scotland, his decision not to approve an increase of morethan about \2\ per cent, (subject possibly to some minor upwardadjustment). The teachers&apos; strike in Glasgow was still in progress andhe would not, therefore, mention any possibility of a special allowance for Glasgow teachers.The Minister of Education said that, contrary to expectation, thelocal authorities in England and Wales were preparing to make an offer to the teachers which would add about 17 per cent, to the total cost of salaries. This would put the Government in a very difficult positionsince, unlike the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister had notpower to modify, but only to accept or reject, an agreed recommenda-tion from the Burnharn Committee. He proposed shortly to circulate to the Cabinet a memorandum on the present situation.In discussion it was generally agreed that, until the Cabinet had had the opportunity to consider developments in the negotiations inEngland and Wales, the Secretary of State for Scotland shouldreaffirm his decision. This had been well received in the Press and itwas possible that the Government might not find themselves withoutpublic support if they adopted a similarly firm attitude to the burnham Committee.The Cabinet (I) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to reaffirm his decision to approve an increase of pay for Scottish teachers(subject to minor modifications) of not more than about\2\ per cent.(2) Invited the Minister of Education to circulate a memorandumon the current negotiations in the Burnham Committee.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.Parliament would adjourn for the Whitsun recess on 19th Mayand would reassemble on 30th May.In order to make as much progress as possible with government business, it would probably be necessary that the House should sit until3rd August. Consideration would be given later to the possible need to resume the session after the summer recess.

(60) 17thConclusions,Minute 1 andC.C. (61) 12thConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Foreign Secretary said that the meeting of the north atlantic Council at Oslo had provided an opportunity for discussions between the United Kingdom, United States and french representatives, together with representatives of the Federal GermanGovernment, about the problem of Berlin. It was generally agreedthat there would be no advantage in the Western Powers taking theinitiative for negotiations, as there were no new proposals they could put forward. The Federal German Foreign Minister had made very clear to him that they could not accept the idea of an interimsettlement during which the two Germanies would be expected tonegotiate a settlement. Mr. Khrushchev might well put forward proposals for Berlin, which might appear not unreasonable to neutral opinion, and he would be likely in due course to sign a treaty with theEast German Government, as a result of which, he would assert, thestatus of and access to West Berlin would be matters for negotiation with that Government. It was therefore necessary to consider withour allies what course we should follow in such a situation. The first step would be for us to have urgent discussions with the United states authorities.It seemed that the United States and Federal German Govern-ments now agreed that a requirement to obtain passes from the east german, instead of Soviet, authorities would not of itself justifymilitary action, and that the test should be whether allied access wasin fact obstructed or the freedom of West Berlin threatened.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 26thConclusions.Minute 3)6. The Foreign Secretary said that at the international con-ference which was about to begin at Geneva he would continue to workfor agreement on the neutrality of Laos under the supervision of aninternational commission, which might be somewhat larger than theexisting Commission. Although this might be acceptable to the SovietGovernment, the Communist Chinese authorities might be aggressiveand intransigent. The United States authorities were considering anumber of possibilities, including the demilitarisation of Laos or itspartition. There was, however, little chance of securing partition byagreement, in view of the positions which Pathet Lao forces hadalready occupied.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (61) 26thConclusions,Minute 5)7. The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Tshombe was unharmedbut under arrest, and in view of the attitude of the United Nationsauthorities there seemed little chance of securing his release. Theco-operation between Mr. Kasavubu and General Mobutu affordedsome hope that a satisfactory plan might be evolved to retrain theCongolese forces and that further progress might be made towards a constitutional settlement in the Congo on federal lines.
M(iOpening ofParliamentTelevisionFacilities(previous reference:C.C. (60) 43rdConclusions,Minute 6)Coal(previous reference:C.C. (60) 64thConclusions,Minute 6)8. The Home Secretary said that the Home Affairs Committeehad considered an application from the British broadcasting corporation (BBC) for permission to televise the State Opening of thenext session of Parliament. The Committee on Broadcasting, underthe Chairmanship of Sir Harry Pilkington, were expected to reportearly in the following year and the atmosphere of controversy which their report would generate would make it inappropriate that the StateOpening should be televised in 1962. The choice therefore laybetween broadcasting the ceremony in the following session or not atall in the present Parliament: the balance of opinion in the HomeAffairs Committee had been in favour of the latter.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with this conclusion. Public demand for a broadcast of theState Opening did not appear to be strong. If this were entrusted tothe BBC for the second time in succession, the Independent television authority (ITA) must be expected to complain. An alternativesuggestion that excerpts from a film of the ceremony might be broadcast was not wholly suited to the nature of the occasion and was likely to be unacceptable to both the BBC and the ITA.The Cabinet-Endorsed the conclusion of the Home Affairs Committee thatthe State Opening should not be televised during the present parliament.9. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister of power (C. (61) 60) and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (61) 62)about imports of United States coal.The Minister of Power said that the Steel Company of Wales had applied for a licence to import 250,000 tons of coking coal from theUnited States, in order to secure economies in steel production, andto guard against the possibility that home supplies of coking coal mightbe insufficient. In the opinion of the Iron and Steel Board the useof United States coal would in some cases save as much as 50s. a ton,but on average costs the saving ranged from 2s. 6d. to 22s. a ton. TheIron and Steel Board took the view that the steel industry should havefree access to the cheapest and best raw materials in order to meetcompetition from European coastal plants which were using UnitedStates coal, but they estimated that, since steel producers would be unwilling to rely too heavily on imports, the demand for United Statescoal would be restricted to 2 million tons.Imports of coal from outside the sterling area were not allowedat present, and this application raised important issues of policy TheNational Coal Board claimed that British cokins coal was stillthe cheapest in Europe, and they pointed out that a rise in freight ratesmight eliminate the price advantage of United States coal. It wouldbe impossible to restrict any concession to the present application oreven to the steel industry, and if imports were allowed from the UnitedStates it was likely that we should also have to allow additional importsfrom Europe. This might lead to a reduction in the demand forBritish coal of up to 25 million tons; the consequent closing of pits andthe dissipation of labour would raise the gravest social and political difficulties, and would also involve the risk of a serious coal shortage inthe future. It would therefore seem right to consider the question ofcoal imports against the background of the proposals for the future ofthe coal industry, which the Chairman of the National Coal Board was expected to put forward later in the summer, and to take into accountpossible developments in connexion with the Treaty of Rome. Untilthe whole question had been studied by officials the appMcation shouldnot be granted.
The President of the Board of Trade said that there was a very strong case for allowing the application. In addition to direct exports,the steel industry provided the main basic material of the engineering industry which now accounted for 45 per cent, of our exports. the steel industry should be encouraged to make itself more competitive inexport markets, and to allow access to cheaper coal would to someextent offset the competitive disadvantage which had resulted fromthe increased duty on fuel oil. There might well be a case in presentcircumstances for bringing the virtual monopoly of the National coal board to an end, though it would certainly follow that the board should be relieved of the statutory obligations which prevented them from adjusting their prices so as to meet competition from importedcoal and other fuels.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, having regard to theimportant social, economic and political issues which were involved,it would not be possible to grant the application of the Steel company of Wales at the present time. On the other hand it would beunjustifiable to reject the application out of hand. Although importsof coal would require additional foreign expenditure, balance ofpayments considerations could not be put forward to justify preventing the steel industry, which was the basis of a large part of our export earnings, from obtaining raw materials as cheaply as possible.Moreover the existence of the application, even if it were held insuspense, would encourage the National Coal Board to adopt a realisticattitude in working out their plans for the future of the coal industry.The application should therefore be held in suspense while the whole problem, including the possibility of adjusting the statutory obligations of the National Coal Board, the effect of freight rate charges on thecost of imports, and the repercussions on other industries, including therailways, was studied. For this purpose the Chairman of theNational Coal Board should be asked to accelerate the submission ofhis proposals for the future of the coal industry, and to indicate what measures might be open to the Board to meet the problem of allowing the steel industry access to cheaper coal.The Prime Minister said that he would appoint a committee ofMinisters to consider the future of the coal industry and the problemof coal imports. The Minister of Power should ask the Chairman ofthe National Coal Board to put forward his proposals for the industry as soon as possible and in the meantime to indicate how far the board might require greater commercial freedom if it were decided to allowadditional coal imports. The President of the Board of Trade should draft, in consultation with the Minister of Power, an announcementexplaining that the application of the Steel Company of Wales wasbeing held in suspense while the Government studied the importantsocial and economic problems involved.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would appoint a committeeof Ministers to consider the future of the coal industry andthe problem of coal imports.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to discuss this question with theChairman of the National Coal Board.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to draft, inconsultation with the Minister of Power, an announcementexplaining that the application of the Steel Company of wales was being held in suspense.British 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordSugar President of the Council (C. (61) 61) about the British sugar corporation     Corporation.
The Lord President said that the British Sugar Corporation was inform an ordinary limited company but in fact, being the agencythrough which the Government carried out their support policy forthe beet sugar industry, it exercised a monopoly under financial arrangements which guaranteed the shareholders, the great majority ofwhom were private persons and institutions, dividends of 7 per cent,without any risk of loss. The Corporation could not increase thedividend or issue bonus shares without the consent of the agriculture ministers and the Treasury, but its reserves were steadily growing asa result of payments made by the Sugar Board under an incentiveagreement and&quot; now stood at over  7 millions. A minority of share-holders had recently been demanding some benefit from the growth in the reserves which legally form part of the equity. It wasanomalous that the equity of the Corporation was largely in privatehands, and the Economic Policy Committee had therefore considered a proposal by the Minister of Agriculture for the reconstruction of theCorporation. This would provide for the equity to take the form ofa nominal shareholding, to be held either by the Treasury or,preferably, the Sugar Board, while the existing ordinary shares wereconverted into cumulative preference shares bearing interest at 8 percent, and repayable at par in the event of winding up. It was probable, though not certain, that this proposal would secure thesupport of the necessary 75 per cent, majority of the shareholders.In discussion it was argued that the Government should refuse to approve any increase in the dividend. The present shareholders, whoreceived a reasonable return on their money without any commercialrisk, had bought their shares in the knowledge that the dividend was limited; and the Government would expose themselves to political criticism if they gave way to pressure from the shareholders by offeringthem an undeserved benefit which they were in any event likely to regard as inadequate. The proposed method of reconstruction would,moreover, be criticised as closely akin to nationalising the Corporation.It was pointed out, on the other hand, that the reserves would continue to grow unless the incentive agreement was abrogated (whichwould probably lead to reduced efficiency in the industry). Theproblem would therefore become steadily more difficult to handle andthe Government could not hope to escape political criticism if they made no move. The proposed reconstruction was acceptable to theChairman of the Corporation and could be regarded as the best way of disposing of an anomalous situation at a relatively low cost of 50,000 a year, which would be payable by the Sugar Board and not by the Exchequer.The Prime Minister said that much would depend on the attitudeof the shareholders to the proposed reconstruction. Before theCabinet reached a decision, therefore, it was desirable that the viewsof the institutions holding shares in the Corporation should beobtained.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to seek the views of the institutions holding shares in the British Sugar corporation on the proposal to reconstruct the Corporation put forward in C. (61)61.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (61) 61 at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th May, 1961.
