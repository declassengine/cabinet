The Foreign Secretary said that it was now evident that president Nasser would not seek forcefully to prevent the secessionof Syria from the United Arab Republic. He had indicated that hewould not-oppose the admission of Syria, as a separate State, to theArab League or the United Nations. There was therefore no reasonto delay any longer our formal recognition of the separate Governmentof Syria. He proposed to arrange that we should act simultaneously with some Allied Governments in according this recognition.Good progress had been made at the meeting of the three LaotianPrinces, and agreement had finally been reached that Prince SouvannaPhouma should be the Prime Minister of a united LaotianGovernment. This solution had not at first been welcomed by theKing of Laos, but there was some reason to hope that he would be persuaded to accept it.Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of the provincial governmentof Katanga, had now sent a message to Mr. Adoula, the PrimeMinister of the Central Congo Government, indicating his readiness to send a delegation to undertake negotiations in Leopoldville.Mr. Adoula was understood to have responded favourably to this approach. Mr. Tshombe might even be willing to go to Leopoldvillehimself, if he could obtain satisfactory assurances about his personalsafety. These developments were promising.Soviet opposition now seemed to be hardening against theappointment of a single Secretary-General of the United Nations in succession to Mr. Hammarskjold. The Soviet Government seemed likely to revive their proposal for placing the Secretariat under thecontrol of three individuals drawn, respectively, from the Communist,Western and neutral countries. It might therefore be necessary tocontinue for a further period the temporary arrangement by which anumber of Deputy Secretaries took charge of the Secretariat.President Kennedy and the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Rusk, had held in Washington some further discussions on Berlinwith the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko. As a result it hadbeen agreed that there should be a further bilateral exchange of viewson this problem, between the United States and the Soviet Union,before any attempt was made to convene a wider meeting; and these conversations would be held in the near future in Moscow. It was desirable that, before they began, the United States Ambassador in moscow should be aware of the latest views held by the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, France and Western Germany on the main points at issue, and it was proposed that a meeting of senior officials of the four Governments should be held for this purpose in the courseof the next few days.The Foreign Secretary said that he would circulate, for theinformation of the Cabinet, a memorandum summarising the courseof the latest discussions on Berlin.United Nations        2.   The Prime Minister said that he had considered with the(Previous        Ministers directly concerned whether we could safely support a reference:       resolution which the Nigerian Government were proposing to bringC.C.(6t)5lst    forward at the General Assembly of the United Nations declaringConclusions.

It was inevitable that some resolution hostile to ColonialismColonialism     should be moved at the General Assembly, and it might therefore beto our advantage to encourage the Nigerians to take this moderateinitiative.   The terms of their resolution were broadly acceptable tous and we should be able to vote for it if it remained in its presentSECKF.T
form and, in particular, was not extended beyond Africa or advanced in time to a date earlier than 1970. It would, however, be necessaryfor our representative to make it clear, when speaking on theresolution, that we endorsed it as a general aim but were not committed to any particular form of independence (e.g., federalismmust not be excluded) and might have to take account of specialcircumstances affecting the timing of independence for individualterritories the High Commission Territories, for instance, might notbe ready for independence by 1970.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to authorise the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations to assure the nigerian representative that we should be prepared inprinciple to support the resolution on Colonialism in Africawhich he was thinking of moving in the General Assemblyso long as it remained in its present form.commonwealth immigrants(previous reference:CC. (61) 29thConclusions.Minute 7)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 153) recommending the introduction of legislation to control immigration into the United Kingdom from other parts ofthe Commonwealth.  A draft Bill was annexed to the memorandum.The Home Secretary said that the Commonwealth MigrantsCommittee had given long and careful consideration to this problem,in the light of the increasing flow of coloured commonwealth immigrants into this country, and had come reluctantly to theconclusion that powers must now be taken to control this movement.The figures had risen from 21,000 in 1959 to nearly 58,000 in 1960;the latest monthly figure, for August of this year, was the highest on record at nearly 16,000, and the estimated total for 1961 was well over100,000. This trend had already given rise to serious problems,particularly in connexion with housing, and it was evident that thecountry could not assimilate coloured immigrants on the present scale.There was growing public anxiety about the position and mountingpressure from Government supporters for some measure of control.The Commonwealth Migrants Committee recommended a form ofcontrol related to employment. Coloured immigrants having jobs togo to or qualifications likely to be useful in this country would be freely admitted-as would students, visitors and persons able tosupport themselves without taking employment. Others would,however, be subject to a numerical quota which would be determinedby the Government and varied from time to time according to thecountry&apos;s need of manpower. This method of control would not resultin a dramatic reduction of the flow of coloured immigrants and itwould not therefore satisfy all critics of the present situation, but itwould make it possible to bring the situation under control. The bill itself applied to all Commonwealth citizens, irrespective of colour; butit would be evident in its operation that the control was being applied in practice only to coloured people. The Legislation Committee had considered whether it would be preferable to proceed by an enablingBill leaving the detailed provisions to be enacted by Order in Council;but they had concluded that, in view of the controversial nature of thesubject, this would only serve to increase the Parliamentary difficulties.They therefore recommended that legislation should be introduced in the form of the draft Bill annexed to the Home Secretary^memorandum in discussion the following points were made(f/l The Bill would provoke some criticism from other commonwealth countries, but this was preferable to the continuing

He believed thatthe United they had removed some of ihe misunderstandings which had arisen.Kingdom and he had been glad to be able to persuade President Nkrnmah to. 55 (61)risk of ill-feeling over incidents in this country involving colouredCommonwealth immigrants. The Premier of Jamaica had alreadybeen told in confidence that the Government were contemplating theintroduction of this control and had received the news withoutsurprise. It would be desirable that all other commonwealth governments should be given advance warning that this control was likely to be introduced.(b) The variable quota for immigrants without special skills andwith no specific employment in view would expose the Government toconstant pressure to increase or decrease the numbers to be admitted.This provision was, however, inevitable if the flow was to be adjusted to meet the needs of the national economy.(c) The Bill would empower a court to recommend the deportation of a Commonwealth citizen who had lived in this countryfor less than five years, did not belong to this country by birth, descentor naturalisation and had been convicted of an offence carryingliability to imprisonment. The Legislation Committee had suggestedthat this provision might be extended to enable a court to recommend the deportation of a Commonwealth immigrant even if he had livedin this country for more than five years. It was however arguable that, if the power of the courts were not limited by reference to anyparticular period of residence, too wide a discretion would be left tothe Home Secretary. Further thought should be given to this point.UD A resolution on this subject was to be debated at theConservative Party Conference on the following day. The HomeSecretary, in speaking on this resolution, could indicate that theGovernment were concerned at the situation and might well find itnecessary to take steps to control it. He would however avoidimplying that the Government had already decided to introduce legislation on this subject so as to avoid anticipating The Queen&apos;sSpeech and also to give the Commonwealth Secretary an opportunityto advise other Commonwealth Governments that this control mighthave to be imposed.The Cabinet (I) Agreed that legislation should be introduced in the forth-coming session of Parliament, on the lines proposed inC. (61)153, to control immigration into the UnitedKingdom from other parts of the Commonwealth.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider further, inconsultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General, whether this legislation should empower thecourts to recommend the deportation of commonwealth citizens who had lived for more than five years in theUnited Kingdom.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to warn other commonwealth Governments that the United KingdomGovernment were likely to find it necessary to take stepsto control immigration into this country from other partsof the Commonwealth.
put publicly on record a more generous appreciation of the colonial policy of the United Kingdom Government. It was however to beexpected that leading members of the Ghana Government would continue to make public statements which were irresponsible orembarrassing to the United Kingdom Government, though he hoped to be able to reduce this embarrassment by closer and more frequentconsultation.The Oueen&apos;s * The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in view of the unsettledVisit political conditions in Ghana, he had considered whether it would be right to advise The Queen to cancel her projected visit to that country.He had no doubt that The Queen would be accorded an enthusiasticpublic welcome in Ghana. A visit by the Head of the commonwealth would strengthen the ties between the people of Ghana and the otherpeoples of the Commonwealth. It could not properly be construed as an endorsement of the policies of President Nkrumah. On theother hand, if it could be said that The Queen had cancelled her visiton account of increased political opposition to the present Governmentof Ghana, this would be regarded as an intervention in Ghana&apos;sdomestic affairs and the relations between the United Kingdom andGhana would be seriously prejudiced. These effects would beincreased if The Queen carried out the rest of her projected tour in west Africa, without visiting Ghana; and, if she decided not to go toGhana, it would be preferable that she should cancel the whole ofthe West African tour. Thus the balance of the political considerationslay against making any modification of the projected tour.The issue therefore turned on the assessment of the risk to the queen&apos;s personal safety which her stay in Ghana would entail. Hehad made very careful enquiries into this during his recent visit toAccra. He had gone into it in detail, not only with the HighCommissioner and his staff, but with the head of the Special BranchX of the Police and with leading British residents in official and business\ circles. All those whom he had consulted were satisfied that The\. Queen would not be exposed to any increased risk because of recentpolitical developments in Ghana. Some degree of risk was inseparable from Royal visits of this kind, but there was no reason to believe thatthis would be any greater in Ghana than in other countries which her Majesty had already visited.In discussion there was general agreement that the balance ofpolitical advantage lay in favour of advising Her Majesty that herWest African tour should be carried through as planned. The cabinet were conscious of the heavy responsibility which they bore in respectof The Queen&apos;s personal safety. There was, however, no reason toapprehend that any violence would be directed against The Queenherself: the risk arose rather from the fact that President Nkrumah&apos;political opponents might have, during The Queen&apos;s visit, opportunities for violence against him which would not ordinarily be available tothem. This risk could, however, be reduced if the number of occasions on which President Nkrumah travelled in the same car as Her Majestywere limited.The Cabinet&apos;s conclusion was that, while additional precautionsshould be taken to ensure The Queen&apos;s safety during her visit toGhana, there were at present no sufficient grounds for advisingher to cancel that visit.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Prime Minister would advise Her majesty in the sense of the conclusion recorded above.(2) Agreed that this question should be reviewed again nearer the date of The Queen&apos;s departure in the light of further developments in the local situation.
british transport commission(previous references:CC. (61) 41stConclusions,Minute 8 and cc. (60) 63rdConclusions)HotelsCompany6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C. (61) 139) proposing that in the forthcomingreorganisation of British Railways the hotels owned by the british transport Commission should be made the responsibility of a company owned by the British Railways Board.The Minister of Transport said that, in the White Paper(Cmnd. 1248) on the Reorganisation of Nationalised transport undertakings, it had been stated that the British Transport hotelswould be incorporated as a company under the Companies Act and placed under the control of the Holding Company. An independentstructure of this kind would, it had been thought, increase thecommercial freedom of the hotels and remove them from the over-riding influence of railway requirements and would also allow theBritish Railways Board to concentrate on running the railways. Sucha structure would be welcomed by many of the government&apos;s supporters and the proposal in the White Paper had been accepted atthe outset by Dr. Beeching, the Chairman of the British transport commission. On further reflection, however. Dr. Beeching had cometo the view that the hotels should be controlled by the British railways board. If they were under separate control there would be difficult problems where hotels were physically part of railway stations.Separate organisation, moreover, would make it impossible to retain the financial advantages (estimated at  25O.00Q a year) of centralbuying and common maintenance arrangements.The Minister said that on balance he was inclined to acceptDr. Beeching&apos;s advice on these points. So long as the hotels were runas a separate company, ownership of the company by the railways board would not prevent them from being operated efficiently andhe did not think that this need distract the Railways Board from their main task of running the railways. To put the hotels within thecontrol of the Railways Board would, moreover, enable him to concedea point to the trade unions, who were most anxious to ensure that thestaff employed in hotels could continue to be covered by the establishedCC. 55 (61)Malaya 5.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Prime Minister(Previous of Malaya, Tunku Abdul Rahman, was increasingly concerned aboutReference: the situation in Singapore, where the Government were losing groundCC.

In order to stabilise the position the minute 8) Tunku was anxious to secure a merger of Singapore with theGreater Federation while there was still a Government in Singapore withMalaysia which he could co-operate, but he would be unwilling to contemplatesuch a merger unless it could include the British Borneo territorieswhose non-Chinese populations would help to maintain the racialbalance against the Chinese population of Singapore. He was nowpressing for our immediate agreement to the inclusion of the borneo territories in such a &quot; Greater Malaysia &quot;. Earlier this year he had suggested that he should come to London to discuss this project, andhe now seemed ready to make such a visit in the near future.In discussion it was recognised that the defence interests of theUnited Kingdom in this area might, on balance, be better served bypromoting the creation of a Greater Malaysia on the lines now envisaged than by leaving Singapore to claim independence as aseparate unit.The Cabinet Agreed that it was desirable that the Prime Minister of malaya should visit London in the near future to discuss the project for a Greater Malaysia.
Council ofEurope(previous reference:CC. (60) 50ihConclusions.Minute 9)EuropeanSocialCharter7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61)156) proposing that the United KingdomGovernment should ratify the European Social Charter, the text ofwhich was annexed.The Cabinet were informed that this Charter, which had beenprepared by the Council of Europe, was largely concerned with labourmatters but also contained provisions on health, social security and social welfare. It brought together in one document a statement of rights and principles which were for the most part already recognised,in the European Convention on Human Rights or otherwise, by the member countries of the Council of Europe. The Charter would thus become a manifestation of the social rights and standards common to western Europe.The Government Departments concerned, including those inNorthern Ireland, had been consulted in the drafting stages and had examined the final text. The declaration of aims in Part I of the charter could be accepted without difficulty; and. although one ortwo of the specific articles in Part II were drafted in terms stronger than might have been wished, a large majority of them could beaccepted. The United Kingdom would be in a position to complywith the requirements for ratification of the Charter. He suggestedthat it should be signed on behalf of the United Kingdom at aceremony which had been arranged for 18th October and that itshould be ratified in due course. The undertakings given would apply to British subjects in the United Kingdom and to nationals ofother Contracting Parties lawfully resident in this countrv.The cabinet approved the proposal in C. (61) 156 that the Europe.in social Charter should be signed and in due course ratifiedon behalf of the United Kingdom.machinery for wages, pensions and superannuation applying to railway staff.In discussion there was general agreement that Dr. Beeching&apos;advice should be accepted. It would be important, however, to ensurethat the British Railways Board did not in time become unduly pre-occupied with their hotel interests. The legislation to be introduced in the coming session should prevent the company from developingnew hotels save where these were required for railway passengers andshould empower the Minister to secure the discontinuance of anyparticular activity by the Hotels Company. It should also be clearlyestablished that the Company would be expected to dispose of thefree-standing hotels if good offers were made. With these points inmind it would be necessary to scrutinise carefully the memorandum and Articles of Association of the Hotels Company.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (61) 139 that provision shouldbe made for the British Transport Commission^ hotels to be run by a company owned and controlled by the british railways Board.
