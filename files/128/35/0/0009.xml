congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 7thConclusions,Minute 8)CC. ? (61)1. The Foreign Secretary said that, in face of the news of furtherpolitical executions in the Congo, the Security Council had carrieda resolution which condemned these practices, called on the Congoleseauthorities to put an end to them, authorised the United nations forces on the spot to take all possible measures to prevent them,including the use of force in the last resort, and demanded an impartialinvestigation to identify those responsible and to secure theirpunishment. The United Kingdom representatives on the security council had voted in favour of this resolution but, under instructions,had made it plain that the United Nations authorities in the Congowould not thereby be authorised to use force in furtherance of any political settlement. The resolution would leave a difficult discretion to the United Nations commander, and might open the way topressures for the use of force in support of particular political factions.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:CC. (61) 3rdConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now received theviews of the Soviet Government on the proposal that the international control Commission should return to Laos. They were not opposedto this, but considered that some international conference should first be held and that it should be recognised that the only legitimateauthority in Laos was the Government of Prince Souvanna Phouma.Meanwhile, the King of Laos had proposed a different form of commission consisting of representatives of Cambodia, Burma and malaya. He therefore proposed to seek the views of the SovietGovernment on this alternative proposal. There seemed to be a growing recognition that a settlement in Laos must be sought by political means.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Europe(previous reference:CC. (60) 62ndConclusions.Minute 9)european free trade association(previous reference:CC (60) 64thConclusions,Minute 4)3. The Lord Privy Sea! said that the recent meeting of ministers of the European Free Trade Association had reached agreement on anumber of points. It had been decided that the next stage in tariff reductions should be brought forward by six months to 1st July, 1961,and that the possibility of accelerating subsequent reductions shouldbe studied. Satisfactory procedures had been settled for the examination of arrangements for trade in fish and for the review ofarrangements for agricultural products. The meeting had also agreed on the form of association to be offered to Finland, including boththe commercial and the institutional arrangements. The consultative committee of the Association, which was to include representativesof industrialists and trades unions, was to meet in May.In addition, the meeting had shown that the other member countries of the Association welcomed the discussions which theUnited Kingdom Government were having with certain member governments of the European Economic Community and recognisedthat in these discussions the United Kingdom representatives wouldhave full regard to the interests of their partners. The exploratorytalks which we had recently held with the German authorities aboutthe possibility of a settlement of the economic and political divisions in Europe had been entirely without commitment.

Parliament 4.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.BroadcastingPolicySubscriptionTelevision(previous reference:C.C. (61)3rdConclusions,Minute 6)5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the President of the Board of Trade and the Postmaster-General(C. (60) 191) about a proposed experiment in subscription television,in the light of a memorandum by the Home Secretary (C. (61) 18)reporting a conversation he had held on the subject with Sir HarryPilkington, the Chairman of the Committee on Broadcasting.The Home Secretary said that Sir Harry Pilkington had made itclear that he and his Committee remained strongly of the opinion thatthe proposed experiment would prejudge issues of major importance on which his Committee had been asked to report. The experimentwould introduce into television a third method of finance, and thiswas a matter on which the Pilkington Committee wished and, intheir view, ought to be allowed to make recommendations. If these issues were prejudged, before the Committee had been able toconsider them, the members of the Committee were likely to ask tobe relieved of their task. The Home Secretary said that there was much force in these arguments and he suggested that the government ought not to allow the proposed experiment until they had receivedthe Committee&apos;s report.Discussion showed that there was strong support in the cabinet for this view. If the experiment were successful, its promoters wouldhave achieved a major advantage in the competition for any futurethird television service, which was no doubt the real aim underlyingtheir proposal. The equipment they had developed could be testedby laboratory methods, by using any of the existing programmes inthis country, or in a field trial in some other country in which theyhad interests. If, however, a field trial of subscription television bywire were allowed in this country, probable developments in north america would make it very difficult to resist extension of the experiment to a similar service by radio. In any event, if theyallowed the experiment to proceed in the face of determined opposition from the Pilkington Committee the Government might find themselves in a position of great political embarrassment.On the other hand, it was argued that the experiment would beon a relatively small scale: it would be limited to 3,000 households ina single area already provided with sound radio by rediffusion and itcould be limited in time to, say, two years. The equipment developedby the promoters was cheaper, and was believed to be more efficient,than that of their American competitors and, if proved in a field trial,could lead to the exploitation of a valuable export market. the experiment would be carried out with equipment belonging to itspromoters and at their own expense.Summing up the Prime Minister said that, whatever might be thestrength of the case for allowing the experiment, the Governmenthad been followed by discussions between German and french officials. It had now been arranged that a meeting between UnitedKingdom and French officials would be held in London in thefollowing week. Thereafter it would be convenient if the cabinet could review the whole question of our relations with Europe.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.
Kenya 6.   The Colonial Secretary said that pressure for the release ofjomo Jomo Kenyatta was increasing, both in Kenya among EuropeansKenyaita as well as Africans and in the United Nations. The Governor of(Previous Kenya was satisfied that, although Kenyatta had completed his reference: sentence of detention, he could not yet be released from restrictionsC.C. (60) 64th without prejudicing political development and possibly security. he conclusions, would reject any attempt by African political leaders to make theirMinute9)       acceptance of Ministerial office conditional upon Kenyatta&apos;s release;but he did not think that Kenyatta need be kept under restrictionsindefinitely and he would be ready to consider his release when a new government was firmly established. Meanwhile, he proposed totransfer him to a healthier and less remote locality and, as a meansof eroding the exaggerated public conception of his significance, toallow him more frequent visitors, including representatives of the new council of Ministers, ministers of religion and the Press. he proposed to make a broadcast statement of his intentions in regard toKenyatta, on the lines of the draft circulated with A.F. (M) (61) 4.This statement was to be made on 27th February, after the completionof polling in the current elections but before the results were announced.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with the Governors proposed treatment of Kenyatta,although it might be sharply criticised in the United Nations and elsewhere. It was arguable that it might tend to increase Kenyatta&apos;sinfluence, rather than diminish it, but the Governors judgment onthis point was based on extensive local knowledge and experience and should be accepted.The general lines of the proposed statement by the Governorwere also approved. The drafting should, however, be further considered with a view to avoiding phrases which could be misleadingif quoted out of their context.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal of the Governor of Kenya to continueto restrict the liberty of Jomo Kenyatta on the termsindicated by the Colonial Secretary.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary, in consultation with theGovernor, to give further consideration to the terms ofthe proposed statement on Kenyatta&apos;s future.(3) Took note that the Colonial Secretary would refer to theCabinet again before agreeing to Kenyatta&apos;s release atany future date.could not, politically, risk an open breach with the PilkingtonCommittee over it. It might be worth while for the Minister of aviation, in view of his responsibility for the electronics industry, todiscuss the matter with the Chairman; but, even if he and his committee were persuaded to change their attitude, it would still benecessary for the Cabinet to reach a decision as between the opposingviews expressed in their discussions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Aviation, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to put to the Chairmanof the Committee on Broadcasting the commercialadvantages of allowing the experiment in subscriptiontelevision described in C. (60) 191.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (60) 191 at a later meeting.
Sunday observance(previous reference:C.C. (61) 5thConclusions,Minute 6)7. The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theHome Secretary (C. (61) 23) on the effect of the existing law relatingto Sunday observance in England and Wales.In discussion it was suggested that, while the law on this subject was antiquated and confused, there was little evidence of any urgent need or any widespread demand for its reform. Nor was there any assurance of majority support for any particular change. On theother hand it was argued that it was in general desirable that sociallaws should be kept up to date, so as to reflect current trends ofpublic opinion. The point was also made that an extension of thefacilities for entertainment and shopping on Sundays would be ofsome advantage to the tourist trade.The conclusion which emerged from the Cabinet&apos;s discussion wasthat there would be no objection to the holding of an enquiry with aview to ascertaining whether there was any practicable basis for legislation to amend the existing law on this subject.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary to appoint a departmentalcommittee to review the prospects of amending the law relating to Sunday observance in England and Wales.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21st February, 1961.
