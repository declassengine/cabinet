Federationof RhodesiaandNyasaiand(previous reference:C.C. (61) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)NorthernRhodesiaThe Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had been informed on 6th June that the Commonwealth Secretary, in the course of his visit to the Federation for final consultations about constitutional development for Southern Rhodesia, had also discussed with thePrime Minister of the Federation, Sir Roy Welensky, possiblemodifications of the constitutional proposals for Northern Rhodesiacontained in the White Paper of February 1961 (Cmnd. 1295). Amain feature of the White Paper proposals was the creation ofnational seats, for which the votes on the upper and lower rolls wereto be equalised by averaging the percentage of votes cast for a candidate on each roll, and for which a candidate had to obtain a prescribed minimum percentage of the votes cast on each roll.Sir Roy Welensky objected to this scheme, on the ground thatequalising the rolls in this way would favour African voters againstEuropean, since the upper roll contained a significant and increasing number of African voters, whereas the lower roll contained a verysmall number of Europeans. In order to guarantee control by theupper roll, which was Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s main objective, he had proposed that the ratio of upper roll to lower roll votes should be sixtyto forty. It had been agreed that this suggestion should be examined,without commitment, but consultations which had been held by theGovernor of Northern Rhodesia with the other parties in the territoryhad shown that it would be wholly unacceptable. It would, indeed,be hard to maintain that a sixty/forty ratio was consistent with thespirit and framework of the White Paper.The Colonial Secretary, in consultation with the commonwealth secretary, had therefore tried to work out other modifications to theWhite Paper proposals which might help to meet Sir Roy Welensky&apos;sanxieties and at the same time secure the acquiescence, even if onlyreluctant, of the other parties in Northern Rhodesia. There werefive possibilities. It might be provided that in order to qualify for election a candidate in a national constituency would need to secure a certain percentage or a fixed number (whichever was the less) ofthe votes cast by Europeans, and that percentage or fixed number(whichever was the less) of the votes cast by Africans; this would compel a candidate to acquire a minimum degree of support from both of the main sections of the community, but since the requirement would be expressed in terms of a low figure, it wouldmake it easier for European candidates to secure sufficient Africansupport. A second modification might be to adopt the federal governments suggestion that the national seats should take theform of seven double-member constituencies. Third: some degree of racial reservation of national seats might be offered. Fourth:instead of lowering the income and educational qualifications forvoters on the upper roll, the addition of Africans to that roll mightbe achieved by adding certain specific categories of more responsibleAfricans. Fifth: we might agree that the determination of the constituencies should be entrusted to a commission which would beestablished in agreement with Sir Roy Welensky.When the Commonwealth Secretary, two days previously, had informed Sir Roy Welensky that his proposal for a sixty/forty ratio for voting for national seats could not be accepted, he had indicated thatthe White Paper proposals could be modified in these five respects.But in his reply Sir Roy Welensky had reiterated his demand for asixty/forty ratio, in order to guarantee upper roll control of thenational seats, and had given no consideration to the alternativemodifications. If his demand were not met, Sir Roy Welenskyproposed to visit the United Kingdom later in the week with the intention of putting his case, not only to the Government,but apparently to Parliament and public opinion in this country and he would then return to the Federation and propose the   immediate  dissolution  of  the   Legislature  on   26th  June.
It was not clear what mandate he would seek from the electorate it might be for complete independence in both federaland territorial spheres, or in the federal sphere alone, or he might be content to bring pressure on the United Kingdom Government withinthe limits of the present constitution. A most serious situation wouldthen arise, which might lead to violence and perhaps to civil war. Theposition of the Government, in view particularly of their responsibilities in Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, would be oneof extreme difficulty. It would in due course be necessary for theCabinet to decide what attitude should be taken if Sir Roy Welenskypersisted in his demand, and how to deal with the grave situationwhich might develop.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had since learnedfrom the High Commissioner of the Federation that the federation government were now prepared to examine the possibility of ascheme for a middle roll to elect members to the nationalconstituencies. This scheme had previously been rejected by all parties as being impracticable and uncertain. The fact that theFederation Government were willing to examine it might be an indication that they were reluctant to bring the issue to a head atthe present time.In discussion it was pointed out that it was unlikely that any scheme for a middle roll could be devised which would be acceptable to all parties. To meet Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s anxieties it would have to contain a preponderance of Europeans, but this would be bitterlyopposed by the Africans. The Liberal Party would insist onincluding a qualification based on a minimum percentage of racialvotes, since the middle roll might otherwise enable the nationalistseats to be won by extremists; such a qualification would berepugnant to Sir Roy Welensky. There was also the danger thatthe establishment of a middle roll would tend to displace the upperroll.There was general agreement that, despite these objections, therewould be advantage in encouraging Sir Roy Welensky to consider a middle roll scheme, since this would avoid an immediate crisis. Itwould, however, be dangerous to put forward any proposals of ourown for a middle roll; for this would amount to starting a freshnegotiation with Sir Roy Welensky about a scheme which was unlikely to meet the wishes of the African and Liberal representatives.The United Kingdom High Commissioner should therefore confinehimself, on this point, to saying that we would be interested to know what ideas Sir Roy Welensky had for a middle roll scheme. It was important that, at the same time, we should do everything possibleto make Sir Roy Welensky fully aware of the value from his pointof view of the five modifications which we could make to theWhite Paper proposals.In further discussion the Foreign Secretary said that thepossibility of making further modifications to the White Paperproposals to meet Sir Roy Welensky&apos;s point of view should not be excluded. If, in the absence of an acceptable settlement, he wereto claim independence for the Federation or some part of it, he might in the end have to seek support from the South African Government,or even from the Portuguese. It was likely that we were entering aperiod of increasing difficulty in international affairs, in which wecould not afford to be in open dispute with the European elements in the Federation.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would need to resume their discussion on the following day, in order to decide what furtherarguments could be put to Sir Roy Welensky to deter him from pursuing his intention to come to the United Kingdom to bring theissue to a head. The Commonwealth Secretary should prepare adraft   message,   explaining   the   Government^   proposals   for
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th June, 1961.constitutional development in Northern Rhodesia, including the modifications which could be made to the original proposals in theWhite Paper, and indicating that Sir Roy Welensky was free to putforward proposals for a middle roll scheme. If, despite these arguments, Sir Roy Welensky were to visit the United Kingdom, itwould be necessary for the Government to be ready to publish their proposals without delay.The Cabinet-Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to circulate a draft message to the Prime Minister of the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister, for consideration at a meeting on thefollowing day.
