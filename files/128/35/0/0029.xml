The Lord Privy Seal said that the international conferenceon Laos had opened but was not yet making much progress. Thecease-fire was not being observed throughout the country. Effortswere being made to persuade the Soviet Government to agree to a formula which would enable the International Control Commissionto visit areas where fighting was still in progress. If their agreement could not be secured, the United States Government might make an issue of this at the conference. Meanwhile, the Commission had themselves announced their intention of visiting three of these areas;and, if the Pathet Lao agreed that they should do so, this particular difficulty would be resolved. There was now some prospect that thefour Laotian Princes would meet in Paris. If they could there reach agreement among themselves, they could proceed to Geneva as representatives of a potential Laotian Government. British and american military authorities had considered the form which military intervention should take if the international conference broke down.Their report was now being considered by the Chiefs of Staff andwould be available later in the day.The Lord Privy Seal said that the new Prime Minister of Iran,Dr. Amini, was endavouring to pursue a firm policy based on socialreforms, and there was no reason to doubt that he would wish Iranto remain a member of the Central Treaty Organisation. But theopposition of the National Front was increasing and Dr. Amini mightnot be able to maintain his position. We were considering with theUnited States authorities how best to support the present regime,and it was understood that the Shah would be prepared to returnquickly to Iran if the situation deteriorated.The Lord Privy Seal said that there were indications that in theSouth Korean Government which had assumed office following general Chang&apos;s coup d&apos;etat the main influence rested with theForeign Minister, who was closely associated with the ChineseNationalist regime in Formosa. There was some danger that theSouth Korean Government might be tempted to adopt an aggressivepolicy towards North Korea. In common with othc countries whichhad participated in the United Nations operations we should be under an obligation to intervene if hostilities re-opened in Korea.Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Education 4.   The Minister of Education said that on the previous day the teachers&apos; local authorities in England and Wales had agreed to make a revisedSalaries offer to the teachers&apos; representatives of a basic scale of  575-  1,200(Previous with reasonable differentials for teachers holding posts of special reference: responsibility.  This would represent an increase of 16-2 per cent, in C.C. (61) 28th the total cost of salaries. At the meeting of the Burnlnm CommitteeConclusions. that day the teachers might accept the revised offer, in which case theMinuie 3)1. The Cabinet were informed that on the inauguration of theRepublic of South Africa on 31st May the Queen would send to thePresident a message expressing to the people of South Africa herbest wishes for the future. The Prime Minister of South Africa washimself sending a formal message to Her Majesty.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the terms of the message which her Majesty was proposing to send to the President of theRepublic of South Africa.
Europe(previous reference:C.C. (61) 26thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Prime Minister said that studies were being made of thearrangements required to safeguard the interests of British agricultureand of other Commonwealth countries and our obligations to themembers of the European Free Trade Association, if it were decidedthat the United Kingdom should apply to join the Common Market.It would be some weeks before the Cabinet could decide whether thearrangements which we might hope to secure in negotiations with theEuropean Economic Community would be acceptable and whether on balance the policy of seeking a wider political and economic association between this country and Europe should be pursued.At the recent meeting of the Commonwealth Economic consultative council we had re-affirmed our intention to consult with other commonwealth Governments before deciding to open negotiationswith the Community. In seeking the views of commonwealth governments we should set the economic considerations in the context of the great political issues which were involved and theimportance of reaching a settlement in the interests of Western unity.These consultations should therefore be conducted by personal visits by the Commonwealth Secretary or another senior Minister to eachof the independent countries of the Commonwealth. It would help to allay the anxieties felt in several of those countries if their governments were informed fairly soon that Ministerial discussions were contemplated within a matter of weeks. For this purpose he proposed to send a personal message to all Commonwealth PrimeMinisters.Government would need to decide whether or not it could be approved. Alternatively, the negotiations in the Burnham committee might break down, which would give the Minister the opportunity tocall the two sides together. A third possibility was that, if the teachersrejected the offer, the local authorities might raise it to  60O- l,20O,the equivalent of a 17 per cent, increase. Any agreement in theCommittee would require subsequent ratification by the two sides andthe necessary interval would afford the Government an opportunityto indicate their own view. It would be difficult to approve anincrease of more than 16 per cent, in England and Wales, because ofthe Governmenfs refusal to agree to an increase of more than about12-  per cent, for the Scottish teachers (with latitude to adjust thefigure to about 14 per cent.). If, however, the Government were to approve such an increase, this might provide a suitable context for legislation to give the Minister the power already enjoyed by theSecretary of State for Scotland to amend as well as to approve orreject, an agreed recommendation from the negotiating body. Thiswould be unwelcome to the local authorities, but it was the only means by which the Government could secure increases of pay for particular groups within the public service without being forced to concedegeneral increases throughout.In discussion it was recognised that a decision to approve a 16 percent, increase in England and Wales would make it difficult to defend the refusal to concede more than 14 per cent, in Scotland. It was,however, agreed that the Government could not decide what action they should take until they knew the outcome of the negotiations inthe Burnham Committee. Meanwhile, further consideration shouldbe given to the practicability of legislation to give the Minister ofEducation more control over the negotiating machinery.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange forthe Ministers particularly concerned to give furtherconsideration to this question on the following day in thelight of developments in the current negotiations in the burnham Committee.
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 65) about the legislative programme for thefollowing session,, and a memorandum by the Minister of Pensionsand National Insurance (C. (61) 72) urging that a Family allowances and National Insurance Bill should be included in this programme.The Home Secretary said that the Future Legislation Committeehad decided that the programme for 1961-62 must be less onerousthan that for recent sessions. With this in mind they had classifiedthe Bills put before them by Ministers into the lists annexed to thismemorandum. Since, however, it was probable that more than oneof the Bills introduced in the present session could not be completed and would need to be re-introduced and that a greater number than usual of the Bills classified as &quot; contingent &quot; would in fact be required,it might well be necessary to reduce the list of main &quot; programme &quot;Bills. In any event it would hardly be possible to add to their number and there was hope of finding time for few, if any, of the&quot; reserve &quot; Bills.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that the programme for1961-62 must be such as could be managed without putting an unreasonable burden on the Government and their supporters. TheFuture Legislation Committee should therefore be invited to considerthe possibility of reducing it even further. It might, however, bepossible to achieve more legislation either by some variation inLegislativeProgramme,1961-62The Cabinet were informed of the terms of the proposed message.In discussion various suggestions were made for amendment of the text. There was general agreement that, although it could not yet be decided whether a policy of seeking a wider political and economic association in Europe should be pursued, it should now be proposedto Commonwealth Governments that there should be Ministerialdiscussions on this problem, probably within a matter of weeks.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) Account should be taken of dependent countries which wouldattain independence before any association with the Communitybecame effective. Tanganyika would not be much affected; but theWest Indies Federation would be more concerned. It would be useful if the Lord Privy Seal could explain the situation to the representativesnow attending the West Indies constitutional conference in London.(b) It was likely that Canada would be most sensitive to theeconomic consequences. It was also important that Australia andNew Zealand should feel that they were being fully consulted before a decision was reached. There would therefore be great advantage if the Commonwealth Secretary could himself visit these three countries.(c) It would be helpful if, when the Prime Minister^ messagewas delivered, Commonwealth Governments could be reminded ofthe terms in which the present position had been explained to theirofficials at the meeting of the Commonwealth Economic consultative council.The Cabinet Agreed that the Prime Minister should propose to commonwealth Prime Ministers that United kingdom ministers should within a matter of weeks visit other commonwealth countries to discuss the problems whichwould arise if the United Kingdom joined the european economic Community.
The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the future legislation Committee to consider further, in the light oftheir discussion, the possibility of reducing the legislative programme for the session of 1961-62.Commonwealth 7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Lordimmigrants Chancellor and the Commonwealth Secretary (C. (61) 67 and 69)(Previous about the possibility of controlling immigration from other parts ofReference:      the Commonwealth.C.C. (61) 7th ^,     r     ,   ^, ,    ,Conclusions, The Lord Chancellor recalled  that, at  their  meeting on minute 2) &apos; 16th February, the Cabinet had invited him to arrange for theCommittee on Commonwealth Migrants to consider the form which legislation to control such immigration might take. During the early part of the year there had been a startling increase in the number of coloured immigrants, the great majority of whom came from the west indies, India and Pakistan, and if the present trend continued, theParliamentary procedure for example, freer use of allocation of timeorders or by securing the agreement of the Opposition not to obstruct the passage of uncontroversial Bills.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) It was desirable that legislation on Safety, Health and Welfarein Shops and Offices should be introduced in the following session inorder to overtake the effect of the Offices Act, 1960, which had been introduced by a Private Member and passed in the face of advice bythe Government. The Bill was, however, unlikely to be welcome toGovernment supporters and further consideration should be given tothe possibility of deferring it to a later session.(b) Other &quot; programme &quot; Bills which it might be possible to deferwere those dealing with Fisheries, Machinery of Justice and Pipelines,although there was an urgent case for legislation on at least the lasttwo.(c) There would be financial and political advantage in legislatingin the following session to remove a number of anomalies in the family Allowances and National Insurance Schemes. While,however, authority had already been given for the drafting of the Bill,a decision to include it in the programme could not yet be taken.(d) A Bill dealing with Commonwealth Settlement should beadded to the &quot; contingent &quot; list.(e) The Government had for some time been committed to legislation on a number of points which could be included in anAgriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill. If it were decided tointroduce a levy on agricultural imports in the following year,legislation on this also would be necessary.(/) A strong case could be made in addition for early legislation on Civil Aerodromes, Public Libraries and Water Conservation.(g) Although it was unlikely that time could be found for theseor any of the other Bills classified as &quot; reserve &quot; Bills, progress shouldbe made with the preparation of some of them and priority should begiven to Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions), Public Libraries,Water Conservation, Employment and Training, Administration oiJustice, Family Allowances and National Insurance, National coal board Finance, Forth and Clyde Canal, and Underground Car Parks.(h) The Secretary of State for Scotland undertook to discussScottish legislation with the Home Secretary when it was known how much time would be available in the Scottish Grand Committee.
CC. 29 (61)total for 1961 might reach 200,000. This would mean that by the endof the year there would be nearly half a million coloured people inthe United Kingdom; and, if present trends continued, the figuremight rise to 2 millions within the next 15 years. The Committeewere now agreed that this movement was reaching a stage at which theGovernment would be obliged to introduce legislation to enable themto control it. The Committee considered that control could not be related to the health of the individual or the availability of housing accommodation for him. They favoured a form of control based on employment and envisaged that skilled workers and immigrantscoming to specified employment for which no resident labour was available would be admitted without restriction, while others would berequired to obtain a permit from the Ministry of Labour. This wouldhave the merit of flexibility, since the Government could determine therate of flow in the light of the economic, social and political conditions at any given time, and the control could be operated without any distinction on grounds of race or colour. The Committee were not seeking an immediate decision that legislation should be introduced,but invited the Cabinet to take note that it might be necessary to takea final decision in the following autumn. Meanwhile, officials hadbeen instructed to examine the wide range of questions raised by their proposal.The Colonial Secretary said that a referendum would probablybe held in Jamaica in the autumn on the issue of joining the west indies Federation. Any early announcement of a decision to legislateon this subject would prejudice the formation of the Federation;but, as the West Indian political leaders were now in London for a constitutional conference,, it might be disingenuous to refrain fromwarning the Premier of Jamaica, and possibly other senior Ministers,that the Government were considering the introduction of restrictivelegislation later in the year. If he decided to do this he would informthe Commonwealth Secretary, who might wish to give a similarindication to Commonwealth Prime Ministers.In discussion it was recognised that the scheme put forward bythe Commonwealth Migrants Committee would not only give rise tomany practical difficulties in its operation but would raise a number ofimportant questions which required further study before a decision was taken. These included the method of identifying those who should continue to be admitted to the United Kingdom withoutrestriction; the problem of immigrants from the Irish Republic; the relation of the proposed control to a possible commitment, if wejoined the European Economic Community, to allow freedom of movement into the United Kingdom from the Community countries;the question of deportation of Commonwealth citizens; and thepossibility of some selection of unskilled immigrants in their country of origin. Moreover, since this supply of labour was of significantvalue to the national economy, it must be accepted that the proposedcontrol whether it were based on employment criteria alone or on housing and health factors in addition involved an element of discrimination against coloured people. It might therefore be preferable to confront this issue openly and to adopt some machineryof control more analogous to that applied to aliens. This would bemore in line with the controls exercised by most other commonwealth countries, though it might make it more difficult to lay down a quota of immigrants which could be varied from time to time.Summing up the discussion The Prime Minister said that theCabinet could not take a final decision to introduce legislation on thissubject until they knew what form of control was practicable. the implications of the different forms of control should continue to be explored and a further report should be made to the Cabinet in theautumn. Meanwhile no announcement on the subject should bemade.
The Cabinet Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Committee on commonwealth Migrants to give further consideration, inthe light of the points raised in their discussion and inC. (61) 67 and 69, to the practicability of controllingimmigration from other parts of the Commonwealth.Aden(previous reference:C.C. (59) 51stConclusions,Minute 4)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the colonial secretary (C. (61) 68) and the Secretary of State for Air (C. (61) 70) onthe course of constitutional development in Aden.The Colonial Secretary said that our objective was to secure theuse of our defence facilities in the Colony and Protectorate of Adenfor as long as possible during this decade. The continued co-operation of the moderate elements in the Colony could only besecured if we acceded to their demand for some further measure of constitutional advance. They were, however, inclined to favour a closer association between the Colony and the Federation. the rulers of the Federation were keenly interested in a merger, but they feared the development of nationalism in the Colony; they accordingly wished British authority over the Colony to be maintained and, if necessary, used to force a union with the Federation in whichthe position of the Rulers would be dominant. Some constitutional change in the Colony was inescapable, since it was important that new franchise arrangements should be worked out before the nextelections to preserve the position of the moderate political leadersthere. It would be expedient to encourage at the same time the ideaof a merger with the Federation, partly because this was the best wayof preserving the friendship of the Rulers and partly because a unionof the British territories in Southern Arabia would hold out the best hope of retaining our defence facilities for the longest possible period.He therefore proposed that the Governor should conduct a series of discussions during the next few months with representatives of theColony and the Federation, in which he would make it clear that wesupported a merger, subject to the retention of our defence facilities.His purpose would be to reach agreement on a new constitution forthe Colony, to come into force as early as practicable in 1962, which,in addition to the adjustment of the franchise, would allow for greaterdevolution of responsibility to the Government of the Colony,although the Governor would remain responsible for internal security,defence and external relations. In order to give these discussions thebest chance of success, a delegation of the Rulers would be invitedto a preliminary meeting in London; the advantages of givingincreased authority to the moderate elements in the Colony could then be explained to them, and they could be informed that we regarded a merger between the Federation and the Colony as a desirable aim of policy.The Secretary of State for Air said that, although the moderateleaders in the Colony and the Rulers were favourable to the idea of a merger, it was by no means certain that they would agree on the formof such a union. The Rulers wanted to annex the Colony to theSultanate of Lahej, whereas the Colony leaders contemplated entering the Federation as a principal member. Without our encouragementa merger might not take place. Should we, in these circumstances,exercise our influence in favour of it? The creation of this larger unitwould lead to earlier demands for independence, in which event our defence facilities would rest on treaty rather than on sovereignty. Inview of the likely spread of nationalist influences, it was doubtfulwhether we could&apos; place much reliance upon a treaty, particularly as our defence facilities in Aden would be needed mainly for operations against other Arab States. A merger might have the advantage of bringing dissident elements in the Colony under the control of theFederation;  but internal security in the Colony would not be a
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th May, 1961.  - -substantial problem and, if we could avoid a merger, we might beable to retain our defence facilities on the present basis for a longer period. In his view, therefore, although we should not resist a mergerif the moderate elements in the Colony and the Rulers could agree toits terms, we need not actively encourage such a development. we might be in a stronger position, both as regards defence facilities andfinancial assistance, if we had not urged the benefits of a merger on the rulers and the Colony leaders.The Minister of Defence said that, while it would suit us betterif the present position could remain unchanged, some constitutional development in the Colony was inevitable if the influence of the moderate elements there was to be maintained. This made some discussion of a merger unavoidable, and it seemed that if we did notencourage this we might lose the friendship and support of the Rulers.In further discussion it was pointed out that the Rulers would regard any constitutional advance in the Colony as a betrayal of their interests, if it were not accompanied by some progress towards a merger on the lines they favoured. In practice, therefore, there wasno real alternative but to say that we would welcome a merger if this could be agreed between the Rulers and the Colony leaders. It wouldbe necessary to take account of the extent to which, in the preliminary discussions in London, the Rulers themselves showed that theyfavoured merger in deciding how warmly this aim should becommended by us. There was much to be said for treating the Rulersfrankly and explaining to them in general terms the purpose of theconstitutional developments which we proposed for the Colony.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in the preliminary discussions to be held inLondon with a delegation from the Aden Federation, theColonial Secretary should explain in general terms thepurpose of the constitutional development proposed forthe Colony, and should further say that, if the Rulerswished to pursue the possibility of a merger with theColony, the United Kingdom Government would welcome such a development and would recommend the Rulers todiscuss the matter with the Colony leaders.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) above, endorsed the course proposed in C. (61) 68.
