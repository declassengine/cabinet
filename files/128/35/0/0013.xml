ContentsMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers, 1961Union of South Africa
C.C. 13 (61)Meeting of The Prime Minister said that the Meeting of CommonwealthCommonwealth Prime Ministers had taken a course which had made it impossiblePrime Ministers, for him to consuit the Cabinet before the Prime Minister of South1961 Africa, Dr. Verwoerd, had reached his decision on the previous dayUnion of to withdraw the application which he had earlier made that SouthSouth Africa Africa should continue to be a member of the Commonwealth afterbecoming a republic on 31st May. He had hoped to secure theagreement of the representatives of the other commonwealth countries that this constitutional change in South Africa should notbe a bar to her continued membership if at the same time it couldbe made plain that they had had a full opportunity to express their opposition to the racial policy of the Union Government. It might,indeed, have been possible to persuade the other members to accepta settlement of the immediate issue on this basis, since there was ageneral reluctance to take advantage of the constitutional change asan opportunity to expel South Africa from the Commonwealth. Ithad, however, become clear in the course of the discussions that, evenif the immediate issue could have been resolved in this way, some ofthe other members especially Ghana, Nigeria and perhaps India would have continued to conduct a sustained public campaign againstthe racial policy of the Union Government, in which they would have represented it as incompatible with Commonwealth membership.Some of them might even have considered the possibility of leaving the Commonwealth themselves if South Africa remained within it.There was a real risk that continued controversy on this issue mighthave led to the disintegration of the whole association in its present form. Although the discussions had been dignified and courteous,Dr. Verwoerd had made no concession whatever to the susceptibilitiesof the other members: he had not even been willing to consider theacceptance of diplomatic representatives from other commonwealth countries in Africa.The severance of the Commonwealth link with South Africa wasa matter of deep regret. The difficult problems with which we were faced in other parts of Africa, especially the Federation of rhodesia and Nyasaland, would be further complicated by this. It wasgratifying that Dr. Verwoerd had expressed his intention to co-operate in all possible ways with the United Kingdom and with other membersof the Commonwealth who remained on friendly terms. The effecton United Kingdom interests in South Africa would need urgentstudy.The Home Secretary expressed the Cabinefs full unstanding of the difficult situation with which the Prime Minister had had todeal in the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. the outcome could not have been avoided. He knew that this was alsothe view of the Prime Minister of Australia, who had howeverexpressed apprehensions about the implications for the future. Therewas no doubt that the future of the Commonwealth association wouldhave been endangered if the South African application had not been withdrawn. It would be highly undesirable if certain other commonwealth countries sought to transform the commonwealth in such a way as to make it similar in character to the United Nations.The Cabinet expressed their general concurrence with the course which had been followed, and their deep regret at the severance ofthe Commonwealth link with South Africa. It was agreed that weshould seek to maintain friendly relations on a bilateral basis with south Africa, and that this should be made clear in the statement which the Prime Minister would be making in Parliament later inthe day and in the debate which was likely to be held in the House ofCommons in the following week. It was particularly important that south Africa should remain in the sterling area, and it would helpin this connexion if the existing preferential trade arrangements,
which on balance favoured South Africa, could be maintained. in working out the details of our future relations with an independent and republican South Africa, it would be necessary to keep in mind the desirability of readmitting South Africa to the Commonwealthif circumstances made this possible.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement about thewithdrawal of South Africa from the Commonwealth.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for urgentstudy to be given to the legislative, administrative andother arrangements which would need to be made whenSouth Africa ceased to be a member of theCommonwealth.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th March, 1961.
