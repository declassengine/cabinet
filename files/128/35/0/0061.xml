This would require some major changes of policy on which proposals would be submitted tothe Cabinet in due course. Meanwhile, however, agreement hadbeen reached between the Treasury and Departments on a numberof minor changes which would result in a saving of about  14J million.Within the range of Government expenditure covered by this reviewthis would mean a material reduction, for which Treasury ministers were grateful.In discussion it was noted that one of the groups of measures tobe taken had already been disclosed publicly through a breach ofthe normal conventions applying to Whitley Council business.Another postponement of the campaign for the eradication of swinefever would have to be disclosed because it involved the reversal of a policy already announced. It was the general view of the Cabinethowever that, valuable as the savings were, it would not be appropriate for them to be the subject of any general announcement, since it wasnot yet possible to announce substantial savings from major policy decisions. It would be preferable that announcements of individualitems should be made separately, as required.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) Where, as with the Research Councils, the savings to be madewere in a hudget for a body discharging common service functions,quite small reductions might have significant effects on policy inother fields.(b) The savings which might be secured in the home expenditureof the oversea Departments could not be finally assessed until the review of their oversea expenditure had been carried further. Someof the economies made overseas might involve additional expenditure at home.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the report annexed to C.

The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, at the meeting ofthe Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development whichwas to begin on 16th November, the United States Government were likely to propose that the Organisation should set a collective target for economic growth in the member countries of at least 50 per cent,during the years 1962-70. This would involve an average annual rate of economic-growth of 4-6 per cent. The United states administration, who were anxious to pursue policies of expansion in their own country, thought that this would be attainable. In theUnited Kingdom, however, the maximum expansion that seemed60200-1D 2
4 &apos; SECRET^&quot; *&apos;likely to be possible was of the order of 30 per cent, over the period,or a yearly average of 3 per cent. It would therefore be unwise forthe United Kingdom to endorse the higher figure which the UnitedStates authorities had in mind.&apos;1&apos;The ^initial reactions of theRepresentatives of the other Governments had been cautious, butthe United States proposal would need to be handled carefully in discussion at the forthcon^g,meeting of. the, Organisation.The Cabinet Took note of this-statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Egypt 4.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterNubian of Education (C. (61) 177) about an appeal by the United NationsMonuments Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organisation (UNESCO) forfunds to save the monuments in Nubia which would be submergedby the construction of the High :Dam on the Nile.The Minister of Education said that the United KingdomGovernment had already made a grant of  20,000 for the rapidinvestigation of unexplored archaeological sites in Egypt and theSudan. Large sums amounting to $84 million were still required forthe transfer of temples to safe sites and for the preservation ofmonuments in situ, notably Philae and Abu Simbel. It had beensuggested by UNESCO that Governments might contribute accordingto the percentages of their contributions to the budget of theOrganisation: this would mean a United Kingdom contribution of just over $5 million. From the replies so far received from othercountries it seemed unlikely that the required total would be reached;and, as there was no sign that the Soviet Government intended tomake any contribution, despite the fact that the problem arose fromthe High Dam project which they had sponsored, it was open to question-whether any further contribution from the United kingdom should be offered. This was an unsuitable time at which to incuradditional expenditure overseas, and a Government contribution tothis fund would certainly not be appreciated by those who were stillseeking compensation from Egypt for their losses in 1956. If moneycould be found for cultural purposes in Africa, it would be betterspent in improving the standard of basic education there. On theother hand, even a small contribution might help to improve relationswith the Egyptian Government, and this might improve the prospects of obtaining compensation in respect of assets of British subjects heldby the Egyptians.Discussion showed that it was the provisional view of the Cabinetthat a contribution to this appeal would not be justified in presentcircumstances. If, in the event, there were a Russian contribution itmight be necessary to reconsider the matter.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain whether the SovietGovernment were likely to contribute to this fund.(2) Agreed to consider further at a later meeting whether a contribution should be made by the United KingdomGovernment.Commonwealth 5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeImmigrants Secretary (C. (61) 180) on the application of the commonwealth immigrants Bill to the Irish Republic.The Home Secretary recalled that, in earlier discussions on theBill. Ministers had accepted the view that, while the Bill should apply to citizens of the Irish Republic, control of entry from ireland would not be practicable.   In view of the keen interest which was(previous reference :CC. (61) 55lhConclusions.Minute 3)
- r CC. 61 (61)being shown in the position of the Irish .Republic under the Bill, astatement on this point would need to be made in the debate on theSecond Reading of the Bill. An early, statement might induce theGovernment of the Irish Republic to promise to introduce legislationenabling them to operate a control, similar to our own, over the immigration of persons from Commonwealth countries other thanthe United Kingdom. -v-ij-XV:-&apos;: .&quot;In discussion there was general agreement that it would not be practicable to control traffic over the border between the irish republic and Northern Ireland, and that there would be gravepolitical difficulties in imposing a control on entry from NorthernIreland into Great Britain. It followed that the provisions of thenew Bill could not be applied in practice to citizens of the irish republic; and, unless this were clearly stated at an early stage ofthe Parliamentary proceedings on the Bill, it would be more difficultto persuade the Government of the Irish Republic to co-operate in preventing the purposes of the Bill from being frustrated by commonwealth immigrants entering this country through theRepublic. It was true that this exemption could be represented asaccording to citizens of the Irish Republic treatment more favourable than that given to citizens of Commonwealth countries. TheGovernment could, however, take their stand upon the same considerations which had led Parliament, in the context of nationality,to treat Irish citizens as if they were British subjects. The truth wasthat the facts of history and of geography alike precluded theimposition of immigration control between the south of Ireland andthe rest of the British Isles.In further discussion it was suggested that the draft statement annexed to C. (61) 180 should lay greater stress on the practicaldifficulties of control and, in particular, on the peculiar problempresented by the large seasonal movement of workers between theIrish Republic and Great Britain. There might also be advantage in bringing out the intention that the deportation provisions in theBill would have permanent effect and would not be subject to renewalat five-yearly intervals. If the Government of the Irish Republiccould meanwhile be persuaded to undertake to introduce complemen-tary legislation, it would be valuable to include a reference to this in the statement.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Home Secretary, in his speech on the SecondReading of the Commonwealth Immigrants Bill, should include a statement on the application of the Bill to theIrish Republic.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary, the Colonial Secretary and theMinister of Labour, to revise in the light of their discussion the draft statement annexed to C. (61) ISO.Kenya 6.   Tlie  Colonial  Secretary  said  that  tribal  tensions  wereJomo increasing in Kenya and the best hope for the future was to workKenyatta        for a constitutional conference in the early part of 1962 to devise(Previous        satisfactory safeguards for minority interests.  There would be littleReference:      chance of guiding sucli a conference to a successful conclusion unlessCC. (ol) 44th Kenyatta, who was the elected leader of the majority party, was conclusions.    enabled to sit in the Legislative Council by the removal of the minute 5)       disqualification now applying to anyone who had served a sentence of imprisonment of more than two years.   When the Cabinet had authorised Kenyatta\s release from restriction it had been hoped thatan African Chief Minister might have been appointed before thisdisqualification was removed.   However, in view of th-* failure to
effect an accommodation between the majority and minority parties in Kenya, this had not been possible. The Governor and the minorityparties agreed that in these circumstances it was advisable that the.disqualification should now be removed. They believed thatKenyatta&apos;s performance as a member of the Legislative Council wouldnot enhance his stature in the eyes of Africans generally. If the disqualification was to be removed, it seemed desirable that thisshould be announced without delay.&apos;.:.In discussion grave misgivings * were expressed about thepossibility that Kenyatta might become the Prime Minister of anindependent Kenya. It seemed highly undesirable that the UnitedKingdom Government should take any positive action which mightcontribute towards that result. It was true that his current visit toLondon was attracting comparatively, little publicity, and that hewas strongly opposed by the minority parties in Kenya. On the otherhand, he had become the leader of the majority party and was accepted by other African statesmen as the spokesman of africans in Kenya.It was also suggested that it was doubtful whether the removalof the disqualification would increase the chances of bringing theconstitutional conference to a successful conclusion. Kenyatta was an evil man who must be held responsible for the brutalities of theMau Mau movement. It would be impossible for the Europeanminority in Kenya to rely on constitutional safeguards under aGovernment controlled by him.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The continuance within the Commonwealth of an independentKenya under the leadership of Kenyatta would seem to many people to be inconsistent with the moral principles which had hitherto beenthe basis of the Commonwealth association.(b) If we were to avoid chaos in Kenya, the only alternative to working for a satisfactory constitutional settlement leading to earlyindependence was to continue our colonial rule. But this wouldinvolve a heavy financial and political burden.(c) The best framework for satisfactory safeguards for minoritiesin a constitutional settlement would be the delegation of substantialpowers to the various tribal regions of Kenya.(d) In the longer term the best hope for stability in Kenya layin some form of federation with the other East African territories.(e) The European minority in Kenya might well think that, facedwith the prospect of a Government led by Kenyatta, their only realsafeguard was the maintenance of British troops in Kenya.(/) If it were agreed that the removal of the disqualification was inevitable, the timing of any announcement would need carefulconsideration. Such a decision might be more acceptable, especially to certain sections of opinion in this country, if it were not taken untilthe Colonial Secretary had personally visited Kenya and consultedwith the various interests there.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thequestion of removing the disqualification on Kenyatta tobe considered further, in the context of the nature andtimetable of likely constitutional developments in Kenya,at a meeting of Ministers in the following week.
