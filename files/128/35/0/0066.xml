Cabinet 2.   The Prime Minister said that Mr. F. A. Bishop would beSecretariat leaving the Cabinet Secretariat at the end of the week, to take up his new post as a Deputy Secretary in the Ministry of Agriculture.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of Mr. Bishop&apos;s services,and their good wishes to him in his new appointment.Parliament 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)4. The Foreign Secretary said that the United kingdom representative at the United Nations had in the event abstained from voting on the Afro-Asian resolution relating to the Congo, andhad dissociated himself from its recommendations. government supporters in the House of Commons were content with the attitude adopted by the United Kingdom in the discussions in the security council, but they were still apprehensive that the Secretary-Generalof the United Nations might go too far in the use of force againstKatanga. Mr. Tshombe, the Prime Minister of Katanga, had now suggested that a distinguished statesman from an uncommittedindependent country in Africa should be appointed to act as mediatorin the dispute between Katanga and the central Government of the congo. But the acts of violence which had occurred in Elizabethvilleon the previous day might reduce the prospect of an early meeting between Mr. Tshombe and Mr. Adoula, the Prime Minister of thecentral Government.Germany 5.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterBerlin (C. (61) 194) covering two telegrams to Washington (Nos. 8711 and(Previous 8712 of 27th November) about the discussions on Berlin which reference: had held with General de Gaulle during the latter is stay in thisCC. (61) 65th country from 24th to 26th November. The first of these was a conclusions, factual summary of the main points raised in these discussions. the minute 3) second contained a message to President Kennedy discussingalternative means by which further efforts might now be made tosecure Western agreement on a basis of negotiation with the SovietGovernment.The Prime Minister said that President Kennedy had been ableto make some progress in the discussions which he had held withdraw. Adenauer in Washington. Dr. Adenauer was at least preparedfor negotiations, though the position which he had so far taken was too narrow to offer the prospect of a negotiated settlement. general de Gaulle on the other hand was still unwilling that the FrenchGovernment should participate in such negotiations. He seemedtn be influenced by a long-term view of the eventual reaction ofthe German people to any settlement on Berlin which was likely todc reached in present circumstances. He feared that a strongGermany of the future would come to feel the same resentmentagainst such a settlement as Nazi Germany had felt against theTreaty of Versailles.   France would be in a better position to meeting wi;hGeneral deGaulleSir Winston 1.   The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to send to SirChurchill        Winston Churchill on their behalf a message of congratulation andgood wishes on the occasion of his 87th birthday.
CO&quot;5^* COCOLU it; cV- LUinfluence such a Germany if she had not been associated with that settlement. General de Gaulle still contended that the western powers were under no obligation to offer concessions in order to resolve a crisis over Berlin which had been created by the Russians.He could not be persuaded that the situation in Berlin itself waspotentially dangerous. For all these reasons he thought it bothunnecessary and inexpedient to enter into negotiations at this stage.The Prime Minister said that, especially in view of the moreforthcoming attitude adopted by Dr. Adenauer, further attemptsshould now be made to bring the French to agree that negotiations should be opened. The alternative courses were set out in hismessage to the President. Pressure might be applied successively,at a meeting of senior officials followed by a meeting of foreign ministers and culminating in discussion in the North atlantic council. Alternatively, it might be that this question should beconsidered at an early meeting of the Heads of western governments. These two alternatives might, indeed, be combined:for, even if the first alternative were followed, a meeting of Headsof Governments might be held after the pressures had been built up in the North Atlantic Council. He would consider the choice of method with the Foreign Secretary, in the light of any views whichPresident Kennedy might express in reply to his message. A decisions would have to be taken in the near future.-LiI  DC3 military The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the MinisterPlanning        of Defence (C. (61) 195) on the state of military planning for contingencies in Berlin.The Minister of Defence said that there were three groups ofmilitary plans. The first, known as Free Style, was a probe to identify a Soviet or East German decision to block Allied groundaccess to Berlin. The operation might be carried out on one of threedifferent scales, according to the type of obstruction which wasjudged likely to be encountered. The largest force would consistof only 120 men, and it was not intended that these should open fir&apos;.,except in self defence. The second group was composed of operations to force a way to Berlin along the autobahn, either -w:&apos;i ria battalion group (Trade Wind) or with a divisional force (JuneBall). In the third group were the air operations (Jack Pine) designedto maintain Allied air access to Berlin. The United States authorities had now agreed that the first response to a denial of Allied groundSECRET
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 189) covering a report by a working party of officials on the advantages of a decimal coinage.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had undertaken to make a statement before the end of the year about the government&apos;s attitude to adopting a decimal system of coinage. Itappeared from the report of the working party that this would leadto a great saving of time and money in the Ions run, but that these advantages had to be weighed against tl      convenience to theaccess to Berlin would be the mounting of the probe (Free Style)and that, if this were turned back, we should resort to air operations to maintain communications before extended ground operations were undertaken. General Norstad, the Supreme Allied Com-mander, Europe, had asked for authority to assemble the Free Styleforce at once and to hold it indefinitely at six hours&apos; notice. Tothis there were both political and military objections. But it mightbe prudent to give General Norstad authority to assemble the force(though not to launch it) if it appeared that action to block Alliedground access to Berlin was imminent. It was also desirable thatsome aspects of the arrangements for command in Berlin shouldbe clarified. Authority had already been given for a single military commander, who would be the United States Commandant, toassume responsibility under the control of General Norstad in theevent of grave civil disturbances or overt armed attack. TheAmbassadorial Group in Washington should be asked to define the capacity in which General Norstad would control the singleCommander. The American Commandant in Berlin had proposedthat in an emergency the officer who was currently acting as theChairman of the three Commandants should have power in certaincircumstances to deploy or commit all or part of the Allied garrison in advance of the establishment of a single Commander. It wouldbe imprudent to authorise the Chairman Commandant to commitforces without the unanimous agreement of his colleagues (and hencewithout the agreement of Governments): we might, however, agreethat the Chairman Commandant should be empowered to alert anddeploy the garrison, provided that it was clearly understood thatthe sole object of this authority was to enable Allied forces in berlin to be alerted and assembled in readiness for the appointment of asingle Commander. All these proposals had been considered and endorsed by the Defence Committee on the previous day.The Cabinet (3) Approved the recommendations made in paragraph 15 ofC. (61) 195.The Cabinet also considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 187) on contingency plans for Berlin.The Foreign Secretary said that if civil air access to Berlin wereinterfered with by physical means, fighter aircraft would beintroduced into the air corridors and military transport aircraftsubstituted for civil aircraft. Authority had been given for Alliedescort fighters to return fire by Soviet or East German aircraft. Wehad, however, refused to agree that Soviet or East German groundinstallations which fired on Allied aircraft might be attacked without prior Governmental authority.The Cabinet (4) Took note of C. (61) 187.
430SECRETpublic and the cost of the change, both to the economy and to theExchequer. It was thought that the total cost would be in the region of  200 million, but no reliable estimate of cost could be made before much more was known about the number and age of thevarious monetary machines in use in the country and before a. detailed study had been made of the best way of phasing any change.This required a large-scale investigation by a PreparatoryCommission in which Government Departments, local authoritiesand nationalised industries would have to participate. The directcost to the Exchequer would be substantially increased if theGovernment were to assume liability for compensating private interests; it would be important to avoid any commitment in thisrespect until the results of the examination by the PreparatoryCommission had been considered. rIt would first be necessary, to decide what the new unit for adecimal coinage should be. A system based on 10s. divided into100 units would have considerable advantages over one based onthe  , although it would entail adjusting all past financial statistics.There were also psychological objections to a change which might appear to abandon the   sterling. If, however, the   were retainedas the basic unit, it would be necessary to divide it into 1,000 unitsif the sub-unit was not to be unacceptably large.A number of Commonwealth countries already used decimalcoinage. In addition, Australia and New Zealand were committed in principle to changing to that system, and it would be important to co-ordinate any action we might take on this subject with theGovernments of those two countries. Moreover, the cost of changing the system would continue to increase, since mechanical methodsof calculating and accounting were being rapidly developed. Onthese grounds a decision should not be postponed much longer. Ifit were decided to appoint a Preparatory Commission, it was forconsideration whether the Government should announce now thatthey were in principle in favour of making the change.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The terms of reference of a Preparatory Commission shouldbe so drawn as to avoid recommendations which would increasethe pressure on the Government to assume, liability for compensatingprivate interests.(b) On balance it seemed likely that a system based on the 10s.unit would be preferable. To avoid the psychological disadvantages of this unit it might be possible for it to be called, at first, the &quot; newpound &quot;.(c) It was not clear that it would be necessary to introduce a wholly new series of coins. It might be possible to re-value someof the existing coinage, and thus to achieve a substantial saving inthe cost.(d) While it was desirable to co-ordinate policy on this question with the Australian and New Zealand Governments, there wouldbe serious disadvantage from the point of view of the cash machineindustry if all three countries were to change to a decimal systemat the same time.(e) It was suggested that the adoption of a decimal system ofmeasurement would provide greater economic advantages than adecimal coinage. Both had been recommended by a committee ofthe British Association and the Association of British Chambers ofCommerce.The genera] conclusion which emerged from the cabinets discussion was that the advantages of adopting a decimal-coinagewere sufficient to justify setting up a Preparatory Commission tomake a detailed estimate of the cost and to study the appropriatetiming and phasing of the change. It would, however, be inexpedient
wages policy(previous reference:CC. (61) 58thConclusions,Minute 8)Firemen7. The Home Secretary said that on 13th July the employers&apos;side of the National Joint Council for Local Authorities&apos; fire brigades had made an offer for an immediate and substantial increasein pay for the London and Middlesex brigades. The unions hadneither accepted nor rejected this offer but had asked for a nationalpay increase, for which they had subsequently suggested an operative date of 31st October. A deputation from both sides of the national joint Council had recently sought from him and the Chief Secretary,Treasury, an assurance that the Government would not publiclydissent from a settlement reached on that basis. In pursuance ofthe advice of the Wages Committee, no such assurance had beengiven: the deputation had instead been asked to take into account the economic situation of the country and it had been suggested to them that the operative date for a settlement should not be earlier than February 1962. The employers had been warned- that theyshould not proceed on the assumption that the Government wouldbe prepared to increase the general grant if, contrary to the government&apos;s advice, they decided to pay increased wages from the dates which they had proposed.A representative of the employers&apos; side had now asked whetherthe Government would increase the general grant if a settlement withan earlier operative date were reached, and had also asked whatthe Governmenfs attitude would be if a settlement were not reached and a request for arbitration were made.The constitutional position was that the Joint Council were fully responsible for any settlement. It had been announced duringthe passage of the Fire Services Bill, 1959, that, in the light of theintroduction of the general grant to local authorities,.the Governmenthad reviewed the statutory powers conferred on the Home secretary with regard to the determination of pay and i other conditions ofservice in fire brigades and had come to the conclusion thatMinisterial intervention would no longer be justified in this field.This made it difficult for the Government to do more than repeat the warnings which had already been given.In discussion it was argued that, while the offer made on13th July in respect of the London and Middlesex brigades was clearly a commitment before the introduction of the government&apos;s policy for a pay pause, it would be more difficult to represent anincrease for the other brigades as a consequential commitment.This would certainly not be accepted by Government supporters asjustification for any retrospection in pay increases, which would beregarded as a serious inroad into the Governmenfs wages policy.Any concession which appeared to be another breach of the paypause would increase the difficulties in the passage of the Bill toextend the borrowing powers of the coal industry. On this view, thebest course might be for the Government to be prepared to use thesanction of withholding any additional payment of general grant inrespect of any increases other than those offered to the London andfor the Government to announce at this stage that a decision ofprinciple had been taken in favour of making this change.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the adoption of a decimal coinage should notbe accepted in principle at this stage but that there wouldbe sufficient advantage in making this change to warranta full-scale investigation into the cost.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) approved the recommendations in-paragraph 14 of C. (61) 189.
SpaceResearchBlue Streak(previous reference:CC. (60) 44thConclusions,Minute 3)8. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Aviation (C. (61) 197) and by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C. (61) 200) about the arrangements for setting up a EuropeanLauncher Development Organisation (E.L.D.O.).The Minister of Aviation said that there was a good prospect that an international organisation could be formed to develop blue streak as a satellite launcher. Besides the United Kingdom andFrance, which had sponsored the Organisation, West Germany..Belgium, Denmark and the Netherlands were likely to participateItaly remained doubtful, and Austria, Norway. Spain. Sweden and switzerland were almost certain to decline. Although governments had been asked to give a final indication of their intentions byMiddlesex brigades. An incidental difficulty of this course was that,because of the way in which the payment of general grant was calculated, the denial of it would affect London and Middlesex aswell as the other local authorities.On the other hand, the fact that an offer had been made inJuly for London and Middlesex, and that this in the normal coursewould set the pattern for increases to other brigades, together withthe fact that the negotiations for all brigades could be regarded asdirected towards a single settlement, were grounds for arguing thatan operative date in February or even January next for increases inrespect of the other brigades would be an acceptable compromise.It was difficult to maintain that, in the light of the Governmenfsstatements during the passage of the Fire Services Bill in 1959, the discretion rested finally with the Joint Council if, at the same time,the Government were to refuse to meet the cost by denying general grant. -It was pointed out that it would be undesirable to encourage theJoint Council to resort to arbitration. For it was likely that, as an offer in respect of the London and Middlesex brigades had beenmade last July, any award would involve a considerable element of retrospection.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the Governmenfs advice to the Joint Council, or tothe employers&apos; side of it, should follow that which had previously been given and should be on the following lines. The constitutionalresponsibility for a settlement rested under the Fire Services Act,1959, with the Joint Council. The increases for London andMiddlesex which were offered before the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on 25th July were clearly a commitment beforethe introduction of the policy of a pay pause. As regards other areas, it would be right for the date of payment of any increase tobe deferred; but, because the offer to London and Middlesex impliedan element of commitment for an increase in the rest of the country,the Government would regard a date early next year for that increase as a reasonable compromise. Local authorities must not proceed on the assumption that there would be an increase in the general grant for the current financial year in respect of the amount involvedif an earlier date for settlement were chosen. This advice shouldbe given to the Joint Council, and the Government should be readyto publish it if, as a result of the meeting of the Joint Council onthe following day, any settlement were reached which could beregarded as inconsistent with the Governmenfs policy of a pay pause.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to inform the National joint council for Local Authorities&apos; Fire Brigades of the government&apos;s attitude to pay increases in the fire service in the terms set out above.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th November, 196J.27th November, none had yet done so. Some of the hesitation arosebecause the position of Italy was uncertain and no firm arrangements had been made for underwriting her financial contribution, which amounted to some 10 per cent, of the total. Meanwhile, UnitedStates manufacturers were making attractive offers of assistance inthe launching of satellites under joint American-Italian arrangements.If the Italians could be convinced that E.L.D.O. would beestablished, whether they were members or not, they might well feelimpelled to join it; and it was in any case desirable to end the uncertainty felt by other prospective members. He therefore sought authority to inform the French and German Governments that theUnited Kingdom would be prepared, if necessary, to pay the wholeof Italy&apos;s subscription provided that France and Germany wouldshare with us in making good the deficiency caused by the defectionof the smaller countries. If it should prove necessary to take up this commitment, we should have assumed responsibility for contributing 33 million, spread over five years, towards the Organisation^ totalbudget of  70 million.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that our prospectivecontribution to E.L.D.O. had steadily increased since it had beenoriginally assessed at the Strasbourg.Conference in February 1961.France and Germany, on the other hand, had as yet accepted no additional liabilities and might well refuse to do so until they knew the full extent of the deficiency. It was arguable that we should similarly reserve our position. If the Italians were to decide to join,we were already virtually committed to sharing equally with Franceand Germany the deficiency caused by the absence of the smallerPowers; and the assumption of the whole Italian liability would add 1-4 million a year to our expenditure. Such a commitment couldbe met only at the expense of other projects.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The construction of a satellite launcher was withoutscientific interest in itself and should not be financed at the expenseof valuable scientific research. The venture would produce acommercial return only if it were to provide the means of establishing a satellite communications system. It was not yet certain that alauncher based on Blue Streak would prove most suitable for thispurpose.(b) Our current expenditure on Blue Streak was of the orderof  500,000 a month. The sooner E.L.D.O. could be established,the sooner could we be assured that this expenditure was not beingwasted. We should therefore approach the French and Germanson the basis that we would offer to underwrite the Italian subscriptionif they would thereupon agree to share with us the responsibilityfor the remaining deficiency and at the same time confirm theiradherence to the Organisation on this basis. If this offer were not accepted, it would be necessary to consider whether the project should be abandoned altogether.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Aviation to approach the Frenchand German Governments on the lines proposed inC. (61) 197, informing them at the same time that our offer was conditional on their proceeding immediately with theestablishment of E.L.D.O.
