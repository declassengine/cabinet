The Foreign Secretary said that the Communist forces inLaos, with the assistance of weapons and supplies dropped by Sovietaircraft, had secured military successes against the forces of the present government of Laos. The Chiefs of Staff had always taken the viewthat military intervention in Laos by the South-East Asia treaty organisation countries would be unlikely to result in a satisfactory solution; the most we could attain by such means would be astalemate, and there would be every likelihood of defeat unless wewere to use nuclear tactical weapons. We had therefore sought apolitical solution by working for the revival of the international commission, but this aim was not fully supported by the UnitedStates and the Laotian Governments.We were at present discussing with the United States and canadian Governments what preparatory steps might best lead to a return of the International Commission. In view of the militarysuccesses of the Communist forces in Laos, the Soviet Governmentwere unlikely to agree to the return of the Commission. They wouldprobably insist that the Geneva Conference should be reconvened,perhaps in the enlarged form now proposed by Prince Sihanouk.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.congo republic(previous reference:C.C. (60) 65thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary said that Congolese forces supportingMr. Lumumba, with financial and other help from Egyptian troopsprovided for the United Nations, had advanced into the KatangaProvince. They had so far been prevented from moving furtheragainst the supporters of Mr. Tshombe by the interposition of a united Nations contingent of Nigerian troops. The United NationsSecretary-General had accepted our suggestion that he should instruct the Egyptian contingent to be removed to some other part of the congo, and he had agreed that, if they were to refuse, he would orderthem to leave the country on the ground that they were not co-operating with the United Nations authorities.President Kasavubu had now agreed to summon a constitutional conference, and to appoint a government which would includesupporters of Mr. Lumumba and would administer the country ona provisional basis until a definitive constitution had been agreed atthe conference.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.1. The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that he would soon&apos;be able to announce the resumption of full diplomatic relations withthe United Arab Republic. A. satisfactory agreement had beenreached on the establishment of consulates, as a result of which noEgyptian consuls would be appointed, at any rate for some time, inany of our dependent territories in East Africa.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the foreign secretary.
national health service(previous reference:C.C. (60) 65thConclusions,Minute 4)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministerof Agriculture and the Minister of Health (C. (61) 1) and. by theMinister of Pensions and National Insurance (C. (61) 6) about thelevel of subsidy on welfare milk.  .&apos; - .    &apos;.!The Minister of&apos;Health&apos; recalled that he and. the Secretary^pf-State for Scotland had earlier proposed^ as one of a number of methods of meeting the increasing cost of the Health Service, thatthe subsidy on welfare milk should be reduced by ;2d. a pint. In thecourse of the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion, it had been suggested thatsome concession should be made to safeguard the nutritionalstandards of families containing four, or more children. Accordinglyit was now proposed that for such families (and for families with threechildren where the mother was pregnant) the subsidy should remain at its present level. This concession would reduce the direct saving to the Exchequer by some  2^ millions in a full year. consideration had been given to various alternative concessions, but it had been felt that these could not be adopted because they would be likely to lead to a large reduction in consumption and, in consequence, wouldhave a serious effect on the milk industry. It was proposed that thevarious measures relating to the cost of the Health Service and theGovernments intention to increase the weekly contribution byIs. should be announced together on 1st February, shortly before publication of the Civil Vote on Account.The Minister of Pensions suggested that on nutritional and other grounds there was a good case for extending the concession nowproposed to families with three children and those of widowed mothers.In discussion it was pointed out that it was estimated that therewould be an increase of some  380 millions in total government expenditure in 1961-62 as compared with the corresponding figure for the current year. Account had already been taken, in arriving atthis estimated increase, of the  120 millions increase in contributions under the new insurance scheme. But, as an offset, the increase inthe health contribution would yield  48 millions in a full year; andthe proposals relating to the cost of the Health Service other thanthose on welfare milk and welfare foods would yield in a full yearnearly  15 millions ( 12-2 millions from an increase in theprescription charge to 2s. per item and  2-6 millions from increases in other charges). There was thus in prospect a total saving to theExchequer of  63 millions in a full year.The proposed increase in the prescription charge would be politically unwelcome and could be regarded as a genuine economyonly to the extent that it would serve as a deterrent to unnecessaryresort to doctors and might help to emphasise the very high cost of drugs to the Exchequer. Nevertheless, it was the general view of theCabinet that this increase should be approved. It would, however,be desirable to give further consideration to the date on which theincrease in the prescription charge should take effect.The Home Secretary said that, while it ought to be possible toreduce Exchequer expenditure in other fields as well as in the health service, he no longer wished, in view of the need to contain the costof that Service, to maintain his opposition to legislation to increasethe charges for dental and optical appliances. It was helpfulthat this legislation would provide that these charges, like other charges in the Service, should in future be determined by statutory instrument.There was general agreement that the Government should proceed with this legislation, accompanied by the concessionsproposed by the Health Ministers in respect of appliances for children and expectant and nursing mothers, and with the proposed increasein the charges for amenity beds in hospitals.
As regards the proposed reduction in the welfare milk subsidy,the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that, if any reduction were approved, the concession in favour of families with four or more children should be extended to those with three children and thoseof widowed mothers: On that basis, however, the proposal wouldhave the effect of reducing the consumption of milk by some20 million gallons a year and would reduce the earnings of producersby about  1% millions. It was therefore certain to provoke strong opposition from the Milk Marketing Board and the national farmers Unions, who were already critical of the Governmenfspolicies. It would hardly be possible to avoid compensating the milk industry for this loss in the Annual Price Review and it would in that case be necessary to set off some  1  millions against the saving tothe Exchequer of  7 millions from reduction of the subsidy.It was suggested that to differentiate between families was,perhaps, less easy to defend than to abolish the welfare milk subsidyaltogether. There might be a case for a comprehensive review of allthe special services provided for children in particular, the family allowances, school meals and school milk, as well as welfare milk and foods.In further discussion it was agreed that the subsidy on welfarefoods other than milk should be abolished.Summing up, The Prime Minister said that it was the general view of the Cabinet that approval should now be given to all theproposals before them for reducing the cost of the Health Serviceexcept that relating to welfare milk; and that the agreed proposals,together with the Governmenfs intention to increase the health service contribution, should be announced on 1st February. Furtherconsideration should, however, be given to the dates on which thevarious proposals should take effect and the Cabinet should resume their discussion of the welfare milk subsidy at a further meeting before 1st February.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision that the prescription charge shouldbe increased to 2s. per item, that legislation should beintroduced to increase the charges for dental and opticalappliances, and that the charges for amenity beds shouldbe increased.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Health, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer, to give further consideration to the dates onwhich these increases should take effect.(3) Authorised the Minister of Health to announce on1st February the increases referred to in Conclusion (1)above and the Government^ intention to increase the health Service contribution.(4) Agreed to resume at an early meeting their discussion of theproposals in C. (61) 1 and 6 on the reduction of the welfare milk subsidy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th January, 1961.
