The Foreign Secretary said that there was some prospect thatthe problem of the secretariat of the United Nations might be resolved by the appointment of an acting Secretary-General together with five or more under-secretaries who would, be selected on a regional basis with the function of providing the acting Secretary-General withadvice if he so requested. Such an arrangement might not be strongly opposed by the Soviet Union, and it might receive the support of asufficient majority in the General Assembly to enable the personselected as acting Secretary-General, who might be a Burmese, toassume his responsibilities with reasonable confidence.In discussion it was pointed out that it was very desirable that arepresentative of the Western European countries should be one of the under-secretaries.South-east asia treaty organisation laos    ,    .(previous reference:C.C. (61) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Foreign Secretary said that there were indications thatthe Soviet Government were now prepared to co-operate in a political settlement in Laos, and reasonable progress was being made at theconference in Geneva. Meanwhile discussions between the threeLaotian Princes were proceeding in Laos, with the object of reaching agreement on the composition of a balanced Government.If, despite these hopeful indications, negotiations for a political settlement were to fail, there would be a grave danger that, withthe end of the rainy season, the Pathet Lao, who had considerablystrengthened their forces in many parts of the country, would againresort to military action. In that event there would be a demand formilitary intervention by the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation, andthe United States Government might well feel obliged to undertake this task. In such circumstances, although we had previously made it clear that we would not favour military intervention except on arestricted basis, and that our participation in any land action must belimited to our share in the Commonwealth brigade, it would benecessary to consider afresh what our policy should be and what formmilitary operations, if these were appropriate, should take.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Middle EastUnited arab republic  .(previous reference :CC (61) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Foreign Secretary said that, following the revolt in Syria,a new Government had taken effective charge of the&apos;country and itwas necessary to consider at what stage that Government should berecognised. It would be desirable, especially in view of our economic interests, to avoid a breach of relations with the egyptian government. It would therefore be advisable to wait until the UnitedStates authorities had explained to President Nasser that recognitionof the new Syrian Government could not be withheld.In discussion it was suggested that it would be difficult for theEgyptian Government to break off relations if a number of countries,including important European countries such as Western germany or Italy, recognised the new Syrian Government at the same time.The Cabinet    -  . , -Invited the Foreign Secretary to await the result of thediscussions between the United States and EgyptianGovernments, and then to arrange, if possible, that recognition of the new Syrian Government was concertedwith a number of other Governments.
Minute 3)Germany *4.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign:Berlin Secretary (C. (61) 149) about the Berlin situation, following the(Previous meeting of Foreign Ministers in Washington and the consultations;Reference : which he had had with the United States Secretary of State, Mr. Rusk,CC. (61) 52nd and with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, in New York.:L&quot; &apos; &apos; 1 &apos; The Foreign Secretary said that there was some reason to thinkthat the discussions which he and Mr. Rusk had separately had with&quot;Mr. Gromyko had in the end persuaded the Soviet Government that&quot;it would be unsafe for them to continue to be completely,&apos;:uncompromising about a settlement of the Berlin problem. Mr.Gromyko had now been brought to see that, unless some concession-were made to the Western point of view, there would be a serious;danger of war, which would inevitably escalate into a nuclear conflict.&apos;It had been impressed on him that a solution could not be secured on;the basis only of a peace treaty with East Germany and that it must:depend on direct negotiations between the West and the Soviet&apos;:Government. But Mr. Gromyko had not so far seemed willing to contemplate a future status for West Berlin of a kind which would be.acceptable to the West, and he still seemed to consider that, although^Western routes of access to West Berlin might be guaranteed by the.Soviet Union, those routes would have to be the subject of prior?agreement with the East German Government. Moreover he insistedIthat a settlement would have to comprehend matters other than?Berlin, such as the recognition of East Germany, the acceptance of \the Oder-Neisse line and the existing frontiers between East and West,:Germany, and restrictions on militarism in West Germany. There;was, however, some indication that the Soviet Government would besatisfied with something less than de jure recognition of East;:Germany.President Kennedy was shortly to meet Mr. Gromyko, and inthe light of whatever then transpired it would be necessary to consider;how  negotiations  could   be   pursued.    Although   the  French:;Government remained averse to formal negotiations or to a meetingof Foreign Ministers, they seemed ready to acquiesce in a continuation.;of the informal discussions with Mr. Gromyko and to accept that;;!those discussions would cover matters of substance.  It might be$possible for the informal discussions between the United StatesGovernment and Mr. Gromyko to be continued perhaps in Moscow,when it might be hoped that they would deal with these problems;in greater detail.  On balance, it seemed advisable to encourage thisIprocess to continue for some further time before resorting to formal:negotiations between Foreign Ministers.The Foreign Secretary warned the Cabinet that, while some progress was being made in the direction of seeking a settlement bylnegotiation, the Soviet Government had not yet made any appreciable -concessions. The situation remained extremely dangerous, and there!would undoubtedly be a grave risk of war if the Soviet Governmentobstructed Western access to Berlin.The following were among the points made in discussion:(a) The future status for West Berlin which Mr. Gromyko had;;;so far contemplated would provide for no more than token forces of western troops. It was of great importance that the Western Allies!should continue to maintain in West Berlin forces which, while theyiwould clearly be inadequate to prevent the seizure of the city by military aggression, would be sufficient to protect the inhabitantsfrom subversion.(b) Although there would be disadvantages in removing the headquarters of the United Nations to West Berlin, the establishmentof some elements of that organisation there might make a settlement-more acceptable, since it would help to assure access to the city.  r;* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET   &apos; - ill
Middle East 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordKuwait Privy Seal (C. (61) 1.40) covering a report by officials on future policy(Previous and military dispositions in Kuwait and the Persian Gulf.   the reference: Cabinet also had before them a note by the Deputy Secretary of theCC. (61) 50th Cabinet (C. (61) 145) covering a draft directive to the Commander-in-Conclusions, Chief, Middle East, about military intervention in Kuwait after BritishMinute 4) forces had been withdrawn.CC. 53 (61)- -(c) The United States Government now fully, accepted theimportance of securing a settlement by negotiation. But there was considerable criticism from some sections of United States opinionthat the United Kingdom was not participating to a sufficient extent in the military preparations and economic planning designed to persuade the Soviet Government that the West would firmly maintain their objectives.The Minister of Defence said that it would be possible to takea few more steps to increase our military preparations in Europe, e.g.,by withdrawing administrative troops from Kenya, and by stationinganother squadron of Canberra aircraft in Germany. But the only way to make the British Army of the Rhine a viable force would beto mobilise reservists, and the United States authorities accepted thatthis would be inadvisable at the present time. He proposed toexamine the extent to which it might be possible to recall reservistswithout a Proclamation.The President of the Board of Trade said that the United states authorities also realised that an economic blockade would not be an effective method of compulsion on the Soviet Government; but they felt that plans must be made for an economic blockade, and ifnecessary put into effect, in order to convince the Soviet Governmentthat the West were determined not to surrender to a threat of force.In fact, economic counter-measures would cause disproportionateharm to this country and we could only contemplate using them inconjunction with, and not as an alternative to, military action. Weshould continue to urge upon our Allies the advantage of applyingeconomic counter-measures against East Germany only, in the firstinstance.(d) It was pointed out that it should always be borne in mind that Soviet forces could seize West Berlin at any time. The informalnegotiations which had been taking place might be no more than acover for the preparation of aggression. If on the other hand theSoviet Government were prepared to seek a settlement by negotiation,the fact that the informal discussions were taking place would provide them with grounds for refraining from concluding a peace treaty withEast Germany for the time being.The Prime Minister said that there was some danger that themilitary preparations which were being made by the West might leadto the belief that a Soviet aggression in force could be defeated byconventional military means; at the most, defence by conventional forces could only provide an interval in which world opinion and diplomatic action could be brought to bear. It should also be clearlyrecognised that economic measures would not in practice compel theSoviet Government to change their policy. The reluctance of theFrench Government, and also of the West German Government, toagree to formal negotiations added to the risks of the situation. Itwas fraught with such danger that it might be necessary in the nearfuture to induce these Governments to participate fully in the attemptswhich were being made to reach an acceptable settlement by negotiation.
The Minister of Defence said that the Arab League force couldnot be relied on to hold up an Iraqi attack on Kuwait for anyworthwhile period; and it was- therefore desirable that theCommander-in-Chief, Middle East; should be able to respond to a request for military help&apos; from- the Amir of Kuwait as quickly aspossible. If&quot; the COmmander-in-Chief, Middle East, had to obtainpolitical authority from london before-he&apos; could initiate operations,this might entail a delay which would preclude the possibility ofengaging Iraqi ground forces before they-came, into contact with theArab League force, when it would be difficult to distinguish them fromthe air. Any delay might,moreover be increased because of theliability, of communications, from the Persian Gulf to interruptionfrom electric storms,. He therefore proposed.that the Commander-in-Ghief, Middle East,. should be,authorised,, without further referenceto London, to undertake limited military action if he were satisfiedthat the. Amir had made a formal request:for military help and thatIraqi forces,had crossed; the: frontier or, attacked targets in Kuwaitfrom the air, and provided that the Political Resident, Persian Gulf,agreed that the Amir&apos;s request should be met. This authority wouldprovide mainly for air action against Iraqi ground and air forces in and over Kuwait but including hot pursuit of Iraqi aircraft to a distance of 15 miles inside Iraq, for the deployment in Kuwait of forces for this purpose and to activate the stockpile there, and for air reconnaissance-into&apos;-Iraq limited to-high altitude flights not beyond:Basra.In discussion it was suggested that the authority to be given tothe commander-inrGhief, Middle&apos;East,,should:notbe mandatory, butthat he should:be:able to take, into, account whether the. action he haddiscretion to take would, be sound.from a,military point of view. Itwas also important that the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, shouldnot initiate the action for which he had authority except as part of ageneral operation to intervene in Kuwait to prevent its seizure by military aggression. The Cabinet were agreed&apos; that, provided the directive were revised to take account of these points, the proposedauthority should be given to the Commander-in-Chief, Middle East.The, Lord. Privy Seal said that officials had come to the conclusionthat, at any rate for, some time ahead, there was no practicable alternative to military measures as the. means- most likely to safeguard the independence of Kuwait and thereby to. protect our economic andpolitical interests there and in the Persian Gulf. If. this view were accepted, it would be necessary to consider how comprehensive our military dispositions in the area -should1 be. In order to be able to reinforce Kuwait, within 36 hours, it would be necessary to plan formilitary dispositions which,.ih.the short.term, would, necessitate theconstruction as soon as possible&apos; of additional air-conditionedaccommodation in Bahrain at-a cost of about  500,000 and, in the longer term,, raised1 the question of: re-providing, the Kenya base in aden or elsewhere in the Persian Gulf. In view of the expenditure which this would, entail; and having regard, to the politicaluncertainties of the situation in the Middle East, it would be desirable for- the longer-term aspects of this problem to- be considered by ministers in their examination of the future defence programme asa whole. But construction of the additional accommodation inBahrain would in any case be justified in order to provide a reasonablemilitary insurance against- Kuwait being over-run by Iraq within, say,the next year.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to revise the draft directiveto the. Commander-in-Chief, Middle East, in Annex B ofC. (61) 145, to take account of the points made in their discussion, and to submit it to the Prime Minister forhis approval.(2) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 8 of C. (61) 140.
&amp;   -&apos;, v . .  C.C. 53 (61)Methane Gas 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C. (61) 144) about a proposal by the Gas Council to importmethane gas in liquefied form from French North Africa.The Minister of Power said that the Gas Council wished to enterinto a 15-year agreement with British Methane for the delivery ofliquefied methane to Canvey Island. The Council itself had an interest in British Methane and the remaining interests were held by&quot; Conch &quot;, an association of Shell and an American company. BritishMethane would in turn enter into an agreement with the Frenchinterests concerned who would be responsible for supplying the gasin liquid form at an establishment near Oran; and two tankers wouldbe built by private interests in this country for long-term charter toBritish Methane.Experiments which had been made in bringing liquefied methanefrom the United States, although on a smaller scale than the present proposal, indicated that the project would be safe and feasible. Theadditional amount of foreign exchange involved by the proposal would not be large a matter of  4 millions&apos;. Some additional capital investment would also be required in this country over the period from 1962 to 1970, but the return on the investment would be goodeven on the worst assumptions. While there were risks in relying on supplies from areas as unstable as the Sahara and Oran, thedevelopment of underground storage in this country would make it possible to store large quantities of methane against a temporaryinterruption of supplies and, in the last resort, supplies could beobtained from other parts of the world. The Gas Council should be encouraged to avoid dependence on coal and oil as their only sources of gas. Approval of the proposal would be in accord with the government&apos;s general policy of encouraging the nationalised industries to improve their efficiency and the return on their capital and investment, and it would stimulate competition between thevarious kinds of energy, which would be of benefit to consumers.In discussion there was general agreement that the proposal ifIt could be carried out satisfactorily, would help to achieve the government&apos;s general objectives for the nationalised industries. Itwould improve the competitiveness of the economy, revitalise the gas industry and offer greater employment opportunities through thedevelopment of new technologies. The building in British shipyardsof two tankers to carry the methane would be valuable for the shipping and shipbuilding industries and would open up prospects of further orders in a new field. Considerable misgivings were, however, feltabout the substantial risks involved in dependence on unstable partsof the world and about the effect of the proposal on the coal industry.The Chairman of the National Coal Board felt that approval at thisstage might prejudice further action on the Lurgi project, and had asked that a decision should be deferred for some months until thecost of large-scale production of gas from coal by the Lurgi processhad been worked out.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The Lurgi and methane projects were not alternatives but were, to some extent, complementary to one another. Even after allowing for imports of methane, the growth in the demand for gaswould leave room for at least one large Lurgi plant in addition to thetwo smaller plants already in existence. Moreover, the grid whichwould have to be constructed for gas produced from methane wouldbe available for Lurgi gas, if that process proved to be economic; andmethane would itself be a suitable enricher for Lurgi gas.(b) Although it was hoped to produce gas from methane at 8Jd.a therm compared with the current cost of 13Jd. a therm, it was not entirely clear how far the Gas Council would be able to reduce theprice of gas; if they could not secure reductions the prospect of
Wages Policy 7.   The Minister of Labour recalled that, at their previousWages meeting,  the  Cabinet  had  invited  him  to  consider  whetherCouncils 1st December would be the most satisfactory operative date for the(Previous.       wage increases proposed to him by the four Wages Councils which reference:      could claim that commitments had been entered into before 25th July.,CC. (61) 52nd On further consideration he had felt that to select 1st December would conclusions,    lay the Government open to charges that,they were weakening in minute 7)       their resolve to maintain the policy of the wages pause.   after consulting the Prime Minister and the Chancellor of the Exchequerhe had come to the conclusion that, on. balance, the best date to choose would be 1st January and he proposed to make anannouncement to that effect on 9th October.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Uganda 8    The Colonial Secretary said that a fair measure of success(Previous had now been achieved in the Uganda Constitutional Conference,Reference: which was expected to complete its work on 9th October.   TheCC. (61) 52nd Democratic Party led by Mr. Kiwanuka, the Chief Minister, would conclusions, oppose the arrangements proposed for the representation of the minute 5) Baganda in the central legislature, but the Baganda delegation hadbeen persuaded to take an effective part in the conference.Europe 9.   The Lord Privy Seal informed the Cabinet of the general line(Previous he proposed to follow in making his opening statement on reference: 10th October to the European Economic Community (E.E.C.)   HeCC. (61) 44th did not propose to present the representatives of the e.c. with a JnS&apos;    So/Wl statement of the United Kingdom position, but those partsmime i;      of hls speech which were of particular interest to commonwealth governments and to the members of the European Free trade association (EFTA) would be summarised and made available toexpanding the share of the energy market taken by gas would beremote. A substantial working capital would be required for thenew process in addition to the new capital investment. It would therefore be valuable to have estimates of the comparative cost of producing from coal, oil and methane the additional quantities of gasrequired by the industry.(c) In view of recent experience of difficulties created for ship-owners by the unfavourable charter terms obtainable, it would bedesirable to know before any commitment was undertaken whatcharter terms were proposed and whether private capital could beexpected to be available for the construction of the tankers.(d) If the proposal were approved, the timing of the necessarycapital investment and the date on which an announcement mightbe made should be discussed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(e) If it were decided not to approve the proposal, it wouldprobably be necessary to give the Gas Council a detailed account ofthe reasons, since the Council were convinced that, in principle, their proposals were fully in accord with the Governmenfs policy.The Cabinet Agreed to resume, at a later meeting, their consideration ofthe proposal in C. (61) 144.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th October, 1961.their representatives afterwards. The content of the speech wouldbe based on the conclusions reached in Ministerial discussions andthe important sections of it would be cleared in detail with theMinisters directly concerned.He proposed to begin his speech by describing the spirit in whichthe application for membership was being made. He would say thatthe aims and objectives of the Treaty of Rome were accepted by theGovernment, though naturally the Government would want to haveexplanations of how the Treaty worked in detail and also explanationsof decisions taken by the Community. He would then deal in some detail with the three major matters the Commonwealth, agricultureand EFTA for which satisfactory arrangements would have to besecured if the United Kingdom were to join the Community. Finally,he would make some procedural suggestions, including the proposal that negotiations should begin in mid-November after the members ofthe Community had had an opportunity to study the statement.The Cabinet (1) Approved the general line which the Lord Privy Sealproposed to take in his statement to the european economic Community on 10th October.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate a precis of his speechfor the information of the Cabinet in due course.
