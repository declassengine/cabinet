CC. 24 (61)Parliament 1.   The Home Secretary said that, in accordance with the succession      Cabinef s decision on the previous day, he had informed the Leaderto Peerages     of the Opposition of the Governmenfs intention to move for the(Previous       appointment of a Joint Select Committee on the composition and reference:      membership of the House of Lords.

The Home Secretary was, however, in aposition to say that he had made it clear some days before the motion for the writ that, if there were to be any enquiry into the membership of the House of Lords, it must, in the Governmenfs view, be on amuch broader basis than the immediate issues raised by the case ofLord Stansgate (Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn).The Leader of the Opposition was now proposing that, if LordStansgate secured the majority of the votes in the by-election, a petition should not be presented against the validity of his election and his position should remain undetermined at least until after theJoint Select Committee had reported. The presentation of a petitionwas not, however, a matter for the Government: it could be presented by the Conservative Party candidate at the election or by any of theelectors. Moreover, it was likely to be at least a year before theJoint Select Committee had completed its work and any consequentlegislation had been passed and, since it would be indefensible toleave the constituency unrepresented for so long a time, theGovernment should give no encouragement to this proposal.In the circumstances the Home Secretary proposed to make astatement and move for the appointment of a Joint Select Committeeon the lines already agreed by the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the HomeSecretary.Algeria(previous reference:CC. (61) 23 rdConclusions,Minute 1)2. The Cabinet were informed of a rumour that, following the collapse of the revolt in Algeria, some or all of the dissidentFrench generals were on the way to Gibraltar. This was inherentlyimprobable but, if they did land at Gibraltar, arrangements had beenmade for the Governor to prevent their departure until he receivedfurther instructions. Meanwhile, the legal possibility of extraditingthe French generals from Gibraltar was being urgently considered.WashingtonTalksEurope(previous reference:CC. (61) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4)*3. The Cabinet had before them the records (C. (61) 54 and 55)of the Prime Ministers meetings with President Kennedy in washington and with Canadian Ministers in Ottawa during his recent visit to North America. They resumed their discussion of the politicaland economic relations between the United Kingdom and Europe.The Prime Minister said that the time had not yet come to takea final decision.on the question whether the United Kingdom shouldaccede to the Treaty of Rome. Many important aspects of this problem would have to be further considered in detail, and fullconsultations would have to be held with our partners in theCommonwealth  and  in the European  Free Trade AssociationPreviously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
(E.F.T.A.). The question to which the Cabinet should addressthemselves at this stage was whether it was to our advantage to work towards a solution by which the United Kingdom (preferably withsome of her partners in E.F.T.A.) would join with the countries ofthe Common Market in forming a wider political and economic association in Europe, The question for discussion now was whether,on a balance of advantage, it was in our interests to try to bring this about.The following is a summary of the main points made in theCabinet&apos;s discussion:(a) The countries of the Common Market, if left to developalone under French leadership, would grow into a separate politicalforce in Europe. Initially this would tend to have a disruptive effectwithin the Western Alliance. Eventually it might mean that the Sixwould come to exercise greater influence than the United Kingdom,both with the United States and possibly with some of the independent countries of the Commonwealth. This development was therefore a threat to the political position of the United Kingdom as a worldPower. It would be consistent with our traditional policy to seek toprevent the concentration of undue strength in a single political uniton the continent of Europe. Politically, our interests would be betterserved by working for a wider European association in which we couldplay a prominent part.(b) The Common Market also represented a serious economicthreat to the United Kingdom. The countries of the Six, with a population of 160 millions, would together constitute a marketcomparable in size to the United States; and, under modern conditionsof industrial production, this must lead to a great increase in theefficiency and productivity of industries within the area. The largerindustrial units which were already being formed in the countries ofthe Six would be in a stronger position by reason, not only of their size, but of the degree of standardisation which could be developedwithin the area to compete successfully with British industry in theexport markets of the world; and this would be even more damaging to our interests than our exclusion from the European market itself.Moreover, as the economic strength of the Common Market grew,other European countries would be attracted to it and, against itsattractions, we should find it difficult to hold E.F.T.A. together.If, therefore, we stood aloof from the Six, we should find ourselves in a position of growing economic weakness.(c) Hitherto we had been thinking in terms of an economicsettlement between the Six and the Seven. It was now apparent thatthis alone would be neither practicable nor sufficient. A solution was needed which would prevent political, as well as economic, division in Europe. Moreover, the United States Government would not lendtheir support to a purely economic settlement: their main concernwas to prevent the Six from developing as a separate political forcein Europe. In these circumstances a political initiative was required.Our economic objectives could not be attained unless we could finda means by which we, together with some cf our E.F.T.A. partners,could join the- political institutions of the Treaty of Rome.(d) Public opinion in this country had in the past beenpreoccupied with the difficulties and dangers of a closer association with Europe. Recently its advantages had been more clearly seen.Manv of the leaders of British industry were in favour of our joining the Six: indeed, there was now some risk that the difficulties wouldbe under-estimated. In political circles also informed opinion wasmoving in the same direction. On the other hand it must beremembered that a great weight of sentiment could easily be arousedagainst any policy which could be represented as a threat to theCommonwealth and to British agriculture. In the conservative party, in particular, this could evoke strong emotional reactionscomparable to those which had recently arisen over Colonial policy.
C.C. 24 (61)(e) In respect of our relations with other commonwealth countries a number of difficult questions would need to be considered.Thus, if we acceded to the Treaty of Rome, could we secure acceptablederogations in respect of Commonwealth preference and free entry?Would it be possible to assess, before entering into detailed negotiations, the nature of the derogations which we were likely tosecure on these and other matters? Should we have to forgo our right to make trade agreements with other Commonwealth countries?Would they have to forgo their right of free access to the Londonmoney market? If we joined the Six, would European interestscome eventually to weigh more with us than Commonwealth interestsin formulating our general political and economic policies? Finally,we were under obligation to consult fully with other commonwealth governments on this question, and the timing and the method ofsuch consultation would need careful thought.(/) The Home Secretary recalled that, at their meeting on13th July, 1960, the Cabinet had agreed that there were insuperable difficulties in the way of our accepting membership of the Six underthe existing provisions of the Treaty of Rome. The Cabinet had then particularly in mind the difficulties in respect of theCommonwealth. But there were other difficulties too. In the cabinet&apos;s last discussion on 20th April reference had been made tothe surrender of national sovereignty which would be involved; andthis point would certainly require careful thought in the light of reports by officials which were coming forward for consideration by ministers. The Cabinet must also weigh the likely reactions ofBritish farmers. The National Farmers&apos; Unions had now published a pamphlet which came out strongly against association with the Six;and the Government had themselves undertaken that they would notalter the existing system of&quot; support for agriculture during the present parliament. In the discussion on 20th April the Minister ofAgriculture had indicated the general lines on which the existing system might be adapted: and it was possible that a new policy on those lines might, at the cost of some increase in the cost of living,protect the interest of arable farmers. So far, however, nothing hadbeen suggested which would provide similar safeguards for horticulture or for the producers of pigs or eggs. Much further thought would need to be given to the agricultural aspects of this problem. The Government would be in very grave political difficultiesif they could be represented as having broken their pledges to the farmers.ig) The Minister of Agriculture said that the pamphlet published by the National Farmers&apos; Unions was concerned with the results which would follow if the United Kingdom joined the Six withoutany derogations in respect of agriculture. The Government werenot contemplating such a course; and he fully agreed that they must avoid putting forward any new policy proposals whiv.h would exposethem to the charge of having broken their pledges to the farmers.In general, the alternative policy which he had outlined would havethe effect of transferring from the Exchequer to the consumer someof the financial burden of supporting British agriculture. This wouldnot in itself be a betrayal of the farmers. It was true, however, thatdifficult problems would arise on particular commodities and these were now under examination. A wider common market in Europemust inevitably mean some changes in the pattern of agriculture, both here and in other countries; but it need not necessarily mean any reduction in the net income of British farmers.(h) The Minister of Education asked whether the countries ofthe Six would be content with changes in our agricultural policy which,while varying the pattern of our production, left the net income ofBritish farmers unchanged. Would they not expect that, in return for
taking more manufactured goods from the United Kin theywould have opportunities for increased exports of foodstuffs to thiscountry?The Minister of Agriculture said that our existing system ofagricultural support, because it reduced the price of food to theconsumer, resulted in a lower level of wages. It was primarily forthat reason that the countries of the Six would expect us to adopta different system. It did not follow, however, that the net income of British farmers need be substantially reduced.(i) The Minister of Labour said that he agreed with the view,expressed by the Minister of Agriculture in the discussion on20th April, that in the long run British agriculture was likely to suffermore severely if we stood outside the Common Market than if wejoined it. He also agreed that the balance of logical argument lay onthe side of joining the Six, with suitable safeguards for agriculture.But the political difficulties of this course should not be under-estimated. British farmers were content with the present system of support, which insulated them from the effect of world prices; andthey would be reluctant to consider an alternative system which lackedthat obvious attraction. Moreover, though it should be possible to devise safeguards for most commodities, there would be some forwhich it would not be possible to provide protection. Horticulture,in particular, was bound to suffer serious damage. The politicalpressures from areas specialising in these commodities would be very severe.(/) The Lord Privy Seal said that the French Government had indicated that they were willing to discuss with us how we couldjoin the Common market, or enter into a special association with it,so long as we were ready to make some concessions on commonwealth trade and on British agriculture. They had made it plain that, whileit was open to us to consider either course, they would greatly prefermembership to association. Hitherto, we had not been able to tell the French how far we were prepared to go, either on commonwealth trade or on agriculture. If we could disclose to the French the sort of conditions which the Cabinet were now considering it was possiblethat further progress could be made in negotiation. Even so, it was doubtful whether it would be expedient for us to declare at the outset that we were prepared to accede to the Treaty of Rome before wehad negotiated the necessary derogations. Such a declaration wouldinvolve us in political difficulties in this country: it would also leave us less room for manoeuvre in negotiation. It would be preferable to make further progress with the detailed negotiation of the necessaryderogations before taking any final decision. The obligations whichwe had undertaken to consult with our partners in the commonwealth and in E.F.T.A. were a further reason for preferring that course.It was evident that we could not accede to the Treaty of Rome without some economic damage, at least in the short term both to this countryand to other countries of the Commonwealth; and, before a finaldecision was taken, the Cabinet should have before them a statement showing the balance of advantage and disadvantage in the courseultimately proposed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thisquestion must be viewed in the wider context of the East-Weststruggle. In this the Communist bloc were gaining ground and theWestern countries were in some disarray. It was an article of communist faith that capitalism would in the end destroy itself;and, given competing currencies and conflicting trade interests, therewas a real risk of a growing economic weakness in the Western worldunless its countries could find means of drawing more closely together.For some time after the war, in her years of political and economicweakness, Europe had been dependent on American aid and content to accept Anglo-Saxon leadership.   Europe had now regained her
strength, and a new situation had arisen. Different means must nowbe found for binding Europe within the wider Atlantic Community.The United Kingdom, as the bridge between Europe and north america, had the opportunity to take an initiative in this. We couldof course decline that responsibility. It would be easy for us to putforward, as excuses, the need for preserving our special relations withother Commonwealth countries and protecting the interests of british agriculture. But, if we decided to stand aloof from inner Europe atthis time, might we not find that the eventual damage to our interests would be even greater in terms of the secular struggle between Eastand West? We should not forget that in this struggle half of our commonwealth partners and half of our partners in E.F.T.A. wereneutral. Moreover, as the economic strength of the Six increased,other members of E.F.T.A. would certainly be under strong temptation to join it; and, to the extent that this happened, the economic positionof the United Kingdom would be progressively undermined. the older members of the Commonwealth, though they would stand with us now, might then be obliged to turn increasingly towards the UnitedStates; and new world groupings would arise, as a result of whichthe United Kingdom would lose much of her influence in world affairs.These considerations suggested that, on a balance of advantage, itwas in our interest to join the political and economic association ofthe Six if we could gain admission on terms which would be tolerableto us. A political initiative would be necessary, and France was certainly the key to the situation. Hitherto, General de Gaulle hadnot wished us to join the Six presumably because he wanted france to retain the leadership of inner Europe. But his attitude might be changed if he could be brought to see that the West as a whole couldnot prevail against the Communists unless its leading countries workedtogether towards a wider unity in the free world as a whole.The Prime Minister said that at the present time France was,in more respects than one, a main obstacle in the way of creating a closer unity in the West. This had been a main theme in his recent discussions in Washington. He believed that he had persuadedPresident Kennedy that, if the free world was to present a united front to the Communists, General de Gaulle must be brought to seethat France must co-operate more fully and effectively with herWestern partners. First, she must take her full share of responsibilitywithin the North Atlantic Alliance and accept its principle ofinterdependence. Secondly, if she was determined to continue with her nuclear programme, she must aim, not so much to create anindependent national force, as to make a contribution to the strengthof the Western deterrent as a whole, which should increasingly beregarded as held in trust on behalf of the free world as a whole.Thirdly, she must make it possible for the United Kingdom and someof the other members of E.F.T.A. to join with the Six in creating a wider political and economic association in Europe, if, in all thesematters, she were willing to work for Western unity, she could takeher rightful place with the United States and the United Kingdom as one of the pillars of the Western Alliance and thus earn the rightto participate in the system of tripartite consultation which general de Gaulle demanded.The Prime Minister said that he hoped that President Kennedywould speak to General de Gaulle along these general lines in thecourse of his forthcoming visit to Paris. If so, we should be able to judge, in the light of the GeneraPs response, whether there was abasis for seeking wider political and economic association in Europe.If General de Gaulle was willing to consider this problem in the wider framework of the world situation, it should be possible tofind a solution of the special economic difficulties which the UnitedKingdom Government would find in acceding to the Treaty of Romeas -it now stood.
The conclusion reached by the Cabinet, in the light of this discussion and the earlier discussion on 20th April, was that the rightpolicy for the Government to follow at this stage was to work for asolution by which the United Kingdom (preferably with some of herpartners in E.F.T.A.) would join with the countries of the Six informing a wider political and economic association in Europe. Itwould be necessary, in negotiations with those countries, to securespecial arrangements to preserve the main trading interests of theCommonwealth; a satisfactory relation with other members ofE.F.TA.; and special provisions for British agriculture to enable itto be brought into harmony with the general agricultural policy ofthe Six on a basis adequate to support the interests dependent on it.If, however, these points could be covered satisfactorily, either in a protocol to the Treaty or otherwise, there seemed to be no reason ofprinciple why the United Kingdom should not accede to the Treatyof Rome, including its political institutions.The Cabinet (1) Took note that, in the course of his visit to Paris, president kennedy might be able to ascertain whether the FrenchGovernment were willing to co-operate more fully withtheir Western Allies on the general lines indicated by thePrime Minister in summing up the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Agreed that, if President Kennedy&apos;s approach elicited afavourable response from General de Gaulle, the UnitedKingdom should be ready to enter into further negotiationswith a view to finding means by which the UnitedKingdom, together with some of her partners in E.F.T.A.,could join with the countries of the Common Market informing a wider political and economic association inEurope.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th April, 1961.
