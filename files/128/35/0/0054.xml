C.C 54 (61)investment programme.(previous reference:C.C. (61) 46thConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor af the Exchequer (C. (61) 151) covering a draft white paper on Civil Public Investment in 1962-63.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that the draft white paper was based upon the Cabinet&apos;s decisions of 1st August. Itshowed an approved total expenditure on public investment for1962-63 of  1,845 million, some  90 million more than the forecastout-turn for 1961-62 and  200 million more than the estimated out-turn for 1960-61. The increase in the proposed expenditure for1962-63 would have been much greater but for the action taken bythe Government to hold back the rate of progress of a number of programmes as part of the series of measures taken in July to relieve the pressure of internal demand and to increase the long-termstrength of the economy. Subject to any amendments which mightbe required in consequence of a decision on the importation ofmethane gas, and to any minor amendments which might be foundnecessary before final printing, he invited the Cabinet to agree that the White Paper should be presented to Parliament and published.The Cabinet Approved the draft of the White Paper attached toC. (61) 151, and invited the Chancellor of the exchequer to arrange for its presentation to Parliament.Methane Gas.(previous reference:C.C. (61) 53rdConclusions.Minute 6.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Minister of Power (C. (61) 144) about a proposal by the gas council to import liquefied methane gas from French North Africa.The Minister of Power said that he wished to correct astatement he had made in the Cabinet&apos;s earlier discussion. If it were decided not to approve this proposal, he would not be under a formalobligation to send to the Gas Council a written statement of his reasons for withholding approval. There was, however, no doubtthat he would be obliged to give his reasons to Parliament.In discussion special attention was drawn to the risk ofdepending for supplies of methane on such a politically unstable area as Algeria and the Sahara. Although transport costs would be greater, it might be preferable to draw supplies from other areas,e.g.. Nigeria. The net foreign exchange cost of the project was estimated at  4 million a year and might rise further. The cabinet should be fully satisfied of the long-term benefits of the project tothe national economy before committing themselves to increased expenditure on imports at a time when reductions in other overseaexpenditure were being enforced. The proposal also involved capitalexpenditure of  10 million on tankers ar.ii  19 million oninstallations, and there might be better ways of investing such large sums in order to improve the economy. In addition, it was desirablethat due weight should be given to the advice of the Chairman of theNational Coal Board, who had asked that a decision should be deferred for some months.On the other hand, it was argued that against the net foreign exchange cost of  4 million a year there would be an annual saving of some  7 million on domestic production costs. This could be ofgreat importance for some industries. e.g.. steel production.Moreover, the estimate of foreign exchange cost assumed that all the oil products displaced by methane would be produced from Britishrefineries This put the cost in its worst tight. If we had to importmore refined oil products the additional foreign exchange cost of themethane ought to be reckoned at less than   I million a year.(lOON)b 1
Trade UnionElections.(previous reference:CC. (61) 41stConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (C. (61) 146) reporting the results of his further discussions with representatives of the Trades Union Congress onthe conduct of trade union elections.The Minister of Labour said that it was clear, from these further discussions, that the trade unions would be strongly opposed to any legislation for the regulation of their elections. The Trades UnionCongress had taken firm action against the Electrical Trades Union,and it was possible that the current elections in that union mighthave the effect of breaking the Communist hold over its Executive.If so, there might be a good case for leaving the future to thevigilance of the trade union movement especially if the TradesUnion Congress would give an assurance that they and theirconstituent unions would be more active in future in preventingabuses of election procedures. On the other hand, there were strong feelings on this subject in the Conservative Party; and, unless the queen\s Speech included some reference to it. a hostile amendmentmight be moved by Government supporters in the Debate on the address. He therefore suggested that some words should be includedin The Qucen&apos;s Speech which would imply that the Governmentwould be ready to introduce legislation on this subject in theforthcoming session of Parliament if at a later stage this seemedexpedient. On further reflection, however, he considered that it was unnecessary to use so specific a formula as that suggested inparagraph 5 of C. (61) 146: it should suffice to say in the speech that &quot;the Government were &quot;considering, in consultation with theTrades Union Congress, the problems raised by breaches of tradeunion rules &quot;.In discussion it was argued that, in view of the action whichthe Trades Union Congress had taken against the Electrical TradesUnion, it was now less necessary to contemplate general legislation on this subject. It would also be inexpedient to antagonise tradeunion opinion by introducing such legislation, at a time when theGovernment were likely to find themselves at issue with tne tradeunions over wages policy and other questions of great importanceto the national economy. In these circumstances it would be preferable that no reference to this subject should be included inThe Queens Speech.The Cabinet-Agreed that The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament should not include any reference to the conductof triide union electionsMoreover, the proposal would accord with the Governments generalpolicy of encouraging the nationalised industries to improve their efficiency and the return on their capital.The Prime Minister said that the Government should not lightlyapprove a scheme which would cost foreign exchange at a time whenthey were seeking every economy in Government expenditure overseas. He suggested that a small Committee of Ministers underthe Chairmanship of the Home Secretary should consider thearguments for and against the proposal.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for asmall Committee of Ministers, under the Home Secretary&apos;chairmanship, to give further consideration to thearguments for and against the importation of liquefiedmethane gas and to report their conclusions to the Cabinet.
The Queca&apos;sSpeech on theProrogationof Parliament.(previous reference:CC. (61) 52ndConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home Secretary(C. (61) 148) covering a draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the prorogation of Parliament.The Home Secretary said that the draft had been prepared bythe Committee on The Queen&apos;s Speeches in consultation with theDepartmental Ministers concerned. It was a little longer than the prorogation Speech of 1960.In discussion it was suggested that the list of visits from Headsof States during the past year should be re-examined to ensure that none had been overlooked. Various amendments of wording were also approved.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to put before the Prime Ministerfor submission to The Queen a revised draft of the prorogation Speech taking account of the amendmentsapproved in the Cabinefs discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th October. 1961.
