The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.2. The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the course of his recent visit to Salisbury he had reached agreement with the PrimeMinister of Southern Rhodesia, Sir Edgar Whitehead, on the final form of the constitutional proposals for that territory. The revisedconstitution would provide for the termination of the present reserve powers of the United Kingdom Government and for the substitution of other safeguards to protect the African population. These wouldbe entrenched in the new constitution and would include a declarationof rights and the establishment of a constitutional council to advisewhether any proposed legislation would be discriminatory. these arrangements would in fact be acceptable to African opinion,although African representatives were unwilling to admit this andhad declined to express their views on the constitutional proposals.There would be strong African criticism of the proposals relating toland tenure, but in present circumstances it would not be in the best interests of the Africans that the present restrictions on land holdingshould be abolished. It was of crucial importance to the future ofthe Federation that the constitutional proposals for SouthernRhodesia should be approved at the referendum which was likely tobe held in the latter part of July.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had also been concerned, during his recent visit, to try to lessen the differences between the Governments of the United Kingdom and of theFederation on the course of constitutional development in northern rhodesia. The Governor of Northern Rhodesia had suggestedcertain modifications of the original proposals which went some way towards meeting the apprehensions of the Prime Minister of theFederation, Sir Roy Welensky. While it had not been possible toreach agreement, it now seemed that Sir Roy Welensky had given up his plan to hold a General Election in order to obtain a fresh vote of confidence from the electorate, and the Governor would now try to secure the acquiescence of the other political Parties in northern rhodesia to the proposals which he had put forward. There wastherefore some hope that a compromise solution might be foundwhich, while it would not be acceptable to any of the Parties inNorthern Rhodesia, might be imposed without provoking a crisis.3. The Minister of Education said that the executive of theNational Union of Teachers (N.U.T.) had now decided to recommend the rejection of.the agreement reached in the Burnham Committeefor an increase of 16  per cent, as from 1st January, 1962, in the pay of teachers in England and Wales. It was probable, though not certain, that this recommendation would be endorsed by a conferenceof the Union on 17th June, and in that event the whole question was likely to be referred to him. The teachers had not appreciated thegenerous nature of the Burnham agreement and the Minister wouldhave liked to urge the local authorities to make a more adequatepresentation of their case. He could not, however, approach them on this basis without implying that the Government would beprepared to approve an increase of 161 per cent, in England andWales.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, if an early decision were taken not to concede an increase of more than 14 per cent, forthe English teachers, he could refuse to concede a similar increase forScotland from a date earlier than 1st October. If, however, theGovernment decided to approve 16i per cent, for England and Wales,
BritishSugarCorporation(previous reference:C.C. (61) 27thConclusions.Minute 10)4. The Minister of Agriculture said that he had now consulted the institutions holding shares in the British Sugar Corporation aboutthe proposal to reconstruct the Corporation so as to provide for the equity to be held wholly by the Treasury or the Sugar Board and forthe existing ordinary shares to be converted into cumulativepreference shares bearing interest at 8 per cent, instead of 7 per cent.The institutions had not rejected this scheme but had declined toexpress a definite view on it until they knew what the attitude of theprivate shareholders in the Corporation would be. It would not bepossible to obtain the views of the private shareholders generallyexcept by summoning a special meeting at which the Chairman ofthe Corporation could present the reconstruction scheme; but thiswould involve publicity and might encourage an organised minoritygroup of private shareholders to press for the removal of the present restrictions on the Corporation which limited the dividend to 7 percent. The Chairman of the Corporation would therefore prefer totake soundings of the representatives of this group of privateshareholders, and this could be done without committing theGovernment in any way. The alternative would be to leave theposition as it was at present. In that event the reserves of theCorporation would continue to grow unless the incentive agreement were abrogated.he would feel obliged by the decision already announced to allow the 14 per cent, increase for Scottish teachers to operate from 1st July.In discussion it was pointed out that over the period to31st March, 1963, taken as a whole the period for which the currentScottish settlement was to run an increase of 16  per cent, from 1st January, 1962, would give the English teachers materially less thanthe Scottish teachers would receive from a 14 per cent, increasecommencing on 1st July, 1961. This would make it more difficultto resist the demands for even higher increases for the Englishteachers. On the other hand, if the Scottish settlement were to operate from 1st October, 1961, the Government could hardly defend,in the face of threatened strikes by the English teachers, a refusal to concede the same date in England. To this there would be serious objections, both because of the cost and because the English localauthorities were firm in their intention that the new settlement shouldnot come into operation before 1st January, 1962, which was alreadythree months earlier than the end of the period originally contemplated for the current settlement. The date of operation ofthe new Scottish settlement was therefore less important for its costthan for its effect on the English negotiations. For this reason itmight be preferable to defer any announcement in respect of Scotlanduntil after the N.U.T. conference on 17th June, although an earlierannouncement might have the advantages of implying that in theGovevnmenfs view 14 per cent, was the right figure for England andWales as well as for Scotland, and of avoiding any possible accusationof disingenuousness on their part.The Prime Minister said that the Ministers principally concerned should give further consideration, in the light of the latest developments, to the line to be taken on this question both in Englandand Wales and in Scotland. The possibility of improving the negotiating machinery and, in particular, of giving the Governmentincreased control of it was a relevant factor.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister cfEducation and the Minister of Labour, to give furtherconsideration to the amount and timing of increases in the pay of teachers in England and Wales and in Scotland.
m 1SECRET 5C.C. 30 (61)In discussion it was argued that there was no justification forgiving the shareholders an increased return, and that the Governmentcould resist their pressure to obtain some benefit from the increasingvalue of the equity. On the other hand, the present arrangements were an embarrassment and the Government could not hope to escape political criticism if they remained unchanged. On balance,it was the viewof the Cabinet that the Chairman of the corporation should seek the views of the organised group of private shareholderswho were pressing for an increase in the dividend. It was understoodthat he should be able to do this without publicity and without putting the scheme of reconstruction forward as a Government proposal.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Agriculture to authorise theChairman of the British Sugar Corporation to ascertain, in confidence, what view was taken by the representatives ofthe organised minority of shareholders about the proposed scheme of reconstruction.CivilService(previous reference:C.C. (60) 62ndConclusions.Minute 2)UnestablishedService*5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 73) about the extent to whichunestablished service should be taken into account in determining the pension of an established civil servant.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on a number of previous occasions the Government had rejected a claim by the staff side of the National Whitley Council that unestablished service inthe Civil Service between 1919 and 1949 should count in full insteadof one half, as at present in reckoning the lump sum gratuity and pension paid to an established civil servant on retirement and thepensions, but not the lump sum gratuities, of established civil servantswho had already retired. The annual cost of such a concession would be about  7-8 millions in the early years (although it wouldbe  26 millions in the first year if the Government were obliged to concede also an increase in the lump sum gratuities of those alreadyretired) and the total cost would be at least  300 millions over thenext half-century. This would be reduced only marginally by certain concessions proposed by the Staff Side. Apart, however, from thecost, the claim would inevitably have repercussions in the nationalised industries and elsewhere in the public services. On the merits theGovernment should continue to reject the claim, on the ground thatit would be wrong to alter at the expense of the tax-payer theconditions of service voluntarily accepted by unestablished officers on entering the Service. But the claim had attracted strong political support on both sides of the House of Commons and therewas a motion on the Order Paper, signed by nearly 400 Memberscalling on the Government &quot; to authorise discussions to take place onthe Civil Service National Whitley Council with a view to arriving at areasonable settlement of this long-standing problem &quot;. This political pressure might perhaps be diverted if. while declining to concede theprinciple, the Government offered to discuss through the whitley council such minor adjustments as adopting 1945 instead of 1949as the date from which unestablished service might be reckoned infull.The Postmaster-General said that about one-third of the pensioners and serving officers concerned were or had been employedby the General Post Office. The concession would cost the PostOffice . 3- 3A- millions a year, which it would be necessary to pass on* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
washington talks(previous reference:CC. (61) 24thConclusions.Minute 3)president kennedy&apos;visit toLondon*6. The Prime Minister made a report to the Cabinet on thediscussions which he had held with President Kennedy during thelatter&apos;s visit to London on the previous day. For the greater part ofthe time they had met alone; but towards the end of the morning theyhad been joined by the Foreign Secretary and two official advisersfor a discussion on the question of Berlin. The President hadpreferred this type of private discussion, so that he could give a frankaccount of the impressions which he had gained from his talks withGeneral de Gaulle in Paris and with Mr. Khrushchev in Vienna.Mr. Khrushchev, though civil in manner, had maintained astubborn and unyielding attitude on almost all the questions discussed.It was only on Laos that he had shown any readiness to compromise.On Berlin he had been insistent that a solution must be found beforethe end of the year along the lines which he had previously advocated.On nuclear tests he had shown no readiness to reach an agreement and had suggested that this subject should now be absorbed into thediscussions on general disarmament. He had also argued, in relationto disarmament as a whole, that inspection must necessarily be used* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.to their customers. He therefore supported the view that the claim should be rejected.In discussion it was argued that there had, over the pastgeneration, been a substantial change in the attitude of public opinion to entitlement to pension. The principle of not making retrospectivechanges in the terms of service of civil servants had already beenbreached by the Superannuation Act, 1946, which had allowed the reckoning at half-rate of all unestablished service rendered after1st January, 1919; and, although they had made no positiverecommendation, the Priestley Commission on the Civil Service hadrecorded the view that there was no question of principle outstandingand that the sole consideration was that of cost. After the first world War many civil servants had been required to serve long periods before securing establishment and were now living, orexpecting to have to live, on very small pensions.On the other hand, the Government could readily defend a continued refusal to put upon the tax-payer the substantial burdenof giving this wholly uncovenanted benefit to certain civil servants.Moreover, if the claim were conceded, there would be immenselyexpensive-repercussions in many fields of public service and a furtherimpetus would be given to the practice of retrospection which it wasa constant preoccupation of the Government to minimise. these arguments, if carefully presented, were likely to be acceptable toGovernment supporters; and, if that proved to be the case, it wouldbe preferable to refrain from offering to discuss even the minorconcessions mentioned by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, since these would require legislation which would reopen the wholecontroversy.Summing up the discussion, The Prime Minister said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was that the Government shouldcontinue to reject this claim and that, as a preliminary to doing so,the arguments against it should be carefully explained to their supporters in Parliament.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to explain toGovernment supporters in the House of Commons the strong arguments against conceding the claim that allunestablished service should be reckoned in full in determining the pensions of established civil servants.
( ] SECRET 7C.C. 36 (61)for intelligence purposes so long as any armaments existed an argument which, if pressed, would preclude progress with any plan ofprogressive disarmament. The President felt that the members of theWestern Alliance would have to consider very carefully what theirresponse should be to this increasingly intransigent attitude of theSoviet Government.In Paris the President had made little progress towards his aim off knitting France more closely into the Western Alliance. He wouldhave been ready to offer some form of covert tripartite consultation,and some technical assistance in respect of the means of delivery of nuclear weapons (though not in respect of the warheads) if general de Gaulle had shown any readiness to accept more fully theobligations of interdependence. But the General, though preferringto postpone for a time his demands for the reorganisation of theNorth Atlantic Alliance in form because of the impending threatover Berlin, but in fact because his position would be stronger whenthe French Army had been brought back from Algeria was evidentlyreluctant to accept the implications of the Alliance in terms of theinterdependence or integration of national forces. On the questionwhether the United Kingdom could join the Common Market he hadonce again expressed doubt whether we could do so consistently withour economic relations with other Commonwealth countries; but hehad laid even more emphasis on the political difficulties which weshould find in acceding to the Treaty of Rome. From this thePresident had deduced that General de Gaulle had no particular wishto see the United Kingdom join the Six.The impressions which the President had formed from thesevisits to Paris and Vienna would influence him in his review of thepolicy of the Western Alliance in general and of the United StatesGovernment in particular. It seemed likely that one result, at least,would be a closer understanding and co-operation between theGovernments of the United States and the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.Germany(previous reference:C.C. (61) 27thConclusions,Minute 5)*7. The Foreign Secretary said that, at the end of his meeting with President Kennedy in Vienna, Mr. Khrushchev had presentedan aide-memoire defining the position of the Soviet Government inrelation to Berlin. This was a plausible presentation of the Sovietcase for the conclusion of a peace treaty which would regularise theposition of West Berlin. It argued that, if a treaty could not be concluded with a single Germany, separate treaties should be madewith its two separate parts. It proposed that Wost Berlin should become a demilitarised free city: its people should be left to decidetheir own future: its contacts with the outside world should not beobstructed: and its constitution should be safeguarded by tokenforces from the four original occupying Powers, with the addition ofsome forces from neutral countries and a United Nations presence.In discussions with President Kennedy on the previous day it hadbeen recognised that this presentation of the Soviet case, if published,would make a favourable impression on opinion in neutral countries and in the United Nations. It had therefore been agreed that theGovernments of the United States and the United Kingdom should at once review the various negotiating positions which the western powers might take up. if and when international negotiations were opened on the Berlin question.   The United States Government were* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
prepared to take the initiative in this and would subsequently bringthe French Government into consultation. It was not howevercontemplated that any negotiations could be opened until after theGerman elections in the autumn. It was also possible that it might eventually be thought preferable to allow the Soviet Government to conclude a treaty with East Germany in the hope that they wouldrequire the East Germans to continue to allow free access to west berlin. It now appeared that all the Western Powers would be readyto accept a position in which access to West Berlin was controlled bythe East Germans, so long as there was no physical interruption inthe flow of traffic between West Berlin and West Germany.In discussion the view was expressed that a solution on thegeneral lines of the Soviet aide-memoire might not be disadvantageousto the Western Powers. It might at least be preferable to a situationin which we were faced with the choice between accepting ahumiliating diplomatic defeat or initiating military action likely to lead to major war in Europe. On the other hand it was argued thatthe condition of freedom and prosperity in West Berlin was one ofthe few victories which the West had won in the cold war, and thatfor this reason it ought not to be put in jeopardy. It was also pointedout that, though Mr. Khrushchev had been threatening for some timeto conclude a peace treaty with East Germany, he had not done so;and this might mean that it would not be to the advantage of theSoviet Government to resolve the problem in this way.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints raised in discussion.Angola 8.   The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Angola was(Previous       to be the subject of a debate that day in the Security Council on the reference:      basis of a critical resolution sponsored by the Afro-Asian countries.C.C. (61) 23rd   The Portuguese Government were refusing to co-operate with theConclusions,    committee appointed for that purpose by the United Nations and minute 3)       were deferring the announcement of their programme of political,social and economic reforms for Angola until the disturbances in thatcountry had been suppressed.   This attitude would make it difficult for the United States and ourselves to vote against the resolution.At the same time, it was important that the Portuguese Governmentshould not feel that they had lost the sympathy of their allies.   Inthat event the present regime might conceivably be overthrown, and portugal might withdraw from the Western Alliance.   He would therefore continue to urge the Portuguese Government to publishtheir programme of reforms for Angola without delay, and would consider whether we could abstain, at least in part, from voting infavour of a critical resolution in the Security Council.Arrangements had been made some time ago for British militaryforces to take part with Portuguese forces in joint training exercisesin Portugal. There was an obvious danger that these exercises,which were not under the auspices of the North Atlantic Alliance,might be misconstrued by African and Asian countries, including some of our partners in the Commonwealth. On balance, therefore,it might be wise to postpone them, despite the disappointment whichthis would cause to the Portuguese authorities.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Anglo-Portuguese joint military exercisesshould be postponed.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6 th June, 1961.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to explain this decision to thePortuguese Government, and to continue to urge themto publish their programme of reforms for Angola withoutdelay.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would send appropriateinstructions to the United Kingdom representative at theUnited Nations for the forthcoming debate on Angolain the Security Council.(4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, to explain our policy on Angolato other Commonwealth Governments.
