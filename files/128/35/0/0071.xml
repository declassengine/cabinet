We could also advise the portuguese government, as the United States Government were proposing to do,that if their position in Goa came under actual threat of forceit would be open to them to bring the matter before the security council of the United Nations. It was more difficult to deal with therequest for staging facilities.   We should be on strong ground inwithholding such facilities in Gan, since we had never made theseavailable to any allied Power.  On the other hand, if facilities weremade available in Mauritius, there would be local difficulties onaccount of the large Indian population.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, although indian troops were being concentrated in the neighbourhood, it seemed unlikely that the Indian Government had finally determined to launch an armed attack on Goa. It was possible therefore that theycould be dissuaded from extreme measures. There was generalagreement that, while the Portuguese request for military assistancemust be rejected,lmmediate representations should be made to theIndian Government in terms which could be made public if the need arose. If, however, we were to take this line, it would be inexpedient to allow the Portuguese to stage reinforcements through territory under our control; for this might prejudice our main effort to restrain the Indian Government from the use of force.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to inform the PortugueseAmbassador in London that the United KingdomGovernment would be unable to give any military assistance for the defence of Goa against attack by India,but would at once make representations to the indian government with a view to dissuading them fromlaunching such an attack; and to add that, in order to givethose representations a fair chance of success, it would be preferable that aircraft carrying military reinforcements toGoa should not be staged through territory under UnitedKingdom control.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for suitablerepresentations to be made to the Indian Government,through the High Commissioner in Delhi, with a view torestraining them from making an armed attack on Goa.
right to vary the instructions which he had previously given inpursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 5th December, since it was now clear that the Cabinet&apos;s views could be adequately expressed inthe debate, and the voting, on the Soviet resolution and it would nolonger be necessary to table a separate resolution proposing theappointment of a committee to consider the problem of Formosa.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the United kingdom representative at the United Nations had now been instructed to vote against the third paragraph of the Sovietresolution on Chinese representation in the United nations and, in the debate on that paragraph, to place on record theGovernment^ concern about the future representation of formosa in the United Nations.(previous reference:Minute 5)Europe 3.   The Lord Privy Seal said that a further meeting had been heldCommon in Brussels on 8th December with representatives of the european market Economic Community.  The work done by officials since the lastMinisterial-meeting had been reviewed, and two important decisions had been taken on procedure. First, it had been agreed that detailedCC. (61) 65th studies should be made by officials of the social as well as theConclusions. economic implications of applying the common tariff to manufacturedgoods from other Commonwealth countries. Secondly, it had beenagreed that the problems of the less developed countries of theCommonwealth should be studied both on a product-by-product anda country-by-country basis, and that in these studies the prospects of association under Part IV of the Treaty of Rome would not be overlooked. In addition, it had been agreed that the chairman for meetings with the Six should be provided in turn by the various countries, including the United Kingdom, changing every threemonths but not in any prearranged order. This would have theadvantage that we could hope to avoid having to assume thechairmanship at a critical period of the negotiations.As a result of these arrangements it now looked as though weshould be able to get the whole field reviewed in detail before final decisions were taken on any part of it.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.congo republic(previous reference:CC (61) 70thConclusions)4. The Cabinet discussed the tactics for handling the debate onthe Congo which was to be held in the House of Commons on14th December. This debate would normally have been held on the adjournment: but it was agreed that, in the special circumstances which had now arisen, it would be expedient that the vote should betaken on a Government motion. A suitable motion should be tabledthat evening.The Prime Minister said that it must be expected that the debate would range beyond the specific question whether we should providebombs for United Nations aircraft operating in Katanga. that question had brought into the open the anxieties which were widelyfelt about the conduct of the United Nations operations in the Congoand the purposes which they were designed to support. Seriousdoubts were entertained, both about the objectives of the united nations authorities in New York and about their ability to ensurethat these were effectively carried out by United Nations officials onthe spot. The Government would certainly be under pressure, fromtheir supporters in the House of Commons, to make a further attemptsr.CP FT
CC 71 (61)to clarify this situation in the Security Council. There would also besupport for the view that, if we could not secure general approval inthe Security Council for the policy towards the Congo which wefavoured, we should withdraw our support for the operations of theUnited Nations in the Congo.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement and invited himto arrange, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary andthe Leader of the House of Commons, for a government motion to be tabled as a basis for the debate on the Congoin the House of Commons on 14th DecemberPublicExpenditure(previous reference:CC. (61) 46thConclusions.Minute 5)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (61) 199) on the general control of public expenditure.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the Governments policy should be governed by the two undertakings given by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (i) to keep public expenditure within the limitsjustified by national resources, and (ii) to keep the increase inGovernment supply expenditure in 1962-63 to a level of not morethan 2^ per cent, in real terms above the Estimates for 1961-62. Thegrowth of public expenditure had a direct bearing, not only on thelevel of taxation, but on the health and growth of the economy as awhole. If the public services took too large a share of manpower and capital, too small a share would be left to private consumption,private investment and exports. In some sectors of expenditure for example, roads and hospitals long-term policies had alreadybeen drawn up which would contribute to the Governments objectives and the Cabinet would shortly be considering proposals which wouldresult in expenditure being contained in certain other major fields agriculture, education and the services for school meals, school milk and welfare milkr The need for savings was urgent. The forecastEstimates for 1962-63, which had not yet been fully examined,suggested a total of some 1\ per cent, in excess of the Estimates for1961-62 and left no doubt that, in order to fulfil the Chancellorsundertaking, savings of at least  100 million would have to besecured. Towards that amount, minor savings totalling nearly 15 million had been agreed. It was also clear that in addition tothe Supplementary Vote shortly to be presented for  78 million for agriculture in the current year there would be a number of otherSupplementary Votes for smaller amounts.In discussion there was general agreement in the Cabinet that themain object of policy should be to increase the rate growth in thenational economy. There was some division of opinion on the best way of securing this result. On the one hand it was argued that the ratio of public expenditure to private expenditure should not betreated as rigid and that some forms of public expenditure might infact make a better contribution to growth than private expenditure.While no one would dispute that public expenditure could reach a level which would have an adverse effect on the economy, it was arguable whether that level had yet been reached and how, within any given level of public expenditure as a whole, expenditure could best be distributed in order to promote economic growth. Theproblem of controlling wages, salaries and other incomes far out-weighed in importance to the economy the need to limit public expenditure, and cuts in public services would not make it any easier to secure restraint in collective bargaining or acceptance of theGovernment^ proposals for economic planning.
agricultural policy(previous references:CC. (61) 67thConclusions.Minute 8 and cc. (60) 65thConclusions.Minute 3)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (C. (61) 211) on the cost of the Governmentsagricultural support policy.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that Parliament would shortly be asked to approve a Supplementary Vote of  78 million foragricultural support in the current year. This would, in his view, havetwo effects. In the short term it might affect confidence in sterlingunless the Government could show that measures were being takento restrict the level of expenditure on agricultural support in thefollowing year. For the longer term it underlined the need, whetheror not the United Kingdom joined the Common Market, to substitute for the unlimited commitments under the Agriculture Act, 1957, some alternative system which would limit the burden of agricultural support on the Exchequer and pass on some of the cost to theconsumer. His paper proposed that for the short term theGovernment should announce that they would not allow the cost ofagricultural support in 1962-63 to exceed a stated maximum figure,that in the next annual review in February farm prices should befixed at minimum levels, that no further commitments should beaccepted under the Hill Farm and Livestock Rearing schemes andthat no further financial provision should be made for the farm improvement scheme.In discussion the following points were made:[a) It was argued that it would not be possible to set a firm limit for agricultural support in the following year without breach of the pledge given in 1957 that during the lifetime of the present Parliamentsubsidies would not in any given year be reduced by more than2\ per cent, in all or by more than 4 per cent, for any singlecommodity. This pledge must be maintained.(h) The large Supplementary Vote which was now required was wholly due to the collapse of the fatstock market. Beef prices were beginning to recover when a mild spring and a good summer producedan extra million lambs. Before this surplus had been absorbed the danes increased their bacon imports in September. It could beassumed that in a normal year only one sector of the market wouldbe seriously affected; but this year the collapse had been general.Although the increase in meat supplies had amounted to only 2 perIt was emphasised, on the other hand, that the proposals put forward by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, provided for substantialgrowth in public investment over the next three years. departments had proposed investment in public services which in the aggregatewould involve capital expenditure in these years of 15 or 20 per cent,above the present level; and it was thought that an increase of about10 per cent, above the present level could be approved. If, however,increases were allowed along all the channels of public expenditure,there would be a real danger that the private sector would be starvedand that the necessary expansion of exports would in consequence be frustrated. The crucial point was the pace of development, whichcould not continue simultaneously at the maximum for all services.It did not seem possible to escape the conclusion that, if the pace ofdevelopment were faster than the normal on some services,expenditure on others would have to be retarded.The Home Secretary suggested that, in the light of this general discussion, the Cabinet should proceed to consider some of the mainspecific proposals for reducing public expenditure in the year1962-63.The Cabinet Took note of C. (61) 199.
cent, in quantity, this had involved a 14 per cent, drop in the wholesaleprice. It could therefore be made clear that the Supplementary Votewas due entirely to factors over which the Government had no control.(c) Although the scope for short-term savings might be very limited it could not be neglected. Officials should examine urgentlythe possibility of securing economies on the lines suggested by theChief Secretary, Treasury. The main difficulty was the existence ofthe 1957 pledge which prevented or restricted action over most of thefield.(d) While it might be possible to devise means of maintaining thelevel of support to the farmers, within the terms of the 1957 pledge,while passing on a greater proportion of the cost to the consumer, thiswould require legislation, which could not be passed in time to affectthe position in the following year.(e) The changes in agricultural support policy which would be involved if the United Kingdom joined the Common Market were already being studied. It had now been agreed that a parallel studyshould be made of the changes which might be made if we did not join the Common Market in order to relieve the Exchequer of theunlimited liability to which it was exposed by the existing policy. Itwas estimated that these studies would take about 18 months tocomplete. In this context it might be unwise to make adjustments,for short-term purposes, in the Hill Farming and Livestock Rearingand the Farm Improvement schemes. For these limited schemes would not be affected by our entry into the Common Market, andtheir retention would provide some small compensation to farmers ata time when it would be badly needed.(/) There might be advantage in introducing voluntary quotas for meat imports in advance of the compulsory quotas which would follow entry into the Common Market or a fundamental change inthe Government^ agricultural support policy. Here again, however,any benefits would be comparatively long-term. Voluntary quotaswould only be effective in reducing the cost of agricultural support ifthey were associated with a scheme for Government buying tomaintain market prices. This would be in itself a major change ofpolicy and would need working out in detail.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in presenting the supplementary Vote of  78 million for increasedagricultural support in the current year, to explain that theincrease was entirely due to the collapse of the fatstockmarket and to give the reasons for that collapse in some detail.(2) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to indicate, whenpresenting this Supplementary Vote, that the government intended to take a firm line in the next annual review of farm prices; but agreed that he should not commit himself to a stated maximum figure for the level of agricultural support in the year 1962-63.(3) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the Minister ofAgriculture, the President of the Board of Trade and theSecretary of State for Scotland to arrange for officials oftheir Departments to make an immediate review of thepossibility of securing further economies in the cost ofagricultural support in the short term.CX. 71 (61)
