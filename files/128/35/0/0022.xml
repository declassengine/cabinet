Cuba(previous reference:C.C. (60) 39thConclusions,Minute 3)1. The Cabinet were informed that, according to the latest information from Washington, the attempt to overthrow the Castroregime in Cuba had failed. The situation in Cuba was to be discussedthat day in the Political Committee of the United Nations general assembly, where four resolutions had been tabled. We had agreed with the United States Government to vote in favour of a resolutionput forward by a group of Latin American countries recommending that the whole matter be referred to the Organisation of american states. In the House of Commons that afternoon the opposition were likely to try to adjourn the House for discussion of the Cubansituation; but the current proceedings in the United Nations shouldafford sufficient ground for resisting such a motion.South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 20thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Cabinet were informed that the Soviet Government had now given specific assurances, acceptable both to ourselves and tothe United States, on the timing of our proposals for an immediatecessation of the fighting in Laos which, after verification by theInternational Control Commission, would be followed by aconference early in May. It ought therefore to be possible to issue the request for a cease-fire later that day.ParliamentSuccession toPeerages&apos; (previous reference:C.C. (61) 20thConclusions,Minute 1)3. The Home Secretary said that Mr. Anthony wedgwood benn had now been adopted as the Labour candidate in the by-election at Bristol, South-East. The returning officer had no power to reject his nomination. Mr. Wedgwood Benn was likely tosecure a majority of the votes, but it could be assumed that theElection Court would thereafter hold his election to be invalid andthat the Conservative Party candidate would then assume the seat.The Speaker would prevent any attempt by Mr. Wedgwood Benn toenter the House of Commons, but it was for consideration whetherthe Government might not strengthen their position by taking theinitiative in the appointment of some form of enquiry into the issues raised by the present case.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet that this course should be followed. Parliament, and inparticular the House of Lords, would be unlikely to welcome any form of independent enquiry and the most satisfactory course wouldbe to move for the appointment of a Joint Select Committee of bothHouses. The terms of reference should not be limited to the questionwhether and on what conditions hereditary Peerages might berenounced but should be wide enough to include other questions relating to the membership of the House of Lords. They should not,however, extend to the powers and functions of the House of Lords.Tactical advantage could be gained if the Government motionproposing the appointment of a Joint Select Committee were putdown at an early date.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General, to bring before themdraft terms of reference for a Joint Select Committee on questions relating to membership of the House of Lords.59250B 2
-O cWasSiingtonTalks(previous reference:CC. (61) 20thConclusions,Minute 8)Europe*4. The Cabinet had before them notes by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (61) 54 and 55) covering the records of the PrimeMinister^ meetings with President Kennedy in Washington and with canadian Ministers in Ottawa during his recent visit to north america.The Prime Minister said that these discussions had strengthenedhis view that far-reaching decisions would have to be taken soonabout the United Kingdoms relations with Europe. In recent years the Communist bloc had been gaining ground at the expense of theWest and, if this was to be checked, the leading countries of theWestern world would need to draw more closely together. Therewas, however, a risk that current developments in Europe would tend in the opposite direction; for, if the countries of the common market formed a close political association under French leadership,this would create a further political division in Europe and wouldalso have a disruptive influence within the Atlantic Community.This might be averted if the United Kingdom, together with some ofthe Seven, could join the political association of the Six and help tobuild in Europe a stable political structure which would preventFrance now, and Germany later, from attaining too dominant aposition. Difficult economic adjustments would be involved, both for the United Kingdom and for other Commonwealth countries;but it was arguable that both we and the other commonwealth countries would in the long run gain greater economic advantage fromaccess to a wider market in Europe. The Cabinet must now weighall the relevant considerations and determine its future course. Ifthey decided that it was right, on balance, to draw closer to Europe,they would have to consider what economic price might have to bepaid and what were the tactics by which this objective could be attained. Nothing would now be gained by delaying a decision.And, if the decision went in favour of closer union with Europe, thepractical steps to that end would have to be taken before the end ofthe present Parliament.The Prime Minister invited his colleagues to express their general views on this issue.The President of the Board of Trade said that in 1954 we had under-estimated the strength of the forces working for unity betweenthe countries of the Six. The Common Market was now frimly established and, as it developed, our economic interests would be gravely prejudiced if we remained outside it. We should be excluded from one of the largest and most dynamic markets in theworld; and, as time went on, the trade and investment of the UnitedStates would be drawn increasingly towards Europe. It was therefore in the economic interest of the United Kingdom to be associated withthe Six. Our attempt to form a European Free Trade Area had failed largely because the French opposed it. The French wouldalso be reluctant to accept our participation in the Six partly, nodoubt, because they wished to retain its political leadership. Weshould have therefore to fashion a line of approach which the french would find it difficult to resist. For us the main difficulty in joining the Six would be, not the common tariff, but the concept of a singlecommercial policy. From this we should need to obtain somederogation, if our special relations with other commonwealth countries were to be preserved. As regards foodstuffs, the mainburden was more likely to fall on consumers, than on farmers, in thiscountry though British horticulture was bound to suffer. It should however be remembered that the agricultural policy of the Six hadnot yet been finally determined; and, if we joined, we should be ableto influence its formulation. British industry was increasingly aware of the advantages which it would gain from our association with the six.   The other members of the Seven were more apprehensive about* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
the future. Economic association with the Six would present themwith no great difficulties, but for some of them political association would be impossible. A system might perhaps be devised which involved equal economic obligations but differing political obligations.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, if the United Kingdomjoined the Six, awkward adjustments would have to be made in our economic relations with other Commonwealth countries. Canada, asan exporter of manufactured goods, would be seriously affected, andthere would be special difficulties for New Zealand. On the otherhand, it should be possible to devise arrangements for tropicalfoodstuffs which would safeguard Commonwealth interests.Moreover, to the extent that our economy was strengthened by our participation in the Six, this would serve the long-term interests ofother Commonwealth countries. He himself believed that, if westood aloof from the Common Market, we should get the worst ofboth worlds; and that the right course on balance was to go fully into partnership with the Six. If we could take this decision inprinciple, we should be better able to discover by negotiation how farour difficulties could be mitigated and what price we should need topay. We ought then to be able to persuade the other commonwealth countries to acquiesce in that course; but it would be a mistake toget into further consultation with them before a decision of principlehad been taken.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in measuring the effects on British agriculture, it was right to consider, not merely the short-term disadvantages of joining the Common Market, but alsothe long-term results of standing apart from it.   In the countries ofthe Western world surpluses  of agricultural  production wereincreasing, and all our traditional suppliers were expanding their production.   The countries of the Six were now net importers ofagricultural products.   It was true that they were not planning toproduce surpluses: they were planning merely to be self-sufficient.But there was no doubt that improvements in the structure and efficiency of their agriculture would lead inevitably to increased production, and they would ultimately be able to supply all their needs and possibly to produce a surplus.  Then, with our open market, we should be exposed to the surplus production of many countries in the Western world.   Meanwhile, the production ofBritish agriculture would expand; and, as world prices of foodstuffsfell with the greater quantities available, the Exchequer cost ofmaintaining the existing system of support for agriculture in thiscountry might in a decade rise to something like double its present figure.   All this suggested that we should be thinking in terms of moving over to the continental system of supporting agriculture.   Ifthis were the right policy for us, it would make it easier for us tojoin the Six.   But, if we were to do so, we should move in good time,before the agricultural policy of the Six had been finally settled, sothat we could play our full part in influencing it in directionsconvenient to ourselves.   He had arranged for a study to be madeof the effect which the adoption of the continental system ofagricultural support would have on food prices in this country andon the balance of payments.  The effect of such a move on opinion in farming circles should not be under-estimated.   At the time ofthe last General Election, the Government had undertaken that thepresent system of support for agriculture would not be changed in this parliament.   The immediate effects of such a change would also be serious especially in relation to pigs, eggs and horticultural products;Moreover, most farmers were content with the present system andwould be apprehensive of change.   They would have to be convinced and this would not be easy that they would suffer even more serious damage in the long run if we stood aside from the Six.   even so it must be recognised that, if we joined the Six, the net income of
British agriculture would be lower than at present and our trade withother Commonwealth countries would also be reduced. For thecountries of the Six would certainly insist that there should be some increase in our imports of foodstuffs from Europe. Our task wouldbe to ensure that the policies adopted by the Common Market were so designed as to do more economic damage to third countries than to British agriculture and Commonwealth trade. The French andother members of the Six realised that we should have to safeguardsome of our Commonwealth interests. They would expect us to insist on special arrangements in respect of butter from New zealand and wheat from Canada and Australia; and4 if they wanted us to jointhem, there should be no difficulty in working out satisfactory arrangements for temperate foodstuffs for the next seven years or so.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) Political association with the Six might ultimately involve a significant surrender of national sovereignty. Adherence to theTreaty of Rome would limit the supremacy of Parliament, whichwould be required to accept decisions taken by the Council of theCommunity. It would restrict the right of the Executive to maketreaties. It would also involve a final right of appeal from our courts to the Supreme Court of the Community. A major effort of presentation would be needed to persuade the British public to accept these encroachments on national sovereignty.(b) The immediate effects on our relations with other parts ofthe Commonwealth would be serious. Apart from the reactions inother Commonwealth countries whose economic interests would bedamaged, public sentiment about the Commonwealth in this country must also be considered. There was at present a growing recognitionof the part which the Commonwealth could play, as a multi-racialassociation, in the world of to-day. Opposition to this Europeanventure would develop if it were thought that it would undermine the cohesion of the Commonwealth and impair its value as a factorfor preserving world peace.(c) It would not be easy to secure adequate safeguards for commonwealth production of tropical foodstuffs. On this particularpoint we could not look for assistance from the United states administration, who were interested to safeguard the position of our competitors in Latin America.(d) Canada would suffer special economic damage if we joined the Six. There might be advantage in repeating our earlier offer tonegotiate a Free Trade Area with Canada at once.(e) The disadvantages from the point of view of theCommonwealth might be mitigated if our joining the Six could be presented as a necessary measure to draw the countries of the western world more closely together in order that they might be better ableto compete with the rate of economic growth in the Sino-Soviet bloc.From this point of view it would be valuable if&apos; our association withthe Six could be presented as a first step towards a wider assimilationof trading areas on both sides of the Atlantic.(/) Need it necessarily be assumed that, if we joined the common market, the trade in foodstuffs between the United Kingdom and thecountries of the Six would result in a net increase of imports intothis country? British agriculture was, on the whole, more efficientthan that of the Common Market countries, and we ought to be ableto export foodstuffs into those countries.ig) Even so, the political difficulties of justifying this policy in agricultural constituencies would be very great. From that point of.view its presentation would need careful consideration.(h) The special difficulties in respect of agriculture should not beallowed to obscure the undoubted advantages which British industry&apos;would derive from the wider market opened to it by our association;;with the Six. Modern industry needed to operate in a large economic;unit. This was strikingly illustrated by the output per worker in theUnited States and the Soviet Union, which was far greater than that,
in the United Kingdom. British industry could not afford to missthis opportunity of access to the wider market of the Six. If westood aside from this we should fall behind industrially: the common market and the United States would forge ahead and we should be increasingly excluded from our markets overseas. From this pointof view it was gratifying that the new Administration in the UnitedStates were in favour of our joining the Six.The Cabinet  -(1) Agreed to resume their discussion of this problem at ameeting in the following week.Germany In further discussion attention was drawn to the proposal, putforward by Mr. Dean Acheson during the Prime Minister^ meetings in Washington, that if the Western position in Berlin were threatened,a force of two divisions should be sent forward from western germany. A military movement in this strength would surely involvea serious risk of precipitating a major war in Europe. Were theUnited States Administration prepared to accept such a risk?The Prime Minister said that this proposal was linked witha change in the American attitude towards the problem of Berlin.The previous Administration had been unwilling to contemplate thatthe passage of Western convoys into Berlin should be controlled by officials of the East German Government. They had thereforefavoured a plan by which, if the traffic control were transferred to officials of the East German Government, an attempt would be madeto dispense with that control by passing a convoy through to west berlin with a small military escort. The new Administration dislikedthis plan for two reasons. First, they thought it inexpedient to raise a major issue over the technicalities of the traffic control, i.e., by whichofficials the documents were stamped. Secondly, if it became necessary to have recourse to force, they thought it unwise to do soon a token scale. They were therefore disposed to the view that theWestern Allies should not react, by any forceful means, to anytechnical change in the system of traffic control. They took theview that, so long as supplies continued to flow into West Berlin,it was not a matter of any great moment whether the traffic wascontrolled by Russians or by East Germans. They considered thatthe Western Allies need not react unless the flow of supplies, whethermilitary or civil, was interrupted. But they took the view that, once it became clear that the Russians were cutting off supplies from west berlin, the Western Allies must show at once that this was an issueof vital importance to them. They must therefore react by measureswhich would immediately engage the responsibilities of governments on both sides, in order to show the Soviet Government that themaintenance of the Western position in Berlin was of vital importanceto the Western Allies. They did not favour an attempt to supplyBerlin by air. They proposed that, if supplies to Berlin were seriouslyinterrupted, a land force should be sent forward which would be suffiently strong to be able to make its way at any rate to the Elbe.This proposal, which had yet to be discussed with the other AlliedGovernments, had the advantage that, if there was to be aconfrontation over Berlin, it would be based on realities rather thantechnicalities. From that point of view it was a notable advance onthe position taken up by the previous Administration. It also carriedthe implication that the new Administration would be prepared toaccept de facto the existence of an East German Government.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of this statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th April, 1961.
