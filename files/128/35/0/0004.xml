Road Safety(previous reference:C.C. (54) 17thConclusions,Minute 3)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 2) on penalties for motoring offences and on thequestion of drink and driving.The Home Secretary said that a Committee of Ministers underthe chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster haddevised a new penal system for dealing with motoring offences, whichhad been approved by the Home Affairs Committee. Under thissystem, conviction of any of the most serious offences (listed in category A in the Annex to C. (61)2) would, with one exception,involve automatic disqualification from driving for not less than twelve months. For other dangerous offences (category B),disqualification would be at the discretion of the courts. Furthermore,any driver convicted of any offence in either category three timeswithin three years would, on the third conviction, be automaticallydisqualified for six months. This would be additional to anydisqualification imposed by the courts for any of the actual offences committed. The penalties for individual offences had beenrationalised by abolishing, in all appropriate cases, the differentiation between the penalties on first and on subsequent convictions of thesame offence; by raising the level of fines to take account of the changed value of money; and by abolishing imprisonment where it seemed no longer applicable.Discussion showed that there was general agreement withthe principle of the system of &quot; cumulative&quot; disqualification.Considerable misgivings were, however, expressed about the acceptability of the proposal to Parliament and the motoring publicif the range of offences counting towards &quot; cumulative&quot;disqualification were as wide as was proposed. In an extreme casea motorist could be deprived of his livelihood by being disqualifiedfor three comparatively venial offences which were frequentlycommitted by many motorists. The Government must avoid theappearance of wishing to victimise motorists and it would thereforebe preferable to limit the offences in category B to those involvingbad or incompetent driving.On the other hand, there was no question that there wereoffences not involving bad driving which were, nevertheless, a source of serious danger on the roads. To be allowed to use a motor vehiclewas not a universal right but a privilege granted to those who showedthemselves able to do so without endangering others. For those who did not, disqualification was a measure of prevention and the criterionfor including an offence in the proposed new system of &quot; cumulative &quot;disqualifications should be, not that it involved bad driving, but thatit was a form of dangerous behaviour on the roads.Summing up this part of the discussion The Prime Minister saidthat there was clear agreement in the Cabinet that the system of&quot; cumulative &quot; disqualification should be adopted. Whatever formthe Bill took on introduction, the list of offences covered by the new system would be the subject of much criticism and adjustment inParliament. The question was, therefore, whether the central principlecould best be preserved by putting forward a wide range of offencesand accepting some reduction of the list during the passage of theBill, or by proposing initially a more limited range and leaving it toParliament to add other offences to the list. The balance of opinion in the Cabinet appeared to be that the initial list should not be entirely restricted to offences of bad driving, but that at the sametime there should be some reduction in the list proposed by theHome Affairs Committee so that it only included offences which.C. 4 (61)Parliament 1.

clearly involved dangerous behaviour. The content of category Bshould therefore be further considered before the draft Bill was submitted to the Legislation Committee.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the system for dealing with motoringoffences proposed in paragraph 3 of C. (61) 2.(2) Agreed that the offences counting towards &quot;cumulative&quot;disqualification should be restricted to those clearlyinvolving dangerous behaviour.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, inconsultation with the Minister of Transport and the attorney-General, to give further consideration in thelight of Conclusion (2) to the desirability of deleting someof the offences in category B in the Annex to C. (61) 2.(4) Approved the revision of the penalties for individual offences,on the lines proposed in paragraph 7 of C. (61) 2.The Attorney-General pointed out that, under the scheme asput before the Cabinet, a driver would be automatically disqualified on conviction of the first offence of causing death by dangerous driving,while for the first offence of dangerous driving without causing deathdisqualification would be at the discretion of the courts (the onlyexception to the principle of automatic disqualification for an offencein category A). From the point of view of the driver&apos;s culpability,there was no logical distinction between the two offences. Since the degree of culpability might in either case vary widely, and especially since both offences could only be tried by the High Court,disqualification should in both be left to the discretion of the court.Discussion showed it to be the general view of the Cabinet thatconviction on the charge of taking life by the criminal act of drivingdangerously should entail automatic disqualification. Public opinion would demand some vindictive element in the treatment accorded tothe offender in these cases, and there were analogous offences in whichthe offender was more severely punished if he happened to causedeath than if he did not. Nor was it easy to justify automaticdisqualification for some of the other offences in category A if itwere not imposed also for causing death by dangerous driving.The Cabinet (5) Agreed that on conviction of causing death by dangerousdriving disqualification should be automatic in every case, but that for dangerous driving without causingdeath there should be automatic disqualification only ona second or subsequent conviction.On the power of the Courts to remit disqualification The Ministerof Transport said that under the present law remission might begranted after six months or, where the period of disqualification was for more than a year, after half the period or three years, whicheverwas the less. Where the original period was a year or less, the courts in practice granted remission for six months in as many as half thecases. He would therefore have preferred tiiat the power to remitshould be abolished altogether or, failing that, that the presentminimum of six months within which remission might not be grantedshould be increased to twelve months.In discussion it was pointed out that there were overridingobjections to abolishing the power of remission and that the second alternative suggested by the Minister of Transport would in practicefavour the most serious offenders. The general view of the cabinet was therefore in favour of the proposal put forward by the HomeAffairs Committee, that the power to remit should be limited to theHigh Court and, where a legally qualified Chairman was presiding,to Quarter Sessions. In Scotland, however, there would be noobjection to leaving the power in the hands of the Sheriff Courts.
The Cabinet (6) Agreed that the power to remit disqualification should belimited in England and Wales to the High Court and,where a legally qualified Chairman was presiding, toQuarter Sessions.The Cabinet next considered the question of drink and driving.The proposal favoured by the majority of the Home AffairsCommittee was that the existing offence of driving under the influence of drink should be re-defined in terms of &quot; impaired ability to driveproperly&quot;; that the present practice of the police in administeringvoluntary tests of the alcohol content of a suspected driver&apos;s bloodshould be maintained; but that, in order to make it easier for the prosecution to secure convictions in appropriate cases, the courtsshould be expressly directed to have regard to evidence of the resultof such tests and, where the accused motorist had refused to undergo a test without any reasonable explanation, to treat his refusal assupporting any evidence given on behalf of the prosecution, or asrebutting any evidence given on behalf of the defence, with respectto his condition at the time.The Attorney-General said that, in his view and that of the otherLaw Officers, there was no need for any change in the law on thissubject. Moreover, the proposal relating to evidence of refusal ofa test would undermine two principles of English law that every person was assumed to be innocent until he was proved to be guilty,and that no one was required to provide evidence against himself.The accused would be obliged to go into the witness box to explainwhy he had refused a test and would then be subject to comprehensivecross-examination on all the circumstances of the case. If, however,the Bill was to deal at all with evidence of refusal of a test, there was probably no workable alternative to what had been proposed.In discussion some doubt was expressed about the wisdom oflegislation which placed so much emphasis on evidence of tests(especially since tests as normally administered could not alwaysprovide scientifically reliable results) and seemed unduly to weightthe scales in favour of the prosecution. On the other hand, the prosecution would not in practice rely solely on the evidence of a test or refusal to submit to a test. The blood test was reliable, andthe urine test gave at least a reasonable indication of the alcoholcontent of the driver&apos;s blood. There was reason to hope that, before long, equipment would be developed which would enable the alcoholcontent to be established with complete accuracy by a test of thedriver&apos;s breath. It was important that this factor should come to berecognised by the courts and the public as an important one indealing with the offence of driving under the influence of drink. short of compulsory testing, which would not yet be politically acceptablein this country, legisation on the lines proposed was fhe only way ofmaking progress in this matter.Summing up. The Prime Minister said that the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that, in view of the public concern at the numberof accidents caused by drinking, the Bill must deal with the problem and that the most satisfactory method of doing so was that proposedby the Home Affairs Committee.The Cabinet (7) Approved the proposals for legislation on drink and drivingin paragraphs 10 and 11 of C. (61) 2.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,2nd February, 1961.
