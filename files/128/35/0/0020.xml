ParliamentSuccession toPeerages(previous reference:C.C. (61) 19thConclusions,Minute 1)South-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 19thConclusions.Minute 3)2. The Prime Minister said that the United States Administra-tion were now in full agreement with our view that the wiser coursewould be to seek a political settlement in Laos and to be content witha neutral regime which would be a buffer between Vietnam andThailand. They might however face a difficult political dilemma. For,if they sought a political settlement and Laos in the end went over tothe Communist side, their Republican opponents would be quick toaccuse them of appeasement. Equally, if they were obliged toauthorise military intervention, they would be criticised on the basis that, as in Korea, a Democrat Government had embarked on war. This difficulty could however be averted, for the time being atany rate, if the Soviet Government accepted our latest proposals fora cease-fire and a conference.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentwere now pressing the Soviet Government to expedite their reply.Their delay might be due to the fact that they were having difficulty with the Chinese. It was hoped, however, that a reply might bereceived by the end of the present week. In that event it might bepossible for the conference to meet on 2nd May.Meanwhile there had been some improvement in the militarysituation in Laos. The morale of the Royal Laotian troops had beenstiffened, and they had made some limited advances.Prince Souvanna Phouma had also been persuaded to visitWashington. It would be valuable if the authorities there couldsatisfy themselves, by conversations with him, that he was not in sympathy with the Communists.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.1. The Home Secretary said that the House of Commons was to debate, later in the day, the position of Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn.After consultation with Government supporters in the House ofCommons, he proposed to resist a motion that Mr. Wedgwood Bennbe heard at the Bar of the House. It was clear that he was in fact aPeer, though not perhaps a Peer of Parliament, and there was no adequate precedent for a Peer&apos;s being heard at the Bar of hisown volition, as distinct from being invited to give evidence. TheHome Secretary would thereafter move that the House took note of thefact that Mr. Wedgwood Benn, on succession to the Viscountcyof Stansgate, had ceased to be a Member and agreed with the reportof the Committee of Privileges, which had reached that conclusionand had recommended against the introduction of a retrospective Billto enable him to remain a Member of the House of Commons.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with these proposals. It was also agreed that the Governmentshould resist amendments advocating legislation to permit therenunciation of Peerages and to enable those who had renounced themto be Members of the House of Commons. If there was a case for amending the constitution of the House of Lords and the law ofsuccession to Peerages, it should be examined as a whole, with all its implications, and not in the context of one particular instance.The Cabinet were also informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Disarmament(previous reference:CC. (60) 39thConclusions,Minute 1)Nuclear Tests3. The Foreign Secretary said that no progress was now beingmade in the negotiations at Geneva on the cessation of nuclear weapons tests. The attitude of the Russians had hardened, and theprospects of securing a settlement seemed to be deteriorating. Inparticular, the Russians had made a new proposal that the singleneutral Administrator of the International Control Organisation,which they had previously accepted, should be replaced by a tripartiteadministrative council with a representative from the Western side, theCommunist side and the neutral bloc. This proposal was based onthe argument that no single person could be objective as betweenCommunist and non-Communist interests, and it followed the line which the Russians were taking in respect of the structure of the united nations. This was a principle which neither we nor the United states could accept. It had therefore been agreed, with the United StatesGovernment, that we should now table our Treaty proposals in full soas to make it plain to world opinion how much had been agreed and how little remained outstanding. If the negotiations then broke down,this would help to make it plain that the responsibility for the break-down lay with the Soviet Government.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Foreign Secretary.Middle EastKuwait(previous reference:CC. (60) 3ConclusionsMinute 7)1st4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord privy Seal (C. (61) 49) on future relations with Kuwait.The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ruler of Kuwait had asked thatthe Exclusive Agreement of 1899, under which the United KingdomGovernment assumed responsibility for the external affairs of Kuwait,should be replaced by an instrument reaffirming our friendship and support. There would be no change in our military or financial arrangements. Any new agreement of this kind should be made in a form which would not provoke the opposition of other Arab States.There were three alternative possibilities. The first would be an exchange of notes abrogating the 1899 Agreement, accompanied by an oral and unpublished assurance (which might be recorded in an aide-memoire) that the United Kingdom Government recognised theircontinuing obligation to assist in maintaining kuwait&apos;s independence.The second would be an exchange of notes both abrogating the 1899Agreement and stating that its abrogation did not affect our obligationto maintain the independence of Kuwait. The third would be a formaltreaty, recording the same obligations, which would be subject to ratification. Whichever method were adopted, it would be desirablethat the Ruler should also be offered a Treaty of Friendship and commerce which would give additional emphasis to the full independence of Kuwait; but this would take some time to complete and the Ruler was anxious to replace the 1899 Agreement before thepresent Political Resident left the Gulf early in May.The Lord Privy Seal said that it was not certain what the Rulerhad in mind; he himself favoured the first alternative of a simpleabrogation of the 1899 Agreement accompanied by an unpublishedassurance of continued support for the independence of Kuwait. ThePolitical Resident in the Persian Gulf had suggested that he should present to the Ruler the first and the second alternatives together, sinceto present the first alone might create the impression that we were seeking to reduce the extent of our support. The Lord Privy Sealrecommended that this suggestion should be approved.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was general agreement that the 1899 Agreement shouldbe abrogated while the present Ruler&apos;s position remained strong.(/;) A formal treaty would serve the interests neither of Kuwaitnor of Her Majesty&apos;s Government.  Experience in Jordan and Iraq
Education 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theScottish Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (61) 53) about the pay claimTeachers        of teachers in Scotland.(Previous jj1e Secretary oi State for Scotland said that the National JointCC ( rf Council for Teachers&apos; Salaries in Scotland (N.J.C.) had submitted to conclusions n&apos;m an aSreed recommendation for a general increase of 12^ per cent.Minute 7- on current salaries of all grades of teachers, coupled with areduction of all scales to 12 or 10 years. The total cost of therecommendations would be about t&apos;6j millions representing anincrease of 18 per cent, on the present cost of teachers&apos; salaries in Scotland. The recommendation was unacceptable, not only because of the amount and cost of the proposed increase and itsdamaging impact on the parallel negotiations in the burnham committee on the salaries of teachers in England and Wales, but also because it failed to provide differentia! increases in favour of those sections of the profession in which it was necessary to stimulaterecruitment. The Secretary of State therefore proposed that the localauthority representatives on the Burnham Committee should beinformed in confidence that they must not assume that the N.J.C.&apos;srecommendations would be accepted; and that he should inform theN.J.C. that he could not accept their recommendations and would himself put alternative proposals before them.In discussion there was general agreement that the recommenda-tions of the N.J.C should be rejected in terms which left the way openC.C. 20 (61)indicated that the existence of such a treaty could be a standingtemptation to its abrogation. It would be possible to express thechange in relationship by combining abrogation of the 1899 Agreementwith the reaffirmation of the assurances given in 1914, which includedrecognition that the Sheikhdom of Kuwait was an independentGovernment under British protection; but explicit reliance on a50-year old formula might invite charges of imperialism.(c) We should in any case retain our military obligation to go tothe aid of Kuwait if she were threatened by Iraq. For this we relied on our military facilities in Aden and on our ability to providereinforcements from Kenya. Our policy in Aden would continue tobe directed towards retaining our facilities there, and certainconstitutional changes would be sought before the Legislative Councilreached the end of its term in 1963. Our military position in Kenyawas somewhat less secure.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that the Ruler wanted a new agreement, but other Arab States might affect to be offended by theconclusion of a formal treaty. Any new agreement must recognise our right to intervene if Kuwait&apos;s independence were threatened and thiswould, it seemed, equally involve recognising our obligation to do so.The first two courses described by the Lord Privy Seal would eachhave the same effect, but by adopting the first we could avoid publiclydeclaring, or registering with the United Nations, the protection whichwe would continue to extend to Kuwait. It would be possible, ifquestions were raised in the House of Commons or elsewhere, to pointout that the 1914 Agreement remained valid.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to instruct the Political resident in the Persian Gulf to inform the Ruler of Kuwait that her majesty&apos;s Government accepted his wish to replace the exclusive Agreement of 1899 by a new agreement, to offerhim a choice of the two courses approved in discussion andto seek his agreement to the first of those courses.
to further negotiations. The Council might therefore be informed thatthe Secretary of State agreed that some increase in teachers&apos; pay was justified (although the current rates had been in operation for no morethan 15 months) and would put alternative proposals before themproviding for differential increases designed to improve the quality ofthe education service. This decision might be announced in reply toa Parliamentary Question on 18th April. It was for consideration whether the Secretary of State should at the same time give some indication of the aggregate increase he would be prepared to entertain.This would put the Government in a stronger position in relation tothe threatenend strike of teachers in Scotland, due to begin on 8th May.But, if the figure were higher than the 10 or 11 per cent, which theEnglish local authorities were at present intending to offer, thenegotiations in the Burnham Committee would be prejudiced.Meanwhile the English local authority representatives, who were tomeet on the following day, should at once be informed in confidence that the Government would not be willing to approve an aggregateincrease of as much as 18 per cent.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The N.J.C. had not recommended any date of operation forthe proposed pay increases. The Cabinet had agreed at their meetingon 24th January that this should be not earlier than 1st January, 1962,but the Council would certainly press for a date in the near future.(b) The Cabinefs decision would precipitate the threatened strike of teachers in.Glasgow, which was now likely to be supported by theleaders of the teaching profession in Scotland and might be expectedto spread to other parts of the country. It was, however, important that the Government should not make concessions under threat of strike action.(c) The suggestion that non-graduate men teachers should beintroduced in Scotland, which had been put forward for discussionamong the interests concerned, was now likely to have to be deferredbecause of the opposing views which had been expressed. Since oneof the objects of the threatened strike was to protest against thissuggestion, it might be preferable to announce its deferment before thestrike took place.id) The recurring embarrassments caused by the interaction of english and Scottish negotiations on teachers&apos; pay made it desirablethat, if the two negotiating bodies could not be integrated, the timing of the settlements reached in the two countries should in future besynchronised.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Education to inform the local arthorityrepresentatives on the Burnham Committee, in confidence,that the Government would not be willing to approveaggregate pay increases for teachers of as much as 18 percent.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, after further consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theMinister of Education, to reject the recommendation of theNational Joint Council for Teachers&apos; Salaries in scotland on the lines agreed in their discussion.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Ministerof Education to put before the Wages Committee proposalsfor differential increases in the pay of teachers.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland and the Minister ofEducation to give further consideration to the possibilityof closer co-ordination between the bodies responsible for negotiating teachers&apos; pay in the two countries.

(61)conclusions minute 1)TrawlerStrike atHull andGrimsby6th7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (C. (61) 50) on the trawler strike atHull and Grimsby.The Minister of Fisheries said that the strike had been started bythe Grimsby Trawler Officers Guild. It had spread to Hull, but was now confined to Grimsby. It was directed primarily against the landing of Icelandic fish, but the strikers had also raised points relatingto their wages and conditions of service. The trawler-owners were determined not to seek any alteration in the Paris Agreement of 1956,in accordance with which Icelandic fish was landed in this country;they realised that the maintenance of that Agreement was an essential part of the recent settlement resumed with the Icelandic Governmenton fishing limits. They were willing to discuss the other points a tissue if the strikers returned to work. The stoppage at Grimsby wasnoi complete; a few ships had sailed in spite of the strike, and thehundred or so ships on the fishing grounds would complete their tripsbefore they were asked to join the strike. Landings at Hull were mainly of coarse fish and at Grimsby of better quality fish. there might be some reduction in supplies of coarse fish for a few days as a6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the paymaster General (C. (61) 52) about the weekly hours of workof railwaymen.The Paymaster General said that the railways were now almost the only major industry with a 44-hour week and the railway unions had submitted a claim for a reduction of four hours in the standardweek, without loss of pay. The British Transport Commissionproposed to offer a reduction of two hours: they considered that this concession would be fair in comparison with other industries, would secure the goodwill of the unions and would, in any event, be awardedif the claim went to arbitration.The Wages Committee were of the opinion that a negotiated settlement would be preferable to arbitration and recommended thatthe Transport Commission should be authorised to offer a reduction ofnot more than two hours, on condition that the effective date shouldbe 1st January, 1962, if possible and in any case not earlier than theintroduction of the next winter&apos;s schedules, and that satisfactory newrosters were introduced.In discussion it was generally agreed that, while the Governmentshould try to avoid giving the impression that they accepted theprinciple of comparability irrespective of its financial consequences,and although there was no hope that the proposed concession couldavert the wage claim which was shortly expected, the balance ofadvantage lay on the side of accepting the Transport Commission^proposal. Satisfactory new rosters could not, however, be devisedwithout the use of work studies which, indeed, offered the only hopeof achieving significant economies in the operation of the railways. Forthis reason it would be useful if the Commission would agree that dr. Beeching, the Chairman-Designate, should be associated with thenegotiations. The introduction of work studies would be strongly resisted by the railway unions and the Government would be well advised to make in advance their preparations against the industrial action which must ultimately be expected.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C. (61) 52 for a reduction in the weekly hours of work of railwaymen.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to convey this decision to theBritish Transport Commission.
result of the Hull strike, but in general there should be no shortageover the next two or three weeks; thereafter there might be somescarcity of better quality fish, ,No usefuTpurpose would be served by government intervention at this stage, but he would keep his colleagues in touch with the developments.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food.Washington 8.   The Prime Minister made a preliminary report to the CabinetTalks on the discussions which he had held during his recent visit to washington and the impressions he had formed of President Kennedyand the members of his Administration.The Prime Minister said that he would arrange for the records ofhis formal meetings with President Kennedy to be circulated to all members of the Cabinet. He proposed that the main issues arisingfrom those meetings should be considered at a special meeting of theCabinet in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th April, 1961.
