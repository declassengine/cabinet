Federationof RhodesiaandNyasalandNorthernRhodesia(previous reference:C.C. (61) 34thConclusions,Minute 2)2. The Prime Minister said that, following the Cabinefs last discussion of the constitutional proposals for Northern Rhodesia,he had informed the Prime Minister of the Federation, Sir roy welensky, that the Government were willing to modify the proposals in the White Paper of February 1961, by basing the qualifyingminimum of votes for election to the national seats on races insteadof rolls and by certain other changes designed to go as far aspossible to meet the views of the Federation Government. two representatives of the Federation Government had arrived in london on the previous day and the latest indications were that, subject tocertain important modifications of detail, they were willing to acquiesce in the proposals now before them. Steps were being takento ascertain the extent to which the Federation Government were committed to the modifications which had been suggested on their behalf and an undertaking would be given that these would be immediately examined.In discussion the Cabinet agreed that the Governmenfs decision must be announced in Parliament not later than 26th June. Thiswould make it possible to communicate their views to Mr. Kaunda,the leader of the United National Independence Party in northern rhodesia, before he left London. An advance copy of the government&apos;s statement should be sent to Sir Roy Welensky ifpossible, on the following day.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Colonial Secretary, to give urgent consideration to thelatest proposals received from the Federation Governmenton the constitution of Northern Rhodesia and to submit tothe Prime Minister a draft statement of the government&apos;s decision on them.Coal 3.   The Prime Minister said that the Committee on Coal Imports(Previous       had considered further the issues arising out of the application by reference:      the Steel Company of Wales to import United States coal.  They had .C (61) 27th   concluded that, while the structure of the coal industry and theConclusions,    question of coal prices were being reviewed by the Chairman of the minute 9)       National Coal Board, it would not be in the national interest to grant the application.   It might in any case be difficult, in the present economic situation, to justify buying United States coal.   It was now necessary to consider the form and timing of the announcement of theCommittee&apos;s decision.In discussion it was suggested that, since the Steel Company of wales was at present unlikely to press for an answer to its application,it might be preferable to leave the matter in suspense. On the otherhand, the application had roused considerable interest and it wouldbe inadvisable for an announcement to be made after parliament had risen for the summer recess. On balance it seemed preferable that an announcement should be made at some time in the followingmonth.The Paymaster-General said that, when he had recently metcertain leading members of the steel trade, he had gained theimpression that they were not unduly anxious that permission shouldbe given to import United States coal into the United Kingdom.They had informed him, however, that within the European economic community some four steel works were being put down, based on united States coal to be supplied under 10-year contracts. Theyhad promised to supply him with particulars.C.C. 35 (61)Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.
Europe 4.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime MinisterCommonwealth (C. (61) 84) covering a draft directive for the three Ministers (the consultation Commonwealth Secretary, the Minister of Aviation and the Minister(Previous of Labour) who were to visit Commonwealth countries to discuss the reference: future relationship of the United Kingdom with the EuropeanCC. (61) 3lst   Economic Community.MJnuteizT ^he Prime Minister said that discussions which had taken place at Chequers during the previous week-end between the Ministersmainly concerned had led to the conclusion that the approach to theCommonwealth should be on the basis that it was undesirable toleave in suspense for much longer a decision on the question whetherthe United Kingdom should apply to accede to the Treaty of Rome.It did not seem possible to obtain any clear indication of theconditions we might secure to meet our own requirements and thoseof the Commonwealth by taking any further the various informal discussions which we had held with representatives of the member governments of the Community. The three Ministers should therefore inform Commonwealth Governmenfs that we were inclined to think that the right course would be for us to make a formalapplication to accede to the Treaty of Rome in order to find outwhether we could secure acceptable terms and conditions whichwould safeguard the essential interests of other commonwealth countries, and also meet our own requirements and those of the othermembers of the European Free Trade Association (E.F.T.A.).In discussion it was pointed out that hitherto the Governmenfsattitude had been that we should not apply to accede to the Treatyof Rome unless we had formed the view that there was a reasonable chance that our own requirements, and those of our partners in theCommonwealth and of the other members of E.F.T.A., could besecured. It was not clear why this attitude should now be radicallychanged. Moreover, if the approach to the Commonwealth were tobe on the different basis now proposed, this would be taken to meanand it would be publicly asserted that we had definitely decided tomake an application to accede to the Treaty. It might therefore bedesirable for some prior announcement to be made to Parliament,giving some indication of this change of view.It was suggested that, if Commonwealth Governments wereapproached on this basis, they might well seek to enter into detailed negotiations with us in order to settle the terms on which the accession of the United Kingdom to the Community would be acceptable tothem, in advance of our making an application to accede. It shouldbe possible to persuade Commonwealth countries that this proceduiewould be open to great objection, since there was a clear danger thatit would reveal our negotiating position to the Community. It was.however, very likely that Commonwealth Governments would presentthe visiting Ministers with lists of their full requirements, which theywould expect us to secure in any settlement.It was pointed out that the directive envisaged our subscribing,in an otherwise satisfactory settlement, to the basic principles and objectives of the Treaty of Rome as set out in Articles 2 and 3. Itwas suggested that we could not do this, consistently with trying tosecure the maintenance as far as possible of the principle of commonwealth free entry. If we were to accept the basic principles and objectives of the Treaty of Rome we could not at the same timeThe Cabinet-Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Minister of Power, to prepare an announcement,to be made in July, of the decision to refuse the application by the Steel Company of Wales to import coal from theUnited States.
CC. 35 (61)expect to continue our bilateral commercial relationships with commonwealth countries. On the other hand it was argued that wewould not take a final decision to join the Community unless we had secured satisfactory arrangements for the Commonwealth; and if wehad succeeded in meeting the needs of the Commonwealth we could then safely subscribe to the basic principles and objectives of theTreaty of Rome. Moreover, the informal discussions gave reason tobelieve that, unless we were prepared to subscribe to these basic principles and objectives, there would be virtually no chance ofsecuring in negotiation satisfactory arrangements to meet our requirements and those of the Commonwealth and E.F.T.A.The President of the Board of Trade said that it would be inadvisable for him to adopt a guarded attitude at the meeting of the ministerial Council of E.F.T.A. in London on 27th and 28th June, atwhich he was to preside. He proposed at that meeting to describeour inclination to apply to accede to the Treaty of Rome in order toascertain whether satisfactory conditions could be obtained to meet our requirements and those of our partners in the commonwealth and E.F.T.A., on the same lines as would be taken by the three ministers in their discussions with Commonwealth Governments.This proposal was generally approved.In further discussion of the terms of the draft directive thefollowing points were made:(a) Since we had previously undertaken to provideCommonwealth Governments with an assessment of what special arrangements we might reasonably expect to obtain, it would be advisable to admit that our informal talks with representatives of themembers of the Community had enabled us to make only limitedprogress in this respect.(b) Commonwealth Governments should be warned that, evenif we did not ]oin the Community, it was likely that our existing policies, which gave unlimited access to Commonwealth products,would need to be modified.(c) Commonwealth countries should be assured that it would be our intention, in any negotiations with the Community, to preservetheir market in the United Kingdom to the greatest extent possible.We should seek arrangements which in the transitional period would permit exports to the United Kingdom of Commonwealth goods of major significance (with the possible exception of manufactured goods from the developed countries of the Commonwealth) to be maintained at substantially the same level as at present; and in the common market period would continue unchanged except to the extent thatit could be shown that changes were necessary in order to avoidfrustrating the purposes of the Community, and that they would notdamage the essential interests of Commonwealth countries.(d) It would be premature to expect the commonwealth governments to accept the broad political and economic arguments for our joining the Community. It would be preferable to expressour aim as being to bring the Commonwealth Governments tounderstand that these arguments justified our making an attempt tofind out whether we could obtain terms which would meet our requirements and those of our partners in the Commonwealth andE.F.T.A. The visiting Ministers, should accordingly aim to bringCommonwealth Governments to accept that we might decide toapply to accede to the Treaty of Rome in order to find out whethersatisfactory terms could be obtained.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thedraft directive in the Annex to C. (60) 84 to be revised inthe light of their discussion.
united nations(previous reference:C.C. (60) 59thConclusions,Minute 3)Finances5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (61) 59) about the financial position of the united nations Organisation.The Foreign Secretary said that the United Nations organisation had exhausted its working capital fund of $25 millions and had ended1960 with a cash deficit of $10 millions. This situation had resulted from the heavy expenditure on the United Nations operations in the congo, towards which certain countries, including the Soviet bloc and France, would not pay their assessed contributions and from the refusal since 1957 of the Soviet bloc and others to meet their obligations in respect of the United Nations emergency force. Aresolution had been passed inviting the next General Assembly of theUnited Nations to consider setting up a separate scale of contributions for peace and security operations and it was possible that, as a result,an increase in the United Kingdom contribution might be called for.It was in our interest both to ensure that the United nations organisation remained solvent and that the operations in the Congo,which now appeared to be achieving a greater measure of success,should be sustained. The United States had suggested that long-terminterest-free Government loans might be the best solution to theUnited Nations&apos; financial difficulties: the sum required would be approximately $75 millions, towards which the United kingdom might be expected to contribute a sum not exceeding $15 millions.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be inappropriate for the United Kingdom to join with the United states in taking any initiative to restore the general financial position of theUnited Nations Organisation. Although the General Assembly had last autumn refused to give the Secretary-General powers to borrowcommercially, and there might be objections to mortgaging the united nations building in New York, further consideration should be givento such measures, or possibly to a world-wide appeal for donations,before further calls were made on Governments. It was undesirable that the United Kingdom should provide assistance in the form of loans at a time when our balance of payments was precarious. if other countries were to take the initiative in proposing loans we might perhaps agree to contribute, but our contribution should be considerably less than $15 millions. There was, however, generalagreement with the proposal that we should continue to support theUnited Nations operations in the Congo.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should not join in any initiative for providing interest-freeGovernment loans for the United Nations.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to suggest that theSecretary-General of the United Nations organisation should give further consideration to raising capital fundscommercially, possibly by mortgaging the United Nationsbuilding.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to consider the extent towhich we should contribute towards sustaining the united nations operations in the Congo.
