I4iSouth-east asia treaty organisation laos(previous reference:C.C. (61) 23rdConclusions.Minute 2)*1. The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the militarysituation in Laos, there was increasing pressure from some membersof the South-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) for preliminarymilitary dispositions to be made with a view to implementing plans to intervene in Laos if a cease-fire could not be achieved in the very near future. He had been informed by the Prime Minister of NewZealand that his Government would be prepared to support suchaction. He had also received a similar message from the PrimeMinister of Australia, stressing the danger to the Alliance if SEATOwere shown to be ineffective and the difficulties which would arise if the United Kingdom Government were unable to participate in anyintervention considered by SEATO to be necessary.The Prime Minister said that, while it could be argued thatpreparatory military action by SEATO might make the Pathet Laomore willing to agree to a cease-fire, it might well have the oppositeeffect. Moreover, the Soviet Government might cease to use their influence to bring about a cease-fire and to restrain the CommunistChinese Government. He had therefore sent a message on theprevious evening to the President of the United States (ForeignOffice telegram to Washington No. 3005) urging that further time should be allowed for the cease-fire to become effective and thatthe meeting of the SEATO Council which had been arranged for2nd May should be postponed until 3rd May. He had also askedwhether the United States Government still considered that the plan for military intervention should be limited, as had been agreed inhis meeting with President Kennedy at Key West, to the securingof certain bridgeheads on the Mekong River, including Vientiane.After this message had gone, news had been received in Washingtonthat representatives of the two factions in Laos had met and were tomeet again that day in order to arrange a cease-fire, and the UnitedStates Secretary of State had accordingly agreed that the meetingof the SEATO Council should be postponed until the following day.The Lord Privy Seal said that no confirmation had yet beenreceived in London that a meeting to arrange a cease-fire had takenplace in Laos. But, on balance, it would be preferable for the timebeing to avoid prejudicing the chance of a cease-fire by making any military movements. Our reluctance to authorise military preparations would no doubt be embarrassing in SEATO, but itwould provide an opportunity for the military planning to beelucidated. Meanwhile, it had been suggested to the Prime Ministerof India that he should use his influence to secure the agreementof the Soviet Foreign Minister that the members of the international control Commission, who had formulated their report in Delhi,should go to Laos at once, without waiting for a cease-fire to become effective. For the time being it would be premature to bring thesituation in Laos before the United Nations, since that could onlylead to an acrimonious debate with the possibility of a resolution which would make intervention by SEATO, if that became necessary, even more difficult.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement that theefforts to secure a cease-fire in Laos should be continued and thatit would be premature for the members of SEATO to make military dispositions in preparation for intervention at this stage.Nevertheless, if it became clear that the Communist forces wereobstructing a cease-fire, it would be necessary for us to play our full part in whatever action SEATO might agree to take. In view ofthe morale of the Laotian Government troops, the prospects for* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.b 2
2. The Minister of Labour said that there was so far no improvement in the situation in the London docks, where an unofficial strike, arising out of the use of listed labour, with theapproval of the London Dock Labour Board, by an employer atLower 01iver&apos;s Wharf, had led to a stoppage of work affecting halfthe port. If the strike continued it might be necessary to takeemergency action, including the use of troops; but for the time being,in the hope of avoiding a severe economic dislocation, it was preferable to continue to seek a settlement by negotiation.The Cabinet were in general agreement that it would be preferable to avoid taking special measures, such as the use of troops,at present, since this would almost certainly lead to a complete stoppage in the London docks, and probably at other ports also.Nevertheless this dispute, following other unofficial strikes in theLondon docks, would have a deplorable effect on our economy and exports. The Government would be likely to receive a wide measureof public support if it became necessary to take firm action.It was not clear how far this and similar strikes were beingfomented by Communist agents. The result of the current legal action against officials of the Electrical Trades Union might providea good opportunity for exposing Communist influences in the tradesunion movement, and the possibility of bringing criminal proceedings in this connection should not be overlooked.It was suggested that the Government should consider whether any steps should be taken, such as the preparation of legislation,which would enable them at the appropriate time to take advantageIndustrialDisputes(previous reference:C.C. (61) 6thConclusions.Minute 1)london dock Strikesuccessful military action in Laos were not good, and it would bedesirable to limit intervention to the plan to secure certainbridgeheads across the Mekong River, which had been agreed between the Prime Minister and President Kennedy at Key West.There was some hope that, with the arrival of General Lemnitzerin Bangkok and Mr. Harriman in Laos, the United States authorities on the spot would take a more realistic view of the political andmilitary difficulties in the way of intervention.While it would be difficult for the United States Government,after the failure of their policy in Cuba, to accept a further reverse,they might nevertheless decide that there were overriding politicaland military objections to intervention in Laos. In that event, itmight be desirable to work for a resolution in the United Nationscalling for a cessation of hostilities. In any case it might be necessaryfor the other members of SEATO to give substantial additionalmilitary and other assistance to Thailand, in order to prevent anextension of Communist infiltration. Military action to supportThailand would not be open to the political and practical difficultieswhich attached to intervention in Laos.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would need to give further consideration to the question of military action by SEATOin the light of any reply which he might receive from president kennedy and of the outcome of the negotiations for a cease-fire.Meanwhile the United Kingdom military authorities in Bangkokshould be informed of the views which he had conveyed to president kennedy about military planning and preparations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to inform the UnitedKingdom military authorities in Bangkok of the views which the Prime Minister had conveyed to president kennedy about military planning and preparations.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at their next meeting.
3. The Lord Privy Seal said that the announcement of the engagement of the King of Jordan to the daughter, who had become a Moslem, of one of the members of the British Military mission in Jordan might have grave consequences for the regime. It had notbeen possible to dissuade the King from taking this step, and hewas confident that he could deal with any unrest which it mightoccasion. Plans were in existence, in the event of serious disturbancesdeveloping, for the evacuation of British residents from Jordan.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,2nd May, 1961.of public support for any suitable measures to deal with the deterioration in industrial relations. This was a question whichhad been considered on a number of occasions in the past. It hadbeen found that there were serious objections to imposing a legalrequirement for a secret ballot before strike action, and any attemptto make unofficial strikes illegal raised difficult questions of penaltiesand enforcement. The real problem at present was how to restore the authority of the trades unions.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to circulate a memorandumon current industrial relations problems, with particular reference to unofficial strikes.
