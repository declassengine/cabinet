GovernmentExpenditureNutritionalServices(previous reference:CC. (61) 61stConclusions.Minute 2)The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (C. (61) 209) and the Minister of Education (C. (61) 213)about possible savings in expenditure on school meals, welfare milk and school milk. Annexed to C. (61) 209 was a summary of a reportby officials on Child Nutrition.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that he saw no prospect of preventing the Estimates for 1962-63 from rising in real terms bymore than 2\ per cent, over the Estimates for 1961-62 unless asubstantial saving could be made in social service expenditure.Officials had examined a number of ways in which economies couldbe secured in expenditure on school meals, welfare milk and school milk without risk to nutritional standards. These services were atpresent costing nearly  100 million per annum. By recasting thepresent arrangements for subsidising school meals, so as to concentrate the subsidy almost entirely on children whose familieswere most in need of its help, it would be possible to save about 27 million from the  57 million now spent on school meals; andby withdrawing the welfare milk subsidy, except for families of four or more children (including as four-child families those with threechildren and an expectant mother), it would be possible to save 20 million out of the  26 million at present spent on welfare milk.He did not think it would be desirable to make any general alteration in the arrangements for school milk. If savings of the order suggestedcould be secured, it would be unnecessary to examine the alternative course, which would be to alter the balance of the family allowancesscheme in favour of the larger families. This might reduce expenditure on family allowances (estimated at  135 million for1962-63) by a gross amount of about  34 million, but would involve legislation and new administrative expenditure.The Cabinet considered first the welfare milk scheme. There wasbroad agreement that it would be right to secure substantial reductions in the cost of the scheme, which provided milk at half-price, not only for the small number of families unable to afford the full price, butalso for a much larger number of families whose consumption of milkwould not be affected if they had to pay the full price. It wassuggested, however, that further consideration should be given tothe merits and defects of certain of the proposals to which officials had drawn attention. The biggest saving ( 20 million) would beobtained if. as the Chief Secretary. Treasury, had suggested, subsidieswere withdrawn from all save families of four or more children,but this might involve some risk for families with three children andthe possibility of retaining the subsidy for them should not be ruled out. The saving in that event would be reduced to about  14 million.Of three-child families, those in which all the children were underfive were particularly vulnerable; if the subsidy were retained only for these families the saving might be about  18 million. Theadministrative implications of each of these possible schemes shouldbe studied and it should be kept in mind that in 1964. when it wouldbe necessary to renew the powers under which welfare milk wassupplied, it would be convenient to be able to avoid making anyfurther change in the character of the scheme. This would point toa decision at this stage to adopt the proposal which could readily be defended on nutritional grounds viz.. to retain subsidies only forthree-child families where all the children were under five. Adoptionof any of the schemes would affect milk distributors, and it would bedesirable to consult them before an announcement was made if this could be done without undue risk of premature disclasure of theGovernment^ intentions.The changes under discussion would require a new WelfareFoods Order, which would be subject to negative resolution. Subjectto wider considerations affecting announcements of other economy measures, it would be convenient if any announcement about welfare milk could be made some time before the issue of the White Paper
on the Government^ Hospital Plan, which would be ready for publication towards the end of January.The Cabinet then considered the school meals service, for which two schemes were described in paragraph 8 of the annex to C. (61) 209.The Minister of Education said that he could not wholly accept that a doubling of the charge for school meals supplied to all childrenexcept those from the larger and more needy families would have noadverse nutritional effects. It would probably increase the numbersof children who took their mid-day meal at cafes, a development which had both social and nutritional disadvantages. School meals,moreover, had an important educational function which had beenaccepted by teachers, who might regard a doubled charge as markingthe conversion of school meals from an education service to arestaurant service which they would feel less obligation to supervise.He did not, however, think that the effect of an increase from Is. toIs. 6d. per meal would be so serious: a meal provided at such aprice might still be accepted as an education service. It would avoidadministrative complications if there were no intermediate stagebetween a free meal and a Is. 6d. meal. But if the Is. 6d. proposal were pursued it would be important to examine its effect on theoutlay of families having several children at school and to acknowledge the social implications of shifting the burden of school meals frompersons with no children to those having children.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposal for a 2s.charge (described at X.1 in paragraph 8 of the report) would be administratively complicated, particularly in view of fluctuatingincomes. Past experience showed, moreover, that small increases in charges resulted, at any rate in some areas, in many childrenwithdrawing from school meals. A complex scheme would be likelyto give rise to tension among teachers, whose dislike of theirsupervisory function in relation to school meals had recently beenmade clear. If the existing means test arrangements could be leftsubstantially unaltered as they might be on the proposal for a Is. 6d.charge (described at X.2) much difficulty would be avoided, thoughthe amount of the saving which could be obtained would be reduced from  27 million to about  17 million.In further discussion of points affecting the whole range ofschemes covered by C. (61) 209, the following points were raised:(a) Before the Cabinet took final decisions they should have before them statements showing the effect for typical family sizesof various combinations of the economy measures which had beendiscussed. They should also have before them a brief description of the changes in the family allowances scheme which might be proposed as an alternative to economies in the nutritional services.(h) The timing of announcements about economy measures would need careful consideration in the light of foreseeable political conditions.(c) Although no general change in school milk arrangements was recommended, there might be advantage in stopping the supply of free milk in independent schools. This would yield a saving of about 800.000.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Secretary. Treasury, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister olEducation, the Minister of Pensions and National insurance and the Minister of Health to bring before them revised proposals for savings in the cost of school meals and welfare milk, and to outline the savings which might be achieved by adopting, as an alternative, changes in th- family allowances scheme.
