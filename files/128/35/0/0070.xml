congo republic(previous reference:CC. (61) 69thConclusions)The Prime Minister invited the Lord Privy Seal to summarisethe course of developments since the Cabinet had decided on 7th December to supply bombs for use by Indian Canberra aircraft in Katanga subject to written assurances that these would only beused to attack pirate aircraft or airfields from which those aircraft were known to be operating.The Lord Privy Seal said that the terms of the Cabinefs decisionhad been transmitted to the United Nations Secretariat on the night of 7th December. On the following day the Secretary-General had said that he was surprised that the conditions had been made sorestrictive: most of the Katangan air force had already been putout of action by United Nations aircraft using cannon, and theywould have liked to use the bombs to attack bridges, roads and fuel dumps. Even so, the Secretary-General had given the assuranceson which the Cabinet had insisted, and had undertaken to see that united Nations pilots in the Congo were instructed accordingly. On10th December, however, evidence had been received which pointedstrongly to fundamental differences of view between the united nations authorities in the Congo and the United Nations Secretariatin New York. In particular, Dr. Linner, the Civil Head of theUnited Nations Office in the Congo, had given an interview to aSwedish newspaper in the course of which he had said that thelong-term aim of the United Nations forces was to force a politicalsolution on the Katangans by smashing the present politicalleadership and their military strength. He had also maintained that united Nations officials in the Congo had carte blanche for theconduct of military operations there. The United kingdom representative at the United Nations had been asked to secure arepudiation of this statement from the Secretary-General. the resulting statement denied that a free hand had been given to the officials in the Congo, and also denied that the object of the Katangaoperations was to smash the present political leadership in Katangaand their military strength. But it was not entirely satisfactory to us,for it still left it open to United Nations forces to assume military control over the whole of Katanga on the ground that they weresecuring their lines of communication. The statement ended byappealing for help in achieving the aims of the United Nationspeacefully and speedily. Thus, the United Nations, which shoulditself be the mediator in international disputes, was now appealingfor mediation by a third party between itself and the Governmentof Katanga.The Prime Minister said that in the light of these developments the Cabinet would wish to review their decision to supply bombsto the United Nations forces. In discussion the following points were made:(a) For technical reasons bombs of the type which we had beenasked to supply were not the most suitable weapons to use againstindividual aircraft or against earth air-strips.(/?) Over the last three years the Indian Government had takendelivery of 4.500 bombs of this type; and it was estimated that they still had about 3.000 of them in stock.(c) The Government would be open to severe criticism if they now appeared to retract from the decision to supply these bombs.They would be said to have yielded to pressure from the supporters of Katangan independence both in Rhodesia and in the parliament at Westminster.(d) The United Nations had now said that they would not be ina position to collect any bombs we might agree to supply for anothereight or nine days. This put quite a different complexion on thenature of the emergency which had prompted the request for bombs.The Cabinet had been under the clear impression on 7th December
that United Nations forces were in extreme danger and that the bombs were required immediately.(e) In&quot;ahy public statement it would be important not to imply that the Government had changed their minds. It should be emphasised that agreement to supply bombs had been given under certain conditions. Recent statements by United Nationsrepresentatives in the Congo had cast some doubt on their intentionto see that those conditions were met. Until the position had beenclarified the bombs would not actually be delivered.(f) It was still the main object of our policy to negotiate a cease-fire and to arrange for a meeting between the Prime Minister of theCentral Government and the Prime Minister of Katanga. It hadbeen suggested that the British Consul in Elizabethville might act asan intermediary. It would be preferable, however, that such negotiations should be entrusted to someone of greater standing and authority: a past President of the United Nations, such as Mr. LesterPearson, might undertake this task.ig) An attempt would be made to move the adjournment of theHouse of Commons that afternoon, in order to debate the situation.This could probably be defeated if an assurance could be given thatthere was no question of the bombs leaving the United Kingdom forseveral days. The Government would, however, have to be preparedfor a full debate on 14th December.At this point the Lord Privy Seal reported the upshot of a telephone conversation with the Foreign Secretary, who was in Paris.The Foreign Secretary agreed that before the bombs were actuallydelivered it would be necessary to obtain further clarification bothof the attitude of the Secretary-General of the United Nations andof the intentions of the United Nations officials in the Congo. he favoured the suggestion that Mr. Lester Pearson might be appointedto mediate and to secure a cease-fire. He was in close touch withMr. Rusk, the United States Secretary of State, and if necessary heand Mr. Rusk would press for a meeting of the Security Council ofthe United Nations to be held later in the week.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that before any bombs left the United kingdom for the Congo it would be necessary to ensure that theUnited Nations authorities in the Congo clearly understood the conditions attached to their use and wereprepared to see that those conditions were met.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in the statement which he wasto make that afternoon in the House of Commons, to be guided by their views as expressed in discussion.Cabinet Office.
