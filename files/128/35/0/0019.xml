ParliamentSuccession toPeerages(previous reference:CC. (60) 59thConclusions,Minute 4)CC. 19 (61)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the first week after the Easter recess.The Home Secretary said that there would be an early debate on the report of the Committee of Privileges on the petitionconcerning Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn. The Committee had concluded that Mr. Wedgwood Benn was disqualified from membership of the House of Commons by succession to theViscounty of Stansgate and that the instrument in which he hadpurported to,,renounce his Peerage had no legal effect. They had recommended against the introduction of a retrospective Bill toenable Mr. Wedgwood Benn to remain a Member of the House ofCommons but had refrained from expressing any view on thedesirability of general legislation to enable those who succeeded toPeerages to remain Members of, and to be eligible for election to,the House of Commons. The simplest course would be for theGovernment to put down a Motion taking note of Mr. wedgwood benn&apos;s disqualification and approving the Committees report. Therewas, however, a substantial body of opinion, not only in theOpposition but among Government supporters, in favour of referringthe whole question to a joint committee of both Houses.Discussion showed that there was some support in the cabinet for the appointment of a joint committee, although the Governmentwould retain greater freedom of manoeuvre if the proposal were putforward in the form of an amendment moved by one of their supporters rather than by the Government themselves. The jointcommittee&apos;s terms of reference should be restricted to the future, soas to preclude their recommending legislation which would affectMr. Wedgwood Benn, but should be wide enough to allow all the implications of a change to be considered.On the other hand, it was at least possible that those whofavoured a change in the present law would be in a majority on anyjoint committee. The Government would therefore be unwise toagree to the appointment of a committee unless they were themselveswilling to accept some change. Before deciding this question theCabinet would need to give further consideration to the arguments on either side and to the balance of advantage, especially in relationto the influence which any change in the law might be expected tohave on the vitality and effectiveness with which the House of lords would be able in the future to discharge its functions.Summing up the discussion the Home Secretary said that thegeneral view of the Cabinet appeared to be in favour of a government motion noting the disqualification of Mr. Wedgwood Benn andapproving the report of the Committee of Privileges. He would,however, take an early opportunity to ascertain the strength of feeling among Government supporters in favour of appointing a jointcommittee to consider the desirability of changing the law for thefuture. There would be time before the debate for the Cabinet togive further consideration to this question, in the light of whateverinformation he was able to put before them.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary would ascertain the viewsof Government supporters on the proposal to appoint ajoint committee of both Houses to consider possiblechanges in the law of succession to Peerages.(2) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of thereport of the Committee of Privileges on the petitionconcerning Mr. Anthony Wedgwood Benn.
South-East *3.   The Lord Privy Seal said that the interview which theAsia Treaty Soviet Foreign Minister had had on the previous day with theOrganisation President of the United States had given little indication of the SovietLaos Governments attitude to the United Kingdom&apos;s proposals for a(Previous political settlement in Laos. It was, however, expected that the reference: Soviet Governmenfs reply would be received within a few days.C.C. (61) 18th President de Gaulle had meanwhile informed President Kennedy that conclusions)    he supported the United Kingdom&apos;s proposals, but was strongly opposed to intervention by the South-East Asia Treatv Organisation(SEATO) in Laos.The Foreign Secretary had reported that the United states secretary of State thought that the other SEATO countries shouldbe involved in military planning and that this should not take placeon a bilateral basis between the United Kingdom and United states military representatives, as had been envisaged by the Prime Ministerand President Kennedy. It would, in any case, be desirable for theAustralian and New Zealand authorities to be made aware in generalof any military planning between the United Kingdom and UnitedStates military authorities. If the other members of SEATO were involved, they would be likely to criticise the limited nature of themilitary plans which we had in mind. Meanwhile, president kennedy had suggested that bilateral military planning might more appropriately be conducted in Washington.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex2. The Home Secretary said that he intended to announce onthe following day that Lord Justice Romer had agreed to preside over the enquiry into security which it had been decided to appoint!following the recent case of espionage at the Admiralty UnderwaterWeapons Establishment, Portland. The proposed terms of reference of the enquiry were:&quot;To examine the circumstances relating to the breach of security which formed the subject of charges of espionagerecently tried at the Central Criminal Court; to consider whetherthose circumstances indicate negligence on the part of any individual; and to draw attention to any deficiencies in security arrangements which may be revealed by this case &quot;.In discussion it was agreed that there was no reason why theCommittee of Enquiry should not begin their work at once, althoughit would not be possible to make any public reference to their findingsuntil the appeals lodged by those convicted at the trial had been determined. Nor should the Committee&apos;s report be published atany time.In further discussion it was suggested that, although the proposed terms of reference gave effect to the intention announced by thePrime Minister on 23rd March and had been agreed with theChairman of the Committee of Enquiry, it might be desirable to make certain amendments to them, in order to ensure that all the relevantcircumstances could be examined.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Attorney-General and the Civil Lord of the Admiralty,would give further consideration to the terms of reference of the Committee of Enquiry into security which was tobe appointed as a result of the espionage case at theAdmiralty Underwater Weapons Establishment, Portland.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would announce theappointment of the Committee of Enquiry on thefollowing day.Security inthe PublicService(previous reference:CM.

EconomicSituation(previous reference:C.C. (60) 60thConclusions)PublicExpenditure4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 43) about future trends inGovernment expenditure in relation to national resources, togetherwith a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 44) covering a report by the committee under the chairmanship of Lord Plowdenabout the control of Government expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that in pursuanceof the principles suggested by the Plowden committee for ensuringgreater collective responsibility of Ministers for public expenditure and for appraising public expenditure as a whole over a number ofyears ahead, he had, with the help of the Colonial Secretary, theMinister of Housing and the Minister of Labour, made a preliminarystudy of the growth of expenditure in relation to the development ofthe economy and the implications for taxation and the internal and external financial position.The Treasury&apos;s survey showed that public expenditure, taken as a whole, would amount to  10.450 millions for 1961-62, of which about two-thirds would be met from the Exchequer. Assuming separately of growth of about 2-9 per cent, per year in the gross national product and a rate of increase in salaries and wages of about 5 percent, per year, which implied a continuation of an increase of about-7 per cent, per year in prices, public expenditure was likely toreach about  13.000 millions in 1965-66, an annual increase of over5i per cent. The increase in the ratio of public expenditure to the gross national product from 42-5 per cent, at present to 44 per cent,in 1965 would, on previous experience, lead to an increase in the weight of taxation, calling for the raising by taxation of an additional 450 millions more tharTthe present weight of taxation would yield.The Minister of Defence said that, even if the SEATO countries were involved in military planning, bilateral consultation between theUnited Kingdom and United States military authorities could nodoubt be preserved. He agreed that it would in any case be necessaryto keep the Australian and New Zealand Governments closelyinformed since their concurrence would be essential if theCommonwealth brigade were to be used.The Commonwealth Secretary agreed with these views, and pointed out that it would also be desirable to make the pakistan government aware, in general terms, of the fact that there was jointmilitary consultation between the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates authorities. He had now received a message from the PrimeMinister of India, which expressed some concern at the possibility that, unless the United Kingdom&apos;s proposals for a political settlement where accepted by the Soviet Government, it would be necessary forSEATO to intervene in Laos.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that planning for limited military intervention in Laosshould include consultation with the Australian and NewZealand authorities, and that the existence of suchplanning should be made known to the pakistan government.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal, in consultation with theCommonwealth Secretary and the Minister of Defence,to inform the Prime Minister, the Foreign Secretary and her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington of Conclusion(1) above.(3) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for joint planning for limited military intervention in Laos to be conducted in Washington.
9g3The pattern of economic trends on which this growth in public expenditure could most realistically be based called for an increasein the volume of exports to 5 - 4 per cent, per annum, which was aboutdouble the rate of increase over the last few years. It was difficultto believe that this substantial improvement in exports could beachieved, but without it we could not sustain an adequate growth inthe gross national product and should probably be forced to restricteconomic growth in order to protect our external financial position.It therefore followed that, on present trends and policies in wages,consumption and public expenditure, there did not seem a sound basis for the economy in the coming years.The Chancellor said that he was not concerned at present to formulate policies to deal with this situation. But it was clear thatthe future size and shape of public expenditure would be of critical importance. It was particularly important to make the nationalised industries pay their way, since this could result in an enormous saving to the Exchequer and a direct help to the growth of the economy.It would also be necessary to review the direction of public expenditure in private industry and agriculture, and to examine whether our scientific and technological resources were deployed inthe manner best calculated to improve our competitive power and export prospects. He suggested that, in the light of this preliminarystudy, the next step should be to instruct officials to build up a plan for the development of the public sector and its expenditure over thenext four years, and to examine the best methods for financing it.This plan should initially be based on maintaining the present ratio of public expenditure to the gross national product of 42-5 per cent.,and should show what the implications would be for taxation andfor the balance of payments.Discussion showed that the Cabinet welcomed the study whichthe Chancellor of the Exchequer had made, in accordance with therecommendations of the Plowden committee, of the future trend ofpublic expenditure. In further discussion the following points weremade:(a) The estimate of future expenditure assumed, no doubtrightly, a high rate of increase in earnings. One of the mostimportant problems was how to explain to industry that there mustbe a reasonable limit to the rate of increase in earnings if inflationwere to be avoided and a satisfactory rate of economic growthmaintained. It was intended that the Economic Policy Committeeshould resume their discussion of wages policy at an early date.(b) The Minister of Education said that there was a widely feltneed for a general financial and economic strategy for the nation.It was necessary to adopt a positive and constructive attitude to public expenditure in order to ensure that it made the bestcontribution to the growth of the national product and the strengthening of the balance of payments. Instead of seeking to balance a number of conflicting priorities, it would be advisable inpresent circumstances to concentrate on the overriding need toencourage exports. To give clear priority to the encouragement of exports would have direct implications on the form of taxation, cnwages policy, and on expenditure on research and development.(c) It was generally recognised that the imposition of effectivefinancial disciplines on the nationalised industries would affordsignificant relief to the Exchequer.(d) The Minister for Science said that it would be amisconception to apply the criterion of commercial value in seeking to redeploy expenditure on scientific and technological research. Hewould give his views on this aspect of the study to the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.(e) It was pointed out that the most alarming feature of the studywas that the balance of payments prospects made it extremely
CC. 19 (61)doubtful whether a satisfactory rate of economic growth could be sustained. It seemed essential to obtain some greater freedom ofmanoeuvre in our external financial position. This might possibly be achieved&quot;by a reform of the existing system of internationalpayments and the expansion of the world credit base by some meanswhich would materially improve our export prospects. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that consideration was atpresent being given to the problems of international liquidity andimbalance, and to the possibility of remedial action such as the greater use of the resources of the International Monetary Fund.The Cabinet- -(1) Took note of C. (61) 43 and 44.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials to work out a plan for the development of thepublic sector and its expenditure over the next four years,on the assumption that the ratio of public expenditure to the gross national product should remain at 42-5 percent.; to examine methods of financing such expenditure;and to report on the implications for economic growth,taxation and the balance of payments.nationalised industries(previous reference:CC. (61) 15thConclusions,Minute 4)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 47) covering a revised draft white Paper on the nationalised industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as he had suggestedin the Cabinefs discussion of the previous item, the definition of effective financial objectives for the nationalised industries wouldprovide a significant relief to the Exchequer and enable the nationalised industries to make a better contribution to the growth of the national economy.  This aim would be best promoted bya White Paper, publication of which was desirable also on parliamentary grounds and from the point of view of public relations.On reflection, he accepted the view that a specific reference to a standard of 8 per cent, return on capital employed might provokepublic argument with some of the Boards and thereby prejudice the effectiveness of the White Paper.   This reference had accordingly been omitted from the revised draft, and the figure of 8 per cent, was now mentioned only as a factual example of the return which certain of the nationalised undertakings had been able to earn.  As regardsthe Governmenfs power to influence price policies, it was thought likely that some at any rate of the Boards would object to more precise and public financial obligations being placed upon themunless they had an assurance that, when the Government felt obligedto prevent them from making price increases and thereby had a significant effect on the Board&apos;s finances, this intei vention should be publicly acknowledged, if the Boards so wished.  It should be understood that publicity for any such intervention would only benecessary when it was made significantly harder for the Boards to achieve their targets, and such action would not necessarily be unpopular.   The draft White Paper had been further revised to minimise any risk that the right which the Boards would have to askfor commercially unprofitable activities to be taken into accountmight enable them to avoid complying with their financial obligations.In discussion it was argued that the implementation of the policy proposed in the White Paper would undoubtedly entail higher prices for the products and services of the nationalised industries, and thatthese increases might have to be accepted at inconvenient times. Itwas pointed out, on the other hand, that Government interventionto avoid significant price increases or to direct the Beards to continue
uneconomic services for social reasons would not necessarily be unpopular and could be openly acknowledged. In any case, it was an essential corollary of the policies in the White Paper that theGovernment should announce their belief that the nationalised industries should be free to determine their own price policies. Itshould be generally understood thatt except in the case of a truemonopoly such as the London Passenger Transport Board, therewould as a general rule be no interference with the freedom of the nationalised industries in this respect. If, as an exception,Government intervention became necessary, this should be capableof reasonable explanation. In this connexion it was agreed that theMinister concerned, as well as a Board, should have the right to publish the Governmenfs views where these had induced a board to modify their proposals for price changes.It was pointed out that the adoption of the policies of the white paper might lead some of the Boards to press for the removal of otherrestraints on their commercial freedom. The air corporations, forexample, might decline to operate uneconomic aircraft, and theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation might seek a capital reconstruction. Nevertheless, it was the general view of the Cabinetthat the new, financial policies proposed for the nationalised industries should be published in the form of a White Paper, and that it shouldbe made clear that the Government proposed in general to give the boards freedom to determine prices.The Cabinet (1) Approved the White Paper attached to C. (61) 47, subject tothe amendment agreed in their discussion, for publication.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, at an appropriate time, to announce the Governmenfs intention to give the nationalised industries freedom to determine prices.TheCommon-wealth(previous reference:C.C. (59) 57thConclusions,Minute 8)Nomenclature6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C. (61) 46) about the use of the designation&quot; United Kingdom &quot;.The Commonwealth Secretary suggested that in our relationswith Commonwealth countries we should cease to refer to the&quot; United Kingdom &quot; a designation which he regarded as lacking inpopular appeal and use instead the terms &quot; Britain &quot; and &quot; British &quot;.The proposed change was supported by the High Commissioners in commonwealth countries and had been agreed by the HomeSecretary (in relation to Northern Ireland), the Foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade.Discussion showed that, although the change might be less thanwholly welcome to the members both of the &quot; old &quot; and of the &quot; new &quot;Commonwealth and although it would be preferable to make no formal announcement, this proposal was generally acceptable to theCabinet. For the purposes, however, of treaties and other legaldocuments, for the definition of citizenship and in our relations with countries outside the Commonwealth, in particular for the purposesof international organisations and conferences, the term &quot; UnitedKingdom &quot; should be retained.The Home Secretary said that this question was likely to be ofinterest to the Prime Minister. No final decision should therefore betaken until his views were known.The Cabinet-Took note that the Home Secretary would inform thePrime Minister that they were generally in favour of theproposal put forward in C. (61) 46.
CC. 19 (61)Education 7.   The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a large body(Previous       of teachers in Scotland were threatening to withdraw their servicesReference:      for a week in the early part of May.  The purpose of the threat,CC. (61) 2nd   which was not supported by the organisations officially representingConclusions.    the teachers, was to put pressure on him both to accelerate the currentMinute 5)       negotiations on the Scottish teachers&apos; pay claim and to undertakeScottish        to give no further consideration to the introduction of non-graduateTeachers       men teachers in Scottish schools. There was, however, no room forconcession on either point.  The negotiations on the pay claim were proceeding normally and to attempt to accelerate them wouldembarrass both the parallel negotiations in England and Wales andthe Government^ general economic policy.  The possibility of introducing non-graduate men teachers had already been put forwardpublicly by the Government as one of several proposals for discussion in a review of the whole field of teacher training in Scotland.  Hehad undertaken, when the current round of consultations was completed, to put recommendations before all the interests concerned for further discussion before taking any action.  The matter was tobe the subject of debate in the House of Commons, and he proposedthat, even at the risk of precipitating a teachers&apos; strike, he shouldmake neither of the concessions which had been demanded.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Secretaryof State for Scotland.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,28th March, 1961.
