ContentsWages Policy
5962a-11C.C. 48 (61)Wages Polky The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandum by(Previous the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 128) on the means ofReference: securing a pause in increases of wages and salaries in the publicCC (61) 47th sector. They had before them a further memorandum by theConclusions. Chancellor (C. (61) 129) covering a draft statement to be minute l)      communicated to the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on the previous day,with the Minister of Transport and the Minister of Power, he had discussed with the chairmen of the nationalised industries theproblems which would arise from forthcoming wage claims in those industries. It was likely that a claim on behalf of railway employeeswould be presented in the latter part of August, but some weekswould probably elapse before this came to a head. It was possible,though not very likely, that an earlier claim would be made in the gas industry. The miners&apos; unions had given notice to terminatecompulsory arbitration and were likely to submit a wage claim inSeptember, but negotiations would not come to a head until the endof the year. It was likely that a wage claim in the electricity industry would be the earliest for decision: the claim had been submitted on 20th July and the negotiating machinery would have to be broughtinto operation by 20th September. Since productivity in theelectricity industry was satisfactory, it would not be easy to withstanda claim, especially as earnings were not excessive. Although theBoard&apos;s representatives would seek to protract negotiations into thefollowing year, there was a serious risk of strike action in thisessential industry during the autumn.As regards employments under the Governments direct control,it would be necessary to define carefully those in which theGovernment had accepted a specific commitment. In some casesthe commitment was to implement arbitration awards or to acceptthe results of arbitration; in others the commitment was to negotiate on the basis of a pay research survey. The Government must nowexplain to the Staff Side of the National Whitley Council and tothe equivalent body for industrial civil servants what their policy would be towards other wage claims in employments over whichthe Government had direct control. The statement of policy whichhe proposed would indicate that the Government would look at eachcase individually, with the need for a pause in increases in personal incomes in mind: that the existing negotiating machinery would continue to function: but that in the event of arbitration the Govern-ment must, on grounds of public policy, for the time being reserve to themselves the final decision about the timing for putting an arbitration aware! into effect.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet on this questioncontinued to be divided. On the one hand it was argued that thispolicy of retaining Government control over the liming of the implementation of wage awards would lead to ,m accumulation of awards, which might be even larger than would otherwise be diecase because of the knowledge that they were to be deferred. the timing was often an essential element in an award, and this policy would encroach upon the principle of arbitration. It was divublfulwhether the precedents afforded grounds for retaining control of timing as a mailer of public policy. It would be difficult to commandpublic support for the deferment of an arbitration award, once theamount of it had been decided. On these grounds it was argued that there was much to be said for announcing that the process ofarbitration as a whole would be suspended, while other negotiatingprocesses would be allowed to continue.The Colonial Secretary said that to interfere with arbitration,whether by suspending it altogether for a period or by reservingcontrol over the timing of the implementation of awards, would be
a major departure from long-standing policy. In view of the verysmall proportion of wage increases which were the result ofarbitration, it would be an ineffectual method of influencing wage negotiations as a whole. It would be preferable for the Governmentto give a lead to the private sector by taking an early opportunityof rejecting some claim in the public sector and thus demonstratingtheir intention to take a firm line in respect of wages within their control.On the other side it was argued that if, soon after their general statement about the need for a pause in wage increases, theGovernment authorised a significant wage increase in the public sector in pursuance of an arbitration award, this would be taken by private industry as an indication that the Government were not determined to see their policy through. In the present economicsituation the Government were fully justified in retaining controlover the implementation of arbitration awards, on grounds of public policy. It would be undesirable to suspend the process of arbitration in its entirety, since this would be widely resented as an attack onthe system of collective bargaining. To retain control over the implementation of an award could be presented as being consistent with maintaining the principle of arbitration. At the same time, ithad to be borne in mind that one of the main purposes of a pausewas to allow time for the Government, in consultation with industry,to evolve some method of containing increases in incomes withinthe increase in national productivity. This implied a need for theGovernment in some way to control the amount, as well as the timing, of wage awards. It would therefore be essential, if theGovernment were to decide not to suspend arbitration entirely, towithdraw from arbitrators the staging, as well as the timing, of the implementation of awards; this would provide the best hope of avoiding the need for full implementation, at the end of a period ofa pause, of wage awards which had been deferred.It was also suggested that it would be helpful if, in stating their intention to withdraw from arbitrators the timing and staging of wage awards, the Government were to add that they proposed to seek the co-operation of the Staff Side in working out the changes of procedure which might be needed in order to attain the long-term objective of containing increases in incomes within the increase in national productivity. This intention might best be carried out ifthe Chancellor of the Exchequer were personally to meet, later inthe month, representatives of the Staff Side, before the Government^intentions were formally communicated to them, to explain his proposals.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasthe general view of the Cabinet that, in order to avoid any suspicion that the Government were not giving a lead, some means of controlling arbitration was necessary, and that the least objectionablemethod of doing this would be to seek to control the timing andstaging of awards. The Staff Side of the Wuitley Council should he informed that during the pause the Government must, on grounds of public policy, withdraw the timing and staging of the implementation of awards from the terms of reference of arbitrators.An offer should be made to discuss with the Staff Side the means bywhich effect could be given, in the Civil Service, to the aim ofcontaining increases in incomes within the increase in national productivity. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would consider thesuggestion that he should meet the Staff Side representativespersonally, later in the month, in order to explain the government&apos;s policy.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Staff Side of the Civil Service national whitley Council and the Trade Union Side of the Joint
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th August, 1961.CC. 48 (61)Consultative Council should be informed that during thepause the Government must, on grounds of public policy,withdraw the timing and staging of the implementation of awards from the terms of reference of arbitrators.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to meet the staff side representatives personally, later in the month, toexplain the Governmenfs policy.
