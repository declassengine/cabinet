SubjectGhanaThe Queen&apos;s Visit
Ghana The Prime Minister said that, in view of the explosions whichThe Queen&apos;s had occurred in Accra in the early hours of 5th November, he hadVisit asked the Commonwealth Secretary to make a further personal visit(Previous, to Ghana so that he might consider on the spot whether these should reference: be regarded as evidence of a change in the local situation whichCC. (61) 59th would make it advisable for the Cabinet to modify their earlier adviceConclusions. that the forthcoming Royal visit should not be cancelled.Minute 4)The Cabinet expressed their gratitude to the commonwealth secretary for his readiness to make this further journey at short notice, and their appreciation of the thoroughness with which hehad carried out his mission.The Commonwealth Secretary said that during the two dayswhich he had spent in Accra he had undertaken three tasks.First, he had made a fresh review of the security situation. Hehad discussed it with President Nkrumah, the Minister of the Interior,the Chief of the Ghana Police and the Irishman who had previouslycommanded, and now adviseJ, its Special Branch. In addition hehad held full consultations with the High Commissioner and his staff,with the two representatives of the Special Branch of theMetropolitan Police who were now in Ghana and with the localrepresentative of the British Security Service. As a result he was satisfied that the recent explosions in Accra should not be regardedas a new development involving an increased danger to The Queen&apos;ssafety, over and above the risk inevitably involved in any Royaljourney of this kind. He thought it likeiy that they were the workof minority factions in Ghana who were anxious that The Queen&apos;visit should be cancelled so that public discredit could be broughtupon the President. He had also ascertained that the representativesof the Metropolitan Police were fully satisfied with the character,scale and efficiency of the precautions which were to be taken toensure The Queen&apos;s safety.Secondly, he had sought to test the theory that PresidentNkrumah was living in fear of assassination and reluctant on that account to appear in public. He had persuaded the President to travel with him in an open car. with little police protection, overthe route which The Queen would follow in Accra and on her journeyto Tema. This tour was widely advertised in advance and largegroups had assembled at many points on the route. The president had throughout received an enthusiastic welcome. In the result ithad been demonstrated, in a practical and effective way, that he couldmove freely among the people without fear of violence and that hewas still a most popular figure in his country.Thirdly, he had satisfied himself that the President had no immediate intention of proposing any further constitutional changein Ghana. He based this view, not only on the personal assuranceswhich he had obtained from the President, but also on the degree towhich the Commonwealth connexion was being emphasised in the preparations for The Queeifs visit. President Nkrumah had alsoassured him that the White Paper on the recent strikes at Takoradiwould not include any serious allegations against British officialagencies, and had offered to let him see a draft of this documentbefore publication.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in the light of all thathe had learned during this second visit to Accra, he could confidentlyrecommend that the Cabinet should reaffirm their earlier advice thatThe Queen should proceed with her visit.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were agreed that, despite the recent explosions in Accra, there were no sufficient reasons for advising The Queen to cancel her forthcoming visit to Ghana.
The Prime Minister said that he would at once inform her majesty accordingly, and would make a statement in this sense in theHouse of Commons that afternoon. This was likely to provoke a request for facilities to debate this question on the Adjournment; andit must be expected that sufficient support would be forthcoming toenable this request to be sustained. In that event the commonwealth secretary would inform the House of the upshot of his recentenquiries in Accra, and he himself would speak at a later stage inreply to the debate. It was possible that the debate would not befollowed by a division.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their earlier decision that The Queen shouldnot be advised to cancel her forthcoming visit to Ghana.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would advise The Queenaccordingly and would make a statement to this effect in the House of Commons that afternoon.Cabinet Office, S.W.L8th November, 1961.
