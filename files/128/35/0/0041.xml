Tunisia(previous reference:CC. (58) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)CC. 41 (61)1. The Foreign Secretary said that fighting had now broken out at Bizerta, where the Tunisians were seeking to dislodge French troops from the naval base. Bizerta was under Tunisian sovereignty. the base was not at the disposal of the North Atlantic Alliance, and members of the Alliance were not under any treaty obligation to goto the assistance of the French. The Tunisians had reported theposition to the Security Council, and an awkward political situation was likely to arise there. He was considering what line the UnitedKingdom representative should take.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Parliament 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons before Parliament rose for the summer recess.On 26th and 27th July there would be a debate on the economicsituation. In the week beginning 31st July there would be a debate on the European Economic Community. It was hoped that parliament would adjourn for the summer recess on 3rd August.Post OfficeTariffs(previous reference:CC. (61) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Postmaster-General (C. (61) 93) proposing increases in certainPost Office tariffs, and also had before them further memoranda bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Postmaster-General(C. (61) 98 and 101).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, since the Cabinefslast discussion, he had given further consideration to the proposed increases in certain telephone and postal charges in relation to hisown plans for dealing with the economic situation. He was satisfiedthat, far from being inconsistent with the measures he intended tointroduce, the proposed increases were essential and in accord withthe Governmenfs policy on the finances of the nationalised industries.If the increases were postponed until the autumn, there would be a loss of some il\ millions in receipts. He therefore invited the Cabinetto approve the proposed increases, which it would be convenient to announce before his own statement on the economic situation.The Postmaster-General said that he saw no alternative to introducing the increased charges before the end of the present financial year. He had given further consideration to the proposedflat-rate increase in the charge for parcels and ^as satisfied that asystem of graduated increases related to the weight of the parcel wouldnot be practicable.Discussion showed that there was general agreement in theCabinet with these proposals. There might, however, be some advantage in mitigating the impact of the new connexion charge forlong rural telephone lines if it were made payable by instalments.On presentation of the decision to increase the charges, thefollowing points were made:(a) The statement should make it clear that the extra charges were necessary to avert a sharp increase in the extent to which thePost Office was dependent for its finance on the Exchequer.(b) It would be preferable to refer only to a &quot; reasonable return on capital &quot; rather than to emphasise the figure of 8 per cent.
EconomicSituation(previous references:CC. (61) 37thConclusions,Minute 1 and cc. (60) 62ndConclusions,Minute 7.)*4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (61) 88) on the economic situation.They also had before them further memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer on public expenditure (C. (61) 106 and 107).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the statement onthe economic situation which he proposed to make in the House ofCommons on 25th July he would announce a number of measures designed both to relieve the pressure on sterling, which was more serious than at any time since the devaluation in 1949, and to demonstrate the Governments intention to put the economy on a sound basis for the future. He proposed to justify these measures by reference to the urgent need to restore international confidence in sterling and to the undoubted evidence of excessive pressure on national resources.The Chancellor said that he had held separate discussions withthe Ministers concerned about the details of the specific measures hehad in mind. In one or two cases these had still to be completed.He proposed, however, to announce in his statement his intention to restrict Government expenditure overseas to not more than  400millions in 1962-63. This would involve giving notice, in terms which ,he had agreed with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence,that we should seek relief, in accordance with the provisions of theTreaty of Western European Union, in respect of our military expenditure in Europe, and that there was to be a general review ofdefence expenditure overseas. It would also include notice of his intention to restrict the total of our oversea aid to approximately the current level of  180 millions a year. He also wished to secure areduction in diplomatic, administrative and information services overseas; and on this a special directive would be issued by the PrimeMinister.As regards credit restrictions, he would in due course decide whether it would be appropriate to increase the Bank Rate and to raisethe level of the banks&apos; special deposits scheme. The Governor of theBank of England would be prepared to ask the clearing banks and building societies to observe restraint in meeting certain types of demand for credit for consumption purposes, and it could if necessaryO* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET(c) Reference should be made to the cost of wage increases sincethe last increase in Post Office charges.(d) If it were reasonably certain that Post Office charges neednot be again increased within the next two years, this might be indicated in The statement.The Cabinet (I) Approved the proposals in C. (61) 93 for increases in certainPost Office tariffs.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to consider the possibility ofmaking the new connexion charge for rural telephonespayable by instalments.(3) Invited the Postmaster-General, in consultation with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster and the FinancialSecretary, Treasury, to give further consideration, in thelight of their discussion, to the terms in which theincreased charges should be announced.(4) Subject to the further consideration referred to inconclusion (3), authorised the Postmaster-General to announce the increased charges on 24th July.
C.C. 41 (61)be made clear that, if this request was not met, the Government wouldnot hesitate to enforce credit restraint by other means. There were strong arguments for bringing into effect the new economic regulatorwhich would enable him to impose a surcharge, at a maximum rateof 10 per cent., on most Customs and Excise duties and purchase tax.It would also be necessary to take effective action to deal withthe growth of public expenditure. In the light of presentcircumstances, further reductions would be required in the investment programmes previously proposed by the Treasury for 1962-63. Asregards the nationalised industries, he had invited the ministers concerned to ask the various boards to avoid expenditure whereverthis could be -done without damage to the provision of essential supplies and services and the attainment of their financial targets. Hewas seeking the agreement of the Education Ministers to keepingcapital investment to the level of the current year, and to givingpriority to the development of technical education. Expenditure on housing in England and Wales should be reduced to  225 millions and in Scotland to  42 millions. The Minister of Health had agreedthat the annual growth of expenditure on the Health Service shouldbe kept to 2\ per cent., and he hoped to reach agreement with theMinister of Transport on a substantial reduction in the five-year road programme.As regards Exchequer assistance to private industry, he proposedto announce that new commitments for assistance could only bejustified if it could be shown that they would make an important contribution to competitiveness and national efficiency which couldbe secured in no other way; but he would be prepared to indicatethat the Government would still consider exceptional applications in areas of especially high unemployment, such as parts of Scotland andNorthern Ireland. It would also be necessary to indicate theGovernment^ intention to restrict Exchequer support for agriculture,and he would discuss further with the Minister of Agriculture how this could best be done.In order to convince public opinion, both at home and overseas,that we would not allow public expenditure to rise beyond control, itwould be important to announce the Governmenfs determination tokeep the increase of Estimates for 1962-63, in real terms, to within2\ per cent, of the Estimates for the current year. This limitedincrease could be justified, since it would be offset by savings whichwould arise from the completion of the financing of the new steelworks and the suspension of the house purchase scheme. It hadfrankly to be recognised that to keep public expenditure within thislimit would entail substantial policy changes, as yet undecided, in thesocial services. It might, for instance, be necessary to contemplate the abolition of family allowances for the second child, although this might be accompanied by more generous provision for subsequent children. The need to contain public expenditure might alsonecessitate some further reduction in defence expenditure.The ability of the Government to secure moderation in wage increases would be crucial. In consultation with the Minister ofLabour, he hoped to formulate an appeal for a pause in increases in wages, profits and dividends. For this purpose it would be necessaryfor the Government to give a firm lead in wage negotiations in the sector over which they exercised control. In this connexion it wouldbe a great value if it could be announced that the Government werenot prepared to agree to increases in teachers&apos; salaries as large asthose already offered by the local education authorities. He also proposed to include in his statement an acknowledgment of the needfor improved co-ordination of economic planning. He intended to invite representatives of employers and unions to join him inconsultations to devise means to this end.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his advisers weredoubtful whether measures on the above lines would be sufficient tomeet the needs of the present situation. He mentioned a number ofadditional fiscal and other measures which might be considered.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was general agreement that there would be severedisadvantages in using the second economic regulator providing for asurcharge on employers&apos; contributions under the National Insurancescheme. Although it could reduce purchasing power by about  200millions a year, it would appear to add to industrial costs, which was highly undesirable. If it were proposed to use this, furtherconsideration by the Cabinet would be necessary.(b) The President of the Board of Trade said that theGovernment would be better able to claim that they were dealing withthe economic situation on a national basis if some assurance couldbe given that means would be found of taxing short-term capital gains.It would be very difficult to secure wage restraint if capital profitsobtained through speculation continued to be allowed to go free of tax.There was general agreement that, although a capital gains tax on the United States pattern might not be administratively practicable,it was highly desirable that profits from short-term investments, in stocks or in land, should by some means be made liable to taxation.In the absence of a satisfactory assurance on this, the public wouldnot regard the measures now proposed as equitable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to examine thispoint and to consider what reference could be made to it in his proposed statement.(c) The agreement of the Cabinet that the increase in theEstimates for 1962-63 should be kept within 2\ per cent, of theEstimates for the current year should not be held to imply approval for the specific suggestion that family allowances for the second childshould be abolished.(d) It was suggested that, since credit restrictions could not be relied on to control the excessive pressure on the building industry,it would be prudent to prepare for the introduction of buildinglicensing in the autumn if necessary. It might be enough to exercise control only over the larger building projects (say, costing  250,000 ormore). Apart from administrative difficulties, there were arguments against introducing building controls, since the industry had respondedwell to the pressure of increasing demand by substantially increasingits productivity.(e) There was general agreement that the Government should give a firm lead on wages policy in the public sector. There was goodhope that a considerable degree of co-operation in wage restraintcould be secured in the public sector, in the context of a policy forrestraint in wages and profits generally.The Minister of Education said that he would be prepared to withhold his agreement to the increase in teachers&apos; salaries which hadbeen offered by the local education authorities, and to restrict thecost of the increase in England and Wales to  42 millions, whichwould involve a lower maximum salary and restrict the increase tothe level already conceded to teachers in Scotland.(/) It was suggested that, while restrictive measures wereunavoidable to meet the critical exchange position, the fundamentalweakness of the economy was not so much excessive demand as thefailure of production to respond to demand. The proposed remedial measures might be criticised on the ground that they were not designedto encourage economic growth. In this connexion it might be advantageous to take action to control restrictive practices in industry.
LocalGovernmentOrganisationGreaterLondon(previous reference:CC. (61) 39thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (61) 100) reporting the results of the discussions whichhe had held with the Ministers most directly concerned on theproposals for the reorganisation of local government in greater london.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that he didnot wish to be finally committed to all the details of therecommendations made in C. (61) 100. He would prefer that theCabinet should take their decisions on this question on the basis ofa draft White Paper, and he sought authority to submit such a draft frr detailed consideration at a later meeting.In discussion it was pointed out that it would not now be possibleto present a White Paper on this question before Parliament rose forCC. 41 (61)On the other hand it was argued that legislation to control suchrestrictive practices would be likely to alienate the unions at a timewhen our economic difficulties required a national approach. Theproblems of economic growth might best be approached by improving the co-ordination of economic planning, in the way proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer. However, our economic difficultiescould not be ascribed to the lack of economic planning or to poorco-ordination; they arose from excessive demand and a failure ofcompetitiveness and productivity.(g) It was suggested that the restriction of demand could be made more effective if more drastic use were made of the special depositssystem. On the other hand, the clearing banks were only one of theorgans creating credit, and it was not possible for them suddenly to effect a large reduction in the commitments they had already undertaken. It would be no help to the Government if, in order toobtain more liquid resources, they were forced to sell their holdings of Government securities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that the collection of measures to be announced by the Chancellor of the Exchequer must be sufficient to convinceopinion, at home and abroad, that the excessive pressures on the economy would be brought under control. It would be of greatimportance to show that the difficulties were being dealt with on anational basis. There was a widespread feeling that profits fromshort-term investment should not be allowed to escape taxation. Itwas essential to secure a substantial degree of wage restraint, by whatever means, but this could best be achieved if people were convinced that the Governmenfs policy was fair to all sections ofthe community. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should therefore consider the possibility of bringing speculatory capital gains withinthe tax system. It would be right to point out that a considerable partof the demand on our economic resources arose from the international commitments which we continued to undertake, despite the fact thatour relative position in the world had substantially declined. Thetask was, therefore, to demonstrate to the country that theGovernment were taking the economic situation seriously, in orderto fulfil their international responsibilities.The Cabinet would have a further opportunity to discuss thesituation, and the measures proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer, on 24th July.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion on 24th July.
Trade UnionElections(previous reference:C.C. (61) 40thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Minister of Labour (C. (61) 95) about trade union elections.They also had before them further memoranda by the Minister ofLabour and the Attorney-General (C. (61) 102 and 99).The Minister of Labour said that, since the Cabinefs earlier discussion, he had informed the Trades Union Congress (T.U.C.) and announced in Parliament that if the unions could take effective actionto prevent breaches of their election rules this would, in his view, bethe most satisfactory solution. If, however, there were difficultieswhich made this impracticable he would propose to consider with theT.U.C. means by which the Government could help. The general secretary, with whom he had discussed the matter in advance, had shown himself strongly opposed to any action by the Government,on the-ground that it would be an unwarranted attack on theindependence of the unions. The attempt now being made by theT.U.C. to put in order the affairs of the Electrical Trades Union(E.T.U.) was, however, unlikely to succeed and there was little reasonto expect that they would be able, or even willing, to persuade theunions generally to adopt model rules for their elections. He proposedthat, if they Could be induced to discuss the matter with him, he should seek their views on legislation to empower the Registrar of friendly societies to hear complaints about breaches of the election rules andto make orders remedying any breach. Since this power was alreadypossessed by the Courts, it could not reasonably be represented asan infringement of the unions&apos; freedom; but any proposal to go furtherwould be likely to encounter a degree of hostility which it would be unwise to provoke, especially in view of the difficulties on theindustrial front which might arise in the current economic situation.The Attorney-General suggested that simply to confer on the registrar the powers now exercised by the Courts would have littleadvantage, especially as legal aid would not be available in proceedings before the Registrar. Nor could this proposal do anything to securethat the election rules were themselves satisfactory a need which had become apparent in the E.T.U. case. He therefore proposed that the registrar should be given the duty, not to approve, but to examinethe rules and report, if necessary in public, on any which were sounintelligible, unworkable or contradictory as to impede the lawfulexercise by the members of their right to elect their representatives infull freedom. This alone, however, could not ensure that the electionswere properly conducted, and the Attorney-General therefore proposed further that the Registrar should be empowered to superviseelections, if invited by a union to do so at its own expense. Thesetwo proposals together would, he thought, be acceptable to publicopinion and difficult for the unions to reject.Discussion showed it to be the general view of the Cabinet thatno decision should be taken on the alternative proposals before them until more was known of the likely attitude of the T.U.C., and of whatever progress they might make in remedying the position in theE.T.U. Meanwhile, if they could be persuaded to discuss the matter with the Minister of Labour, there would be no objection to hisputting before them both his own proposal, for which the judgement in the E.T.U. case provided a firm foundation, and also those of thethe summer recess. It might however be desirable to publish it beforeParliament reassembled in the autumn.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government to circulate, for consideration at a later meeting, a draft white paper on the reorganisation of local government in greater london.
CC. 41 (61)Attorney-General. Meanwhile, in any discussion with their supporters in Parliament, the Government should not be finallycommitted to legislation.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to approach the Trades UnionCongress on the question of trade union elections, on thelines agreed in their discussion, and to inform them of the outcome.(2) AgreerJ to resume at a later meeting their consideration ofC. (61) 95, 99 and 102 in the light of the discussion referredto in conclusion (1).BritishSugarCorporation(previous references:CC. (61) 30thConclusions,Minute 4 and cc (61) 27thConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Agriculture (C. (61) 105) about the reconstruction of theBritish Sugar Corporation.The Minister of Agriculture recalled that, in accordance withdecisions of the Cabinet, the Chairman of the British sugar corporation had been authorised to discuss confidentially, first withrepresentatives of insurance companies and investment trusts and laterwith an organised minority group of private shareholders who were pressing for an increase in the dividend, proposals for a capitalreorganisation of the Corporation. Under this the ordinary shareswould be converted into cumulative preference shares bearing interestof 8 per cent, instead of the present 7 per cent., and the equity wouldbe surrendered to the Sugar Board. In the light of these consultationsthe Chairman considered that the necessary majority could probablybe obtained for the proposals at a special General Meeting; but theMinister did not consider that the present economic circumstance were opportune for pressing forward with the reorganisation, andthe Chairman had accepted that it should be deferred. The Chairmanhad, however, suggested that his statement to the shareholders might include an assurance that the Board would raise the matter againwith the Government as soon as circumstances permitted.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (61) 105 and, subject to theaddition mentioned by the Minister of Agriculture, the draft statement annexed to it, to be made by the Chairman of theBritish Sugar Corporation.8. The Minister of Transport said that he had been approached by Mr. Charles Clore, who wished to take over British Road Services(Parcels) Limited commonly known as &quot; Carter Paterson &quot; whichwas owned by the British Transport Commission. Although theCommission were under a statutory obligation to dispose of theundertaking, the Minister did not consider that the time was opportune for selling it to Mr. Clore. He therefore proposed to refuse the offer on the ground that, by waiting, the Commission could obtain a morefavourable price.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the Ministerof Transport.british transport commission(previous reference:CC (61) 20thConclusions,Minute 6.)
