1. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Joint parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Lord Lansdowne, had had discussions with the Prime Minister and other representatives ofthe Central Congo Government and with the United Nationsrepresentatives there, but it had not been possible fully to ascertain the origin of the military action taken by United Nations forces against the administration in Katanga. The local representatives ofthe United Nations had been given a considerable measure of discretion by the late Secretary-General, Mr. Hammarksjoeld, and it seemed clear that some of them, notably Dr. 0&apos;Brien, had exceededtheir authority in implementing the instructions of the Central CongoGovernment and in using military force unnecessarily. They hadcertainly misjudged the reaction of the Katangan Government.Mr. Hammarskjoeld had realised the urgent need to bring hostilitiesto an end and had taken the initiative in seeking a meeting withthe Prime Minister of the provincial government of Katanga,Mr. Tshombe; it had been arranged, with the help of Lord Lansdowneand the Government of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland,that such a meeting should be held at Ndola.The United Nations aircraft in which Mr. Hammarskjoeld hadbeen killed had taken a circuitous route from Leopoldville, but hadbeen in contact with Salisbury and Ndola airfields and was apparentlyabout to land when it met with an accident. There was so far no evidence of sabotage or interference by other aircraft. It was hopedthat the investigation of the accident which had already begun wouldbe broadened to include British, Swedish and United Nationsrepresentatives, so that it would have the authority of a high-levelenquiry with international representation.The situation in Katanga was still confused; the United NationsIrish contingent had surrendered at Jadotville, but fighting was still continuing in Kamina and sporadically in Elizabethvitle. We had urged Mr. Tshombe to do everything possible to enforce a cease-fire,and to bring to an end the operations of the fighter aircraft, thought to have been piloted by Rhodesian and Belgian pilots, which hadbeen indulging in uncontrolled action against the United Nationsrepresentatives and forces. The piratical nature of the operations ofthese aircraft had made it expedient for us to agree to allow a limited number of Ethiopian trainer fighter aircraft, together with theiraccompanying transport aircraft, to overtly Kenya and to refuel in uganda, on the strict understanding, to which Mr. Hammarskjoeldhad agreed in writing, that they would be used only to neutralise the fighter aircraft purporting to operate on behalf of the Katangan forces.In fact, the Ethiopian aircraft had not yet been despatched to the congo, since the Ethiopian military authorities were not satisfied thatthe facilities for their journey and for their operations in the Congowere adequate.In addition to the hostilities between Katangan forces and thoseof the United Nations, there was some danger of an uprising by Kasaitribesmen, and our representative at ElizabethviMe had authority toput evacuation plans into effect if necessary.In these tragic circumstances our primary aim should be tocontinue our elforts to bring about a cessation of hostilities inKatanga. Mr. Tshomhe had given Lord Lansdowne an undertaking to return to Ndola for a meeting with United Nations representativesprovided that these did not include Dr. CVBrien. There was good reason to hope that the senior United Nations representative in the congo. Dr. 1.inner, would agree to this, and it was understood thata United Nations delegation was already on its way to Ndola.The Central Congo Government had withheld permission for lord Lansdowne to visit Katanga, ostensibly on the ground that hissafety could not be guaranteed. Since he had already met mr.. Tshombe at Ndola. there seemed no reason for Lord Lansdowne
to prolong his visit, and it was proposed that he should return direct to this country.Discussion showed that the Cabinet approved the efforts whichwere being made to bring about a cessation of hostilities in Katanga,and agreed that overflying and refuelling facilities should be madeavailable for the aircraft which the Ethiopian Government wereprepared to provide to the United Nations authorities in the Congo,on condition that these were only used to neutralise the piraticaloperations of the fighter aircraft purporting to operate on behalf ofthe Katangan Government.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal and ofthe points raised in discussion.united nations(previous reference:CC. (61) 49thConclusions.Minute 4)2. The Lord Privy Seal referred to the death ofMr. Hammarskjoeld, the Secretary-General of the United Nations.There was no provision in the Charter of the United Nations for the replacement of the Secretary-General, otherwise than by appointmentby the General Assembly on the recommendation of the security council. The Soviet Government, in view of their demand for thesubstitution of a triumvirate, would almost certainly obstruct theelection of a new Secretary-General. In these circumstances theUnited States Government, in order to provide for the continuingadministration of the Secretariat, proposed at the outset of themeeting of the General Assembly that day to seek the election of thenew President, who was to be Mr. Slim, a Tunisian. Mr. Slim wasone of the most respected and experienced of the representatives ofthe neutral nations. His election would be followed immediately bythe moving of a resolution calling on the new President to direct and administer the Secretariat pending the election of a newSecretary-General. This procedure might prove acceptable to the afro-Asian representatives, and it would be difficult for the SovietGovernment to oppose it It was possible that Mr. Slim might indue course become the permanent Secretary-General, and there wasa risk that he might be succeeded by some less suitable neutral. Butit was in our genera! interest that the United Nations should continueto be an effective international authority, tnd the Foreign Secretaryrecommended that we should support the United States p&apos;an.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in favour of theprocedure proposed by the United States Government.In further discussion it was explained that no immediate question arose about a further United Kingdom contribution towards financing the United Nations operations in the Congo; in addition to thesubscription of  3 millions for which Parliamentary authority hadbeen obtained, we had undertaken to provide a further  2 millionsbut only if other countries contributed in proportion. The questiot.of enforcing contributions for sustaining the peace-keeping machineryof the United Nations would probably be considered by the general assembly, and there might be some support for seeking the opinionof the International Court of Justice on the question whetherGovernments were legally obliged to pay their assessed share ofpeace-keeping costs and therefore liable to be deprived of their votingrights in the General Assembly if they continued to default.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to inform the United states authorities that the United Kingdom would support their proposals to provide for the continued administration of theUnited Nations Secretariat.
Germany 3.  The Lord Privy Seal said that the meeting of Western ForeignBerlin Ministers in Washington had not resulted in any proposals for a(Previous       solution of the Berlin problem or in any definite arrangements for reference:      negotiations.  The French Foreign Minister had refused to acceptc.c. (61) 49th   any commitment that formal negotiations should take place with theConclusions.    Soviet Government, though he was prepared to consider whetherMinute 3)       there should be negotiations in the light of any information whichmight be obtained by the United States Secretary of State in thecourse of soundings which he proposed now to make of the soviet foreign Minister.   It had accordingly been agreed that the UnitedStates Secretary of State should discuss with the Soviet ForeignMinister not only the possibility of negotiations but also the substance of the problem of Berlin.In view of the result of the Federal German elections it was likely that Dr. Adenauer would either try to continue in power witha minority Government, or that his supporters would form a coalitionwith the Free Democratic Party. In either case it was to be feared that the German authorities would be preoccupied with internaldifficulties; this would make the task of formulating an agreedWestern policy on Berlin even more difficult and it might also affectadversely or delay the negotiations which we were to hold with theEuropean Economic Community.In discussion the following points were made:(a) It was suggested that the reluctance of the French Governmentto contemplate negotiations with the Soviet Government aboutBerlin could be explained partly by their desire to do everything possible to retain Federal Germany within the Western Alliance,and partly from a conviction that the Soviet Governmentwould to some extent be deterred from aggressive policiesby a display of resolution on the part of the West. But, inaddition, it was probable that the French Government realised that negotiations would inevitably entail some concessions to the soviet and East German Governments; and they preferred that the criticismsthat such concessions would arouse should be directed primarilytowards the United States and United Kingdom Governments.(b) The role of the Free Democratic Party would be ofconsiderable importance in the coming months, not only in Germaninternal affairs, but in connexion with the policies of the WesternAlliance.(c) With the steady reinforcement of the military resources on both sides, the danger that hostilities might break out by accidentwas bound to be increased. The policy favoured by the FrenchGovernment therefore entailed a very dangerous risk.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement of the Lord Privy Seal and of thepoints raised in discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to circulate a memorandum forthe information of the Cabinet about the political situationin Federal Germany following the elections there, withparticular reference to the role of the Free DemocraticParty.Middle EastKuwaitIPrc\ ionsReference:CC (MWthConclusions.Minute 5)4. The Lord Privy Seal said that the Ruler of Kuwait had asked that, with the arrival of an Arab League force which he regarded as adequate. British forces should begin to move out of Kuwait.Arrangements had accordingly been made for the departure of a token detachment, and the Commander-in-chief. Middle East, had authority to withdraw other forces from forward positions in Kuwaitto their base camp there. The departure of further detachmentswould depend on the progress of consultations with the Kuwait:
military authorities and, through them, the Arab League forcecommanders.The Ruler of Kuwait attached considerable importance to accepting an Ambassador from Saudi Arabia as the first diplomaticrepresentative in Kuwait. Although it would have been preferable for the British Ambassador to be appointed first, the foreign secretary had decided that, in view of the overriding need to retain the confidence of the Ruler, it would be advisable to accede to hiswish.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Lord Privy Seal.Wages Policy 5.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Deputy SecretaryIndustrial Civil of the Cabinet (C. (61) 135) to which was annexed a minute from the servants Chancellor of the Exchequer to the Prime Minister on the agreement(Previous which governed the pay (known as the M rate) of a group of aboutReferences:      100.000 industrial civil servants.Gmciusiomfand      ^he Prime Minister said that the M rate agreement, which had .c.(6l)49ih   Deen reached between the official and trade union sides in 1959,Conclusions.    required the basic rates negotiated in 34 specified industries to be minute 6)       averaged and to be used as the basis for determining, at six-monthly intervals, the pay of the industrial civil servants covered by it.  Theagreement, which was in writing, ran for five years with no breakclause. Its effect was that, according to the movement of rates in the specified industries, an increase of about 3s. a week, costing  i million a year, would be payable on the next review due in October.   Thequestion was whether this agreement should be repudiated inpursuance of the policy of securing a &quot; pause &quot; in wage increasesWhen the question had been considered by the Wages Committeesome Ministers had taken the view that the Government ought notto break a formal written agreement in a way which might rendera private employer in the same position liable to court action. TheChancellor of the Exchequer had said publicly that commitmentsentered into would be met and the M rate agreement must beregarded as one of the commitments covered bv his statement.Repudiation of the agreement would be a damaging step in the eyes of the public and would prejudice the chance of persuading the unionsagain to enter into long-term agreements. Other Ministers hadargued that, as the Government had already found it necessary tobreach wage agreements (and in particular to ignore the Fair wages resolution), it would be unreasonable and impolitic to concede anincrease in the M rate, which would be widely regarded as a sign of weakness and would make the &quot; pause &quot; ineffective. The Governmentwould find it difficult, if not impossible, to resist claims Irom other civil servants whose wages, though not regulated by writtenagreement, had hitherto followed wage movements in the private sector.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was evenly balanced. On the one hand, it was said that too much emphasis should not be laid on the fact that the agreement was formal and inwriting. This was due to the need to define precisely which outsideindustries were to be considered comparable. An agreement on paper should not be considered to be more binding than otheragreements not on paper which had already had to be repudiated.To insist on observing the M rate agreement would have a disturbingeffect upon other comparable groups of employees whose wageagreements had conspicuously been breached.
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (C. &apos;61) 136) covering a revised draft of a letter from theChancellor of the Exchequer to the two sides of industry.The Prime Minister said that he had thought that, in order to enlist the co-operation of industry in a new approach to the problemsof economic planning, the letter should show plainly that the proposed new Council under the chairmanship of the C nancellor of theExchequer would be supported by an effective planning staff whichwould have some measure of independence and authority.In discussion there was general agreement that the government must proceed with its proposal to enlist the co-operation of both sides of industry in a new form of planning organisation, but considerable doubt was expressed about the standing and functions both of theproposed National Economic Development Council and of the planning ollice to be attached to it. It was suggested that theproposals appeared on the one hand to disregard the significantamount of planning which was already done within the government machine and by contact between Departments and the principal industries, and on the other to over-estimate the extent to whichEconomicSituationPlanning(previous reference:CC. (61) 49thConclusions.Minute (&quot;)On the other hand, it was suggested that it would be discreditableto repudiate an agreement which public opinion would regard asbinding upon the Government. When an agreement had once been concluded in writing, the circumstances in which it was made werenot relevant to a decision about its implementation.In further discussion it was suggested that the union representatives of the staffs concerned would be surprised if in currentcircumstances the Government decided to implement the agreement.Against this it was argued that this consideration did not provide anadequate guide to the action the Government ought now to take.It was also suggested that there might be room for a compromise which would give effect to the agreement up to the time of the chancellors statement but would withhold any increase related to increases in industrial pay thereafter. It was pointed out, however,that a compromise course would be no less a breach of the agreement and that there would in any event be practical difficulties about the selection of any date other than the six-monthly occasions providedfor by the agreement.Summing up, the Prime Minister said that the implementation ofthis agreement was likely to have embarrassing repercussions in anumber of sectors of Government employment. Opinion was divided as to the effect which implementation of the agreement mighthave on the &quot; pause &quot; in wage increases which the Government were seeking to secure. Special importance must clearly be attached tothe view which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had himself beeninclined to take, that the obligation upon the Government to implement this agreement was binding. He proposed to discuss thematter further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, as soon aspossible after his return to this country, in the light of the views whichhad been expressed by the Cabinet, with a view to deciding whichcourse would be most consistent with the policy which theGovernment had announced.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would decide, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer as soonas possible after his return to this country, whether theGovernment should implement the M rate pay agreementof industrial civil servants.
particular industrialists could be persuaded to disclose and discuss their plans. - Apart from the doubt whether useful results could beobtained from the kind of organisation contemplated, there appearedto be a real difficulty in determining the relations between theorganisation and the Government itself. If, as the letter suggested,the Chancellor of the Exchequer was to be the chairman of theCouncil and at least two other Ministers were to be members, theGovernment would hardly be able to dissociate itself from theconclusions reached by the Council or to reject any advice it mighttender. Ultimate responsibility, however, must lie and be seen to lie with the Government.In further discussion the following points were raised:(a) The risk of confusion about responsibilities would be reduced if the main function of the organisation were consultative rather thanadvisory.(b) A case could be made for associating the Research Councilsunder the aegis of the Minister for Science with the central structure of planning: it might be possible to broaden the function of theorganisation so that it could comprise technical and technological aswell as economic matters.(c) It might be preferable and more practicable to strengthen theNational Production Advisory Council for Industry, whose functions were less directly related to economic planning, and to provide it witha small staff of its own.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for ameeting of Ministers at which discussion of the proposedletter to both sides of industry about economic planningwould be resumed.Parliament 7.   The Home Secretary said that the requests had been receivedfrom a small number of the Governments own supporters as well asfrom certain Opposition quarters that Parliament should be recalledin order to discuss the Congo and Berlin. In consultation with theChief Whip he had declined these requests.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement by the HomeSecretary.NuclearDisarmamentDemonstrationin trafalgar square(Prcs religious reference:(.C (MHMIiConclusions.Minute 2)8. The Home Secretary said that the action taken by the policeon the occasion of the demonstration against nuclear armaments on sunday, 17th September, had effectively prevented the organisersfrom carrying out their intention of marching down Whitehall toParliament Square. In spite of the scale of the police action whichhad been taken it was understood that no one had suffered injuryHe would consult the Metropolitan Commissioner of Police if the organisers showed sign of staging a further demonstration. As atpresent advised, he would prefer not to have to give consent to afurther order under the Public Order Act. 1936, if that course couldbe avoided.The Cabinet  Took note of this statement by the Home Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.
