1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

[Local \

Government

Bill: Dog

Registration

LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Local Government Bill would be

/^bjH^eting its passage through the House of Lords in the following week.

QjrtHe\ previous Thursday, an amendment had been carried by a substantial

ma^^fi^k against the Government which would give the Secretary of State

for i^&gt;^ nvironment power to establish a registration system for dogs.

He ui^JJarf&amp;cood that as the powers were merely permissive,  the Secretary

of Stap^f^r the Environment doubted whether it was worth seeking to

reverse\die amendment.    The provisions in the Bill abolishing the dog

licence remained intact.

Legal Aid

Bill

THE LORD CHANCET^yuRyyid that the legal aid system was not geared to

deal effectivelyUfcL6Jj -&amp;ivil cases involving a large number of plaintiffs

and the present arnrf^fterpcnts had attracted criticism in cases like that

of the drug Opren.    H#^aH accordingly tabled amendments to the Legal

Aid Bill to enable th^Ag^l Aid Board to contract with a single

solicitor to provide reprer^Rtation for all the plaintiffs in a group of

closely similar cases.   M^^qnoposed new arrangements had been generally

welcomed, although they ra\g^^ xt go as far as some people would wish.

The Cabinet V^f?

1.        Took note. Ls&gt;\

Rateable

Value of

Business

Properties

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said^^^r^the House of Lords had held

in a recent case that businesses in areayt adjacent to enterprise zones

were entitled to a reduction in the rateable values of their properties.

The rationale was that the benefits which enterprise zones offered to

businesses had had a depressive effect on the / e?3kOnal rental values of

properties in surrounding areas.    He estimatemthyt Swansea City Council

and Glamorgan County Council,  the two authoritT ^+Mediately affected

by the judgment, stood to lose around  1.7 milli\anjXA^

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, si ^t\hat the House

of Lords ruling could have major implications for tm^^W^ng of local

authorities, not only in respect of areas adjacent to enT^j^ise zones

but also, perhaps, areas surrounding simplified planninV^jJnVs or urban

development corporations. The Chancellor of the ExchequeRY^A*.

consultation with interested colleagues, should consider urg^^v the

implications of the decision and what response to it might &quot;W.^/)

necessary. y^^^


The Cabinet -

2.      Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer,

in consultation with the Secretaries of State for

Wales,  for the Environment and for Scotland, and

the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to proceed

as the Prime Minister had indicated.

2.     ^jHg/gECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that Scottish health

worker\/y&gt;&amp; taken industrial action the previous day in protest against

the Government&apos;s proposals on competitive tendering in the National

Health Service.    The action had caused the postponement or cancellation

of a significant number of operations, and at some hospitals the

emergency cover which had been promised had not been forthcoming. The

Opposition spol^Sm^n on Scottish Affairs had given the action his

unqualified suMporVr in the House of Commons, thus demonstrating that the

Opposition wereT^psVed to endorse industrial action that inevitably

harmed the welfaB^_j3^/^atients and increased hospital waiting lists.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FORS^J^ftS&amp;MENT said that employees at Land Rover

had begun strike action the &gt;&amp;xMj*ftus week which had closed down the

plant.    The Land Rover manage^JrftMyed no intention of going beyond their

final offer and no further meet/^g&apos;svyad been arranged with the trades

unions.    The willingness of the Fo^^ronagement to make concessions

beyond what they had described as the^r final offer had had an unhealthy

effect on the expectations of worke *^3^other parts of the motor

industry and it was important that thyyLafri Rover management should

stand firm.    Large numbers of protestew^nad gathered outside the Land

Rover plant.    The trades unions would iT^doubt claim that there were no

more than six pickets at any one time, that the remainder of the

protestors were merely demonstrating, and that the protesters&apos; actions

were accordingly consistent with the code of u^^Cice on picketing.

This was a complex area of law but it was posBftbLg) that Land Rover would

succeed should they decide to mount a challengNj^kilJ^be courts.    The pay

dispute at Ford had been settled, but there was mow/a further dispute

concerning white collar workers.    It was possibl^-^^y this would lead

to renewed industrial action, but any such action Vo^w^aot affect

production for three to four weeks. ^ovTvS

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the industrial action by the

National Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers

^(NACODS) was continuing, but both the union and British Coal had now

^agreed to refer the dispute to the National Reference Tribunal, whose

stfvoodings would be binding on both parties.    NACODS1 main outstanding

Vp^vance was that British Coal were not prepared to reinstate their

^vdha^iwe recognition of the union to represent overseers and deputies.

I^^fpS^ared that the NACODS leadership were embarrassed about the

coni^ilwng dispute and that they were seeking a face-saving device to

3.      THE FOREIGN ft^D^/CMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr John Smith, a

British businessmarr^^yjfl for eight years in prison in Iraq, would be

released that day, aujf*$2*a visit by the Minister of State, Foreign and

Commonwealth Office (w^MMor) during which he had delivered a letter

from the Prime Minister scafoing Mr Smith&apos;s release.    Another British

subject, Mr Ian Richter,Qf y&amp; .ill in prison in Iraq and there was no

indication that his relea^ _^ould now follow.   Mr Smith&apos;s release was

good news but the GovernmerrH^VpM&gt;l ic reaction, given the plight of Mr

Richter, should be caut ious .vTv^n

In discussion,  it was recalled tArt r&lt;Nje Iraqi authorities had insisted,

whenever the United Kingdom had mad^i^presentations on behalf of

Mr Smith, that an Iraqi citizen hefdi^a prison in the United Kingdom

should also be released.    But the tw  33)es were entirely different: the

Iraqi held in this country had been cdyyfc^d by the courts of murder.

It was satisfactory that Mr Smith was released despite the British

refusal to acknowledge any link betweenN^he two cases.

Hiblic of

juth Africa

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said th^s^J^SNSouth African

Government had effectively banned all activity b//almest all the black

political organisations in the Republic.    This haefcSraa an unnecessary

step.    It was hard to see how it could help to promVfyfeM&amp;aceful reform

in South Africa.    The South African Government appea^jp*^.have been

influenced by the prospect of three difficult by-elecM&apos;oN 6/An the next

two months.    The Inkatha movement of Chief Mangosuthu Bu &amp;rt^zi was not

covered by the new measures;  this was likely to damage Ch^1f)Buthelezi

by exposing him to being represented as a pawn of the Sourh-^^bcan

Government. \0v^/\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the United States

Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, who had visited Moscow that week,

| had returned with his view that the Soviet Union intended to withdraw

&apos;/\ts forces from Afghanistan confirmed.    Pakistan was continuing its

X^^forts to promote the emergence of an interim Government before the

j^C^iet withdrawal.    The United Kingdom should support Pakistan in this.

^Bl^^pthing should stand in the way of the main Western objective - that

withdrawal should begin as soon as possible.    The United States

sha^fclythis view, and was doing everything possible to promote the

cessation of Soviet military aid to the Afghan regime before withdrawal

begaf^^V

THE PRIWMINISTER said that one of the leaders of the Afghan Resistance

had suggested to her that, as a matter of military prudence, a country

which had decided to withdraw its forces from another country would

always do so as rapidly as possible, because of the increasing danger

during the proa^J^sNof withdrawal to the diminishing forces that

remained.    Thi(acavled into question the motives of the Soviet Union in

foreseeing a wrtfi4r&quot;3Ylal period of nine or ten months.    The process of

the Soviet withd AaaTZ*kould not be straightforward and there would be

more bloodshed.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMON WE AH^^^ECRETARY said that the United States

Secretary of State, Mr Georg^TffKkl tz, during his visit that week to the

Soviet Union, had followed uA. {misrepresentations which he himself had

made in favour of early moves ^JrA^s adoption in the United Nations

Security Council of a resolut io/^f&amp;ivss ing an embargo on arms supplies to

Iran.    With the agreement of the S^rT^t Union,  the Permanent Members of

the Security Council had now circula^a a draft resolution, originally

drawn up by the United Kingdom, to ^ e^S^n-permanent members. The

United States Administration believea\yfajs-&gt;it now had a Soviet

commitment to adoption of the resolutro^oefore the end of February.

The price of Soviet acceptance had beenvjj clause in the draft resolution

delaying the entry into force of the arms embargo for 30 or 60 days.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatHMrJcje^rge Vassiliou had

been elected President of Cyprus in the second xhwrt^pfi elections on

21 February.    Mr Vassiliou was a millionaire who haay^j^electoral

backing of the Communist Party of Cyprus.      It did rfcjv^rf&amp;^ar that he

would exert early pressure on the United Kingdom concerning the

Sovereign Base Areas on the island.    MrVassiliou was cc&gt;$wrw eX to seek

renewal of diplomatic efforts for progress on the CyprusM^rpoAem. In

the context of the improved atmosphere between the Governm^jKV*\\f Turkey

and Greece, it would be interesting to observe what happenddC the

underlying problems were complex and it was hard to be optinVM^ra^

FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Affairs

Coi*f riv.had been able to dispose quickly of the agenda before it on 22

FeDru^ry.    The French Foreign Minister, Monsieur Raimond, had made no

serr^el^iitempt to sustain the line by Monsieur Chirac at the European

Council/op^the eight non-arable agricultural stabilisers. The

Presidency was therefore able to conclude that the European Council

agreement had been confirmed in its entirety.    The Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary had taken the opportunity formally to associate

the United Kingdom with the Dutch and Italian statements that the

European Counci^^eclaration on agricultural trade should not be

interpreted inua pylotec t ionist way.    The Declaration had been

sat isfactorily &gt;fe^i-rcked from the agricultural guideline in the final

overall text of ^fce^euxopean Council conclusions.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXj^^^R said that at its meeting on 23 February

the Budget Council had bett^ygple, without great difficulty,  to reach

agreement in principle on a^rfrtf^t budget for 1988 on a basis reflecting

the conclusions of the Europ&amp;^mM&amp;Sunci 1, subject to a waiting reserve by

Italy.    There had however bee^^tpycacted discussion of the Presidency&apos;s

proposal for an intergovermenta/^rgl&amp;fiment to provide the additional

reveue necessary pending ratificatrartvof the new Own Resources Decision.

The Italian delegation had disputedJ&amp;e interpretation given by the

Commission to the conclusions of trwyttS^seIs European Council on the

question of the financing of the UnityyX^pgdom&apos;s abatement.    They had

argued that this should be brought to^^ewint against the new fourth own

resource rather than within the Value Awed Tax (VAT) ceiling. Further

discussion would be necessary to resolve this issue.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said  that the rutt^^on 23 February by

the European Court of Justice that by exempting nwjSr^AT certain goods

supplied with medical care in the United Kingdom wss/f^fcceach of its

obligations, had attracted a number of il 1-informed v^srSVceports. The

ruling was addressed to the scope of an exemption from cfte^Sixth VAT

Directive adopted in 1977.    Because the goods had previ^j*  yvbeen an

exempt rather than zero-rated, part of the effect of VATVQmj/ivtion

would be offset by deduction of VAT on inputs which would TTdJw^bfii.

allowed.    It had been made clear by the Economic Secretary &gt;ro^h*N

Treasury,  in reply to a Private Notice Question from Mr Spear^^wAjE,

that this decision had no bearing on the.infraction proceedings/^gw^n by

the Commission against the United Kingdom in respect of certairr o^ps\p


zero rates, much less the Commission&apos;s more general proposals on tax

approximation.    The ruling on the infraction proceedings was not

expected for several months.    The preliminary opinion of the Advocate

\ General suggested that United Kingdom pleas would be accepted in some

^t\ut not all respects.    It would be necessary in due course to give

sAr^rther thought to how the United Kingdom should implement the Court&apos;s

yyjjyal ruling.

NORTHERN

IRELAND

5.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that he had

visited Dublin on the previous day.    The visit had gone well. His

meeting of 30 pf^mvKes with the Prime Minister of the Irish Republic,

Mr Charles Hau\^^yV_had been friendly.    Mr Haughey had asked about

political develcTSroeTiyte in Northern Ireland and had not raised the

matters which rec&amp;pjXA/yhad caused difficulty between the British and

Irish Governments, .

He had shown Mr HaugHV^v^^dence of the scale of smuggling across the

border between Northern n**&amp;and and the Irish Republic, which deprived

the Irish exchequer of d^^^oV^rable revenue.    Mr Haughey had appeared to

be impressed by this evidN ii&gt;^/^which should give him a further reason

for pursuing co-operation oo^reoN*rity either side of the border.

He had also held a meeting wi^fp^ctag^ Ir ish Foreign Minister, Mr Brian

Lenihan, and participated in a /^iv^eeting of the Anglo-Irish

Intergovernmental Conference.    A v^x^range of issues had been

discussed.    One of these had been the^case of a private soldier in the

British army who had returned to du-jg-&quot;33^er serving a period in prison

following conviction for murder in ^oyyn&amp;n Ireland; it was surprising

that the news of his release from prisrafp&apos;should have broken at that

time, more than a year after it had talc^o place.    The two sides had

agreed that there should be a further meeting of the Intergovernmental

Conference shortly, with a full agenda.    He had made clear to Mr Lenihan

that cross-border co-operation on security mus^^te included.    That was

in line with clear public statements by Mr Haughey that such

co-operation would continue.    When this subjecOwJJS^discussed in the

Intergovernmental Conference,  the Chief Cons tabMof/the Royal Ulster

Constbulary and his Irish equivalent were pre sen r-r-^Store over t in

private discussion Mr Lenihan had raised no dif f icolyf$^2bout the

continuation of this arrangement.    It was therfore stfWn^&amp;ing that the

Irish Foreign Minister had reacted negatively to his puM^^ statement

that the two Chief Constables would participate in the ^j^Msoming

meeting. \C-^v&gt;\


After the meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference, he and Mr Lenihan

had walked across St Stephen&apos;s Green in the centre of Dublin, as a means

^ of showing that their relationship remained good.    This walk had

/^featured in news programmes on British television the same evening.

Xtp&apos;Sdi.scussion,  it was agreed that the public line for the Government on

^ fle,/ uestion of the participation of the two Chief Constables in the

/o^tty^ming meeting of the Intergovernmental Conference should be

pra^f^ed with care.    It should include the point that the two Chief

Cons t^jKes always attended when cross-border co-operation on security

was ^&amp;&lt;rtj^sed; and the point that the meeting of the Intergovernmental

Confer&amp;hte/pn 24 February had gone well.

6.    The Cabinet had before them a minute from the Secretary of State for

Energy to the Prime Minister of 23 February and a minute from the

^Secretary of State for Scotland to the Prime Minister of 24 February.

4buE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that on 2 2 February the

^J^Listerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy,  Sub-Committee on

^EcJ^mic Affairs  (E(a)),  had endorsed his proposals for the

^^Evatisation of the electricity supply industry in England and Wales.

If the Cabinet agreed, he planned to make an announcement to Parliament

and publish a White Paper that afternoon.    Under his proposals,  the 12

distribution Area Boards would be privatised as  independant companies.

The national grid would be transferred from the Central Electricity

Generatin^^^ard (CEGB)  to a company jointly owned by the 12

distribu^^^^ompanies.    The generating assets of the CEGB would be

divided,  t^MM^ote competition:    70 per cent of its capacity, including

all the nuclk^^^^se ts, would be  transferred to an identifiable

successor to t^^^^GB,  which would take on the responsibility for the

nuclear power p^^gjAnme.    The remaining 30 per cent of capacity, all

fossil-fuelled, ^^Abe transferred to a new generating company. The

statutory obiigatsupply would be  transferred  from the CEGB to the

distribution compan^B^^The national grid would be available to all

generators as a coming c^Mrier and would act as a collective purchaser

for the distribution caries.    The result of these arrangements

would be that over time a greater diversity in generation would be

established.    There would be a tough regulatory regime covering the

monopoly activities of the distribution companies, and an attractive

package of performance standards and new rights for customers.

These proposals were supported m  ^A 12 Area Board Chairmen and in the

main by the Electricity Council^^jH^nanagement of the CEGB were

disappointed,  but  it would not halfc^^Ln politically acceptable to have

privatised the CEGB as a monopoly,  ci^^^ky had wished.    His announcement

would be controversial,  part icular ly^iit^^he unions, but he would be

able to say that he had consulted all j^E sted parties in the industry

extensively.    Obtaining the support of rjH^^^ustry1 s employees would be

most important; he planned to have an atcaD^e package for them

covering such matters as share incentivesReservation of pension

rights. J^^,

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that on 22 February E(A) had

also endorsed his proposals for the privatisation of the electricity

supply industry in Scotland.    If the Cabinet agreed, he planned to make

an announcement to Parliament and publish a White Papeuvi 1 March. The

Scottish electricity industry was different from tha rK*ngland and

Wales in two crucial respects:    nuclear power providea^J^vid^h proportion

of its generating capacity,  up to 80 per cent  for a t iim^HH^r the

completion of the Torness power station,  and the two Sco^^^^^Dards

were vertically integrated with responsibilities for both Mne^Ltion and

transmission.    He shared the Secretary of State for Energy&apos;^^M^kce to

increase competition in the industry;  and he believed that tOT^MP^d be

best achieved in Scotland by privatising two vertically integrjR^^^k

electricity companies.    The existing Scottish nuclear assets wou^^fci&amp;k

transferred to a company jointly owned by the two new companies, ^&gt;Jj)L


it would be viable to float the southern company which would otherwise

have been disproportionately dependent on nuclear power.    Both the

.   existing Scottish Boards supported this holding company arrangement. He

^expected widespread support for his proposals on structure in Scotland,

^^ith the exception of the management of the South of Scotland

^Mectricity Board who had favoured a single monopoly company.

J^^e^scussion the following main points were made -

a. Giving the generating companies the freedom to import coal

could have a substantial impact on the contibued viability of

British Coal.    If British deep-mined pits had to be closed because

their^^rkets were supplied with cheaper imported opencast coal,

theM^Plonger term security of supply could be jeopardised. In

as  r^Rgflkcket situation,  British Coal might threaten that, unless

the te^E^^^ supply was satisfactory to them,   they would withdraw

suppl ie^^^r^ether.    On the other hand,  the capacity of British

ports  to luc^ imported coal  in the next few years would be

limited,  anS^Hfcestic coal enjoyed a substantial competitive

advantage ove^B^J^prts in transport costs  in inland power stations.

The gener at ingMHkan ies would know they could not obtain all their

supplies at cur%^tMarginal prices on the world market:  the market

was  too small andjM^tile.    It would be in their commercial

interest to enter^nto long term contracts with British Coal, and

the presence of the international market would provide valuable

competitive pressures on the costs of British Coal. Placing

restrictions on the freedom of negotiation between British Coal and

the generators would be lik^^only to lead to further indefinite

subsidies  from taxpayers A^^ltish Coal.    In presenting this

aspect of the announcement^R j uld be important to emphasise that

generators would be likely t^E^g^ the bulk of their coal supplies

from British Coal  for securit^^B^^pply reasons,  rather than that

they would now have the oppor tu^y:yvto import substantial volumes

of coal from abroad. ^^^^

b. There was  likely to be vigorouS^^Weition both in Parliament

and from the electricity unions to th^^ ^rnment1 s proposals. In

particular,   the leader of the power engijp^Jfcc, Mr John Lyons, was

highly respected and would be advising f^re Alliance. The

reorganisation of the industry would be complex and controversial

and it would not be possible to complete privatisation of the

industry during the present Parliament:    this could affect the

price. On the other hand, it would not be acceptab^a to the

Government&apos;s supporters to privatise the industrA\ Ma monopoly

supplier and so reorganisation was  inevitable.    ^KjA3^ been

union opposition to all previous major pr ivat isat i^H^^fhis had

never prevented the employees concerned from recogn^kjKg^tfie

benefits of privatisation. fl/ fl

c. It could be argued that there would be greater compW^pbn

between the generating companies if the CEGB&apos;s existing nd(^4^

power stations were divided between the two new compan ies. ^P^^ak

this would be likely to result in a delay in permission bein^


granted for construction of the three nuclear stations after

Sizewell B.    Only if responsibility for the nuclear programme was

k vested in an identifiable successor to the CEGB could there be

M confidence that the nuclear programme would be carried forward in

accordance with Government policy.

^ ^^d.      There would be difficulties  for further companies in

^^^?establishing themselves in the generating market.    Such companies

would have to finance the entire current cost of capital in any new

power station investment, whereas the two companies being created

out of the CEGB would have large portfolios of existing capital

assets at historic cost and more limited capital financing

requa^^nts.    On the other hand,  this was a problem which often

fac^M^U.companies wishing to enter an established market.    In the

case^H^jRVetr icity it was not  impossible that new entrants could

compet^Blk^^ssfully,  for  instance with a new coastal power station

burning nj^^med coal.

e.      The pr^fEs t0 impose a requirement on the northern Scottish

company to chJK^iniform tariffs,  ran contrary to the philosophy

being appl ied^B^^fcj rest of this  privatisation exercise.    On the

other hand, a Xncmal consideration in establishing the North of

Scotland Hydro-El^^W^c Board had been to equalise tariffs so that

the remoter areasXere not unduly penalised by the costs of

transmission.    Abolishing it would cause major difficulties.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet had

considered carefully the issues ^(^h had been raised and endorsed the

proposals before them on elec tiftAc^pr iva t isa t ion in England and Wales,

and in Scotland.    The Secretary^W^Bmte for Energy should finalise his

statement to Parliament  for that t^Ufc-rooon.  taking account of

suggestions made in the discussion^^^^^roceed with the publication of

a White Paper later that day as he bM^pP^osed.    The Secretary of State

for Scotland should consult  further w^S^^^f Chancellor of the Exchequer

and the Secretary of State for Energy on^l^^.ssue of uniform tariffs in

northern Scotland.    Subject to this poin^^iBktoo should proceed with

his statement to Parliament and the public%^bi^&gt;f a White Paper on

1 March,  as planned. ^^Mk

The Cabinet -

Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the discussion and invited the

Secretary of State for Energy and the Secretary ImI

of State for Scotland to proceed accordingly. ^K^t.
