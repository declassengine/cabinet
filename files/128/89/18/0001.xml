r^jl^LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that Mr David Alton had tabled

*Xr^ /consideration at Report Stage in the House of Commons of the

\frraf kal Justice Bill a new clause which essentially sought to replicate

tfWjj^&amp;isions of his Abortion (Amendment) Bill.   Opposition Members had

tabiwiAj clauses incorporating some of their failed Private Members&apos;

Billsf^^e-sumably in an attempt to dissuade the Speaker from selecting

Mr Alforf%&apos;new clause.    If the Speaker selected Mr Alton&apos;s new clause,

this couy^^eTeate an awkward precedent for the handling of measures

introducexxby Private Members.    More immediately, it could make the

handling of the Criminal Justice Bill very much more difficult,

especially if any amendments on abortion which might be incorporated in

the House of Commoas were either further amended, or rejected outright,

by the House of/^orWB.    If the amendment were selected, very careful

consideration wa^d^tmed to be given to the handling of these matters.

THE PRIME MINISTER&gt;c^M\ng up a short discussion, said that it would be

most unsatisfactory C^*y%^major Government Bill to be forced back and

forth between the two ^pro&amp;aS as a result of the incorporation in an

opportunistic manner ofvw^c^was essentially a Private Members&apos; issue.

While the selection of ame^Jp^etats was a matter for the Speaker to

decide, a statement of therOovarnment&apos;s view of the repercussions of

selecting the Alton amendmeKC^K^ald be made available to him.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATI^A^ SCIENCE said that the House of

Lords had earlier that week rejected^j^an emphatic majority an

amendment which sought to delay the afJ^t^lon of the Inner London

Education Authority and the Lord Privy Aead/and the Chief Whip, Lords

were to be congratulated on their handlrocof the matter.   The House of

Lords had earlier approved by a very substantial majority the principle

of the Government&apos;s proposal to allow schools to opt out of local

authority control and achieve grant-maintained status, but, on the

previous Thursday, an amendment had been incorp^aMd, against the

advice of the Government, which sought to provAAt rjta  a ballot of

parents would be valid only where a simple majoril^oj\ parents eligible

to vote were in favour of seeking grant-maintainei^e^a^fts.   That was an

unreasonably high threshold, and the matter would n$ af p\be addressed

when the Bill returned to the House of Commons. /&apos;yy/\

The Cabinet - /yy*\

2.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

figures for April would be published that day.    The seasonally adjusted

total had fallen by 49,000 and the overall total was 2.455 million, the

lowest figure for 6i years.    This was the twentieth consecutive month in

\ which unemployment had fallen.    Unemployment had fallen by 566,000 in

^fae previous 12 months, the largest annual reduction since the Second

woVld War, including 470,000 since the General Election.   All regions

kb^uy benefitted, with the largest reductions in the West Midlands, the

CfM&amp;&amp;West and the North.    The rate of unemployment, which stood at 8.8

partem:, was falling faster than in any other major industrialised

co f^Crv^ind was now below the levels of many of our major European

compe^5xa*s, including France, Italy, Belgium, the Netherlands, Spain

and ttie^J&amp;public of Ireland.   The number of unfilled vacancies had risen

siightl^/i^p&apos;April and it was estimated that there were now more than

700,000 y^cancies in the economy.   The overall position remained very

healthy.^

THE SECRETRARY OF/STAjE FOR EMPLOYMENT, reporting on the strike action

by employees of P^QjlKo^uropean Ferries at Dover, said that, following

the lifting of the br^oy&amp;Kjde by lorry drivers at Dover and the ending of

secondary action by meww,of the National Union of Seamen (NUS) in the

previous week, ferriesMfe^j^generally running normally except at Dover

where P and 0 were running^( r\irregular service to Zeebrugge using two

ferries.   The dispute apraM&apos;eajlikely to continue for some while, though

P and 0 seemed slowly to be^3Mp4M.idating their position.    The High

Court had the previous day ad^oirwed until the following week an

application from the NUS to naVeX^Meir sequestration order lifted and

had made clear that, before the^awftcation could be granted, further

assurances would be needed on sev^^aVjoatters, in particular that all

illegal activity had ended.   The f^jres &amp;mposed on the union, together

with the legal costs incurred durina^tfg&gt;dispute, were likely to leave

the union in very serious financial &lt;&lt;G3^ culties.   The way in which the

dispute had developed had demonstrated/jma^effectiveness of the

Government&apos;s legislation to ban seconda^jQ action.

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the problem between

the United States and the Soviet Union over the Intermediate Nuclear

Forces (INF) Treaty had been resolved and progress on other matters was

j likely to be made in the lead-up to the forthcoming Summit in Moscow

^ietween the President of the United States, Mr Ronald Reagan, and the

^xfcneral Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail

\fe&lt;j*bachev.   This meeting   would be important for the latter who needed a

 ^Jemcp s8 in the run-up to the special conference in June of the Soviet

Zoiamc&amp;vist Party.   There had been some signs of Soviet movement at the

VieJ^tavmeeting of the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe

which/jjttght permit agreement on a concluding document covering human

rigrf^g^gaS a mandate for the conventional stability talks. The

withdrarofT^f Soviet forces from Afghanistan was under way and

28,000^5wiet troops should have left by the time the Summit took

place.

THE FOREIGN An\^0^B&gt;NWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of

France, Monsieur(rrjjrfipis Mitterrand, had called legislative elections

in France on 5 anV-JZ&gt;June.    It seemed that the French Socialist Party

could win an overal%y&lt;mr^rity in the National Assembly, their prospects

having been helped by/w^olisarray among the parties of the right.

Meanwhile, no major palioVx ronouncements had emerged from the present

French Government led bj 2j p^ieur Michel Rocard.   The Prime Minister

would be meeting Presidendf^lyplterrand on 10 June.

 Terrorist

Jlttack in

 Khartoum

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECTtEM^ said that five British citizens

and two Sudanese had died in terrvris^attacks in Khartoum on Sunday

15 May.    No one had claimed respon&lt;*j UrjXy for these incidents. Despite

press reports, it was not clear thar^ra^yJiad been aimed at American or

British targets.   The Sudanese Head oi/jgy6t&amp; had blamed Iran. Several

young men had been arrested, three of sAem carrying Lebanese passports.

The attacks had coincided with the swearing in of the new Sudanese

Government.   The inclusion in the new Cabinet of Moslem Fundamentalist

Ministers was likely to aggravate splits betwe^w-snorth and south Sudan.

There was therefore a variety of possible exp/Sanaraions of the incident.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that tni^yQ^es in southern

Beirut between supporters of the AMAL and Hisbollah dVgjgnjpaations had

continued.    200 people had been killed and a thousand wrt&amp;si&amp;d in the

fighting since 6 May.    Syria had not taken any decision rfxj yytervene in

a decisive way.   As for the hostages held in Lebanon, the&amp;S^^ents added

to their danger but there was no news of them and there was^ft^ ^widence

so far that they might form part of a deal between Syria ana^jyan. It


was hoped to obtain direct debriefing from the recently released French

hostages soon.

588 Budget

4. C^TH  PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the European Parliament had voted

on l^^w^o reinstate all their first reading budget proposals, so

creat^ftioin.excess over their statutory margin of 212 mecu on

conimitn4iW^r and some 5 mecu on payments.    At the last Budget Council,

the Germwi Presidency had sought some negotiating freedom to reach a

final agreement with the European Parliament.    The United Kingdom and

France had raised objections to this but did not command a blocking

minority.    In the event the German Presidency appeared to have

interpreted th^/Cobjicil&apos;s remit widely.    It was not yet clear whether

Lord Plumb, ths^Rr^s-ident Qf the European Parliament, would declare the

budget adopted,    fte had indicated that he would need to consider whether

the budget had a &amp;% uwf)financing base.   He would no doubt also have in

mind the possibilitj^yY^sing non-adoption of the budget as a weapon in

the discussions of ant^^caSs-institutional agreement.    In the perhaps

unlikely event that he^^NLopt for early adoption, the PAYMASTER

GENERAL said that he wouW^o\sult the Lord President about the

Parliamentary implication^X^n

In discussion it was pointed^wt^hat the agreement reached was ftot

consistent with the conclusiow^y the Brussels European Council which

had established clear understawoy^pgjitvon expenditure limits.   This was

one of a growing number of example&apos;s &gt;dX incompetent conduct of business

by the German Presidency.    The ba&lt;j g&apos;rr)&amp;jid to the Presidency&apos;s action on

this occasion probably lay in their^^^tu.to give effect to the

conclusions reached at the Brussels t tf/?pean Council on a possible

inter-institutional agreement on Commujmji^^expenditure.    The Presidency

might have attached weight to the possMfrlity that while disagreements

continued on that issue, the Parliament wight refuse to adopt a budget.

It seemed clear that there was no way of undoing at this stage the

action taken by the Presidency.    Nevertheless amessage should be sent

to Chancellor Kohl expressing the United Kingdrat^Vvstrong disapproval of

the action taken which might call in doubt thaAbas)iA for the Own

Resources Decision. (v^y

The Prime Minister,  summing up a brief discussion ^ $/&amp;hat the

Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation with the^SjK&amp;etary of State

for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs should arrange fQr^rvent

examination of the compatability of the agreement reachei^p^the 1988

Budget with the conclusions of the Brussels European Coife  ljAnd in the

light of that examination prepare a letter which the Prim^M&gt;p 8ter

might address to Chancellor Kohl. &lt;c\\v


15 MayXi:

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the informal meeting of

Economic and Finance Ministers on 14-15 May had gone reasonably well.

The discussion of the draft Directive on capital liberalisation had made

good progress and there seemed a fair prospect of its being agreed at

) the June meeting in a way satisfactory to the United Kingdom.   There was

tme doubt about the position of the French Government, which had

, represented at the meeting, but he had taken an opportunity

ntly to speak to Monsieur Beregevoy and judged that he would

, and might accelerate, the previous government&apos;s progress

abolition of exchange controls.   There had been a brief

Jon of technical proposals for improvement of the operation of

the ^jj^pean Monetary System together with the proposals put forward by

the G^rawr Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, for consideration of a

Europea^/s^ntral Bank.    The latter had aroused no enthusiasm and was a

remote nreue.   It was however clear that the German Presidency would put

forward proposals of some sort before the European Council at Hanover.

It would be important to ensure that consideration of the issue was put

back to the Econpmic and Finance Council.   There had also been a tour de

table on the CommTakion&apos;s proposals for tax approximation.    The United

Kingdom was not\^afre^in objecting to these proposals in principle.

Others had expres/kd^pubts on practical grounds to an extent which

amounted to de fac^rr^r^agreement.    He had commented at the meeting that

he could not rememb et^y&amp;Ay^earlier Commission proposals which had aroused

such a range of disagf^JiH&amp;Kts, a comment which had attracted a sharp

reaction from the Vice^Pr^sVdent of the Commission, Lord Cockfield. It

had been agreed that studj^ f/t\f various options should be put in hand,

including an option for aVuiwMg zero rates.   In his concluding

comments, Monsieur Delors twnJ^reXognised the need for unanimity in

decisions on this issue. ^C^^

In a brief discussion it was nc&lt;y^4vhat the establishment of a central

bank on the lines floated by Herxv^e^cher could involve a major

surrender of sovereignty.    It was ^rea)?\that the German Bundesbank and

the French authorities would grop^Jsa^TO^b-a development.   The nature of

the institution in mind was in fact K w y means clear.   Herr Genscher

might well not have any clear idea him ^f/ The idea had been floated

for essentially political reasons.    We  ould give the Genscher proposal

short shrift at Hanover. V

The SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY saiA^trUt there were

indications that the French intended to interveneV^wr^ife Commission&apos;s

consideration of the Rover Group case.    Negotiation^wrxlv the Commission

were continuing but any such action would give encouOT^^jit to

Commissioner Sutherland to reduce the proposed capitaKxi^je&lt;tion. We

had expected an intervention by the German Government butxwjench action

in addition would be unfortunate, not least given that wevfra&apos;dNVmrselves

not intervened in the Renault case.    Any action that could^b^^fc^ken to

reduce the likelihood of interventions would be helpful. Th4 lft}R}KIGN

tTHYSSEN-

NEMISZA

LECTION

5.     Tb4 # oinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

the Environment and the Minister for the Arts (C(88) 8) recommending

that the Government should make a proposal to the Trustees of the

Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection for arrangements to provide a permanent

home for the Collation in the United Kingdom.

THE SECRETARY 0 ::S^E FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Thyssen Trust

was seeking a lonjft^temm home for the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection,

which was one of Vh^r^jJ-i^hest distinction, consisting of over 1,300

pictures currently ^yJ^A at about  670 million.   The pictures were in

a discretionary trust/^Hj^r Bermudan law, and were normally housed at

Lugano, Switzerland.   va*r^uVJhyssen and his Trustees envisaged making

over the best of the pictmftty together with such others as might be

agreed, to a new f oundat%irijn a country of their choice.   The recipient

country would provide a ga$&amp;iv lor the pictures&apos; permanent display, and

would pay a suitable sum in^&amp;mp\nsation to the beneficiaries of the

Trust.   A number of countries^va&lt;^iade offers for the pictures but none

of these had been regarded as VaytXe^fcactory by the Baron or his Trustees.

Nevertheless, the Baron had pers^rfaLyt. signed a Memorandum of

Understanding with the Spanish Go^rnmMt envisaging the loan of the

pictures for exhibition in Spain  ovyi&amp;Jx&gt; 10 years and possibly longer.

Despite that Memorandum, the Baron atf&amp;crors Trustees had indicated that

they would be glad to consider an offe// jr^m Britain before the Trustees

took decisions about the Collection&apos;s figure at their meeting in July.

A realistic offer would have to include v sum of about  120 million as

compensation for the Trust&apos;s beneficiaries, and the provision of a

gallery of which the estimated construction cost was  38 million.

Additionally, the running costs of the gallerv^rrght be  4 million a

year on top of the yield of admission charges uind\  her contributions.

In his view, the acquisition for these costs or^vClNVlection of the

Thyssen Collection&apos;s distinction and value was aijMunrairalleled

opportunity that would certainly not present itsei^ara^n. He

accordingly proposed that the Government should inforHf/^fe Baron and his

Trustees of their willingness to seek approval from I^ rt aJ ent for the

acquisition and accommodation of the pictures if suitableX*wangements

in principle could be made.   A main feature of the legi w l&quot;ob, which

would probably be needed in the next Session if the propo^aJr&gt; eot ahead,

would be the establishment of a new foundation to receive tJre^n^tures

and to care for and exhibit them.   Possible locations for tnkVaJ^ery

had now narrowed down to sites at the Canary Wharf developmen&lt; wJ&gt;*ch

Baron Thyssen was likely to prefer) and in the city centre of L/^yK


Birmingham, where a major redevelopment,  including an international

convention centre, was currently in progress.    A number of important

legal points needed to be settled before the proposal could be

\ confirmed.    In particular, it needed to be established beyond dispute

^*that the new foundation would have absolute and unencumbered title in

sM^je pictures.   That point was emphasised in the draft proposal to

^Htofyon Thyssen attached to C(88) 8 for which he now sought the Cabinet&apos;s

^mfcpDval.

TH^wtNlSTER OF STATE, PRIVY COUNCIL OFFICE (MINISTER FOR THE ARTS) said

that,^e\strongly supported the proposals made by the Secretary of State

for^jSMiMvironment.    At the price proposed the permanent

acquisy&amp;op&lt;Pof the Thyssen Collection for this country would be a

remarkaVre bargain.    It would both enrich the range of Old Master

paintingvin this country and strengthen the holding of distinguished

modern paintings, which were very weakly represented in British public

collections.    In view of the scale of Government financing that was

proposed, it wa^JoNbe important for the Government to nominate a

majority of th(at rvstees of the new foundation.

In discussion theAfj^Aawing main points were made -

a. In view of wre^rtu.que nature of the opportunity, the

arrangements ancr^a^m^nts proposed by the Secretary of State for

the Environment reprp^S^ted a defensible package.    If they were

accepted, the Goverw|S  *fryY:ould show that it had successfully seized

a fleeting opportuniNk^/tHE they failed, then the Government could

demonstrate that it hai^g^n^ as far as it reasonably could to

secure these treasures^tor^rae nation.    It was, however, important

that Baron Thyssen and hi^xrjrttees should understand that the

Government had gone as  &amp;t( k      could and the details of its

proposal could not be modifiad/^u^ haggle between the Government

and the Collection&apos;s owners woutjP&apos;De most unseemly, especially if

appeared to be in competition Smr2 TOhe Spanish Government.

b. The proposals would get a mix&amp; &apos;polit ical reception, with

assertions that the money should be^spent on other purposes. Those

problems would be eased if the new gallery for the pictures were

located in Birmingham, rather than London.   The city centre

redevelopment in Birmingham was an extretarf^important venture that

enjoyed bipartisan political support in ine * gion.   The location

of an outstanding art collection there woa^ftrorawe both symbolic and

economic importance, and greatly assist the\ferp4tntation of the

Government&apos;s regional policies.    Baron Thyssert^i/uld be made fully

aware of the impressive character of the BiraingVMp development.

On the other hand, the first priority must be trrg^rcq^isition of

the Collection.

c. If it turned out that Baron Thyssen had such a Swjjma

preference for the Canary Wharf site that the proposaiTsorotoftd not

proceed on any other basis, it would be important for ia.tra^be seen

that the choice was his rather than the Government&apos;s. ^(^?


THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the

acquisition of the Thyssen-Bornemisza Collection on the terms

proposed would represent a unique bargain. The transfer of the

Gulbenkian Collection to Lisbon was an example of the losses to the

nation that could occur if opportunities of this kind were not

decisively seized.    A matter of this nature should, however, only

v   proceed under the full and explicit sanction of Parliament. The

r   Cabinet had therefore agreed that Baron Thyssen and the Trustees

^ohould be informed of the Government&apos;s willingness to seek

&gt;x ^liamentary authority for the acquisition of the collection for

million and for the establishment of a foundation and other

&lt; r f ftgements as set out in the draft note attached to C(88) 8. As

tfa&amp;yaraft note made clear, a number of legal points remained to be

seVt^ea.    In particular, it needed to be established that the new

foundation would have a clear and unencumbered title in the

pictures, and that there was no impediment to their coming to this

country in perpetuity.   These issues would require close and

continuing^iggal attention.    The Cabinet noted the Chancellor of

the Exche(n(ler5t agreement that any costs of the proposal within the

next threexJDsa^Z^seriod should be met from the Reserve: costs

falling beyonfl tA^t period would need to be considered in the next

public expendv^ra/8urvey when provision for other arts expenditure

beyond that peMao^s determined.    It was important to maintain

confidentiality 4ra&lt;&amp;Vthe Government&apos;s proposal, for as long as

possible since itruSsau^horised disclosure could jeapardise the

chances of success. ^y^S.
