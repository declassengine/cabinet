1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

Human \s,

Fertilisation^

and

Embryology

/TOE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the White Paper on

&apos;fjp&amp;jn fertilisation and embryology, setting out the Government&apos;s

\pTODb\als on the report of the Warnock Committee, had already been very

u^fuEfcy debated in the House of Lords and would be debated in the House

of Qpmkpqs on the following Thursday.    On the particularly sensitive

isstf^v^&amp;&apos;embryo research, the Government spokesman would put before the

House ^ne^iactual advice that was available to the Government on the

medicalfussues, but would make it clear that the Government had not

reached Vonclusions on the action to be taken.    This approach was in

line with that which had been adopted on the recent Second Reading of

Mr David Alton&apos;s Abortion (Amendment) Bill.    Although strong individual

feelings couldvbeYVexpected on the issues raised by the Warnock Report,

reaction to tq^GJjviernment&apos; proposals set out in the White Paper had so

far been encourag/fng}

THE PRIME MINISTER^^maing up a brief discussion, said that the issues

raised by the WarnocAr^#fomittee were potentially highly divisive, and

legislation should nGr^Revintroduced until it was certain that a wide

measure of agreement had^Mpan obtained for the Government&apos;s approach.

There should be no c ommraroe&apos;rm whatsoever as to the timing of legislation

until the picture was cle^*^y/\

Paisley

Grammar

 School

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND &amp; f&gt;that the Prime Minister&apos;s

letter the previous day to the Rector c$ Paisley Grammar School had been

greeted with the greatest enthusiasm by the parents of pupils at the

school, by the teachers there, and by parents and teachers at similar

institutions.    The letter had said that he wodJ^Xbe laying regulations

to expand the categories of school whose cloB^jrevby an education

authority would require his approval, and he wnr^tTMie making a

Parliamentary statement about the regulations lU^e^/^hat day.

11974

Birmingham

 Public House

I Bombings:

; Appeal

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Court of Appeal would&lt; ^gV\ving

judgment later that day on the cases, which he had refeVx&amp;d^o the

Court, of the six Irishmen serving sentences of life impri^mrhi^it for

the Birmingham public house bombings.    Depending on the coircNi^&apos;hon and

contents of the judgment, he might need to make a statement ^krlyythe

following week. ^/^^

lipiaosexuality

THE SECRETARY OF S^^^^OR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the proposal in

clause 28 of the Loc^x&amp;wernment Bill to prohibit the promotion of

homosexuality by loca^*aVp*pr i t ies had attracted a good deal of

criticism from the artis^jOcommunities.    While he believed these

worries to be il 1-foundetd^&apos;tife) acknowledged the sincerity of at least

some of the anxiety that^K32^&amp;en expressed.    In response to this, and

to head off the possibilit5M&amp;Ai&amp;fficulties in the debate in the House

of Lords the following week^ob^^aroposed t0 introduce an amendment to

the Bill to clarify the prohrVwi^o^that was proposed.    He had it in

mind that the clarification woW^d JnAng out that only local authorities

that had the intent or purpose o^/prpSii&gt;oting homosexuality would be in

breach of the prohibition. ^^-&quot;N

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a bri^K^j^cussion, said that there might

be some risk that increasingly refine^OJormulations of the prohibition

turned out to be counter-productive.    Opponents in the House of Lords,

and especially those with legal qualifications, might produce risible or

perplexing examples of events that might, or might not, be caught by the

prohibition, depending on the intent that wa*vTmp|Uted to the local

authority in question.    The Government&apos;s pro{fcsa^s-^should be formulated

so as to offer as little scope as possible for /stfcrV\scoring of

legalistic points, and the Secretary of State rqt--xj&gt;e} Environment should

consult the Attorney General on the matter. ^ilyy

The Cabinet - &lt;^*^y\

guided by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the d^eQx&amp;ion.

2.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had agreed,  in consultation with

the Secretary of State for Social Services,  that it should be made known

that the Government was carrying out an internal review of the National

Health Service, with special emphasis on the hospital service.    For the

^time being, nothing further should be said which might give rise to

^pjessure for further information about the timetable or likely

&gt;&lt;jQnclus ions.

Reference:

CC(88) 2.3

THE SEC^TARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that nurses at a number

of hosprrals had announced that they would be taking one-day strike

action the following week.    These decisions had been taken at poorly

attended meetings and it was difficult to estimate the scale of the

strike action/WfTyh would occur.    It was clear, however,  that those

organising thoxacta-Qn would seek to present it as protest

demonstrations. //Tne)\leaders of the trade unions principally concerned,

the Conf ederatios^-ej^Htealth Service Employees, the National Union of

Public Employees aijrjP^njA National Association of Local Government

Officers, were becomai&amp;^acreas ingly concerned that any action which

caused suffering to p^r^^etvts would be deeply resented by the public and

would be damaging politip^iiy to the Labour Party.    He had asked each

District and Regional H % iyAuthority to inform him of any operations

that were postponed or ofc&lt;te*^*rvanges to regimes which were required as a

result of the forthcoming irfa^^jrial action.    He would certainly wish to

draw to public attention anj\re^Srts of hardships caused to individual

patients.    Members of the Loo&amp;6W&gt; J bulance Service would also be taking

strike action the following we^fj^ut he did not thrTik that the scale of

the disruption would be suffic ien- /f_V.require the implementation of

emergency procedures.

Action in

the Coal

Industry

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the National Association of

Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) had broken off pay

negotiations with British Coal.    British CoaL^S 8k referred the dispute

to the National Reference Tribunal, whose fiiuling&gt;s were binding on both

sides.    He expected that a ballot of the memb&amp;rV^rpXof NACODS held

earlier that week would authorise the union&apos;s nlatJ^naJ. executive to

initiate industrial action short of indefinite st^kfe/ action. NACODS

were co-ordinating their action with the National Ujaroj -\of Mineworkers

(NUM), which would probably decide at a delegate cor^^jte^e the

following week to step up their current overtime ban.   ^e^ias keeping in

close touch with British Coal, and he and the Seeretar5^ ^wfate for

Employment were considering the next steps.    The coal sV&amp;cJsv^available

to the Central Electricity Generating Board were very suDs^ratrt^il.


THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said that British Coal would announce

shortly the closure of two large pits in Wales.    This would clearly be a

focus for protests by Mr Arthur Scargill and other militant members of

1^  the NUM.    But such protests would carry far less credibility if British

/^Coal were able to announce at the same time that agreement had been

^V^pached with the NUM in Wales, against the strong opposition of

Scargill, to introduce six day working at Margam Colliery. He

^pAi^eyed that the majority of Welsh mineworkers favoured six day working

(axMjncgam and it was important that British Coal should seize the

io^TMvive and come forward with detailed proposals for giving effect to

THE P^MJ^INISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Secretary

of StaK&amp;^ror Energy should keep in close touch with the Secretary of

State fw Wales about the handling of these matters.    The Government&apos;s

tactics throughout should be designed to support the moderate elements

among the mineworkers.

The Cabifc^^

1.      Took n^^^^wath approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing

up of the disc^afeoon and invited the Secretary of State for Energy

and the Secretacw&gt;^  State for Wales to be guided accordingly.

Industrial

Action at

, Ford Motor

Company

Limited

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FoVt^P^YMENT said that employees at Ford Motor

Company Limited had voted WeavX^ in favour of strike action against a

three year pay deal offered l^^Tne^management.    The two sides were due

to meet again later that day tp^ fy \to reach a settlement.    The prospect

of industrial action or of an mc^S^ed offer from the management was

unwelcome.    Moreover, industrial atHon would put in jeopardy the

creation of new jobs at Dagenham arta^E^erpool arising out of plans to

shift production away from continentay/,Ej*i&gt;ope.

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said^^^ the handling and

brevity of the meeting of the Foreign Affairs CourrcyLX^Sn 25 January

indicated that the German Presidency were still in \t&amp;aftskay.    The German

Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, had as a diversionary^a^tic encouraged

debate on the United Kingdom abatement.    Exposition of&lt;^2jtf \&amp;ase for not

re-opening the solutions reached at Fontainebleau had d&amp;(raated in

particular Italian support.    The structural funds remained-^jfx^ifficult

issue.    We would need to continue to work hard at keepingN^h^^armans,

French and Dutch to acceptance of the need to contain growctt/W/hin 1$

times the maximum rate.    Agricultural reform remained the cen^^i^s^sue,


with the dominant problem being the inadequate Presidency proposals for

cereals and oilseeds.    It would be necessary to recover this ground.

Our alliance with the Dutch remained firm and we were jointly making

)   efforts to mobilise pressure on both the Commission and the Presidency.

 ^Although he was not optimistic about the prospects for early agreement,

\Ve should not ourselves signal doubts but keep the Germans in the dock.

^m^WINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that in some

vres  fcts the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 23-24 January had not

b^en unsuccessful.    The Presidency had sought to re-open the position on

a n^HroeJKof the commodities in the Copenhagen package but he had been

able^Spymobilise a majority to resist this approach.    It had been

acceplj^p/fcriat adoption of a set aside scheme could not provide a case

for abandoning stabilisers in that area.    Proposals for a drastically

weakened** variant of the oilseed stabiliser had also not been followed

through.    The discriminatory quality of the proposals on the co-

responsibility -Levy would raise special difficulty in the context of

presenting the/lfrAuments for agricultural reform in the United Kingdom.

THE PRIME MINISTBlfp)\umming up a short discussion, said that the special

European Councilv^j^rV^ February might well prove an unsatisfactory

occasion if a Fran^d^Gpynan alliance persisted and attitudes were

influenced by elect r!aV^reoccupations.    However, we should resolutely

resist any attempts t^w&amp;ldoze through an unsatisfactory agreement.

Additional resources wou-tf 2*;equire unanimity.    We should stick to our

guns and maintain the p^Jsrssune for reform.
