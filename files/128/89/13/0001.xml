Jrok SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the remaining

&apos;sN^a$ s of the Local Government Finance Bill were scheduled to occupy

VbrfwtJof the Government time in the House of Commons during the following

yeeK/a&lt;*d the subsequent Monday.    Probably the most crucial single issue

was thB^ew clause moved by Mr Michael Mates, which would be considered

durwfgl^ first day of the Report Stage, on the following Monday. That

new cwj *jCVould provide a graduated system of community charges related

to the^^rga-payer.1 s liability to income tax.    The normal community

charge \wyfyzbe required from those paying income tax at the standard

rate; thosk below the income tax threshold but beyond the limits of the

taper of housing benefit proposed by the Government would only be liable

to a community charge at 50 per cent of the normal rate; whilst higher

rate income taxpayers would be liable to a community charge enhanced by

50 per cent.    Ap/arVjangement of this kind was manifestly objectionable,

both because ofV^e^^aring anomalies that would flow from it and

because of the higmfadministrative costs that would be incurred at any

attempt to make it^Zs&amp;xfcf) Nevertheless, Mr Mates&apos;s proposal was backed

by a number of GoverMlaVt^supporters.    A few of these were implacable

opponents of the commu^^^^harge, but many of them had but a poor

understanding of the is^^tfsgjMJivolved,  and no more than a vague feeling

that the community charge/jjOTl-K too heavily on poorer people. He

believed it was essential rf^r \he Government to detach as many as

possible of its supporters xr^jfr^hr Mates&apos;s proposition and he therefore

proposed that further help wMoiwe community charge should indeed be

offered to the less well off,^nj ^t?hrough the appropriate machinery,

which was clearly an adjustmenrxy^^e taper that determined the rate at

which housing benefit was withdra-ro i?nom beneficiaries as their income

increased.    In the present f inane i^cy&amp;jr the rate of the taper (which

naturally took account of assistanca^ro^ajds domestic rates rather than

the community charge) was set at 20 p*5^ ent.    He proposed, with the

agreement of the Chief Secretary, Trea^)^^ the Secretary of State for

Scotland and the Secretary of State forMfocial Services, that this

should be reduced to 15 per cent when th K community charge was

introduced.   The reduced tapers would therefore apply from 1989-90 in

Scotland and from 1990-91 in England and Wales.   The effect of this

would be to reach a very large number of the p/  ff&quot;afc people that

Mr Mates&apos;s amendment was designed to help, buoAsiirjijQut the clear defects

and anomalies inherent in Mr Mates&apos;s proposal, lSfalTising its impact on

higher taxpayers.    If the Cabinet agreed his prop^&amp;a^Ahe would need to

consider how best to present it in order to be most^e^te^tive in

detaching Government supporters from Mr Mates&apos;s amen/mjHj \ he was at

present disposed to think that the best course would^JP\ o$ him to hold

a press conference later that day, following the meeting j^h the

committee of Conservative backbench Members in environme^d^ayfairs.

In discussion the following main points were made - &lt;//\\v


a.     Liability to income tax, or to tax at the higher rate, was

largely influenced by such matters as entitlement to allowances,

and very often could not be determined within the year in question.

Under Mr Mates&apos;s proposals, very slight changes in such matters

(including,  for example, mortgage interest rates) could have the

effect of tipping charge-payers one way or the other between the

proposed three bands.    The proposal was, therefore, a tax trap of

^ the worst kind and was totally unacceptable on that ground alone,

w The capricious impact of the proposals could have some especially

^^&amp;tartling effects on the somewhat better-off.    For example, a

S cAkrge-payer in Camden who came just within the higher income tax

^?braiyket would suddenly find that he and his spouse were, between

 l&gt;&lt;?m^-J.iable for a single extra community charge payment equivalent

t^X^e full charge for that authority, currently estimated at about

b.     \juite apart from questions of principle about access to tax

information, Mr Mates&apos;s scheme represented vast administrative

problems.    During the course of a radio interview that morning

Mr Mates hatKayserted that he had been advised by Department of the

EnvironmeniAjjfvLcials that the administrative aspects were

manageable arw&apos;Thjat the problem was, rather, a political one, but

that was not ^a--a e*arate account of the analysis that officials

had,  in fact, gjrJ^fl/Mr Mates.    The fact that his proposals had

masssive implicat/iroj^ir^for tax administration was now emphasised by

his need to put d&lt;^*v\3^further amendment, designed to bring his new

clause into order witj* * t a ways and means resolution.    The effect

of the latest amendm^^/vMS to make the machinery dependent on

self-certification by\^tJhe//*harge-payerf without any system of

verification. &lt;S^\\&gt;

c. It was insufficientlg^rm^rstood, both inside and outside

Parliament, that the top ic/^r\\ent of earners paid 15 times more

towards the expenses of locaL^Jv^rnment than did the bottom 10 per

cent of earners. This fact did md^n to displace the assumptions on

which Mr Mates&apos;s proposal reste^&lt;^^ the Government should take

every opportunity to emphasise it\/

d. About 7 million people were currently estimated to be eligible

for housing benefit in 1990.   The effect of the Secretary of State

for the Environment&apos; 8 proposal would be to increase the amount of

benefit available to about 2.7 million of/CEfese people, and to make

about an additional 1 million people eliafble^for benefit. The

cost of his proposal would be about  115  iXfJeh&gt;- 130 million.

Mr Mates&apos;s defective proposals would,  in con^rjAt. cost in excess

of  300 million. 7^//

e. Although the Secretary of State for the EnV^crfJment&apos; s proposal

was clearly the right way of tackling the problem, ^p^you Id need to

be carefully presented so as to avoid any apparent^j rxj^.ict with

the social security reforms that had recently been Wou&amp;ht into

effect.    In particular,  the present proposal did notSr^rat^t the

capital cut-off for housing benefit, on which much rec^n^ otitic ism


had concentrated, and it would be necessary to present the proposed

increased number of beneficiaries in a way that did not impair the

Government&apos;s commitment to reduce the dependency culture.

?

^\THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

yjagreed the Secretary of State for the Environment&apos;s proposal that the

-^/^per for housing benefit should be reduced from 20 per cent to 15 per

y^^Kt in Scotland and in England and Wales to coincide with the

\&gt;&gt;($*i&apos;oduction of the community charge.    The Cabinet also authorised the

^afaj&amp;ary of State for the Environment to announce the full details of

tM^^tfcision later that day, if he judged this to be tactically

necessa^.    Although there was probably a fairly widespread acceptance

that&lt;$^J4 tes&apos;s amendment presented various practical difficulties, a

greate^T^^rort was now needed to expose the true nature of Mr Mates&apos;s

proposa^/^e a capricious tax trap.    It would also be important to

stress bVth the scale of extra assistance that was now to be made

availableM;hrough the appropriate machinery, and the extent of the

differential contribution that higher earners already made to local

authority expenditure, through taxation.    It would be important not to

say anything atrytThyy stage about the way in which the money for the

decision should^e^  und, since this could only be considered as part of

the decision abouify&apos;tma overall Exchequer grant for the years in

question.    Finally^^^Mlnister should always be present when Members of

Parliament were inv^ra^Ao discuss sensitive matters of public policy

with officials.

The Cabinet - &lt;/^\

Took note, with appro\ ^^f the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the discw^flsXp^ and invited the

Secretary of State for l^e/g&amp;vironment to proceed

accordingly.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLO^OT^ said that workers at Jaguar&apos;s

Coventry plant were threatening to tak^itrike action from the following

Monday over plans to increase production there.   Negotiations between

the Jaguar management and the trade unions had until recently appeared

to be deadlocked but there were now indications that fresh talks might

be initiated.    A separate industrial dispute w^e^developing over plans

by Jaguar and GKN Sankey to secure a single uVioryagreement for a new

factory they proposed to open early the followvV^-y&amp;ar at Telford which

would create 400 new jobs building car bodies f^r^J^cuar. Union

opposition to single union agreements put at risVptfji/prospects of new

jobs, as had been demonstrated by the decision of Tojid^he previous

month to drop their proposal to open a factory at DowfeA\ The Trades

Union Congress had shown themselves to be totally inefrep-JJ&amp;al in seeking

to resolve inter-union disputes over single union agre&lt;jir$Hj &quot;S\.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the strike action by

members of the National Union of Seamen employed by P &amp; 0 European

Ferries at Dover was now in its eleventh week.    A number of seamen had

second jobs and the current industrial action accordingly had the

Xpotential to run for a good deal longer.    However, further developments,

)lncluding a mass meeting of the workforce, could be expected over the

-yfjsi\\owing weekend.

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, said that the group Islamic

Jihad, who^were the kidnapping and extortion arm of the terrorist

organisation Hizbollah, were almost certainly responsible for the

hijacking on 5 AarjJ. of a Kuwaiti Airlines Boeing 747 en route from

Bangkok to Kuwa/fyt&apos;TjNlmad Mughniyah, brother-in-law of one of the 17

convicted terroW^t)t serving prison sentences in Kuwait, was believed to

be directing the dtteraVion of the hijacking.    Hizbollah and Islamic

Jihad looked to Ir^n^pp^ guidance.    Although there was no clear evidence

of collusion by Iran^wJiyCbAthe hijackers,  there were reports that when

the aircraft had been/ ^ foshhad in Northern Iran extra hijackers and

explosives or weapons tfatiAgone on board.    The release on 6 and 7 April

of all the British subject^xjwiong the passengers aboard had been very

fortunate.

Once the hijacked aircraft hrfl^r^ached Cyprus, the attention of the

press and public, and the faoAjPjlfit the aircraft had been in full public

view, had adversely affected tf*e^fcf&gt;dling of the incident.    It was

regrettable that it had been pe lqrjirx t)*^4 to refuel and depart from Cyprus.

But since the full facts of the naj ef*M.tions had not yet emerged, it was

premature to induldge in recriminations.

Algeria, to which the hijacked aircrafX^h^Jl flown from Cyprus, had a

long history of acting as &quot;brokers&quot; in^ncidents of this kind, as they

had done between the United States and j^an over the episode of the

American Embassy hostages in 1979 and in the negotiations between France

and Iran.   The Government had warned the Algerian Government of their

responsibilities to extradite or prosecute hij p3&amp;Lrs.   The team

negotiating with the hijackers included Kuwaims Qtid representatives of

the Palestinian Liberation Organisation as wert^a^-^igerians. The

latter had begun to blame Kuwait for in trans igen^dejyoWre was no sign of

the Kuwaitis yielding and their resolution had befeflxfefrm throughout. It

was not known how matters would finally turn out ana/^i^was not

appropriate for Britain to make detailed public comme^fj^Aeyond

recalling that British policy was not to strike deals wMp &gt;terrorists

and that international obligations must be respected.   $f peSuas full

support for this from British press and public opinion.


When the current incident was over,  there would be some lessons to be

learned for the future.    For example, it was important to be able to

sanitise the immediate environment of a hijacked aircraft from press and

\ media attention.    Public speculation made any kind of intervention to

vVnd a hijacking very difficult and the numerous press and media

&apos;Joeferences to the possible involvement of the British Special Air

iixs^kyice had been unhelpful.    It was nevertheless a modest achievement

w^rj^^the American media had not publicised the fact that one of the

^^a^aengers (who had been among those released at Larnaca) was a dual

6lii&gt;e^Staes/Egyptian national with an American passport in his

poWe^r^qn.

THE FOREjM AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that an agreement was due to

be signed ciiat day at Geneva providing for the withdrawal of Soviet

troops from Afghanistan to begin on 15 May and to be completed within

nine months.    TheJioviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, had

said privately jy^Wthington during March that withdrawal might in fact

be completed ahaVd ax~Xhat deadline.    There was no formal agreement on

the question of coiyfTTnuing Soviet military support for the Afghan regime

in Kabul and recipV^ *K^mericans rights with respect to the Afghan

Resistance.    But the&lt; j*^njj^ld be side letters which in effect provided

that if the Soviet Uni^jp^^re to continue supplying arms to the regime,

the United States wouldr^S&amp;JAle to match such supplies to the Mujahideen

on a symmetrical basis. syy\

No doubt some people wouldN^ajXfchat the agreement was less than ideal.

This should not be allowed to^o^Sx^ire the fact that after eight years

the Soviet Union had been bro^hVBo admit having made a major mistake,

no matter how much the General ^M^bary of the Communist Party of the

Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbach^yf^ould seek to embellish the

presentation of withdrawal.    There^^fsM^o Western interest, before

Soviet troop withdrawal was completed^in harping unduly on future

government arrangements in Kabul, siifo^Siis would only serve to hand

back the political initiative to the S&lt;5yop&amp;Union.    The important thing

was to allow conditions to evolve in wh^Ki the Afghan people were free

to choose their own Government for themselves.   He would be making a

public statement later that day welcoming the agreement and announcing a

pledge of further substantial British aid for the Afghan refugees. In

short, the best should not be allowed to becoma&lt;35k enemy of the good.

The aim must be to persuade the Soviet Union tuarraly the lessons of

Afghanistan and to be guided by comparable rear^i^xsSother parts of the

world. \&gt;~^\JyS

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the exP^*Y]  f *V

ammunition depot on 10 April situated between Islamabad f^Mg^P111*1

had resulted in around 100 announced deaths with some 1&gt;1VV^5&gt;eu

injured.    The cause was not known.    Mishandling of explosive^te^have


been responsible but a Pakistan Minister had said that sabotage could

not be ruled out.    Since the depot had stored munitions destined for the

^    Afghan Resistance there might be consequences for the continuing flow of

^   supplies to them.

in TorjB^Sg a new Government and would be unlikely to secure votes of

5.     The Cabinet considered a memorandum by thy^Sypretary of State for

Defence (C(88) 6) on the Statement on the Defl^eJikeHmates 1988.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the\S*^*taent underlined

the continuity and stability of British defence po^ &gt;^V^s*ith appropriate

emphasis on both nuclear and conventional forces.    lA^J^orded the

decisive conclusion of the domestic debate on Tridents^lM^eviewed our

security concerns in the wake of the 1987 Treaty on Inte^Jpj&amp;iate Nuclear

Forces.    It stressed the need for an effective nuclear Mr^meht in NATO

strategy; and in its focus on the Warsaw Pact conventiona^^Isr\chemical

threat it reflected NATO&apos;s arms control priorities.    The f *   e^ on

Warsaw Pact forces had been agreed with the Secretary GeneraQ^H^NATO to


ensure consistency with NATO assessments.    The Statement once again

warned of the need for difficult decisions to match priorities to the

available resources, but also stressed the steps being taken to achieve

&gt;   better value for money.    The presentation would be further improved that

t^Xyear by the addition of coloured photographs.    A popular version, free

Jiof charge, was also envisaged; there had been no criticism of this the
