the (QjfChKt of statutory ballots for elections and for political funds.

He und r/s * &amp;d that the Secretary of State for Employment would decide in

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERIES said that the Social Services

Committee&apos;s Report on resourcing the^n n/onal Health Service (NHS) would

be published later that day.   The RepoVp\/^hich was a confused and

incoherent piece of work, argued that Cn /Government should commit

itself to the full funding of NHS pay awagrds for 1988-89; that resources

should be allocated to allow NHS services to grow by 2 per cent in

1988-89; and that the Government should make good sums that the

Committee perceived as shortfalls in funding in^fraXt years and the

present one.    The Committee&apos;s comments on fundwie Wjthe present year

were partly due to their misinterpretation of eVnt!sTTc  put to them by

his Department.    He proposed to make a short anno\xi ^?Bt that day,

pointing to the resources that the Government had lr^rack found for the

NHS, clarifying some of the Report&apos;s misunderstanding/ j*$ &gt;iaking it

clear that the Government would in due course reply fu^f^Tb^ the Report

in the normal way. ^^^*\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the National Reference

Tribunal (NRT) had considered the dispute between the National

Association of Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) and

British Coal (BC) at the weekend, and were expected shortly to announce

rtsKeir findings, which were binding on both sides.    It seemed likely that

^hANRT fundings would be less directed at pay than at other conditions

^wAarvice.    In the meantime, BC had withdrawn the re-rostering

aroawements that had been introduced at the height of the dispute and

NACO^S*^iad called off the ban on overtime working.

3.    THE FOREIg/(aNI^)COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the objective of

the North Atlanisiy&lt; ?^ty Organisation (NATO) Summit in Brussels on

3 March would be t^rAkffirm the unity of the Alliance.   There was no

difficulty over the c^atrral principles underlying NATO strategy in

respect of both defmaf^Ad arms control.    But there could be problems

with the Federal RepuMjr &lt; vf Germany (because of internal coalition

factors) over what note te^a^rike about the need to keep NATO nuclear

and conventional forces M^Xrpviiate, although he was hopeful that these

could be successfully circ^fciv$rat d.    Equally, there was room for

disagreement with the Federa-j^&amp;wblic over the sequence of the arms

control agenda.   Earlier NAT&amp;VTui^ter ial meetings at Reykjavik and

Stavanger had usefully made cTe^//hat after the conclusion of an

intermediate range nuclear force/^ gyfislement the priorities for arms

control negotiations should be stram^c nuclear weapons, chemical

weapons and conventional forces.   %nl&gt;^ fter that should the question of

possible reductions in short range tw^i^Sb forces be addressed.    It was

important that the sixteen democratic^wfewments comprising the

Alliance should come to clear conclusioo^Bt the NATO Summit on these

force modernisation and arms control questions.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thl^i^secent

demonstrations and public protests in Yerevan ref^cfce/d traditional

Armenian nationalism within the Soviet Union direct-e^ln particular

toward Turkic Azerbaidjan.    In the present case theMJef^j&amp;trators were

calling for transfer of territory from Azerbaidjan tcM rro wia. The

Politburo in Moscow had despatched a strong group of tne vop^et

leadership to talk to the Armenians on the spot, much as^&amp;rj^tad done

in the face of previous expressions of nationalist sentimetkcarvsewhere

in the Soviet Union.    Demonstrations in Yerevan had now been-^^aljrorarily

suspended, pending consideration at the level of the General\Aew^kary

of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail GorbachM^^/-

Conceding an alteration of the relevant territorial boundaries wair^dvfce

likely to lead to more trouble by outraging the Azerbaidjanis. Kxap^ie^


likely outcome was a compromise giving more recognition to the social,

*&gt;   economic and cultural interests of Armenians.    Should this fail to

?^satisfy the demonstrators and were public protest to be resumed, a hard

^//Line might well have to be imposed by the Soviet leadership. These

^^rfmDonstrations, which had received litle publicity within the Soviet

VA^w^C&gt;n, would give no comfort to the proponents of perestroika and

H^^Bgost.    Whatever the outcome, events had strengthened the critics of

Mjr Po?^chev.

THE PRIW&amp;^KINISTER said that she and the Foreign and Commonwealth

of State, Mr George Shultz, who was passing through London en route for

Brussels direct from his shuttle diplomacy in the Middle East.

There would be a^Efrparate meeting with King Hussein who was also in

in the Arab/lsra^/^EEs^pute.    The situation of the Israeli Prime

Minister, Mr YitzHak^iamir, was now different from what it had been

before the recent o *jr&amp;erak of violence in the occupied territories.

This was an example o ^ ^2onscr ipt army acting in support of the civil

power and being unable^ro^bXserve necessary restraints.    She recalled

that Israeli forces haouV^vJcately been obliged to withdraw from

The Cabinet^fcr^^|LDre them a memorandum by the Secretary of State for

Trade and Indu^^y^C(88)4) and a draft announcement to Parliament that

British Aerospaca^Km(BAe) had been given, until the end of April, an

exclusive right tq^^^tfiate on the acquisition of the Government

shareholding in Rova^H up.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE J^^RADE AND INDUSTRY said that since the sale

of the commercial vehidTe subsidiaries of the Rover Group (RG) to DAF in

the previous year the Group&apos;s Chairman, Mr Graham Day, had been

reviewing the options for the return to the private sector of the

remaining RG businesses.    These were principally Austin Rover and Land

Rover.    Until recently it had apgflkred that the prospects of selling

these businesses, whether by flWt^^Qn or through sale to institutions,

within an acceptable timeframe woK^wnote, but BAe had recently made an

unsolicited approach to him, decl^Hkjg^a serious interest in acquiring

the whole of the  issued share capi^M^^iG and seeking to open

negotiations for the purchase of the^ovMyriment shareholding.    BAe were,

however,  insistent that they would be^AgflLto enter into such formal

negotiations with the Government only iT were granted exclusivity

of negotiation for a fixed period.    In vl^^^^Lthe difficult history of

the matter, he had agreed with BAe that tn^ufc^aurnment would be prepared

to deal with them on an exclusive basis, bur oJ^until the end of

April, after which the Government would naturinly be free to examine

alternative options.    A number of important matters remained to be

settled.    In particular, BAe had been looking for a Government cash

injection that would make a worthwhile contribution to the working

capital needs of the acquired busineses over and above j^at was required

to write off all debt and related liabilities of RG aad^mhad, in

reply,  stressed the need for the Government to emerge^J|ffiA deal which

was publicly defensible and which the EC Commission wouM^B^rove under

state aid rules.    He had also made it clear to BAe that ak^^Kriism

would be required to ensure that they did not dispose of ei^peBAustin

Rover or Land Rover for a period of at least 5 years from colkl^kion of

any purchase.    Without such a provision,  BAe would be free to^MfA for a

profit  in on-selling the businesses to other trade buyers. ^^UM

wish to continue the collaboration with Honda that RG presently ^PM^

and, subject to the Cabinet&apos;s agreement, steps would be taken to^hk^^k


sure that the right people in Honda were informed of the announcement:

he believed that Honda would,  in fact, continue their co-operation, but

during a visit to Japan in the following week he proposed to emphasise

^ to the Honda management that the Government would also welcome this,

^kubject to satisfactory resolution of the points he had mentioned, he

^ufcs satisfied that the BAe proposals would provide a sound solution for

^ th*^kreturn of RG to the private sector, without encountering monopoly

^Jon^ems or the distrust of foreign interests that had been manifested

on previous occasions.    The proposals had the great advantage of

offering an assured future to RG&apos;s component manufacturers, and to their

network of distributors and dealers.    Links between the aerospace and

motor industries existed in a number of other countries, and worked

well.    For^f^Ll these reasons he believed that RG&apos;s acquisition by BAe

represen M ^ best way forward,  but if the negotiations should fail,

the GoverreK|&apos;^ tfould be free to look at offers from elsewhere.

Parliament ^E^^me Stock Exchange would need to be  informed before

detailed fornfe^^rr otiations could commence,  and he sought  the Cabinet&apos;s

agreement to a^^n^uncement later that day on the lines of the draft

circulated withTd^^fr.

In discussion the ^flung main points were made -

a. After BAe,  th^tf^mpanies most likely to show an  interest  in RG

were probably Foroand Volkswagen.    Both these possibilities raised

difficulties.    Acquisition by Ford might well raise monopoly

problems, whilst acquisition by Volkswagen would threaten RG&apos;s

dealers, distributors and component suppliers.

b. The main cause for aimMi^was whether BAe1 s management was

itself sufficiently robust^R^^e on the notorious management

demands of RG.    On the other^C%ar Mr Graham Day&apos;s grasp of RG had

been notably firm and competefW^Bfcl BAe were proceeding on the

basis that he would remain avaimbl^^o them.

c. Both BAe and RG were defence ^cTMry tors but, subject to the

ability of the BAe management to copa^^Rb the acquisition, there

was no reason to question the proposa^^fc^kdefence grounds.

d. The Secretary of State for Trade arar Industry had taken legal

advice and was satisfied that there was no legal impediment to the

proposed exclusive negotiating period, or to concluding a deal with

BAe during that period provided that any alternative bids were

properly considered before a final decision was talun.    In making

the decision,  there would be a wide range of facAcEato be taken

into account,  as well as the price obtained for ^ SAfernment&apos; s

shareholding.

e. The statement to be made in Parliament should br^g ^it the

fact that after the end of April the Government would m^^Ally be

free to examine alternative options. ^^m^^.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the CarJ^f|&gt;lJ^

agreed that the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should ?


negotiate with BAe for the sale of the Government shareholding in RG

during an exclusive negotiating period up to the end of April, as set

^out in C(88)4.    In view of the clear undertakings given on previous

^Wccasions, Parliament should be informed before the matter was taken any

Hkrther.    The Secretary of State for Trade and Industry and the

k^h^cellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should therefore make an

^^^ncement that afternoon on the lines of the draft attached to

^88)4,  subject to the points made in discussion,  in particular the fact

that after the end of April the Government would be free to examine

alternative options.    She regretted that, because of the extreme market

sensitivity of the information and the lack of secure communication

links,  it w*uld not be possible to notify the Secretary of State for

EmploymeAm o was  in Los Angeles on Government business,  about the

statement^jP&amp;Ae the time when it was made.    It was extremely important

that the Go^RjJ^nt spokesmen in both Houses should not be drawn

significantl3^J&quot;pfcad the bare notification in the draft statement, for

fear of prejudKinBsubsequent developments.    It would not be necessary

to submit a pro^roiBkleal to Parliament before it was concluded with BAe

and no commitmen^^kjlbe contrary should be given.

The Cabinet - ^R^k

Took note, with afKToval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the

discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Trade and

Industry and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to make

announcements that afternoon in each House of Parliament, as the

Prime Minister had indicatedg^
