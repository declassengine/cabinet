THE^PkME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate the

Lord&gt;* fvy Seal and the Chief Whip, House of Lords, on the very

substantial majority by which the House of Lords had on the previous

Monday^t ? ^ted an amendment proposed by Lord Chelwood to the Local

GovernmepVE^iance Bill which would have undermined a basic principle of

the commu/fvty charge.   The strength of the Government&apos;s case in this

regard was\reflected in the number of cross-bench peers who had voted

against the amendment.

The Cabinety^^x

Endorsed the^te^Sn^Minister1s remarks and congratulated

the Lord PrivyO&gt;eAA-and the Chief Whip, House of Lords,

on the handling-^$d^ he Local Government Finance Bill.

would be imposed on the union.   The^un^Jh now faced serious financial

difficulties as a result of the fine^^iready imposed and their legal

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said tha ineral Council of

the Trades Unions Congress had the previous day ag/reeW, by a majority of

19 to 14, to give conditional support to the Govercffll^jrc^s adult training

programme for the long-term unemployed.    This welcom fyD^&gt;ilt would

greatly facilitate the establishment of the programme^wjj^v could be

expected to make an important contribution to further ve^rang the rate

of unemployment. &lt;^v&gt;\

I 1911

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he would in the following week circulate to

.Cabinet colleagues the final draft of the White Paper on the Reform of

\\Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911, on which the Government had

Vp&lt;omised debates before the Summer Recess.    The White Paper would

 ^fTr^vpose that, as in the unsuccessful Bill introduced in 1979,  the scope

Swcrf/&amp;riminal sanctions should be limited to certain defined categories of

^nToymation in areas where unauthorised disclosures were peculiarly

li^elwvto damage national interests.    A major change from the scheme of

the/^T^-Bill would be that where the protected nature of the

information depended on a test of such damage, the prosecution would

have T^rjM^ablish it to the satisfaction of the Court: the earlier

proposalconclusive Ministerial certificates on the risk of damage

to nation*! interests was not being repeated.    The White Paper would

propose a^jpecial offence for members of the security services, and

those working closely with them, which would penalise their unauthorised

disclosure of any information relating to their work, without any

requirement to yp&amp;te damage to national interests.    A further aspect of

the proposals w^ichywould doubtless attract comment would be the absence

of any special ctei^jic^v based on public interest.   While any effort to

reform this area ^t^kk^lav was bound to be difficult and controversial,

he believed that trte^fftfeme put forward in the draft White Paper was a

sound one and that tny/jMuments deployed to support it were convincing.

The Government was coinmu to moving forward with this White Paper.

He hoped that Cabinet colK a$ues would let him have any comments as soon

as possible. (//a\

The Cabinet - i^XVk

comments, the draft of a Wliltexjj^er on the Reform of

Section 2 of the Official SecVe^Xct 1911.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that in recent ^^ys three separate Metropolitan

Police cases involving alleged football hooliganism had collapsed as a

result of doubts about police evidence.    It was^- qportant to limit the

adverse impact on police morale, and he had taYenuhe opportunity to

reaffirm the Government&apos;s support for the polr^e^&apos;jfr^fforts to grapple

with this important problem. (( J)

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the overcrowding in the prLa^j^Xystem

continued to impose a heavy strain on the prison service^as)fcad been

illustrated the previous day by an outbreak of disorder aK^RJw^N&apos;stone

Military Camp.    He was very grateful for the help which thew*\ Mtry of

Defence had provided in establishing temporary accommodationwp^V

prisoners at Rollestone and Alma Dettingen Camps.    An encouragiufyfr^.

development was that the number of prisoners in police cells waar

falling.

^THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the &quot;Evening Standard&quot; had

&apos;rhe previous day carried a prominent report which had claimed that the

^ejrcvrch of Scotland had criticised the speech by the Prime Minister to

 ^fcXe^General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on the previous Saturday.

^rra^Shurch of Scotland had issued a statement making clear that the

rvp&apos;Ac^had been based on a gross misunderstanding of what had been

mef^ty^vprocedural vote and that the Prime Minister&apos;s attendance had in

factxj$ee*k^greatly welcomed by the General Assembly and that any future

visit w *rldbe equally welcome.

3.     THE FOREIGN T&amp;rf^frpiONWEALTH SECRETARY said there had been

unwelcome press repA t^/b.ased on a misunderstanding, which had given the

impression that the t^raWnment was seeking to delay the holding of the

inquest in Gibraltar onA fae Irish Republican Army terrorists involved

in a bomb plot and shor^ \^je security forces on 6 March.    This had

fuelled suspicion in the mera &amp; of a conspiracy.   The truth was that the

Government wished to have &lt;fcJJ^Vtquest held as soon as possible, not to

delay it.   Every effort voSM_jiaw.be made to persuade the Coroner to

decide upon and announce a fi^^ifT^e.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY/^**id there had been no change in

the situation in Beirut.    There had lw *frdlj rther breakdowns in the

cease-fire.   The Syrians were still ho^Cngto avoid armed intervention.

If they were to advance into Beirut&apos;s smiQrern suburbs that would pose

added risks for the remaining hostages, ^&amp;he debriefing of the recently

released French hostages had not yet been completed.   First reports did

seem to suggest that the three British hostages were still alive, but

there was no basis for the more graphic stories^rrrs^he press.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the^ejjLjtt Hungarian

Socialist Workers Party Conference had resulted in a l^a^o^otriumph for

the Prime Minister, Mr Karoly Grosz, who had recently vfsvr^d Britain.

It was ironic that this advocate of decentralisation had &lt;rf f&gt;4fc ntly

decided to combine his new party post as successor to Mr jfafiosjKadar in

the role of General Secretary with his governmental post aV^^wfSb

Minister.   Mr Grosz1 s bid for rapid economic reform was like^\^cVl&gt;e

accompanied by widespread pressure for political change. v&gt;&lt;^/


-^Mn discussion,  it was noted that during his visit to Britain Mr Grosz

^)Ld aired far-reaching ideas about economic reform and that he appeared

4^\be taking full advantage in Hungary of the opportunities provided by

^Gorbachev&apos;s concepts of glasnost and, perestroika in the Soviet Union.

THE FQj^GJkAND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that seven female members of

the Etr^^an Royal Family detained without trial since 1974 had been

released XjHr^21 May.    Three male members of the Royal Family were still

in prisomA The general situation in Ethiopia remained lamentable, and

current economic and agrarian policies had been criticised even by the

Russians and the Chinese.   The United Kingdom had been in the forefront

of efforts to secyxe the release of the Royal Family and would continue

to keep up the ryrcsa^re for the release of the remainder.

THE PRIME MINISTER sai ^sk the United States President,

Mr Ronald Reagan, had ctftfs^nvto come direct to London in preference to a

debriefing visit to Brusse^^aiter the forthcoming Summit meeting in

Moscow with the General Se^era^y of the Communist Party of the Soviet

Union, Mr Mikhail GorbachevY^Tj* B gesture was a very great compliment.

There would be talks at No 10/^wV^ng Street on Thursday 2 June,

followed by a small dinner parw^/^kd on the following day Mr Reagan

would be going to the GuildhallW^^Tie would make a speech reporting

on the Summit.   There would thus fae sS&amp;ood deal of news interest

focussed on London and the United SytMjAdministration deserved some

public words of encouragement.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER reported(^^Abe Japanese

Government had now reached decisions on liquor tax ve^dtm which would

shortly be conveyed in a letter to the Prime Minister//^rthough some

details remained to be settled the decisions reached wK^Q^t is factory.

A non-discriminatory regime for Scotch vis a vis Japanese wjj&amp;sky

products had been established.   The tax rate for whisky \&lt;aV^o\be

reduced to Yen 1,150 per litre, a 45 per cent reduction frxxn_^nievcur rent

Yen 2,098.   The tax on shochu would be raised by 75 per cent^tfjx^^

achieving a major reduction in the tax differential. vO/O

&quot;lb*


?^sTHE PRIME MINISTER summing up a brief discussion, said that the response

/iqo the Japanese decisions, when they had been made public, should be

i^o^^idled in conjunction with the industry.    The general thrust of our

//IrtTOonse should be to welcome the package warmly which had resulted from

^eu r ained pressure by the United Kingdom authorities.    The outcome

a^nxej&amp;d augured well for future Anglo/Japanese relations.

THE FOU&amp;feJfeD COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of the

United sS&lt;eT Mr Reagan, had vetoed the Trade Bill on 24 May for

domesticl&amp;sons.   The&quot; House of Representatives had voted to override

the veto but it was likely to be upheld by the Senate.

4.     THE FOREIGN ANu^fiOjjMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at its meeting on

24 May, the Foreign iSratir^ Council had considered all the outstanding

points in the follow-up^Xthe February European Council.   The text of

the budget discipline a^p^el^n had remained firmly agreed.    Some further

detailed discussions would ir^required before the own resources decision

could be put in place.   Ai^roeyneeting of the EC/Israel Co-operation

Council, the Prime Minister^p^Xarael, Mr Peres, had taken up a

conciliatory position on all jarjj^s^anding Tax and Trade issues including

those concerning the Occupied\Kerpi\ories.    However the proof of this

pudding would be in the eating.^DT^^issions had also taken place with

Mr Peres on the prospects for the^pea&amp;e process in the Middle East: he

had made a convincing presentation jej^hos case but was clearly not

confident about the prospects for tne^anraeli elections which might be

brought forward to August. The Counci^-il3&amp; endorsed the text of the

EC/Council for Mutual Economic AssociaftWn^COMECON) Joint Declaration.

As regards negotiations with individuarvf^MECON states, the prospects

for an EC/Hungary agreement next month nc^j looked reasonably hopeful and

an agreement with Czechoslovakia was a possibility.    The Youth for

Europe exchange programme had been agreed with funding of only  10

million over three years, well below the  40 mi&gt; t&amp;ji programme that some

member countries had looked for.   As regards tne d^fces of the 1989

European Parliament elections, most member countEie^i ppeared now ready

to settle for 15-18 June but Spain had yet to come^inijb line.    In a

brief discussion it was noted that in the Council^s-jj^seussion of the

structural funds, satisfactory assurances had been r&amp;apm&amp;d from the

Commission that the rural areas of particular concernv^a^w. the

Highlands and Islands, mid-Wales and Devon and Cornwall, Ntairjd be

eligible for support. ^-vv&apos;YN

1124 May

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that he

ToughtTol importance at the meeting of the

24 May to check the tendency of the Commission to seek to extend


;x\competence.    This was the more necessary since the southern member

&apos;^states took the view that it was the responsibility of the remainder to

^sO* Xp them improve their own standards of education.    The Commission

^VaVp&amp;ared to assume that all higher education should be treated as

\yp*4/ional training coming within the Treaty, with the possibility of

p-fpjfc&amp;ls based on Article 128 and decided by majority voting. They

we&amp;eproposing unacceptably expensive programmes.    It was necessary to

residetojs approach.
