Bill

THE^)*^MjPMINISTER said that regional selective assistance would assume

great^s prominence with the abolition of regional development grants.

There would be pressure for the published criteria for awarding

selective assistance to be made more precise in the interests of

ensuring that the procedures were scrupulously fair. However,

tightening upvThjk criteria in this way would itself be

controversia\A^njLthe Industrial Development Advisory Board had a

good record in/ytxVing out worthwhile applications.    Moreover, more

precise criteri^ w^M^d make the allocation of assistance more

susceptible to ji^rtTia^ review.    The Government would need a clear

position on this qvftfjpw&amp;n in time for the Second Reading of the Regional

Development Grants ^ &amp;m nation) Bill on Monday 25 January.    It would

also be important to en ^  that procedures for making grants available

to very small business^k &gt;dl)a not discourage applications because the

procedures were complica^tej^^v

3.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIA^ SERVICES said that the World

Health Organisation Conference on AIDS would be held in London on

26-28 January and would be opened by the Princess Royal.   Around 150

countries were expected to be represented, ^^ ^j.y at Ministerial level.

4.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the army risings in

Argentina from 14 to 18 January in support of Colonel Aldo Rico

illustrated the continuing instability in the country.    The crushing of

the revolt would strengthen the position of the Army Chief of Staff,

General Dante Carini, and the President, Dr Raul Alfonsin, could come

.under pressure to make further concessions to the armed forces.

Nicaragua

THB^POREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at the meeting of

Ceira^y American Presidents in Costa Rica on 15 and 16 January, the

Presvoep^&gt;of Nicaragua, Mr Daniel Ortega, had unexpectedly undertaken to

suspeq^che State of Emergency (and thereby restore civil liberties in

full) ai d had offered to hold direct talks with the Contra resistance

movement.    If genuine,  this was an encouraging development, although it

would complicate the United States Administration&apos;s prospects of

securing Congressional approval for further military aid for the

Contras. v

Taiwan

THE FOREIGN AND COMM^E^LTH SECRETARY said that the death of the

President of Taiwan, MVxftiang Ching-kuo, on 13 January marked the

effective passing of wp/tSV&amp;ex generation of the Kuomintang.    The new

President, Mr Lee Teh-h&amp;L^/w&gt; s the first native Taiwanese to hold the

post.    Pressures could de&gt; eJc6ov for Taiwan to become a state in its own

right and to drop its claiiQ^ep^be the legitimate Government of China.

In discussion,  it was suggestApKC&amp;at we needed to capitalise more fully

on the lucrative commercial oppp^ttioaities available in Taiwan, whose

economy was dynamic.    A particuuarXOTStacle was the relative difficulty

experienced by Taiwanese in obtavliijlS^isas for the United Kingdom as

against other Western European coutM^le-s.    It was noted that United

Kingdom exports to Taiwan had riserf^y^over 60 per cent over the last

year; action was  in hand to strength^ our trading office in Taipei and

consideration was also being given to ways of facilitating the granting

of visas.

AFFAIRS

Agriculture

Council

18-20 January

5.      THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND that the

Presidency&apos;s approach at the meeting of the AgricultirfxJ^ Wincil on 18-20

January had been as unhelpful as it had been feared l^migKt be. The

meeting was to be resumed on 23 Janaury.    The German Ag 3e1&gt;vture

Minister, Herr Kiechle, had made new proposals on stabiM^e^r^.for

cereals and oilseeds which would involve reduced discipliw&amp;&amp;fand


increased cost.    In general,  the Presidency also appeared to be pursuing

German national interests.    Proposals had been put forward to example

giving greater emphasis to co-responsibility levies.    As proposed, the

latter would both weaken discipline and be discriminatory:  the effect of

the exemption provisions would be to require United Kingdom farmers to

pay three times as much levy as German farmers.    Finally, the Presidency

Xhad made clear an intention, in relation to other commodities, to reopen

V he package on the table at the Copenhagen Council, apparently with a

/^waew in some cases to renegotiation at the time of the annual price

/fij^CAng.    A Franco/German alliance was certainly operating at present.

Mjne^Oerman objective appeared to be to isolate the United Kingdom:

HjefirJfaiechle bad spoken in terms of looking for a qualified majority for

hi^v^^psals.    The Dutch had remained with us.    There were signs that

the^-OiS^ssion might be contemplating some degree of compromise on

cerea44^ ut they were standing firm on oilseeds.    He had made clear that

if theV&amp; were a weakening of the stabiliser proposals, the discussion in

the Agriculture Council would be a waste of time and could not provide a

basis for agreement in Brussels.    The Commission had tabled detailed

proposals on s^e-fc. aside.    On this issue, discussion had made good

progress, thrfugh^more remained to be done.

THE FOREIGN AND/COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the first meeting of

the Foreign Affaic^C^iuncil in the run-up to the European Council would

take place on 25- e^fa*puary.    It would be necessary at that meeting to

reinforce what the i^^HS^er of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food had said

and to remind memberCco^n^ries that there would be no question of

additional resources ex a&amp; \pn the basis of unanimity.    Sir David Hannay

would be conveying a sufo b\\ firm message to the Presidency in Brussels

today.   The interest of ^ttfC^ftvthevn member countries of the Community

lay mainly in the size of ^O^e^se they might hope to secure in the

structural funds,  itself on^a^lhe most difficult issues in the

negotiations.    It might vell^oe/^ekessary at next week&apos;s meetings to

seek to enlist their support w&apos;re&amp;re ion to the achievement of

acceptable stabilisers and contif^i ^^agricultural expenditure by

persuading them that the size of fc ^s *ructural funds was not

independent from the amount of exp^dj^ure on agriculture.    In general,

the outlook for the Brussels Europea^MJwncil looked at present

umpromising.    But we should continue \6 see what progress might be

practicable. ^

Took note.

WAR CRIMES

6.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Hom^/IJ^reetary and the

Secretary of State for Scotland (C(88) 1) setting out i^tjsals for the

future handling of allegations that ex-Nazi war crimin% ^dre living in

the United Kingdom.


THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Simon Weisenthal Center and others had

submitted to the Government material  indicating that during the Second

World War a number of persons now resident in the United Kingdom might

have been guilty of atrocities in German occupied territories with which

this country had no extradition arrangements.    Although some of them had

^ since become British citizens, none had been so at the time of the

^events in question, and the United Kingdom courts therefore had no

^jurisdiction in the matter.    The material submitted to the Government

//ffj^ been examined on behalf of the Law Officers who had concluded that,

/JiH&apos;syegarding the question of jurisdiction,  it would not provide a basis

f/3^/pjrpse cut ions.    In the absence of jurisdiction, the Law Officers were

unaMle to take the matter any further, but the Government needed to find

a w y^ ^ respond to the pressure that had developed on the matter. He

had proposed to the Home and Social Affairs Committee (H) in December

that T^rbest way forward would be to take the necessary retrospective

jurisdiction in the Criminal Justice Bill, but the Committee had not at

that time been able to agree to this approach to the problem. Since

then, the present Session&apos;s legislative programme had come under

increased prea^S^e, and he had given an undertaking to the former Lord

President of (the ((fcounci 1 that he would not seek to expand the Criminal

Justice Bill r y Ji?^, way.    Against that background,  the proposal had

emerged in discu^j/wuwith the Ministers concerned that a practicable

way forward woulcr-^^yto establish a non-statutory inquiry to assess the

available evidence^ajfrd^dn the light of that, to advise the Government

whether retrospectiHKJ^g^slation should be introduced.    It was an

important part of this Vf^tegy to make it clear that the Government

indeed stood ready to i$*y6ewuce legislation if the inquiry so

recommended.   He had maaA^Lc/^lear in the Second Reading debate on the

Criminal Justice Bill thatpJjs^id not intend to use the Bill to deal

with war crimes, but that n&gt;&gt; starfid not let the matter drop and would

inform the House of Commons^rp&lt;/mje^ intended to proceed.    He now sought

the Cabinet&apos;s agreement to the/  T$blishment of a non-statutory inquiry

on the lines described in C(88; l^/ai&gt;d to his making an early

announcement of this.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND^Md^he fully supported the Home

Secretary&apos;s proposal.    He would have^Sraa considerable reservations about

taking retrospective jurisdiction simply to enable inquiries to proceed,

and he believed that the machinery of a non-statutory inquiry to advise

the Government was a well judged way of taking the matter forward.

In discussion the following main points were^ad^:

a. Although it would be necessary to gi

(Ob

-ear indication that

the Government stood ready to legislate inTrtJ&lt;yyight of the

inquiry&apos;s advice, the Government would have zoJ(/ 4  that decision

in its own hands and could not be totally bourM/jGfWie inquiry&apos;s

report.

b. There was a good deal of experience in the MiirasJ^ta^of Defence

that was relevant to the investigation of war crimes./^\


THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

approved the proposal in C(88) 1 to establish a non-statutory inquiry to

assess the evidence against alleged war criminals resident in the United

Kingdom and to advise the Government on the need for legislation. The

Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland should now settle

the membership of the inquiry in consultation with the Lord Chanellor

^.and the English and Scottish Law Officers:  they should also consult the

V^Secretary of State for Defence to ensure that his Department&apos;s expertise

^j/n war crimes was fully brought to bear.    The Home Secretary and

/^feelrxetary of State for Scotland should also discuss the financing of the

Wamwo-y with the Chief Secretary, Treasury, who had reserved his

pOsL^on on meeting these costs from the public expenditure reserve.

SuflyJiUjC^to these points, the Home Secretary had the Cabinet&apos;s agreement

to Walra&apos;an early announcement of the inquiry, taking into account the

point/n(fSe in discussion about the need to retain the final decision on

futurevlegislation in the Government&apos;s hands.

The Cabinet -

Took no fi,jm.th approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the

discussi^2T&gt;/&lt;rJEjk invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary of

State for /scooUand to proceed as the Prime Minister had indicated.

Thursday 21 January 1988 at 10.30 am

The National

Health

Service

THE PRIME^DfcffiTER,  summing up a general discussion by the Cabinet about

the finanernj^^^the National Health Service  (NHS),  said that the

Government hS^nWie available very substantial additional resources and

introduced a nu^^mof efficiency measures.    Nevertheless,  in recent

weeks there haaJB^n unremitting campaign in large sections of the

media, with disprM^^ionate attention being paid to problems  in the NHS

and demands for fu^^ffel^public money over and above the  increases for

which provision had aJ^^fly been made.    Doctors and nurses were feeding

information to the me^ia about difficulties in the health services, and

stories from such sources inevitably carried weight even though the

stories were often misleading.    There was no media interest in the vast

number of patients who were entirely satisfied with their treatment and

what emerged was therefore a th^^ughly distorted picture. The

Confederation of Health ServweMMployees and the National Union of

Public Employees were seeking^^^^fcoloit the situation by taking

industrial action ahead of the ^fcj%^sion by the independent review body

of recommendations on nurses&apos; pajl^^Ji^th i s tactic could well backfire

by undermining public support for        Cursing profession. Some

commentators were suggesting that t^ragj^^ent healthy fiscal position

provided scope for additional funds TCjBrmade available to the NHS.

The Government would need to make clea*^fl ever, not only that the

standard of living of NHS employees was^M^r^p/ed by tax reductions but

also that the economy owed its strength        uJ^prudent and careful

financial policies which had been pursued i^a that this achievement

would be placed in jeopardy if public expenditure controls were to be

relaxed now.    The Government had an excellent record on health service

funding and should continue to drive this message home.    The Chief

Secretary, Treasury should issue a note to Government_supporters as soon

as possible explaining the detailed plans set out White Paper on

Public Expenditure which had been published the pre^A^Aday and drawing

particular attention to the planned increases on manj^E^ity services.

The Secretary of State for Social Services should alsofc^M^.ate to

colleagues a briefing note on health issues,  bringing ou^^t 

improvements in NHS performance in recent years. ^^i^.

The continuing debates on the health service in the House ofi^RAons had

revealed two strands of opinion among Government backbenchersMne

maintained that additional funding should be made available in^pne^L


short-term, but this failed to take account of the very large increases

in resources for which provision had already been made in the last

public expenditure round for the coming year.    Others were urging the

Government to seize what they saw as the opportunity provided by the

. present mood of discontent about the NHS to announce radical changes to

^the way it operated.    It was clear that there were very great variations

the performances of different parts of the NHS: some hospitals and

^Jmsultants operated very efficiently while others were badly managed.

^Without better information about these disparities,  it was difficult for

the Government to formulate long-term policies, and work was urgently in

hand to obtain this information.    The Government should be cautious

about saying that it was looking for change lest it inflamed this

situation further and encouraged whose who wanted an inquiry; and there

could he^^k commitment  in principle to long-term restructuring until the

Governi^^^jjad a very clear view of its policy.    Even then the timing

and hand^50^^^&gt;uld require the most careful consideration.
