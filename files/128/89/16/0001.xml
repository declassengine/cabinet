&lt;^^^hRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the debate on an

Opp$ fiCkpn motion on housing on the following Wednesday would probably

be la^eLx concerned with issues relating to homelessness. The

Oppost^^i might well allege that the Government&apos;s policies would

encourg^J^?hmanism by private sector landlords, but any such charges

could be\Very clearly refuted.    On the other hand, the Government could

bring attention to the abuse by some local authorities of their powers

to deal with homelessness,  including procurement of accommodation for

people they accented as homeless within the areas of neighbouring local

authorities: haywa^sX bringing forward proposals on this matter to the

Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on Local

Government Financ^/^wnother current issue in the housing field was

Camden Council&apos;s Vfej^^Jrirge arrears in processing applications from

council tenants vis]$rfgb&lt;) exercise their right to buy their homes. He

believed that this rekyM^A gross inefficiency in the Council&apos;s

administration, rather^^^rVdeliberate obstruction of the Government&apos;s

policies, and he doubted wK her it would be useful for him to use his

statutory power to interv^fJeTnHe was accordingly working up proposals

for introducing private se^t^^Kpertise to assist in resolving the

problem. &lt;VVvV

efonn Bill

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND^6CIENCE said that he hoped that

the decisive majorities which the Government had secured on the first

day of the Committee Stage in the House of Lords on the Education Reform

Bill would help to set the tone for the remairy^gNtoroceedings on the

Bill, and he congratulated the Lord Privy SeaflA^oV he Chief Whip, Lords

on their handling of the matter.   He was consuIryttgYhurch leaders about

a form of words for inclusion on the face of the\*Ll^*hich was designed

to meet the concerns expressed in the House of Lor^yihont the nature of

religious education in maintained schools and the exuepAyXo which it

should be based on Christianity.   He hoped that agreem^nV^^ould be

reached in time for an amendment, which he believed would^&amp;mmand wide

support, to be tabled at Report Stage in the House of Lch&amp; {J\

&apos;    2.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT,  reporting on the strike

Vvaction by employees of P &amp; 0 European Ferries at Dover, said that on the

/previous Tuesday, in an action brought by Sealink, the High Court had

/T^uled the National Union of Seamen (NUS) in contempt of an injunction

y^ea^rning secondary action and had imposed a fine of  150,000 and

^aa^Afiteved the union&apos;s assets.    British manned ferry services had been

s^j^twotially disrupted by secondary action, although foreign manned

sery^^eJ. were largely unaffected.   Other unions had not so far lent the

NUS^art^material support.   However, the Opposition, in aligning

thems^W^^ fully with the strike action, had served to polarise the

disputed /Neither the NUS nor the Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration

Service &lt;{aCAS) seemed likely to be able to come forward with proposals

which P a^O would now find acceptable; the initiative by the Trades

Union Congress earlier that week in seeking to reopen negotiations at

ACAS had manifestly had no prospect of success.

Although more tHkan U.000 P &amp; 0 employees had accepted the company&apos;s

revised pay andN^f 3riy.ons package, many of them were unwilling to

return to work in(xhp/*ace of the current strike action.    P &amp; 0 were

currently running CVj^a^rries between Dover and Zeebrugge, but were not

running any to Calais /p ^oulogne.    Their capacity to run additional

services was hampered^w^^^ack of trained staff, but that problem

should gradually be overc&lt;Jjj ^ as existing staff returned to work and

P &amp; 0 took on new recruit ff &lt;/vt appeared that P &amp; 0 would seek to resume

three freight services durdSQg//ji  following week.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TR^S 0RT said that P &amp; 0 had sought fresh

certificates for the two ferrr^^unich had resumed sailing even though

there was no legal requirement on^nfin to do so.   Department of

Transport surveyors had satisfactoiH^yOcompleted exhaustive inspections

of the ships, their crew arrangemeiits-^rid emergency procedures. Seldom

had any ships been inspected so thoraJ*glJf^.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRB^ND said that, if sustained, the

interruption of the Stranraer/Larne ferrj^ operated by Sealink, would

pose increasing problems in Northern Ireland.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, AHA that the important

points for the Government to get across in anyf(comments they made on the

dispute were that ACAS had earlier proposed a ffe^^o^vwhich P &amp; 0 had

been willing to settle but which the NUS had reje\dt^ y^that the NUS had

consistently refused to hold a secret ballot; and xKsQA.he two ferries

which had resumed sailing had been exhaustively inspeyiVre^by Department

of Transport surveyors. &lt;&gt;aCv-

2%3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, referring to the release on

&apos;jAj May of three French citizens held in Lebanon for three years by

^^CVamic extremists,  said that the only means of achieving this outcome

&lt;V*hroh the French Government had so far acknowledged were withholding the

^O&gt;e  dration of normal diplomatic relations with Iran and refusing to

wfpajr^. loan obtained from Iran during the reign of the Shah.    If true

thv ppsdtion would not be discreditable.    But there were grounds for

susp^ xjN&gt;g that the deal struck had gone far beyond this, which would be

very d^jiraging to the wider efforts by the West to present a united and

effectfiwR^Tont against terrorism.    Public opinion in France was

never thelej5^?likely to be sympathetic to the release, whatever price had

been paidv^ The United Kingdom&apos;s position on &quot;no deals with terrorists&quot;

should nevertheless remain unchanged and there was no real pressure from

British public opinion to proceed otherwise despite occasional

expressions of distress, for example by one particularly active friend

of the British borage, Mr John McCarthy.    The Government&apos;s public line

should therefortybe^hat British policy was unchanged, that we were

asking the FrencnT!krtFe\hnment for details about the circumstances of

their hostages&apos; re^ea^e/and that, on purely humanitarian grounds we

naturally welcomed tT jf *rastages&apos; release.

In discussion, it was J^gs 2^ that the British Government should be

cautious about welcoming rp^^elease until more was known about the

surrounding terms.    It wa^K^affyd that the French Government had already

offered to make available B^-Taje^British Government any information from

the debriefing of their relea*Jwf^.tizens relevant to British hostages

and also that events had demo^TOt^ir^bed very plainly the direct link

between Iran and the hostage taj&amp;e^e^ The timing of the release recalled

the parallel of Iran&apos;s action in^^irKgv the release of American hostages

in 1980 to try to influence the Uni&lt;irdv6tates Presidential election. No

doubt Iran had acted now because it h ^leved it had secured the best

possible deal at the most timely momtSiH^^But it seemed on balance

unlikely that the release, even takenj^Aer with the simultaneous

release of French hostages in New Calea Ma, would be enough to swing

the second round of the French Presidential election in Monsieur Jacques

Chirac&apos;s favour.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that ((he^inderlying

situation highlighted by recent unrest in Poland was^&amp;hre same as it had

always been:    Polish economic policy was a mess.    SreQSK^ecessary to

secure an agreement with the International Monetary Farajf^s^ch as holding

down wages and removing subsidies invariably led to scriW^p  Because of

the absence of a proper political structure for coping w^&amp;^sNich

conflicts of interest, strikers refused to give way and wfeJJ^.

circumstances were never right for putting a sensible econbm^rtvwlicy in

place.   Nevertheless, there were some grounds for thinking &amp;KaV/\

widespread violence might be avoided.    The Polish Government ytgff&amp;L.

y\TEE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had recently been

Jpome hopeful developments in Southern Africa.    Talks had taken place in

_^ cVndon on 3 and 4 May between the United States as mediator, South

&lt;vS^jvj.ca and Angola (with Cuban representatives as part of the Angolan

\\cfeWgation).    There seemed at least to be a possibility of working

Yo^rrae an end to the conflict in Angola, which in turn could have

iiv^lifi^Xions for the future of Namibia.    It was a good sign that these

tal^shad taken place overtly and that both sides had been prepared to

make &lt;^ ^e^-gestures of goodwill.    There would no doubt be a further round

of tafC^Msewhere in due course.

Meanwhile^, there had been a good meeting between the South African

President/^Mr P W Botha,  and the Mozambican Minister for Co-operation,

Mr Jacinto Veloso on 26 April.    There were signs of co-operation over

revival of the Joint Security Commission and the Cabora Bassa power line

rehabilitation./VOTljNthe other hand,  it still seemed as though some

elements of thexJSoufch-^African defence forces were acting in a different

direction by supp&lt;/rcTj^ the Renamo rebels.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTW^SECRETARY said that he had that morning had

a discussion with the vis^Ct^n&apos;aNPrime Minister of Hungary, Mr Karoly

Grosz, who might well succe^^jrxKadar as First Secretary of the

Hungarian Communist Party.   H&gt;s\^scussion with Mr Grosz had been a

refreshing experience.    Mr GrCTsJ^jftd been the architect of the policy

which had made possible an agr6e1nfiy  &gt;with the International Monetary

Fund: this policy had a number o^nojieJ features for Eastern Europe,

including the introduction of incoaJirtMJC and other taxes, reduction of

subsidies and other state interventi^p^in the economy, legislation

covering company bankruptcy and retu tfi yhousing to the market.

lr Takeshita

THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had taken the ofoojytimity of her

meeting on 4 May with the Japanese Prime Minister^~^^Take8hita, to

pursue two outstanding bilateral issues: the problem/i^^eats on the

Tokyo Stock Exchange and the tax on whisky.    On the r^Jrc^sjoint she had

expressed disappointment that it had not yet been possibrp^ip allocate

seats to two further British firms.   Mr Takeshita had cKaj^eiaN. that on

the Tokyo Stock Exchange business was still conducted by N&amp;pAr^traders

and there was therefore a space constraint on additional meMJam. In

response she had said that it would be impossible for the B^&amp;^tfa5i^ people

to understand that a highly technological nation like Japan w^tfWhe

unable to resolve this problem because of a space constraint. Mp/n&amp;.

this remained the position Mr Takeshita must expect the British yy^s&gt;

Government to be reluctant to approve applications by Japanese frnan^Pal


^^organisations in this country.    Mr Takeshita had undertaken to take a

.//close personal interest in finding a solution to this issue.    As regards

--/&gt;we second point, a General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs (GATT) Panel

\OoeJ rt had found that Japanese taxes discriminated against imported

VwW/ky.    It had recommended that the current grading system for whisky

ta^r^er^Vabolished and that all whisky and competing spirits should be

taicepV^X a non-discriminatory way.    She had made clear to Mr Takeshita

thaVito^ould be unthinkable for Japan to fail to implement the

concltf*|2&gt;eift of the GATT Panel report in full.    The main outstanding

proble^nw^fs^the differential between whisky and shochu.    She had

proposeAorjy&apos;Mr Takeshita that in the first instance the tax on whisky be

set at l,vO0 yen per litre and the tax on shochu doubled, so reducing

the existing differential to 10:1.    Mr Takeshita had commented that

shochu was a regional drink with many small producers.    He had appeared

to accept that J&gt;  n should narrow the existing differential to 10:1 but

had suggested rJnat^nhis objective could be achieved by a greater

reduction in th&amp;^*xzcvn whisky and a smaller increase in the tax on

shochu.    He had agai.n)given a personal undertaking to find a solution to

the problem.    GATTvpt^xJ^iures seemed unsatisfactory in that acceptance

of the requirement fvfy^tfjkpensation in other sectors,  in the event of

non-compliance with a(p4rfe^ruling, might suit a country in some cases.

In a brief discussion it v^^ftoted that on the whisky issue

Mr Takeshita had indicated^nyintention to bring forward an acceptable

solution at the time of theCE rn^mic Summit in June.    As regards Stock

Exchange seats, one complica^jTb^vas the interest of other countries,

notably the United States,  in\S^iring access.

Summing up, the PRIME MINISTER svfd^Kat she had judged it right to take

up these two issues at the outsethepr discussions.   More generally

the Japanese attached considerable ^&amp;^r-feance to good relations with

this country, which they regarded asCjj^^ringboard to Europe. English

was their second language.    The atmosp^ep^xif the remainder of the talks

and the subsequent dinner had been extremely cordial.

CC(88) 12.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said tha^jj^vad met the

Taoiseach, Mr Charles Haughey, at the session in Dubl Kwr^ May of the

Anglo-Irish Conference.    He had conveyed to Mr Haughey th^^qvernment&apos; s

great concern over the functioning of the Anglo-Irish Aro&amp;emant and the

failures in security co-operation, as well as over the spetjMTO^tfvthat

Mr Haughey had made recently in the United States.    Mr Haugft^^Md

conveyed through him a personal message to the Prime Ministe^JjMmt

which he would be writing to her.    It was however clear that Grfal/y

disruption of the smooth operation of the Anglo-Irish Agreement\^ec ase

of a whole catelogue of incidents and difficulties in security ma^&amp;er^

over recent months was something that both sides wished to see ende-d^so


^V\that the full context provided for by the Agreement could be resumed.

XVJJe had tabled some tough requirements during the meeting on mesures to

//jM&amp;rove security co-operation and some of these if accepted could be

\Sw ebcjfcfiemely helpful.    For this reason, he had deliberately sounded a

&lt;^^Cch*ly more optimistic note publicly after the meeting. There

rra Md a real problem about Mr Haughey&apos;s underlying philosophical

appt&gt;o^rt*o, parts of which had surfaced in his recent speeches, and this

would ifjwe to be the subject of further discussion in due course. In

the m^MtJ^Sie, because of the illness of the Tanaiste, Mr Brian Lenihan,

Mr Haug\Ryip d also assumed the responsibilities of Foreign Minister,

which vtfiJLe provide welcome scope for further direct talks between

himself afc\} Mr Haughey.

In discussion it was pointed out that there had been assurances before

from the Irish s^e\which had led to nothing in practice.    The real

problem was the((saf&lt;e; haven south of the border between the Republic of

Ireland and Norbfei^^reland, where British security forces could not

follow but Irish security forces were not competent enough to act

effectively. ^?v//

THE FOREIGN AND COMMOffl^rai SECRETARY said that he had on 4 May

approached the British Bro^roa sting Corporation (BBC) over the

&quot;Spotlight&quot; programme tha^^Wv reportedly to be shown on BBC television

in Northern Ireland later \&amp;xajij evening.    Like the Thames Television

programme &quot;Death on the RocVJ^i^vhad been expected to carry interviews

with alleged witnesses of thSASWoJyting of three Irish terrorists in

Gibraltar by members of the sdojJrAry. forces.    He had therefore repeated

the arguments, based on the 196o/e^eon Report, against contamination of

the evidence if this programme wVrex^c^be shown before the inquest in

Gibraltar, and had also set out trreGe^rnment&apos; s case on this point in

writing to the Chairman of the BBC W&amp;xgppi Governors.    The BBC&apos;s

response was awaited: it was possiblerotey^would allow the programme to

go ahead in a modified form. V/^^

In discussion, it was pointed out that in the case of the Thames

Television programme &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;, it seemed that the Independent

Broadcasting Authority, whom the Foreign and CoiamQinwealth Secrtary had

approached, was not really functioning properW; sh)nce members of the

Authority had not been meeting collectively tox^vo-sider the issue but

had simply been briefed afterwards by the Chairmin.   ) ack-sliding of

this kind appeared to be endemic with such superv 3E f j /bodies.
