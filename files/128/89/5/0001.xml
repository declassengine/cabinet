&apos;Ifflg^lOME SECRETARY said that he had informed the Cabinet at the time of

\J&gt;he^publication of the White Paper on Firearms the previous November

tl^f pj^re might be difficulties with Government supporters over some

aspej^t^jaf the controls that needed to be established over firearms.

ThatC^Miction had proved to be correct, and the Standing Committee

considering the Firearms  (Amendment) Bill was an unusually difficult

one.    in. the previous week the Standing Committee had defeated a

sittingsVmotion and had made it clear that progress on the Bill would

continue to be blocked unless the Government was prepared to offer a

compensation scheme in respect of the weapons, now lawfully held, that

would be prohjyfred under the provisions of the Bill.    There seemed to

be no exact pln^ea&amp;nt for a situation in which it would become a

criminal offence/^To^mossess articles for which individuals currently

held certificate^-o^Ziywful ownership,  and the Home Office had been

given an opinion by^&amp;imsel that there could be difficulties under the

European Convention &gt;w ^ruman Rights if the Government did not offer

compensation, which l$w l&lt;0at least represent about half of the value of

the weapons in quest ion.sypteve was also a strong security interest,

notably in respect of ^JOTOfertl Ireland,  in ensuring that the prohibited

weapons were in fact takd^v^uji^pf circulation.    In all these

circumstances, and with the/fi^ft^ of the Chief Secretary, Treasury and

the Attorney General, he wai^worlding up a scheme of compensation at a

flat rate, or at half the val&lt;J Ao &gt;the weapons if it could be proved to

be greater, to enable the Bill^empke progress. &quot;

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a Dti^? discussion, said that it would be

intolerable if the expectation grer^flS^/hat the Government was under an

obligation to compensate those who wa&amp;f^ajjversely affected by its

decisions.    It was essential, therefov&amp;j that the proposed scheme should

be presented in a way that prevented ii^being used as a precedent in

more normal situations.    Since the weapons in question would be handed

in to the authorities, the word &quot;compensation&quot; might not be the most

appropriate to describe the scheme, which seeajS&lt;t\to have some affinities

with compulsory purchase. (( {)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that no end was immediately

in sight to the strike of employees at the Ford Motor Company.    A ballot

was shortly t ^5iv\held at Vauxhall.    The three-year pay deal against

which the Forla^iraLpyees were striking was,  in fact, a generous one,

though the Fora&apos;^MnaAement hoped to get major changes in work practises

in exchange.    Ta^jAkgs. was gaining ground in parts of the media that the

strike in some way^^ftmified the failure of the industrial relations

legislation promotedr&amp;^khe Government, because the workforce had been

fully balloted.    Thav^e^rOic ism was totally misconceived and it would be

important to rebut it. ^^^\

In discussion it was note^L^Hsrt if the strike continued it might prove

necessary for the Departmeo^^^lealth and Social Security (DHSS) to set

up facilities for the paymewt^r^f^social security benefits to those on

strike.    If that point were l^aytherji,  it would be essential to stress

that such arrangements were no^n&gt;oraSthan administrative measures

necessary to prevent DHSS offices^e&quot;w3g swamped with business, and that

no special favours were being exten&amp;a to those on strike.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the d j ey &gt;ion, said that members of the

Government would wish vigorously to rV6&lt;ft the criticism of the

Government&apos;s industrial relations polices that the Secretary of State

for Employment had mentioned, and the Secretary of State should

circulate a note to his colleagues indicating the general line that

might be taken.    Although 11 Ford plants hadagainst strike

action, those who had voted for strike action(mu4)t be regarded as having

taken account of the implications for their ra3^?5\, their future job

prospects and their company. VV-^V^S

The Cabinet -

1.     Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks, and

invited the Secretary of State for Employment to C^//\\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the National Association of

Colliery Overmen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) had voted for a ban

on overtime.    British Coal had responded by re-rostering in order to

Vover pit safety.    NACODS had accepted re-rostering at a number of pits,

/^Vit it had been necessary to send the men home at some places.    NACODS&apos;s

&gt; yne now appeared to be that if British Coal withdrew their re-rostering

//7&amp;dfers, together with threats of further action, they would lift their

(ji^epc\me ban and accept the arbitration of the National Reference

T^bural.    In the meantime, British Coal had withdrawn the monopoly

recondition previously extended to NACODS and had given the Union of

Demc&lt;CS iMc Mineworkers the right to form a group representing overseers

and si/pe^^sors if they were able to attract the necessary members. The

situati^fi was highly confused, but the indications were that the firm

line taR^n by British Coal management was paying off.    The industrial

action had had no more than a minimal effect on the coal stocks

available to the Central Electricity Generating Board, which were very

substantial.

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMM^wUkfcJ&apos;H SECRETARY said that the General

Secretary of the Communis t ^Ja^q, of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail

Gorbachev, had announced onV^^e^bVuary that Soviet troops could begin a

withdrawal from Afghanistan o^Ta^lay and complete it within ten months.

This was contingent on agreeraei^&apos;oe^i&apos;ug reached by 15* March in the

negotiations about Afghanistan un^rr*M e auspices of the United Nations.

This was the first time that Mr Goc^chev had personally made such an

announcement and it was hard now t( t|2&quot;weve that the Soviet Union did

not intend to withdraw.    But the Sovue/f&apos;iJJkion probably hoped to distance

itself from responsibility if things y&amp;((t very wrong in Afghanistan.

The President of Afghanistan, Mr Mohamrt^d Najib, had endorsed

Mr Gorbachev&apos;s statement and had offered a large number of places in his

administration to the Afghanistan resistance.    International reactions

to Mr Gorbachev&apos;s statement had varied.    The ^fe^dent of Pakistan,

General Zia-ul-Haq, was optimistic.    France ws \Jkry cautious. The

United States position was between these two.^-^KjehNwould depend on

whether the resistance in Afghanistan could resUojjd^Ao a co-ordinated

way.    The British reaction should be cautious; tfi^^ftpernment should

welcome Mr Gorbachev&apos;s statement as far as it wencf//^?&apos;Should draw

attention to the important question whether the Afgngfwrk^ugees in

Pakistan would return to their country on the basis of VhJOproposed

agreement.    It would be important to prevent the SovieC^yj^sta from

plausibly blaming others if things went wrong in Afghanfc&amp;a/A^but the

prospects were better than in the previous eight years.    t^^W^ld be

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the violence in the

territories occupied by Israel was continuing.    Some 45 Palestinians had

been killed during the current phase of unrest.    This increased the

.polarisation between the parties;  the Israeli settlers in the occupied

 ^territories among others were becoming increasingly truculent. The

&gt;^areign Ministers of the Twelve countries of the European Community

/^TfiCO had discussed the subject on 8 February.    King Hussein of Jordan

/lrad&apos;OBeen present for part of the meeting.    He had spoken with his usual

^igjpi^v and charm, on the basis of his recent talks with the United

Srate^Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern and South Asian

AfM&gt;^s5^Mr Richard Murphy.    The United States had become more active

agai^TyWl this matter, partly because the continuing unrest in the

occup*4d/territories was causing widespread concern in public opinion in

the United States.    The direction of the renewed United States activity

was not entirely clear.    Mr Murphy was seeking discussion of interim

arrangements in the occupied territories, while neither drawing too much

attention to wijJT^vthe ultimate arrangements should be nor allowing this

aspect to be sneLMed.    King Hussein was understandably wary of being

drawn into arxvaH&gt;sr^m&gt;&lt;nts about the immediate future without knowing what

the ultimate arrfAngdAents would be.    The Foreign Ministers of the EC

countries had isV*erf&gt;  statement which reaffirmed support for an

international confwr p&lt;j  on the Arab/Israel dispute and welcomed the

renewed efforts for \fmQgp&amp;ss which had been made by the President of

Egypt, Mr Hosni Mubarakywell as the United States.    King Hussein was

expected to visit Londo^/J^W that month.

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH  vtfJ&amp;$ARY, reviewing the prospects for

the European Council on 11-12 Februad&amp;^afaid that the proposals in the

Presidency paper, which had only beenVarculated late the previous

evening, suggested that the German Agriculture Minister, Herr Kiechle,

had come off relatively well from the tug of war in Bonn.    The proposals

generally fell short of what Britain might have-hoped and would need

substantial improvement if they were to provi&apos;peVpe basis for a

settlement.    This was especially the case inVi^Lr &gt;on to the proposals

on cereals and oilseeds, the latter having subs/t/anyual budgetary

implications, and in relation to the agricultur&amp;cg&amp;zjfeline provisions.

The Dutch remained firm on agriculture and the CoiwfWs- on were also

behaving reasonably well in this area.    As regards 4fe*&lt;8Wuctural Funds,

where we had pressed the case for maintaining a li iriwxi^upvrate

frontier, the Presidency proposals contemplated on oveta^V^ncrease of

up to 77 per cent.    Although the French had hitherto sutftforjjad us on

this issue up to now,  they were unlikely to be helpful ifK^j^eOfinal

stages.    On the proposal for new contribution arrangementsCV^r^ugh a

fourth resource, we could fortunately stand aside: this was\fe^Antially

a matter for dispute between the Italians and French.    The Unl//^\

Kingdom abatement had in the course of negotiations been graduVIly^X


pushed to the back of the agenda and the Presidency paper now only had a

pro memoria reference to the issue.    It remained possible that Monsieur

\   Chirac of France, whose conduct generally at the Council was difficult

I^\to predict, might decide to press this question.    If he did, no doubt

Aethers would join in.    There were a number of tactical issues that would

( .^fiaed to be addressed at the Council.    For example, at present,  it was

C^AMftpsed, quite illogically, that the level of own resources should be

(jH&apos;soB^.sed before agriculture.

THE^/jJ^jnGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, concluding,  said that the German

Pres^qejTjey appeared concerned to reach a settlement at the meeting.

Britaw)/#  ed a real struggle to achieve the necessary improvements in

the corfMusions they had proposed.    If Britain was able to do so, there

could beVadvantage in expressing a decision on the level of own

resources on an abatement exclusive basis.    This would have the merit of

keeping the overall number down as well as keeping the abatement out of

competition wraTwher Community expenditure.

THE CHANCELLORo^TTffi EXCHEQUER said that what was being proposed was an

addition in the vWwmBity&apos;s revenue of some 25-30 per cent.    This would

be a massive increa^/&gt;^ven assuming Britain maintained the abatement

arrangements intact &gt;/y%&amp;&amp; would clearly be essential, such an increase

would involve an addn^^on^&amp;f some  250 million to Britain&apos;s published

net contribution.    An inyrfptse in the structural funds was of no value

to Britain:    the Govern ^* r^sViould seek to keep the increase as low as

possible.    Some benefit o^uJj/^   derived from new agricultural

arrangements insofar as thaj^JGvQroduced discipline where existing

arrangements had been whollj\ma&lt;fl5quate.    But the Presidency proposals

as circulated contained insun&amp;aTgAt improvements to match the

prospective increase in the Bri^irBlAs^ontribution.    Discussions in

restricted session at the meetina^f^he Economic and Financial Council

the previous day supported a view tfe^T agreement could be reached on a

fully symmetrical monetary reserve V^fjfe^lid not rule out a declaration

on unfair trading practices but this V^ajfe^not be linked to an

exceptional circumstances provision, was not clear that either the

Commission or the Dutch were wholly reliable on the latter issue. On

the level of own resources, we would need to be watchful that an

abatement-exclusive solution did not in practice lead to a more

expensive outcome than could otherwise be obtjrf*^d.

In discussion there was general agreement thaV-*fp&quot;rmprovement on the

Presidency proposals on agriculture would be netkjipjJcx if Britain was to

contemplate and present an increase in own resourcT^W^ an order which

would go well beyond the levels contemplated at FontrsKrableau.

Expenditure was in fact already running well beyond^w aV^evel. Britain

should seek improvements in the proposals for the agricVLt&amp;ral guideline

including the growth provision.    Any declaration on unfl^rw^fViading

practices by third countries should only represent a derwr&gt; Uto such

practices, not a loophole to the guideline provisions. Stao^C&amp;er

regimes had been devised for application across the board, &gt; uV^ft was

essential that those for cereals and oilseeds be strengthenec^^fYjtjje

problem of surpluses as to be tackled more effectively.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that he had taken

the opportunity of the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 8 February

to draw attention to the problems of fraudulent payments in the

ooeration of the Common Agricultural Policy.    This received a

tctive response from the Commission and a number of member

es.    In a bilateral with the French Minister of Agriculture,

r Guillaume,  the latter had reverted to the question of the

ion for rum imports into the Community from French overseas

ncies, an issue which had been discussed during the recent

French summit.    The French now appeared,  in return for removal of

an ^&gt;e^pg British reservation, only prepared to offer limited help to

forwVr^yBritish interests in relation to the spirits directive. The

matterv&gt;^  of electoral interest to Monsieur Chirac and could be raised

in the n&amp;rgins of the European Council.
