of Commons in the following week.

Local 1

Government

Bill:

Contract

Compliance

?^ffiJ^LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Local Government Bill would complete

/  l3\Report Stage in the House of Lords later that day.    On the previous

Tue2**%v an amendment had been carried by heavy cross-bench voting

agai*r r the Government which sought to enable local authorities to ask

que^Hj5*  of potential contractors about the way in which they

discnapgeAtheir obligations towards the disabled.    This would give

local^r^horities a loophole that they might exploit against the Bill&apos;s

provisrojis requiring the contracting-out of services, and the Secretary

of State for the Environment was therefore considering the best way to

repair the damage without creating problems with the interest groups for

the disabled. understood that one possibility might be for the

legislation t(/ specify the questions concerning the disabled that it was

permissible foEyCSe^J. authorities to ask.    Such an approach would be in

line with the pr^yLsAons concerning racial discrimination that were

already in the BWrJ&gt;//

THE PRIME MINISTER, v jjn(tftt g up a short discussion,  said that the

amendment would cause gm^ damage to the Government&apos;s policies on the

contracting-out of loca^XaJ^Chority services, and there could be no

question of allowing it^S^ytfand.    The Secretary of State for the

Environment should consiaeT^f/ra. best method of closing the loophole

opened by the amendment anKswoMd circulate his proposals to his

colleagues most closely conc^^Afliefore the necessary Government

amendment was tabled. /&gt;^vv

The Cabinet -

Invited the Secretary of StatevwrJtye Environment

to be guided by the Prime Minisi^^s summing up of the

discussion.

THE NEXT

STEPS

2.      The Cabinet considered a Note by the S the Cabinet

(C(88) 2):  Improving Management in Government: (n&apos;he&apos;)Next Steps.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Efficiency Unit ^^Iher request

carried out a scrutiny to review progress with the of management

in Government Departments and to consider the way fcVwajraX  Their report

was attached to C(88) 2, and had been considered by a gpmpSof

Ministers.    It was now proposed that the Government shcw^aiijbcept the

recommendations to set up agencies to carry out executive ^6 ^tions; to

commit itself to a programme for implementing agencies progressively; to

see that staff were trained and equipped effectively for this^&amp;flriyery of

services; and to ensure that the centre of Government pressea AjH^rtHly

for those improvements.    The general purpose of these changesVa^^&gt;^


give civil servants with executive work greater responsibility for the

conduct of that work, with a consequent improvement in incentives and

efficiency.    It had originally been suggested that most of the Civil

^Service should be organised into agencies, but the proposal now was that

Ow&gt;e Government should start by setting up 12 covering over 71,000 civil

N^ftrvants.    It was important that the establishment of these agencies

py^Tfic-uld be rigorously negotiated with the Treasury, and that they should

/Bpr&amp;uen clear objectives.    The unions would be consulted about the

s&amp;ttfwi up of individual agencies.    Finally, she proposed, subject to

the agreement of Cabinet,  to announce these decisions in a Parliamentary

StaT  lSw that afternoon, and a draft of the Statement was attached to

C(88Tg 0&gt;

In discission the following main points were made -

a. It would be said that the new system had important

implicating^for Parliamentary accountability.    This was indeed a

sensitivefar^a, and the decision not to go further at that time in

setting u^2yi^e5*cies had been taken partly to avoid adding to fears

about Parlifa^meaiary accountability.    On the other hand, direct

contact betwe^K^wembers and the responsible officials already

happened to som^^^tent under the present system,  in the case of

the more execuww &lt;^B^r&gt;artments.    It did not therefore represent an

innovation.    Moreov^p^ Permanent Secretaries would continue to be

the accounting of f^2JM  \for the work of their Departments,

including the agenc^es^/lalthough they would probably be accompanied

by the head of the r&amp;i^ai^t agency when answering for its affairs

to the Public Accounta^Mra&amp;ttee.    Ministers would continue to be

responsible for broaderVgr^/tical decisions, as they always had

been.    It would be importaTrp^sh presentation to.emphasise these

elements of continuity anatp^ftpw that no fundamental change had

taken place in Par liamentary^^^int ability.

b. The Group of Ministers conwyering the report had identified

some risks,  including the possiWjepxfriticism about Parliamentary

accountability, but had reached ewe conclusion that the potential

advantages in improving management and efficiency outweighed the

risks.    It was however important to make it clear that the only

recommendations and views to which the Go rM:nment was committed

were those in the draft Statement.    It Wjrfs yaportant too that the

procedures set out in Annex B of C(88) 2vSh*JI^4 be followed, to

ensure adequate control over public expend^urjej, and especially

public sector pay. ^*~~^sf)

c. Some of the recent press reports suggeste^L^fMMv there was a

danger of overselling the changes and the benefrtsvt^be derived

from them.    This danger should be avoided.    On tha^frf&amp;r hand,

there was a risk that unless the Government gave a^tr^iiz impetus

to the reforms they would lack the necessary momentu -^fa^^;heir

successful implementation.


d.     The emphasis the report put on the importance of management

skills in the Civil Service was fully justified.    It was possible

^ that not enough weight had been given to them in career development

&apos;y\        and senior appointments.

^Ssf/   PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

^lk^,eA the proposals in C(88) 2 and the draft of the Statement she was

(po make later that day.

/The Cabinet -

Dl/Xfendorsed the proposals in C(88) 2.

2.v Noted that the Prime Minister would make a Statement

in Parliament later that day on the lines indicated in

C(88) 2.^_^

3.     THE SECRETARIAL/STATE FOR ENERGY said that the National

Association of ColYMfjyQvermen, Deputies and Shotfirers (NACODS) had

continued their indu^^w^ action over the previous weekend by refusing

to work overtime.    By tn^&amp;revious day, however, all pits were working

normally except for siyC^y^Stsrtb. Yorkshire where NACODS members were

still disputing British X^a^/s^ re-rostering arrangements. THE NACODS

leaders were in a state orp^Qtf&amp;Nkderable confusion which made it

difficult to predict theirNacMjpfts.    Nevertheless he considered that in

all probability the episode ^^jJaJW^nd with NACODS accepting the

arbitration of the National Re/e^fir&amp;e Tribunal, whicji was due to hear

the matter at the end of the mont&gt;^\$rhere had been virtually no impact

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatf(thp/*management of the

Ford Motor Company had made a revised offer which-^SytyLd run for two

years rather than the three-year period originallyeX^Ued.    The offer

comprised an increase in pay of 7 per cent in the fNtraV&apos;Syear and either

2i per cent above the Retail Price Index or 7 per centV^yWchever was

the greater,  in the second year.    They also now propos^JP^ftkt flexible

working should be made subject to local agreement rathev^thiui imposed as

part of the pay settlement.    Union representatives had rer^HUHMded their

members to accept the offer and, although the shop steward^TajE^fejie

Halewood and Dagenham plants had been reported as having resWwi^ided

rejection, he expected the Ford employees to settle on the terna^^N.

proposed, which represented a considerable movement by the Foro


management from their original offer.    Members of the Transport and

General Workers Union at Vauxhall had voted narrowly in favour of strike

action over pay, and employees at Land Rover, who had been offered a pay

&gt;\deal worth 14 per cent over two years, had said that they would begin

^wXrike action on the following Monday.    It was too early to tell whether

/^mployees at either Vauxhall or Land Rover would carry out their

&apos;/W(mtened action.

 R&amp;cRRJME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that the Rover

Gr&lt;^^^h-ad received  2.9 billion from the taxpayer since it had come into

pub?r ^wnership.    Pay settlements of 14 per cent over two years were

very g/ja^rous, and the public would have no sympathy for workers in a

companyCthat had depended so crucially on public support who resorted to

industrral action in pursuit of even higher increases.

THE SECRETARY OF ST^l^aR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the Civil and

Public Servants Asso^a\r^n (CPSA) were balloting all their members in

Department of Health an^&amp;encial Security (DHSS) offices, with a view to

unlimited industrial ac^xmiYfrom mid-March.    The CPSA were pointing to a

number of pretexts to ju\t Wheir action,  though it appeared to be

aimed at blocking the Gove^imehji&apos;s social security reforms. Industrial

action arising from a dispu&amp;&gt;^pjbut a separate issue was also taking

place in inner London, whereva^ e ^DHSS offices were being affected.

Unemployment

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMEN^^rf&amp;l that the unemployment figures

for January would be published that oaf*    The seasonally adjusted total

had fallen by about 51,000 in January w 2.563 million. Unemployment

had fallen by about 550,000 in the previous 12 months and the rate of

unemployment had fallen from 11.2 per cent to 9.2 per cent in that

period.    Unemployment had continued to fall iij5r~aXl regions, with the

largest reductions occuring in Wales,  the We\at Midlands, the North and

the North West.    Revised estimates showed that?7tfTeyjpmployed labour force

had increased by 453,000 in the 12 months to S^kteWAr 1987, with a

large increase in self-employment.    The annual r^^iAyOt industrial

disputes would also be published later that day.    ?/&gt;^rrillion working

days had been lost through industrial action in 19o/^s^k^ while this was

slightly above the figure for the preceding year,  it wa#^therwise the

lowest in over 10 years.    In each of the previous thre^J^ye&apos;afcs, the

number of strikes had been lower than in any other yearVi^iR 1940. A

matter for concern was that the growth of earnings remaine^^^ high.

Average earnings had increased by 8i per cent in the 12 moo^V^yo

December 1987 and, while some of this increase had been cau&amp;yfipp higher

overtime and bonus payments, it also reflected excessive pay fi^t\Wents

in both the private and public sectors. ^^0^

AFFAIRS

Visit by the

Foreign and

Commonwealth

Secretary to

the Soviet

Jiion

^^^THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had that week

v&amp;xtaA Moscow and Kiev.    During a crowded programme, he had held five

hou^^pvKtalks and a working dinner with the Soviet Foreign Minister,

Mr EvMjrcn Shevardnadze, whose approach to the matters discussed had been

candic^/^fe had also had two and a half hours with the General Secretary

of thew&gt;mmunist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. He

had appeared live on Soviet television for half an hour.    It was clear

that Mr Gorbachev was determined to press ahead with domestic reform in

the Soviet Union..    He had much support for this, but there was also

opposition.   ^rfeMntensity of the need for economic reform had been

illustrated bw^Siisit to a machine tool factory near Kiev. This

factory had pres^miaSi.y been chosen for inclusion in the programme of the

visit because ic^w^r/ft good one by Soviet standards.    But the impression

it gave was of poq^^mwgement and antiquated plant.

In discussion of int^rt&gt;Ar*onal affairs, Mr Gorbachev had reaffirmed his

recognition that the Brv * h nuclear deterrent would be retained and

modernised.    Mr ShevarcrfMd^gj in a speech during the visit, had said

that the Soviet Union di^g^^accuse the United Kingdom of &quot;nuclear

fetishism&quot;; this was a rec^inMon that it was legitimate for the United

Kingdom to have a nuclear e^emg^a in its current defence arrangements.

Mr Gorbachev had accused the^7^*AL Kingdom of delaying progress towards

a ban on chemical weapons;  thi4xna^&gt;been refuted,  in-ter alia, by

reference to the secretiveness o^^fTh&amp;vSoviet Union about its chemical

weapons.

On human rights, the Foreign and Com^^j* alth Secretary said that he had

pressed the case for improvements in &lt;foe Soviet record. Thirteen

individual cases of family reunificatiw had been resolved on the eve of

his visit; only one remained outstanding.    The Soviet Union had agreed

to hold bilateral consultations on human rights between officials, in

which the British side would be able to raise^Mividual cases. But

there was no Soviet movement on the fundamentalsvof human rights. The

United Kingdom should continue to press for clT3ag&quot;e&quot;Jv\

In discussion of the Iran/Iraq war, Mr Shevardna3^ raad been brought to

agree that work in the United Nations on a resoluciwv^fSposing an

embargo on arms supplies to Iran should be acceleraT&amp;JjA^TvThe United

States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz, would shorW^be visiting

Moscow and would follow this up.    On Afghanistan, Mr Gv$ *t^aev had made

the most of his recent statement on the possibility of \&amp; tjajjj wa 1 of

Soviet forces.    He had said,  in effect,  that the Soviet UoiJ^f^ad

accepted the Western view that Soviet forces should withdn^wME^&amp;m

Afghanistan but the West was now imposing further condition9^^/,^

Afghanistan was one example of how Mr Gorbachev was re-examinmg^Vv.

important Soviet policies.    Mr Gorbachev had reaffirmed his wish^rovpay


another visit to the United Kingdom.    Visits by Parliamentary

delegations had also been discussed.    The Soviet side had emphasised the

importance of a healthy bilateral relationship.

discussion of Afghanistan, it was argued that the West should keep up

^^Sessure on the Soviet Union to facilitate the return to Afghanistan of

/ra^Jjgees in Pakistan and the involvement of the Afghan Resistance in the

gpJveroment.    At the same time, it would be wrong to press these

cpjlriakrations to the point where the Soviet Union could justify keeping

for&amp; !r\in Afghanistan.    The right policy might be to urge these

consfe&amp;ytions on the Russians, but to desist if the Soviet Union

insisOe&gt;a^&lt;Pi a withdrawal without specific progress being made on the

considerations.    It had to be accepted that, if the Soviet forces

withdrew^ there was a high probability of civil war in Afghanistan.

Some elements among the Resistance were Islamic fundamentalists. One

risk was that the Soviet Union might provide large quantities of arms to

its supporter9&lt;*^\Afghanistan but insist that the West should not

provide arms mp cvher groups in Afghanistan.    A critical factor in

considering thrs^wtra^e subject was the importance to the West of

stability in Paw^s^^

THE PRIME MINISTER said ^ rtv\she had spoken on the previous day to the

North Atlantic Council n^gjn/s^els.    She had made clear her view that

the forces of the Alliance Jrtu^\always be kept up to date, just as the

Soviet Union was doing as avma^fe^r of course.    This should apply to

nuclear weapons among others^xrfTfl^ndeed a decision to modernise them

had been taken as long ago as It was impossible to deter

aggression with obsolete equipmenJ^vThere was a tendency in some

countries in the Alliance to intSruP^: the new policies of the General

Secretary of the Communist Party c^4rtJ2^Soviet Union as meaning an end

to the Soviet threat to Europe.    Ittyy&amp;lfabe helpful if members of the

Alliance were fully informed about tfra^a&apos;avances in military technology

and the upgrading of military equipment which the Soviet Union was still

undertaking.    If the Soviet Union could achieve the abolition of nuclear

weapons its objectives in Europe could be achieved without a war. It

would be important that the Summit meeting of^3J}a Alliance on

2 and 3 March should reaffirm the basic doctrfrneybf deterrence,

including nuclear deterrence.    This would nors3a&lt;e^sy, because of

attitudes in the Federal Republic of Germany an^s^Wa of the smaller

allied countries.

February ^

5.     THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had made a detailed statement

about the outcome of the European Council to the House of Commons on

15 February.    Its major achievement was German acceptance of price

vpenalties as the main way to reduce agricultural surpluses. For

(rereals, the agreement provided that if production exceeded a threshold

&apos;ait for the next four years at 160 million tonnes, well below the

/^Kp^cted 1988 harvest,  there would be price cuts of 3 per cent a year.

#nojre\cuts would be cumulative with the prospect therefore of a 12 per

cvft o^ice cut by the fourth year, plus a cut of 2 per cent in the

cur^ f t-jvear.    In addition there was provision for an increase of up to

3 peV\Jrafttin the co-responsibility levy.    For rapeseed,  the threshold

had betep^et at 4.5 million tonnes compared with a forecast harvest of

6.3 miKMon tonnes.    On this basis there would be a price cut of 8 per

cent thrs year on top of 10 per cent last year.    The price cuts would

become still larger in following years if production continued to rise.

She shared theJudgment put to her by the Secretary General of the

Commission thM^me overall agricultural package was a tough one. In

his view, the\Vrc^i m of surpluses would have been overcome by 1992.

Although we wouVa&apos;ljfte to have done still better, it was satisfactory

that the agricul^w^a^^guideline itself would in future rise at only 74

per cent of the ra^e^6f^growth of the total resources available for

Community expenditu^^^ ^

THE PRIME MINISTER said ^ jj ev the Council had expected to confirm

agreement on stabl isers^fof-j-Mght further commodities on which agreement

had been reached in pr ine^jrL^pkt Copenhagen.    The French Prime Minister,

Monsieur Chirac, had sough^CA^ceopen this position, no doubt for

electoral reasons.    The Duta^P^wne Minister, Mr Lubbers, and she had

made clear that agreement to Vy^ ke measures before the European

Council was conditional on theCsraapcsion of these eigfct stabilisers in

their present form.    It was on t^f^sis that the matter had been

referred to the meeting of Foreign^^^Tairs Council on 22-23 February.

As regards the own resources ceilingor^Jgreement had been reached on a

figure of 1.2 per cent Gross NationaV^pJ&amp;uct, on a traditional payments

basis, well below the Commission&apos;s pr^tfosal.    In future the United

Kingdom&apos;s abatement would be outside th* agreed own resources ceiling.

Concluding, the Prime Minister said that the performance of the Dutch

had been exemplary throughout in contrast to that of some other Member

States. //^\

In discussion,  it was agreed that it would be^e^eTenAial that the meeting

of the Foreign Affairs Council should reaffirm y^oa/ifx\iisions reached

there,  in the run-up to the Brussels Council, thatp^fVe^Copenhagen

package covering eight other commodities should not/e^^Peopened. This

issue should not be allowed to be put back to the Ag *ouVfcural Council

with a possibility there of a majority vote decision.   Jj A,he follow-up

to the Council,  it would also be important to ensure traK^fTyte

Declaration on unfair trade practices was not allowed to^ogw^te as a

loophole to the agricultural guideline.    The toughness of xt^^T^ckage

had been spelt out in recent debate in the House of Commons\^/re) this

sunk in within the farming community it would be necessary t&amp;j&amp;btovce

the message that without such measures there would have been a{jtoYy&amp;nse


of the Common Agricultural Policy, and that the decisions reached

promised greater stability and certainty of conditions.    The agreement

would involve an increase in the United Kingdom&apos;s contribution of the

^\order already recognised in earlier discussion.    But it amounted to a

Ov&amp;reakthrough in containment of the Common Agricultural Policy which had

^/prfen achieved with the abatement arrangements unimpaired.    This was a

&apos;//#&amp;ilt on which the Prime Minister and all those concerned with the
