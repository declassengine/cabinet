&quot;t^^ANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that the debate on the

Rov ^/5*oup on a Motion for the adjournment on the following Wednesday

was ip^fulfilment of the Government&apos;s undertaking to provide time for a

debac^S^Xhis topic.    There was,  nevertheless, nothing significant that

the Govp/mf&amp;nt- could add to their earlier statements about the plans to

privatis^ohe Rover Group and there was a risk that any criticism by the

Opposition of the proposed level of Government assistance would add to

the difficulties of handling that matter with the European Commission.

The European Commissioner responsible, Mr Sutherland, was presently

consulting othe/r^mfember states, and was expected to come to a conclusion

on the matter ^^tl^e end of May.

THE SECRETARY OF fflAWJOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the supporters of

Mr David Alton&apos;s Abrj^ *yon (Amendment) Bill had not given any sign that

they were prepared co/^2^pt an increase in the Bill&apos;s stipulation of

18 weeks as the point^^fT&lt;A&amp;j.ch abortions should, in general, be

unlawful.    In particular,J&amp;e.y had so far refused to contemplate the

figure of 24 weeks, whic^xw^sgeneral medical acceptance as the time

above which a foetus woulx^Cbe^Andependent ly viable.    The figure of

24 weeks was already adminxspJr^Vwe 1 y recommended to doctors by his

Department as,  in general, Dfte^aipp^r limit for abortions to be carried

out.    It was likely that the ^i&gt;^^\Report Stage on Friday 6 May would

be the occasion for a series of/vp*eXon various time limits. The

Government&apos;s position remained one/^f\peutrality, with the Health

Ministers being willing to offer racjx srl advice on the medical

implications of the various proposi&lt;&amp; e-  }

In discussion the following main poinfv&amp;/ ^re made -

a. It was quite possible that the Abortion (Amendment) Bill would

run out of time and,  in that event, acrimonious dispute on the

abortion issue could be expected to contip-tmvin forthcoming

sessions.    Even if a Parliamentary majorftjcy Inould be found for a

limit of, say, 24 weeks,  that would not boWje^nd of the matter,

since the supporters of the present Bill wqr/ldJaertainly continue

their campaign to have that limit reduced. ^EL^ffpk just possible

that a limit of around 22 weeks might attractv^(pf^cient consensus

support to settle the issue for the rest of theC^p^$^nt Parliament,

but any reduction below 24 weeks clearly risked ^re^&amp;ld.ng a

counter-campaign by supporters of the position tha ^*ftect\vely

obtained at present. \S ))

b. A complex aspect of the debate was the allowance\tr1^:Mihould

be made for abortions to be carried out in cases where^eh-^V/oe tus

could be shown to be abnormal.    The scope for tests of unW&amp;XA^

children was constantly expanding,  and the demand for thenrco^kX be

expected to increase accordingly.    If the general limit forC&apos;


abortions was pitched below the point at which reliable tests could

]\ normally be carried out on foetuses,  then more importance was

)) assumed by the exceptions that were allowed for abortions to be

^vvs.     carried out when abnormalities were detected.    The arguments

^\&gt;y\   therefore depended on a sound understanding of the present state of

\&gt;ySsf/ medical science.

A  important factor in the Bill&apos;s Report Stage would be the

v^m^fer in which the Speaker called the amendments.    If, as on

&lt;^p*v-j*)us occasions,  the amendments started at the upper end of the

prtSAos&amp;d time limits, and worked downwards, then it was possible

trWp&lt; ne 24-week limit might be approved.    If, on the other hand,

the\?imendments began at the lower end of the range,  then some limit

lower than 24 weeks might possibly win a majority.

THE PRIME MINIST&amp;Rv.  summing up the discussion,  said that the future of

the Bill would/pepeVid on the progress which it made in Private Members&apos;

time.    While trV^^avTesrnment remained neutral on the issue, colleagues

would be greatly e/ssysjted if they could be provided with factual advice

on the issues tha&amp;^&amp;vfy arise on the Bill&apos;s Report Stage.    To that end,

the Secretary of St^TeYf^r Social Services should circulate a note

setting out the Bill&apos;^^veNusions and the amendments that were proposed,

together with an analyVT^o^ their medical implications and an account

of the views expressed bv^J&amp;Mloyal Colleges.    As soon as the procedural

prospects for the Bill&apos;s &lt;R^poVt Stage became clear,  the Lord President

should also circulate a no^S^rt^that aspect.

The Cabinet - ^&gt;/si/

THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  following the di^fu^sion at the previous

week&apos;s Cabinet, it had been agreed to make adWstj&amp;ants to the housing

benefit arrangements on the capital limit,  the tiwarment of property

belonging to elderly people entering care homes,\s y^c&gt;ri the provision of

transitional protection.    These modifications had $ &amp;VApnounced by the

Secretary of State for Social Services during the derw^Nsn housing

benefit in the House of Commons the previous day, and^T-ad^ijeen

well received by the Government&apos;s supporters.    Much credi^&gt; sas also due

to the Chief Whip and the other Whips, for the work whic&lt;h/ tfey\ had done

to explain the Government&apos;s position to backbenchers in DQ^s^alVd other

recent debates.    While the changes had clearly been necess^wAM the

circumstances, they came on top of the Cabinet&apos;s decisions,^At^t^

previous two meetings,  to meet the additional costs of the Ea^\j(A^

Health Service pay awards from the Reserve and to reduce the h&lt;&amp;i*sinV\


&gt;    benefit taper to coincide with the introduction of the community charge.

&apos;VVThese decisions greatly limited the room for any possible further

^additions to public expenditure, on which the tightest control would

^/^nAed to be maintained.

2.     THENjSECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the strike action

by employees of P &amp; 0 European Ferries at Dover was likely to reach a

critical stage later that week as P &amp; 0 sought to return one or more of

their ferries fj^rjaMlot terdam.    There were already some signs of the

action spreading t^) Folkestone, Hull and Liverpool and there was a risk

that the indusrtt fc^etion would escalate further and cause substantial

disruption at allftofvWhe ferry ports.    Legal action was being taken in

the High Court by^k^Jfyerry operators that day to seek to have the

National Union of Selnn^rfXNUS) ruled in contempt of an injunction

banning secondary acDifj^jVVAlthough that might lead to a heavy fine and

to the sequestration of cW)inion&apos;s assets,  the NUS, who were

considering an amalgamat^rv&gt;Ath another union, had not been deterred by

that possibility.    The TrMspcrt and General Workers Union had said that

their members would help tV-feevts^* ferries provided they were manned by

British crews, but French se^meV^ unions had said that they would

boycott any ship sailed by no^jWHmembers.    Although the negotiating

positions of P &amp; 0 and the NUS h^Kj/tmme reasonably close together during

negotiations earlier that month urid^j^fhe auspices of the Advisory,

Conciliation and Arbitration ServVce^Vf&gt;bth parties to the dispute had

now become firmly entrenched and an&lt;^S*+2k settlement no longer appeared

to be in prospect.    P &amp; 0 had indicaceSythat if they were unable to

secure satisfactory arrangements for r^H^ing their ferries, as a last

resort they would sell their fleet rathieS: than back down in the face of

the union&apos;s demands.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that Jre^had satisfied himself,

in accordance with the requirements of the Me/piaat Shipping Act 1970,

that the new crew agreements proposed by P &amp; Ov^^rg^catis factory.

Department of Transport surveyors were currently^Examining the ferries

which P &amp; 0 were proposing to sail from Rotterdans-a^a^ehecking safety

procedures.    The NUS were claiming that P &amp; 0&apos;s plansYijJVpTved

unacceptably low safety levels but there was, in fac^^n \juestion of

ships being allowed to sail unless they came up to theweMst

standards. ^\^^)

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Kent Police had made conWv^k^W plans,

including arrangements for mutual aid from Essex, Surrey arf^S^s^ex, to

deal with any escallation of the dispute.    So far,  the demori&amp;^afcbrs had

been generally peaceful and good-natured.    There had been some / pe al


allegations that seamen had been intimidated into not going to work: it

was important that anyone who had evidence of intimidation should report

&apos;yv the matter to the police.

^&lt;^*E PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that it would be

vv^jrftortant to remind the public that the majority of P &amp; 0 employees at

^Stn/p* had accepted the company&apos;s recent offer.    The NUS were seeking to

jA^ie^ve restrictive practices through intimidatory picketing.

THE CHA^eI&apos;lOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the National executive of the

National \^nion of the Civil and Public Servants had unanimously

recommended to their members acceptance of a pay offer of 4i per cent

and had given an undertaking that they would enter into talks on

long-term flexiKje^spay.    This isolated the Civil and Public Servants

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY sa\3y  aS. despite lamentable

speeches by the Taoiseach, Mr Charles Haughey, ir^Ne^JYork and at

Harvard University during the preceding week, he rmjK&amp;lf had

deliberately not reshaped his own speech on Anglo-rrWh^elations on

22 April,  intending that it should be read side-by-svd^^th

Mr Haughey1 s contribution.    As a result there had been cV^JLcism of

Mr Haughey in the Irish press and in the Dail for faili^rj^  \attack

terrorism in the presence of an American audience,  for caXtiJi.doubt on

the Anglo-Irish Agreement and for reverting to his long-terjry^M&lt;i of

Irish unity rather than supporting the emphasis on devolutisra \fcnW:he

Anglo-Irish Agreement.


&gt;    THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the impact in

 \ Dublin of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s speech had been in

)j stark contrast to that accorded to the speeches of Mr Haughey which were

xv2een by all except his staunchest supporters as having been a mjaor

,^\ M:or.    In the way his speeches were presented and distributed

Alaughey had pandered unreservedly to Irish-American opinion and had

^fi/gpwery dismissive in his few references of support for the

A-rigba^Xrish Agreement.    It would be necessary to find ways to restore

th^cojr^idence that Mr Haughey had forfeited by this episode; and the

IrisdjK^ov^rnment would have to make a major contribution to this.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Thames Television were

intending to show-^that evening a programme about the shooting of three

Irish terroris/ys^~m Gibraltar on 6 March entitled &quot;Death on the Rock&quot;.

A central poinxJ^n&gt;-fche programme was likely to be an interview with an

alleged eye-witna/s ypich would seek to cast doubt on the explanation of

this incident whrchj^xt&lt;&amp; Government had given to Parliament.    He had

taken the matter xipy^lA^the Chairman of the Independent Broadcasting

Authority (IBA), Lord\?frp^vson, pointing out that to show such a

programme before the vfq^eVt had taken place could be prejudicial to a

fair hearing of the evid^J^e\at the inquest.    After previewing the full

programme together with weln jlawyers, and Thames Television, the

Authority had replied thaK^ g^.saw no grounds in law to stop the

programme from being shown.^vlV^aying this they were no doubt aware

that it would be difficult V^jfcfng an action for contempt in the

British courts when the inque^t&apos;mar^.to be held in Gibraltar.    His own

recollection was that the quest\ix5nwitnesses being pre-examined on

television before an inquiry took^pTap  had been looked into by a

Commission on tribunals of inquiryyffi^j^ed by Mr Justice Salmon in 1968

after the Aberfan pit disaster; anacdi^vMr Justice Salmon&apos;s report had

contained very strong recommendations/^j^frvst this practice on the

grounds that it amounted to contamination of evidence.    If this

recollection was confirmed by referencevto the Salmon Report, he

intended to make another attempt to dissuade the Chairman of the IBA on

the broad grounds that to go ahead with the programme before the inquest

would be an act of irresponsibility. //y\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that th/% ted Kingdom was

making the running on international follow-up ac t ion^^M^e hijacking of

the Kuwaiti aircraft.    He had presented a five-point platf^o the

European Community on 25 April, which had also been taM^jpTy* the

International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) on 26 AN$ci^//&apos;\ The

United Kingdom was in addition pressing for action in the ^rfc^jt of the

forthcoming Toronto Summit of the seven major industrialised.Vpu^tries.

This plan called for accession to The Hague Convention by ^[Iss

non-signatories such as Algeria; the strengthening of the prov(tMoSk of

the Conventions,  for example to prevent hijacked aircraft from mery^nV*


between airports;  the establishment of a group of counter-terrorism

 \ experts under ICAO auspices to be on permanent standby to advise

J (governments on future hijackings; and a comprehensive investigation of

v^Xf circumstances of the hijacking itself.    The degree

/N^rvlranian complicity was still unclear and officials were having a

\\ jrjash look at the whole question of involvement in terrorism by Iran.

&lt;^aup^XArabia had severed diplomatic relations with Iran, no doubt having

al^j^hrtly in mind possible difficulties over forthcoming pilgrimages

to ^^ay\krahia1 s Islamic holy places.    The Government had also had some

difficulties in handling the Algerians and in persuading them that the

UnitecC^Kjygdom was not conducting a vendetta.    There was a limit to how

far the/0W rnment could get out ahead of everybody else in acting as

the international conscience.    But there were some signs that Algeria

might be ready to rethink matters and to discontinue its role as an

intermediary for aircraft hijackers.

THE FOREIGN AND CO^eW^LTH SECRETARY said that, while there was no

Liberation Organisatii/iJ/p^Jacial, Khalil al-Wazir (Abu Jihad) shot dead

in Tunis on 16 April h^^Kpwn killed by Israeli agents.    The matter had

been considered in the Uri t^d\nations that week.    The United Kingdom had

shown firm support for a xtfjrts\uan sponsored Security Council resolution

which had condemned the mu%v^s an aggressive act against Tunisia

while stopping short of namirfg^AsXael explicitly.    The United Kingdom

was continuing to urge moderaairland restraint on the Palestinian side

Defence had met the United States Defense Secr ^a~r^, Mr Frank Carlucci,

on 27 April in Brussels and both he and Mr YouwgerVwere in touch with

their Dutch and Belgian colleagues.    They had reaotfeliNno firm

statement on the Presidency&apos;s own responsibility.    On this occasion, the

, Greek Foreign Minister, who had in general not appeared imbued with the

)l spirit of the Davos agreement, had proposed a reference to Cyprus in the

^rVesidency statement which the latter had accepted in a modified form.

-VvTwe Presidency had, however, misjudged its acceptability to the Turks,

\wfyry had taken umbrage at it.    A dinner with the Turks took place but had

^Sikh/^o further acrimony.    There was no point in apportioning blame for

birfLS/Ohbacle, but it would be more difficult to take matters forward

aga^vnsfcwihis background.
