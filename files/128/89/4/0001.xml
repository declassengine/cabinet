^TftE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that he wished to

/ItQHSratulate the business managers in the House of Lords for securing

^Wejg&apos;uccessful completion of the Committee Stage of the Local Government

Abolition of

the Inner

London

Education

Authority

THE SECRETARY /&lt;JF-&gt;5TATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the

Conservative P^rtvElection Manifesto had approached the improved

delivery of edirc^irton services in inner London by proposing that where

entire borough cx^uja^XA* wished to become independent of the Inner London

Education Author ityp&gt;MjEA) they should be able to request permission to

take over the provis/oj ^&lt;&gt;\f education within their boundaries.    This was

the approach adopt ed^fy\v:i\fc Education Reform Bill, currently proceeding

through its Committee Stag^in the House of Commons.    Three boroughs

(Wandsworth, Kensingtonvjjajr^helsea, and Westminster) had decided to use

the new machinery to break from ILEA&apos;s control:  the City of London

(which had a very small num&amp;p^v^f residents) was likely to take the same

line, and Tower Hamlets wouik j^p&amp;bably also do so.    In these

circumstances a strong feeling/HjidOgrown up, not only in the

Conservative Party, that there ^prouTti be an orderly &quot;and planned transfer

of entire responsibility for educ^&gt;^cwU in inner London to the borough

level.    This line was taken by a gaerfp&apos;many leading figures in the

education world, who were not neces^S^y supporters of the Government.

The main concern was whether it wouldV^e^efe to hand responsibility for

education over to London boroughs thatxOfad demonstrated their unfitness

in various other directions.    The Education Reform Bill, however,

offered safeguards that were previously unavailable,  including the

provisions on the national curriculum, open enrolment, financial

delegation and powers for a school to withdray^-fxtom the control of the

local education authority.    Another relevant (factor was that local

education authorities had the power to set up^roflTyteducation committees

on a voluntary basis:  this machinery offered qu\tfixW&gt;fteful prospects for

a measure of co-ordinated organisation for such pax^/oi the education

service in London as might benefit from that appro acmyyTtavts of the

further and adult education system could well be a c^eAra point.

In the light of these considerations he was in no doubt&gt;|^m K\the best

course was to proceed to the total abolition of ILEA at N^B-p/arliest

possible practicable date, and he had the previous day secu^alT&apos;^he

agreement of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic^fiH^Begy,

Sub-Committee on Education Policy (E(EP)) that abolition shoi&lt; d%Ae

place on 1 April 1990.    ILEA would thus cease to exist before tpe reext


direct elections to it fell due.    The decision would require amendments

to the Education Reform Bill, and he had discussed with the Lord

\    President of the Council the Parliamentary procedures that would be

Jj   necessary for this in view of the fact that the Bill was subject to a

 ^^timetable motion.    He intended, with the agreement of the Cabinet, to

^\ilrake a statement of the decision that afternoon in the House of Commons.

\&gt;/$f believed that it might well receive a wider welcome than would

 a *ler have been foreseen, and that guarded neutrality might now be

^exp^j^ed from some influential figures who would previously have been

hwfci^e to the proposal.

In (firsroyssion the following mam points were made -

a. vC  Work had been put in hand to arrange for the London Residuary

Body to oversee the break-up of ILEA and the distribution of its

assets.    It would probably be necessary to develop criteria to

ensure that resources were distributed in a way that reflected the

varying MAication burdens that fell on the inner London boroughs.

b. Endingf/1LEW&apos; s inflated overheads should lead to a reduction in

the educati&amp;fcn^alfts falling on the community charge payer in inner

London.    The wfyYs^on thus assisted community charge policy, as

well as being a(&gt;J&gt;ug\awaited educational reform.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summiw&gt;ip the discussion, said that the Cabinet

endorsed the previous datf^s Jlecision by E(EP) that ILEA should be

abolished on 1 April 1990vr^kie\ Secretary of State for Education and

Science should announce tha^Orf t^.rnoon in the House of Commons that the

necessary amendments would CT^vjjtjWed to the Education Reform Bill, and he

should circulate the text of rn^^Mtement in draft to members of E(EP).

The statement should be repeate^d^rp/Mie House of Lords.    The Secretary

of State and the Lord President ty? *-\y&amp;&gt; Council should continue to

consider the Parliamentary handlin^ ^  -the necessary amendments. The

ending of ILEA&apos;s dismal record wourSvtJya major contribution to the

Government&apos;s policy of dispersing pow^T/^n education nearer and nearer

to parents and governors.    The Government would also need to consider

whether any additional arrangements werV needed to support schools which

wanted to withdraw from local authority controls in inner London.

The Cabinet -

1. Endorsed the decision by the MinisterjLa^T^Bjteering

Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-CommitE^eoj^f^

Education Policy that the Inner London Educa^Cvf//&gt;

Authority should be abolished on 1 April 1990 ap4/^\at

amendments should be introduced to the Educatio^^^.

Reform Bill to achieve this. /xxK

2. Invited the Secretary of State for Education

and Science to announce the decision that afternoon   //\V

in the House of Commons and to discuss the Parliamentaw/w

handling of the amendments with the Lord President of

the Council. \^ s&gt;\

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he would be announcing in the House of

Commons in the following week that, as agreed by the Cabinet the

previous month, he would be establishing an independent inquiry to

examine material relating to allegations that ex-Nazi war criminals were

&apos;M.iving in the United Kingdom.    Sir Thomas Hetherington, the former

O&amp;irector of Public Prosecutions, and Mr William Chalmers, the former

/&lt; yown Agent in Scotland, had agreed to undertake the inquiry.    He had

 &quot;yo^jL in touch with Mr Merlyn Rees MP, Chairman of the Parliamentary

(A^li-?p\rty War Crimes Group, and with the Opposition spokesman in the

H$*se^*vf Commons to inform them of his proposals.    The establishment of

an i^uj-ry was bound to be criticised both by those who believed that

the &lt;&amp;rtS/d\\o\iY&amp; be amended to take jurisdiction over war crimes committed

abroacy/by^chose now resident in the United Kingdom and by those opposed

to any wive in that direction.    Nevertheless, he believed that the

approachVhe had described would gain general acceptance as a reasonable

response.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STAjfe^FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that about 1,500

National Health ServiceM^ffiTjn staff, of whom about three quarters were

nurses, had mounted a str^k^^fre previous day.    The only area outside

London that had been s ignifxfe&gt;aoVj.y affected was Leeds.    He was still

collecting information about^tp^yef f ect of the strike on patient care,

but about 400 non-urgent oper^^H^appeared to have .been postponed.

The demonstrations connected wi(ptf 0*\ strike had attracted very

considerable publicity and the ts^e^jkiions involved were all attempting

to manipulate the situation for tha^r^own purposes, with scant regard

for truth.    The Royal College of NuC^tfJW,  in particular, had given what

it must have known were distorted acc^op^ of the Government&apos;s

intentions towards the funding of pay decreases for nurses and of the

Government&apos;s evidence to the Nurses PayOReview Body.

In discussion the following main points were made -

a. Staff costs represented about 75 pMcMt of health service

costs, but the extraordinary fallacy seemga/Cd\he gaining credence

in the media that staff pay was in some waj\&amp;eTj  ate from wider

question of NHS funding.    This confusion was gnbsbluvring public

recognition of the fact that the Government haa^ ^Vry good record

in honouring the full amounts that had been rec&lt;ff fflknxJed by the

Review Bodies. ^^^\

b. The Government&apos;s good record on ensuring prope^^a^for nurses

and doctors meant that they had had to square up to ia^res^about

the funding of the NHS that had been avoided by the pr^vj^rfft

Government, which had been content to see the pay of th&amp;&amp;//\

professions lag behind the rate of inflation. L/^ Vs.


c.     Presentational problems about funding the NHS partly arose

from the fact that the public expenditure survey year and the

&gt; planning years used by the health authorities were not in

 &quot;V\ synchronisation with the cycle of Review Body recommendations on

/&apos;Jy\        Pay     Given the room for improvement in NHS management, and the

scope for reducing waste, efficiency savings clearly had to be

\VV/S    sought, but these could not be set far in advance of the year in

 (y^/yy question.    These problems were compounded by the fact that health

/^/yauthorities had to conduct their planning processes in public, so

/^laat contingency planning could easily be misunderstood in the

sW&amp;lic mind.

*a yyttie recruitment of nurses presented little problem over much

ot/vhe country.    Difficulties were concentrated in London and the

Sou^i East, and the Government had sought to tackle this in its

evidence to the Review Body for Nursing Staff, Midwives, Health

Visitors and Professions Allied to Medicine, in which the Review

Body&apos;s ree^mtaendations were sought on geographical supplements to

the pay it nurses including in London and the South East. The

Review Bosy\^S3\no locus in relation to the determination of London

weighting, ^inptal&apos;this was negotiated.

THE PRIME MINISTERf^wJj&amp;ng up the discussion, said that a number of

points had been rais^efj^rfret were important to the handling of present

concerns about the NHS. ^T-Ktere was evidence of colossal waste in the

Service.    The Governmen^^gopd record in meeting the Review Body&apos;s

recommendations for the M^of^doctors and nurses represented especially

strong ground, and no opportoOTM for emphasising this point should be

lost.

3.      THE/?KIME MINISTER, reporting on her discussions on 29 January with

PresideraMitterrand and Monsieur Chirac of France, said that they (and

particularly Monsieur Chirac) had taken the line that the United Kingdom

would be isolated at the European Council on agriculture and without

concessions would not be able to maintain the abatement arrangements.

She had made c/  im that this was a hollow threat against the requirement

for unanimityUfor^Lncreased resources and our relative comfort in

relation to a rejjftm^ypf provisional twelfths.    She had also drawn

attention to theV^-L^/fcipral hazards for the French of acceptance of

discriminatory prop^Msv for the co-responsibility levy which would fall

disproportionately on^B^tish and French farmers.    In contrast,

Chancellor Kohl of Ge^jrwnj^had uttered no threats and had expressed a

wish for the forthcoming&apos;Aici 1 to reach agreement.    The acid test

remained whether or notM^&amp;rKfermans would be prepared to take effective

action to tackle agriculr^aV^urpluses, given their evident preference

for only gradual reform inc^K&gt;d3^j a reluctance,  in the case of cereals,

to accept any price cuts in^Jie/f\rst year and emphasis in the

arrangements on co-responsibiC^yV/fcevy.    She had pointed out to

Chancellor Kohl that Germany be^fi^d from the efficiency of its

manufacturing sector and ought na^tTcVpenalise the efficiency of other

countries in agriculture by seeking^ojoitch prices at the level of the

least efficient. ^^0/

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETAR^x^eporting on the Conclave of

Foreign Ministers on 1-2 February, saiuvthat the Presidency seemed at

last to have focussed on their responsibilities.    Herr Genscher&apos;s

chairmanship was also consistent with the view that the Germans were now

looking for a settlement although there were ti^r^L many problems to be

resolved.    For their part the Germans had, atKlea^t for the moment, put

the abatement on one side, although Monsieur CM^aTrymight seek to make

tactical use of this issue at the European Coun^ll^yAlhe indications

received since the Conclave suggested that the Pres^ency might be

prepared to make some further move on the maximum gua^Mn-teed quantity

for cereals,  the oilseed price and the 20 tonne exem^i^ri^from

co-responsibility levy.    We would need, along with the Dtrt h, to keep up

the pressure in these and other areas.    The Italians rew^rfaH much

exercised over the proposals for new contribution arrang^eroe^zsv giving

greater emphasis to Gross National Product.    The level of tfoO&amp;ructural

Funds represented one of the major areas of difficulty and^t^^dMd not

be easy to maintain the position we had taken up. &lt;/^^^


In a brief discussion,  it was suggested that it would be important to

resist any proposals for ambiguous language relating to exceptional

circumstances which in practice could drive a coach and horses through

il   the agricultural guideline provisions.    Our central pre-occupation must

^Vemain agricultural reform and we should maintain our stand on the basis

&apos;s\&lt;*f common sense.
