(EETPU) would be &gt;wcj&gt; &gt;ed from the Trades Union Congress (TUC) at the

Congress in SeptemDg^/The EETPU were canvassing support from non-TUC

unions, such as the Un*Jiyj &quot;sof Democratic Mineworkers, and it was possible

that a rival body to N^ ^V{C might emerge.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER sai&amp;*is b the General Secretaries of the

Civil Service unions had agreed to re^iwmpjd to their members acceptance

of an improved offer on London Weightr&amp;^^which was the main unresolved

issue in the current year&apos;s pay negotiations, amounting to about 11 per

cent in 1988-89 or 14i per cent on a full-year basis.    If, as he

expected, the unions&apos; memberships accepted the offer, the Civil and

Public Servants Association and the National Uj^PSR of Civil and Public

Servants, which were the two largest Civil Serwic^) unions, would have

settled for about 4 ^/^ per cent, including LcHtrJo p Bighting.

I listurbance

\ at Haverigg

IPrison

THE HOME SECRETARY said that earlier that week a seriWsw*? turbance had

taken place at Haverigg Prison in Cumbria.    Three hundr^jKR&amp;soner

places had been lost and three of the prisoners who had Mcapid remained

at large.   Contrary to some reports, the prison had been ne-rafik

overcrowded nor undermanned.    The Deputy Director General cW^o^^Prison

Service was conducting an urgent investigation and, until thajtx^fatl been

completed, it would not be possible to determine the causes or ^fi^^


disturbance.    Under the law as it stood,  it was not possible to transfer

prisoners between England and Wales,  Scotland and Northern Ireland in

order to ease disparities of accommodation, and there was a case for

|\remedying this situation at the next convenient legislative opportunity.

*\^\^    The Cabinet -

THE PRI^E^JniSTER said that there had been a number of recent issues

concernewwith crime which had given rise to public concern. These

included vhe collapse of three Metropolitan Police cases involving

alleged football hooliganism and of another involving alleged sexual

offences; and anapparent growth in violent crime in rural communities

involving relat^Byy affluent young people.    It would be useful for the

Cabinet to haviAa general discussion about law enforcement and crime,

covering these a3  c~t , for which it would be helpful if the Home

Secretary would cM^jixa&apos;te a brief factual paper.

necessary with the hi^y&lt;SViicers, to bring forward a

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHE^N^&amp;LAND said that the compounds at

Maze Prison, which had become extremp^y uneconomic to run, had been

closed the previous Sunday, with thewtfSwlling band of special category

prisoners being rehoused in &quot;H Block&quot; \ycpAnodation.    The move to the

&quot;H Blocks&quot;, which had gone very smoothjWx&apos;wouId facilitate the

assessment of the prisoners and he had accordingly instructed his

officials to review the cases of all the prisoners within six months of

their transfer.    Given that all such prisoners had now served long

periods in custody,  there must be a possibility^fc&amp;at a number of them

would be found suitable for release. l( (J

In discussion it was noted that, while a number i^SyCecial category

prisoners might be found to be suitable for releaffer^rais matter needed

to be approached with considerable caution, taking aoglw^t of the

potential impact on the morale of the Royal Ulster CcmrfjQfb^lary and of

the Armed Forces.

3.      THE MINISTER OF STATE,  FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE

(Mrs Chalker) said that the summit meeting in Moscow between the

President of the United States, Mr Ronald Reagan, and the General

^Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU),

Mikhail Gorbachev, on 30 May to 1 June had been an outstanding

N^uVress.    Despite the absence of major break-throughs on arms control or

matters, the Summit had been an important further step toward

=yip* *^van&lt;l predictable relations between the United States and the

sWie AJnion.    The habit of dialogue at the top level was now fully

forwn\^espite the fact that fundamental differences and difficulties

rema^M ^--\ Problems could at least be tackled in a calm and constructive

atmosp^hkw.    There was no reason why the next United States

Administyatycon should not carry on where President Reagan would leave

off.   The^resident himself was very concerned to leave a durable

framework T ehind him.    The visit of the Prime Minister to the United

States in November would be very important in that general context.

It was valuable/ztfTiaMj President Reagan had been able to reach a variety

of Soviet audieVJeej &gt;4irectly during his visit to Moscow.    This would

have helped in brMKinf down stereotyped Soviet views of the United

States and the WesV^rO^Pfte emphasis placed by President Reagan on Human

Rights had never bee^KX^lsftly to sour the atmosphere at the Summit

despite occasional pr^&amp;yp^esa on the subject from Mr Gorbachev.    It was

essential that the Russ^Qpvahould understand that Human Rights and the

treatment of their own cip z fts was a key factor in the longer term

health of East-West relarl^rs^) The Soviet military posture would

continue to need watching o^a^V.   There was also a major internal

battle afoot between Mr Gorbrf^hAj^oand      Yegor Ligachev, the Secretary

of the CPSU Central CoinmitteeSX^AiV in all President Reagan could not

have done better in the circumsMfaro^X.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the S^^Hlfiftwiad indeed been a very great

success.    The Government had been vej^P^ojrtunate that President Reagan

had decided to come straight to LonddSMfflom Moscow.    His speech at the

Guildhall on 3 June had been one of hiy^&gt;?  .    His strong emphasis on

Human Rights was a powerful reminder thajr^the West should not hold back

on this subject for fear of souring relac*ons, but on the contrary

needed to set out basic beliefs and ideals clearly and vigorously. The

President and Mrs Reagan had been thrilled with their visit to London

which had done a lot to cement further relation^&quot;be ween the United

Kingdom and the United States.   The President fctd fes^ressed a particular

wish that she should visit Washington in NovembeT/^pmbably as the last

foreign head of Government to do so in his Adminiircj^riiDn and in order

to meet the President-elect. ^Il/y

THE PRIME MINISTER said she had sent messages to Mr Gcg fchfcv both

before and after the Moscow Summit.    She had received a lp*Jg^message

back and Mr Gorbachev had also sent a special emissary t ^ v&quot;a\ the

Soviet view of the Summit with whom she had spent an hour^&amp;j^Areceding

evening.   Mr Gorbachev was anxious to pay a return visit to JflJ^Typited

Kingdom:  such a visit might take place in the spring or summer jfo^iext

year or earlier if that were more helpful to him.    It was very^mwhOin

the British interest that he should remain in power in the Sovie^/^n^an


to pursue the great endeavour to which he had set his hand.    But this

would be a very difficult task because the Russian people were not well

V  equipped in terms of their traditions to release themselves from state

\\ socialism.    They did not enjoy the traditions of law, equity and

-^kolerance which underlay the British democratic system and it would thus

&apos;/Vln^ very hard for them to produce the necessary response for which Mr

\fij nbachev1 s reform programme called.

&lt;&amp;jrtJ)*Sauestion of a strategic arms reduction agreement one or two

br^yt-Cm-oughs had been achieved on technical questions which had not up

to tJrfK^pjtoved possible in the negotiations in Geneva.    It remained

possiSJ^p^chat an agreement would be reached although the timing and

circuma^^es of ratification by the United States Senate would be

awkward.vc The greater depth attained by the relationship between the

United StSrtes and the Soviet Union nevertheless now meant that there did

not need to be a major break-through on every occasion of this kind. In

the face of these_very exciting times in East-West relations, to which

the Government/ySaymade its own contribution,  the Labour Party with its

anti-American \^g4d-CAit a very poor picture.

In discussion, it\w rj^rttoted that the great urgency that Mr Gorbachev had

imparted to efforts^^make the Soviet economy work brought substantial

opportunities for Wes/|&amp;rXnvestment in the Soviet Union.   The Federal

Republic of Germany wa^s\i ady very interested in these. British

businessmen needed to be anally alert to new possibilities for

investment, while continvrv&amp;gyp be wary of attempts to exploit

technology transfer in sen^i we . sectors.

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN A^^O^toNWEALTH OFFICE said that an

Iranian negotiating team was meetina^fth officials from the Foreign and

Commonwealth Office on 8 and 9 June ^prt^Sftodon to discuss a settlement

for compensation of damage to the Iran\a^n^mbassy at 16 Princes Gate,

London and to British diplomatic premisj^r in Iran.    These were purely

technical talks based on principles established between the two

Governments in May 1987.    British objectives were to gain fair

compensation for damage to British property;  the repair of a badly

damaged building in the centre of London which/^SShbecome an

environmental hazard; and settlement of upkeeJ(cosj!s incurred by

Westminster City Council.    The essential elemerrM^fwv a settlement were

a payment by the Government to the Iranian Goverwiejivof  1.8 million as

well as settlement by the Government of the claim iT^yrfstminster City

Council for  200,000; together with a payment by the A^ap/ian Government

of  900,000 to the United Kingdom.    There was no majcr^^^rel over

these figures and under Article 20 of the Vienna Conventiraj^the sums

exchanged were to be used for the purposes stated.    The wprp&amp;n and

Commonwealth Office had rebutted press comments that thes^^Xjrj^s were

connected with some kind of deal over British hostages in tKejrtAanon

and the Iranian Charge d&apos;Affaires had the preceding evening^oin ^f

described one particularly far-fetched report in the British f^e^fe^s

totally untrue.    Even if the negotiations did succeed there was/JrvV


prospect at present of significant improvement in relations between the

two countries so long as Iran sponsored terrorist acts,  failed to

*v respect the security of diplomats and continued to attack innocent

j\ shipping in the Persian Gulf.

S\$ &gt;discussion,  it was noted that publicly expressed misgivings about

^\  ij fher the Government was doing enough for hostages should be met by

vtlwL^xfteminder that the Government constantly asserted the duty of

c\j ^lXVed nations to do what they could to secure the release of

hoq^agerc and that the British Ambassador in Beirut spent more than half

his t^^on efforts on behalf of the British hostages there.

n Hong Kong

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE said that the

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had visited Hong Kong from 29 to 31

May where the t/r&gt;tir\\ population of boat people from Vietnam was now over

15,000, with arUjlm&amp;at eight-fold increase in arrivals this year. The

size of the prooTepRwd brought strong pressure for a change of policy

since many of thev^a^rafc arrivals were economic migrants not refugees in

the strict sense. TTa$xAipj.sters concerned had therefore agreed to a new

policy to be announcec^&gt;pyjIong Kong on 16 June.   All boat people would

be screened on arrival^JwLn^ criteria set by the United Nations High

Commissioner for Refugees(^^distinguish genuine refugees from economic

migrants.   Genuine refugev^/tfakld be accommodated in camps in Hong Kong

to await resettlement.    TrV * o  und not to be genuine refugees would be

detained in Hong Kong as ilLe^grfT^mmigrants pending repatriation to

Vietnam.    This new policy wouskrp*^welcomed in Hong Kong, and the

international community in gen^aV^ould understand the reasons for it.

But there had to be intensified e^fo/M t0 persuade Vietnam to take

responsibility both to control ilLe^el&amp;departures and to agree to take

back its own people against guarantejj^of humane treatment.   The Foreign

and Commonwealth Secretary had spoke^lwofchis sense to the Vietnamese

Foreign Minister in New York on 7 JuneN/jlA had also spoken to his

Chinese and Soviet counterparts about W&amp;&apos;problem.    It was not clear

that Vietnam would react favourably and^he Government had no way of

underwriting any guarantees of humane treatment for people repatriated

to Vietnam.

In discussion,  it was noted that the main effe(&lt;(t a$ the change in policy

would be to act as a deterrent to future arrivaS^^-Sjbere was no

intention to make it impossible for the people t^il^Ara Vietnam but it

was clear that Hong Kong had reached saturation pffrM^cm the basis of

current policy. /rx&gt;\

THE MINISTER OF STATE, FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH OFFICE repc^^that a

new Government had been formed in Denmark on 31 May.    It wasVAaVie* three

party coalition led by Mr Poul Schluter and included the radi^a^Syx^ho

were traditionally weak on defence.    Mr Ellemann Jensen remaineapwrXign


Minister.    The prospects for Danish defence policy was not encouraging.

Expenditure was to remain at the present level with allowance for

\ inflation at least until 1990 when the new Defence Commission would

Yi report on a review of defence policy for the 1990s.    The prospects for

^ore host country support from Denmark for the United Kingdom Mobile

/^oFigrce were poor. On the question of visits by ships of North Atlantic

\^&lt;Saty Organisation (NATO) allies to Danish ports,  the radicals had

vvApe^. for the Parliamentary Resolution which had raised the question

4j^tKet such ships could come to Danish ports without declaring that

th^y//dnk not carry nuclear weapons.   Mr Schluter had now negotiated a

compjf^ise formula which was not ideal but which the Government and the

Unitetl^ ates, after close consultation, were able to accept with the

additions/ascertain supplementary written assurances to which public

refereno^could also be made.    On that basis Royal Naval visits to

Danish ports could resume without breaching the policy of neither

confirming nor denying whether nuclear weapons were carried.

In discussion,/^Cyas noted that the Danish position on defence

expenditure waJ^mugii^worse than it seemed, given that the present level

was appallingly j^wT^jVor example, Denmark&apos;s only two frigates were

permanently in porc-^U^fefeout crews and their notional declaration to NATO

as part of its avai^&amp;^e^orces would probably have to be withdrawn.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCfl  tfE ^said that the recent French initiative

announced by President Mitte^Hrw^o ease the debt burden of certain

developing countries increaseX VhjO prospect of being able to reach

agreement at the forthcoming S^jamrYt^of the Seven in Toronto, even if in

some respects it appeared to falyx^hpVt of the standards set by the

British initiative on this subject^^TAe French proposals needed further

clarification, particularly as to whether the proposed readiness to

write off one-third of total debt cofe  yboth export credit related

debt and aid, or only the former.    ItVa^x^egrettable that the French

proposals did not seem to comprise any ^ement of conditionality,

committing beneficiary countries to appropriate economic recovery

programme.    It was characteristic of France that notwithstanding his own

considerable efforts to enlist support for the British initiative, the

French should have chosen to go their own way./?B)  Federal Republic of

Germany was divided on the question of a debt {^nitsljrative, with the

Minister of Finance opposed and others in favoirr^^^vt given the

position of the United Kingdom, France and ItalyjyUjxKauld be hard for

the Federal Republic to hold out.    As for the Unirarj^OTates, his

contacts suggested that they were prepared to make aywjvj^and that even

if they could not cancel debt obligations completely^  ^\^^sons

connected with the United States budget .deficit, they wouT^Pbe prepared

to contemplate rescheduling over longer periods or at lcwjr/mterest

rates in respect of debtor countries who were not otherwiSw^/A-

beneficiaries of debt relief programmes.   This was not howeVjeiM^a\ easy

subject for urgent treatment in the run-up to the Presidentr&gt; l\ejfections

in the United States.    The Canadians had been working hard to&lt;j$ Wa*l

upon the Americans to make some move. *^x^\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the case brought

by the Northern Ireland McGimpsey brothers would be opening the

\ following week in the Irish courts challenging the Anglo-Irish Agreement

))as incompatible with the Constitutioin of the Irish Republic on the

^g\ounds that Article 1 of the Agreement could not be reconciled with

^^r^icles 2 and 3 of the Constitution.    This could be a serious matter.

\ytti}:\\e parallel case brought earlier to establish whether the Single

^Ey^ra^&amp;an Act had been compatible with the Irish Constitution, the Irish

Gervepnment had been obliged to pass an Act of Parliament and to hold a

re ereod&gt;im in order to amend the Constitution following an adverse

judg^rafft*-^ In the current case the Unionists in Northern Ireland had

alrea^5^y^tributed more than  50,000 toward the legal costs of mounting

this cbfenj&amp;nge.    If the Irish Government lost they were likely to appeal

to the Svoreme Court and the case would probably be heard during 1989.

In discussion, it was noted that if the upshot of this case were to be

the need for another referendum in the Irish Republic, this would be

likely to lead/rogWionist pressure in Northern Ireland for a referendum

there about thAV^ietsvr Irish Agreement.    On the other hand, it could

lead to a useful Mar^Eication of popular feeling in the Republic.

co-ordinated action against terr\H?isp\  In the wider discussion, there

had been a clash with the Commissi^jJrtyjMr the question of frontier

controls. The Vice President of the^^Jwtmission, Lord Cockfield, took the

view that the Single European Act re^ma member states to abolish all

internal frontier controls by 1992.    Tftj/^J&amp;ted Kingdom&apos;s position,

which was shared by a number of others,^as to rest firmly on the

declaration in the Single European Act trot its provisions did not

affect the right of member states to take such measures as they

considered necessary to combat terrorism, crime and the traffic in

drugs.    The French and Germans took an interme/fr?TWi view on the lines

that internal frontier controls should be abol\AsheJabut only when steps

had been taken to strengthen external controls aTVtf^Ta\monise visa

arrangements.    There was a consensus amongst Inte^kio^Ministers that as

a practical matter it would be necessary to retain&apos;gxratier controls in

order to maintain effective control of the movement o/B^^rorists.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said,^pJJ \while we

accepted that there should be a reduction in frontier cdww^Tyv for

trade, we should hold firm to the declaration in the SingiAjSyJ^soean

Act.    It would be intolerable if the Single European Act wasX&amp;cH^ght to

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the President of the European

coming week,  the Economic and Finance Council would be considering

)\certain outstanding issues following the Brussels European Council,

discussing the Capital Liberalisation Directive.    On the latter,

advance of the discussions of the 1988 agricultural price review to take
