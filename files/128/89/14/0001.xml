THE SECRETARY 6^p&amp;E FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Local

Government Financp/BiH. was due to have its Third Reading in the House

of Commons the foKtgwp&apos;iS Monday.    Two of the most important remaining

votes on the Bill w^J jcV&gt;  on the transitional arrangements for the

national non-domestic^m^\(NNDR) and on new powers to restrain local

authorities&apos; ability t&amp;efycKX into barter transactions.   He believed

that the Government&apos;s prop^aVs on both issues should be broadly

welcomed by Government sujmo&apos;rodrs.    On the transition to the NNDR he

proposed that the Bill shoobJ^pJNjvide enabling powers for a ceiling to

be set to the annual increas^x^to\ hich a ratepayer was subject, with a

lower ceiling for small busin^eNBs^/    He did not propose to specify at

this stage what the ceiling shfaulp^k.    It would not, in fact, be

possible for this level to be se4^orvav clear basis of factual evidence

until further information was avai^^DLfe^about the likely results of the

forthcoming revaluation of non-dome ^ e^rates, and that position was

fully accepted by the Confederation ^Cj&amp;itish Industry.   The process of

adjusting to an up-to-date valuation oA^j^ces that were assessed on the

basis of rental values would clearly ne^encareful management, since

rents had generally tended to be high in^reas where rates were low and

the combined effect of high rents and rates could be very marked. The

Bill currently provided for a five year transitional period, and he had

accepted the case for a further transitional o^Tm thereafter. He

considered it important that the Government sH&lt;Wlq&gt; ot allow long delays

in non-domestic rate revaluation to build up aga f^Tn\ future.   As for

the control of barter arrangements, which would D^-^pjfefaided in new

clauses that he would be moving the following Monda^^(eAWould be able

to make it clear that the Government recognised that/tprtK^bovernment&apos; s

proposed controls could be relaxed for deals in proces^wi^some

categories of barter transactions.    He believed that thisj/w^ald go far

to commend the controls to Government supporters. ^V^-/y

In discussion, it was suggested that in the longer term the^^vw^ a case

for ending revaluations since differences in rateable values^e^7

offset by corresponding differences in capital values.    In the^aop^.

term it was recognised that revaluation was necessary to remedyCx }\


disparities between regions and between service and manufacturing

industries.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that it remained

Jjessential that the Government should demonstrate the fullest possible

-^ /a^pport for the Local Government Finance Bill.    The Secretary of State

COvP^vtbe Environment should resolve the details of the proposed

\&gt;*^/ri.ction on local authority barter transactions with the Chief

Sft^efnry, Treasury, and she should be kept in touch with what was

propp^.

&lt; j fl^C binet -

l.VSy&amp;oV. note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the discussion and invited the Secretary

of State for the Environment to proceed accordingly.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the Defence and

Oversea Policy Committee (OD) had that morning agreed that the United

^Kingdom should participate in the full development of the four-nation

^fturopean Fighter Aircraft (EFA),  subject to final confirmation that the

IWfcderal Republic of Germany (FRG),  Spain and Italy, our partners in the

bJrdftjgct,  intended to proceed also.    This would be an extremely expensive

DjpApt, but OD had concluded,  after very careful consideration,   that it

vras necessary to develop an agile fighter such as EFA in order to

counter the future threat from Soviet bombers escorted by long-range

agile fighters; and that all of the possible alternatives were either

more expensive or had an unacceptably lower capability.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the industrial dispute

at Jaguar&apos;s Coventry plant had been settled earlier that week following

y he endorsement by the workforce, by a majority of about two to one, of

Aplans to increase production there.    The deal would generate increased

/jpMductivity at no increased cost to the company and was an important

in the plan to bring productivity at Jaguar into line with that at

^?^yo:edes Benz and at BMW.

THE SECfc j?Aj  OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that seamen employed by P &amp; 0

Europearfc^P^rries at Dover who had been taking strike action had been

given untvl the previous evening to accept an improved pay offer by the

company.    The company had reported that around 50 per cent of the

workforce of some 1800 people had accepted the offer.    P &amp; 0 management

would be meeting/-r^oresentatives of the National Union of Seamen (NUS)

that day and a massHiieet ing of the workforce had been arranged for the

following day.   v3b&lt; Efrv appeared to be two courses of action open to the

company:    either r/aey)aould seek to persuade the NUS and the port

committee at Dover^QjjwS^he revised offer had been effectively accepted

with a view to an orwe^X^&gt;return to work by the existing workforce, or,

perhaps more likely, l^^yMuild seek to run the ferries with those of

the existing workforce vmv^d accepted the offer together with new

recruits trained to opera^Pj&amp;^e ferries.   The latter course was bound to

provoke an hostile reactidrr^rjdm trades unions.    The P &amp; 0 management

were determined to stand fvsB^against the NUS&apos;s demands.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRA^^I^T said that, under the Merchant

Shipping Act 1970, any new crew^$ eements required his authorisation.

In order to minimise the risk of^ud^^Lal review, he was consulting the

trades unions about the new agreenwft wjkich P &amp; 0 had proposed. The

consultation period ended on the foVJ^J^iag Monday, following which he

would need to consider the unions&apos; rSp^^entations.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said^hat Mr Ravi Tikkoo had

announced highly ambitious plans to build the/*dr&quot;M&apos;s largest cruise

ship at Harland and Wolff shipyard in Belfast.\vJt* was clear that the

project would not be viable without extremely la/ge^ebsidies from

the Government.    The announcement had been a blafcgrtf^a&apos;btempt to force

the Government&apos;s hand into providing the necessary ^dae^ies and he had

ensured that his Department had given no encouragemen^/^Xthe idea that

the Government would be prepared to agree to this.   A^y^uvgestion that

more relaxed criteria for subsidy were being applied to H4 and and

Wolff than to British Shipbuilders would provoke deep re^&amp;Hxmant from

shipbuilding regions in Great Britain.    However, the issua^ojMjd need

sensitive handling in view of the very high rate of long-teraV^v

unemployment in Belfast. ^^^^jjyy

FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, said that the hijacking of

tft  Kjrttaiti Airlines Boeing 747 on 5 April had ended on 20 April in

AlgM&apos;ia^ith the release of the passengers and the disappearance of the

hijac^j3&lt;^ The Kuwait Government appeared to have stood firm in

resistS^once ssions.    The Government would now explore through the

Inter nat&amp;p^JaT Civil Aviation Organisation, the European Community and

the Summr^. of the Seven leading industrialised countries the

possibilities for more effective concerted action against aircraft

hijacking.    Given the likely reluctance of some of Britain&apos;s partners to

agree to seriousAteps against Algeria under the terms of the Bonn

Declaration, thjae&apos;e^afforts were likely to concentrate on practical

measures such al^-thji - ecurity of airports like Bangkok, ways to prevent

hijacked aircraft /yromjmoving between countries and the handling of the

media during hijacvjr^xOtrcidents.

In discussion, it was(ttett&amp;. that the escape of those responsible would

encourage future hijaclCrft^^fticidents.    But interrupting normal air

services as a sanction aga^  \ countries which colluded with or made

concessions to hijackers X^^unlikely to be effective unless widespread

international support from^g ra*\Governments was achieved, which had not

hitherto been the case.    FurfKftV^f f or ts needed to be made to persuade

third world countries to acceKyt^ obligations of The Hague Agreement.

Kuwait deserved praise for hav rfg(%?^bained firm throughout.   The fact

that the whereabouts of the hija jCeYp\since they left the Boeing 747 on

20 April had been kept secret migh^f&apos;^lect a fear that any aircraft

made available to them to leave Alge ^jnight be intercepted, as had

happened on an earlier occasion to ttiJ^rtfW ackers  f the ship &quot;Achille

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported^t&amp;at following the

damage to the United States frigate &quot;Samuel ByRobexts&quot; which struck a

mine in the Persian Gulf on 14 April suffering TOv(fa yalties, the United

States had made a measured response against Iran\W ^s rcise of its

rights of legitimate self-defence.   The result haap&amp;pfiii^Xhe most

substantial clash involving United States forces in /l^^ri story of the

current conflict.    United States naval forces had des  dve$ two Iranian

oil platforms and had crippled two Iranian frigates as w^i^as one

patrol boat and a number of smaller craft.   The Iranian^^cyion had

been swifter and more extensive than expected.    In the coarji-eAaf their

attack against a United States operated oil platform,  the  wJ&amp;O^

Kong-registered British-owned tanker &quot;York Marine&quot; had also\beep/^

attacked,  fortunately without casualty.   Dutch and Belgian mi^Jewe-epers

had played a part in helping the Royal Navy clear the remaindei/^rThe


mines from the area.    The fortuitous timing might help in persuading the

Netherlands and Belgium that their naval presence in the Gulf was useful

and should be continued.    Meanwhile, Iraq appeared to have recaptured at

/y|least part of the Fao Peninsula.   The United States were now attempting

-^/)?\ draw a line under the recent actions against Iran.    But the overall

?V\Vfc^uation was unpredictable.    Current military activity would not make

^Xro^ny easier to secure implementation of United Nations Security

&lt;&amp;ctop vl Resolution 598 on which discussions continued in New York.

In ^K^cKssion, it was pointed out that if as expected the new Belgian

Govero^efnt to be formed within the next few weeks were to be of centre-

left ^jJmttLexion, Belgium might find it difficult to keep a naval

contribu&amp;ip&lt;p in the Gulf and her attitude to defence more generally

might became equivocal.

THE FOREIGN ANIHCOmAoNWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Prime Minister of

Denmark, Mr PouI^^Jrroter, had called a general election for 10 May,

following a resoltil^ijw^Qn 14 April in the Danish Parliament which might

preclude visits to TXraiih ports by ships carrying nuclear weapons. This

resolution appeared t&lt;bky kX into question the continued Danish

commitment to the Nortl A vantic Treaty Organisation.    He and the

Secretary of State for Der^J&amp;e had made it clear on 19 April that this

resolution could have se mJ \:onsequences for British ship visits,

because the Government weXx_JX&gt;k-willing to alter the standard policy of

neither confirming nor deny&quot;tj&gt; ^wi ther nuclear weapons were carried.

It was by no means clear tha^M^ochluter would win the election.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENOT^aWed that the 13,500 troops of the

United Kingdom Mobile Force, which^er^e committed to Denmark in

transition to war, could not be sMit^^ exercised there if Royal Navy

ships could not enter Danish portsX^S^^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the killing of Mr Abu

Jihad, the Second in Command to Mr Yasser Araf^*-&gt;in the Palestinian

Liberation Organisation (PLO), at his home in/Vfun^s on 16 April had been

a well prepared operation.   Although Abu Jihaa^.reputation was by no

means blameless, it was thought that he had beerf/redantly attempting to

organise the current Palestinian campaign in theMG^fjyied territories on

a non-violent basis.    Tunisian allegations of Isravri^r^sponsibility for

the killing were unproven, but Israel had made no s^p^eiu^effort to deny

these.   There had been a backlash in the occupied tefVrOoj^s and a

feeling of renewed solidarity with the PLO.    Twenty fiv^^^estinians

had been killed on 16 April and further Palestinian reta^a^on was

likely.    Even if Yasser Arafat were to succeed in keepingv2fo3wf Nthe

temperature among his supporters, the overall effect on th^rt^we

process would not be good and the prospect for current negot ia4j5yg


efforts conducted by the United States Secretary of State, Mr George

&gt;    Shultz, seemed gloomy.    The Soviet attitude would be important. In

2\effect the United States now seemed to be withdrawing into its domestic

/)Vlectoral process.    The Israeli Prime Minister, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, had

--^e^caped serious pressure in Washington.

opinion on the wine 8jr*M2&quot;i.ser until May.    It had been agreed that this

I REVIEW

|y reports

D./yyT^e Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet

(0^8MX about the recommendations of the Pay Review Bodies.

THE P MjL-MINISTER said that the paper was the outcome of a discussion

among ^Je^ninisters most directly concerned with the Review Body

reportsNurses&apos; Review Body had recommended a generous award for

nurses, giving an average increase in pay of 15.3 per cent. Their

recommendation included the implementation of a new grading structure

for nurses directly involved in patient care.   The intention was to

introduce this nes^structure by 31 October.   The new rates would be paid

from the date tlye^Tmw structure was introduced but would then be

backdated to 1 *)^C^rs.so that on the date of payment nurses would

receive a substant/valYlump sum.   All nurses would receive immediate

payments on accouroQ^i^fc per cent.   The award of the Doctors and

Dentists Review Body^BDJi*),  increasing pay by an average 7.9 per cent,

was also generous, es^^a^ly since there were no problems of

recruitment or retentidtw^xv^doctors or dentists.

The proposal was that NaridiralnHealth Service (NHS) awards should be

implemented in full, and th^tO^l the cost of doing so in excess of the

provision already made shoul^^V^et from the Reserve.    This meant

providing an extra  749m in t^aj^increasing the total allocation for

the NHS for 1988-89 over 1987-Stf^Oiearly  2 billion.   The pay of

clinical academics should be set%y &amp;\\n line with the DDRB report and

the increase should also be financ^p^&apos;rpom the Reserve.

For the armed forces, the proposal wfec^y implement in full the award by

the Armed Forces Pay Review Body (AFPRVyO^The cost should be met from

within current provision for this year.^Tor the Top Salaries Review

Body (TSRB) groups, Ministers had concluded that, particularly having

regard to the pay negotiations for the rest of the Civil Service, the

award should be staged, with 4 per cent paid from 1 April and the

remainder from 1 October.    There was a special/problem with the position

of civil servants at Grade 3, who had lost LoiUonWeighting in 1985 but

faced much higher costs if they lived in LondoiTTywTevTSRB should be

asked to give their position consideration in neltt^raK&apos;s report.

Finally, the Ministers concerned had thought it vo&amp;&amp;p&amp; right to accept

the TSRB recommendation that Northern Ireland County/wjjajrc Judges should

be paid as if they were in Grade 5 rather than Grade^^w^ong as they

were required to do significantly different work from thei^counterparts

elsewhere in the United Kingdom. ^Yv^/y

The TSRB report to the Lord President of the Council on MPsJp/ @nsions

and some other matters was being dealt with separately and w^uSM^Yiot be

published until later. ^llys


The proposal was that the Cabinet decision should be announced in a

i   Written Answer that afternoon.    A draft of that answer was attached to

 \C(88)7.

discussion the following main points were made:

 |

Il/y^.     The presentation of the award for nurses was important. Some

C^c^ktics might complain that they were being treated like the TSRB

&lt;/gyrprfps, by getting only a A per cent increase from 1 April and

to wait for the rest until later in the year.    But it should

ri^tf^Ke difficult to deal with such criticism by pointing out that

foiyxi^TSRB groups the Government had imposed a staging of the

Revrew Body&apos;s awards whereas for the nurses it had accepted the

Review Body&apos;s recommendations in full,  including the backdating to

1 April of the substantial pay increases resulting from the

introduction^jQf the new structure.

b. It was\ynpe* ant to make it clear that the new grading

structure for/yfurtjes had been agreed in negotiations between

management an ^*p{^T before the recent industrial action had

started.    It ha^/ran^ been put to the Review Body for them to

recommend the rat^^r^be fixed for the new grades.    This would

make it clear thatvtTXjvbitroduction of the new structure was not a

response to pressureJ/^rre new structure would also help to

dinstinguish the speci^TjtjLrcumstances of the nurses from those of

Non-Review Body groups\jj&gt; efte NHS, who might press for similar

increases.

c. More generally, thercvwa ^&gt;L strong case for the Government to

emphasise in public presentajHTon&gt;T\ow generous its record in dealing

with the nurses had been.    Th^xEnoj^ase in their pay since 1979 -
