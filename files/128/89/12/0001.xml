Corporal Howes in B^f^^K-on the previous Saturday, and their sympathy

for the bereaved.    Thev^rtisted that all possible steps would be taken

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN MELAND said that the detailed

pictures in the media of the horrificMttacks on the two soldiers had

magnified the distress of the bereaved.    He had described to the Cabinet

the previous week the background against whicb_the Chief Constable of

the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) had deci!ffe&quot;a\\that the police should

seek to adopt a low profile in policing theV^junJt&amp;aTs. There had been a

number of reports of anonymous calls from pers/ofis^alaiming to be members

of the security forces and contending that the\g p^f&gt;ity forces could

have intervened more quickly and saved the \ives^J/Uye soldiers. All

these assertions had been investigated, and no sub^j^^iation had been

found for any of them.    In fact, the security force^VwhXle naturally

being alert to the risks of being drawn into a terror i^rjpjkrap, had

reacted with all practicable speed.    His statement in^^pejtouse of

Commons the previous Monday had also been misinterpretexlfc^j^kome

quarters as suggesting that no members of the security fqrt&amp;eAsViad been

anywhere near the scene of the attacks.    The security foro^s^afci, in

fact, been kept available nearby and had reached the bodies^oyrY^fte two


soldiers only a matter of two or three minutes after they had been

murdered.    The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) and the

Independent Television News (ITN) had now agreed,  in response to a

formal demand by the RUC, to hand over their untransmitted films of the

?\ incidents.    He believed they would have been wiser to have released the

^HJJilms immediately that this had been requested by the RUC, and that such

&apos;fa course would have drawn far less attention to the possible risks to

//^Saorters and cameramen who sought to cover terrorist incidents. He

^^upjjdrstood that the relatives of the two soldiers had been outraged by

&lt;t&apos;ne&gt; hitial refusal of the BBC and ITN to hand over their recordings to

trj^p^rikice.    Radio Telefis Eireann had indicated informally that they

woni^willingly pass their untransmitted films to the RUC if they

recey^e^^a request to do so.    The RUC had put in hand a massive

operaVion to correlate all the available evidence: he believed that it

should prove possible to make a number of arrests and bring serious

charges in connection with this appalling incident.

  Proposed Ford

I Factory at

I Dundee

THE SECRETARY SE^KfrE FOR SCOTLAND said that,  following the decision by

Ford to drop the^ ^Bj?pposal to open a factory in Dundee in the face of

the failure of tra^^waions to endorse a single union agreement, the

Trades Union Congre^s*\( JC) had belatedly voted the previous day in

favour of such an agra* HjjKtt.    The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union

(TGWU), which had donepjrfosjtj to block the proposed deal, remained

divided: while the Gene^ai^S^cretary, Mr Todd, had said that he would

refuse to recommend the T^Cvd&amp;tis ion to his members, the shop stewards

at the Ford factory at Dag^n&gt;r^w had made clear that products from the

proposed factory at Dundee Voytaj^not be boycotted there.    Ford appeared

to be genuinely surprised byCthe^^rength of opposition to the

intransigence of the TGWU and Qjrtjy^ groundswell of support for the

proposed factory, and there we re^^OTg- signs that they were beginning to

back away from their previous uncfjj^^cied statement that the decision to

pull out of the Dundee project was /rcj^ocable.    A delegation of trades

unionists, which would include the jjrfneral Secretaries of the TUC and of

the Amalgamated Engineering Union, we*e due to fly to the United States

that day to meet the Ford management.    He doubted whether that

initiative would bear any immediate fruit; the most that could be hoped

for was that the door would not finally be/^foaied on the project. The

recent industrial action by Ford workers wia(s bVund to have damaged the

case for opening a factory at Dundee, and inwJuM not be unreasonable

for the Ford management to be sceptical of tn^JSy&amp;s ability to keep

individual trades union elements in check. ^1 Is\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that,  following a confused

workplace meeting, the Transport and General Workers&apos;  Union (TGWU) were

ballotting their members at Land Rover on a revised pay offer which had

been negotiated under the auspices of the Advisory, Conciliation and

\. Arbitration Service.    The result of the ballot was due to be announced

/on the following Saturday and it appeared probable that the workforce

^^ould vote in favour of a return to work.   The revised offer contained

^fcAadditional money and the workforce would therefore have gained

o&lt;*|&amp;&amp;ng by their strike action.    Workers at Jaguar had voted by a

inas^&amp;e majority at a mass meeting at the Coventry plant the previous

dW^jrC^favour of strike action over plans to increase production there.

Thevmrlp*s would ballot their members on the issue, but he did not

belx^^that strike action was imminent.

Industrial

Action at

p&amp;O European

Ferries

THE SECRETAM&apos;oj) STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that P&amp;O European Ferries and

the Nationar^o&lt;f5rx of Seamen (NUS) had been negotiating under the

auspices of thf^ Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service in an

attempt to setts^34ye strike action which had been affecting the

movement of ferrYe^^^Dover.    P&amp;O would seek an injunction against the

NUS the following CiM^Kd it appeared that the NUS&apos;s tactics were to

string out the neg&lt;3risui&gt;mis until the outcome of P&amp;O&apos;s legal action was

known.    The overall njff&amp;^SS1 remained fluid and confused.    The NUS&apos;s

position had been weak rfed)Jas a result of the agreement to P&amp;O&apos;s

proposals by representaViw^oof ships&apos; officers.    He understood that

lorries were being delaye^f\pjp up to 16 hours at Dover but that cars

were passing through withow^^i:gnificant delay.

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, referring to the meeting in

Washington on 21-23 March between the United-Spates Secretary of State,

Mr George Shultz, and the Soviet Foreign M/nisner, Mr Eduard

Shevardnadze, said that preparations were VJg^tpWHiing for the Summit

meeting between the United States President, f&amp;rkinald Reagan, and the

General Secretary of the Communist Party of txg^S^v^iet Union, Mr Mikhail

Gorbachev, which would take place from 29 May t^l/^ne.    Among the

subjects which had been discussed in Washington wa /Gte situation in

Afghanistan.    American proposals for a aoratorium&lt; fr^^iet military

assistance to the Afghan regime of Mr Mohammed NajibxtwJ^Nso far not

proved acceptable to the Soviet side but they remainM^on)jthe table.

There was no reason to suppose that the prospect of wr^hjJjMVal of Soviet

troops from Afghanistan had receded.    The two Foreign M^iskrors had also

discussed in Washington the war between Iran and Iraq.       &gt;J*af clear

that the prospects of a second arms embargo resolution at ^tn^-jfoited

Nations had been set back by the resumption by Iran and Ira^^Ondssile


attacks against cities, and also by Iraqi use of chemical weapons in the

war.    he had taken up this latter point with the Iraqi Foreign Minister,

k      Mr Tariq Aziz, who had defended Iraq&apos;s action by saying that if she were

&apos;J     under attack by a more powerful neighbour no military response could be

ruled out.    Nevertheless, this development did not help the atmosphere

*^Vof current discussions in the United Nations framework and made it much

VX^ftarder to secure an arms embargo.    The current mood in New York was one

^*^c&gt;i^xasperation on all sides.

Soviet

Armenia

CC(88) 8.3

THE &lt;S4  iGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Supreme Soviet had

met tt&amp; day before under the chairmanship of President Andrei Gromyko to

discuss unrest in Armenia and Azerbaidjan.    Since the previous

discussion in Cabinet on 1 march subsequent information and events,

including dramatic media coverage, had shown that the disturbances had

been more sayfouk than at first realised.    The Soviet authorities had

admitted 32 ^dapfts&gt;, while unofficially the figure was put in the

hundreds.    Som//aemtanstrations had since resumed in the region. It

remained to be^e^K^hether there would be further major disturbances at

the end of the wsjjtf^jhrjen the moratorium on demonstrations declared by

the organisers wouAjP^Xire.    No fresh measures had been announced by

the Soviet authorit^s^VIt was fortunate for Mr Gorbachev and for the

cause of glasnost that/Of** first major nationality crisis had not been

anti-Russian or anti-S^6*eDj    There was reason to suppose that the

personal instincts both\k x?H\Gorbachev and of Mr Shevardnadze (who had

run Georgia for 13 years ^n&amp;fcaaimed to have introduced multi-lingual

education there) were in rt^e&gt;&lt;firection of greater tolerance toward the

other nationalities within tfaffj&amp;foiet Union.    But the problem of coping

with the minority peoples remainj 4\yery real.

I Central

I America

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRET/ffiff said that a ceasefire had been

negotiated between the Sandinista Government of President Daniel Ortega

and the Contra forces in Nicaragua.    This had followed withdrawal from

Honduras of Sandinista forces after failure to destroy the Contra supply

depot there which had been the objective of/^tfrair incursion.    At the

same time, the Contra forces felt themselve\Awe kened as a result of

loss of American aid following decisions by CHpTTyited States Congress;

and therefore had no option but to agree to a\Wara^4ire.    In the

continuing discussions the Sandinista Governmenrx^fajmed to be

fulfilling their commitments on press freedom.    Itf^p^mained to be seen

whether they could be taken at their word over thi y^v

Agricuf^p^\

Stabiliset^O

4.      THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that some

progress had been made at the most recent meeting of the Special

Committee on Agriculture in resolving outstanding issues on the

stabiliser package and in particular the wine stabiliser.    On the latter

^point, the February European Council had agreed that the compulsory

?&quot;distillation price should be made &quot;truly deterrent&quot;.    The proposals put

Mforward initially by the Commissioner had been correspondingly severe,

countries were determined to weaken these but revised proposals

trfpl^d by the Presidency remained consistent with the European Council

contusions.    It was not yet clear if moves would be made to weaken them

tc^trC^a)iacceptable extent at the meeting of the Agriculture Council on

28-ZYyMa^ch when it was hoped to reach agreement on the stabiliser

packa^Kas a whole.    In a brief discussion, it was noted that it should

be mad^clear to other member countries that if they weakened parts of

the stabilisers, other countries would want to unpick other parts, for

example the United Kingdom would want to reopen the sheepmeat regime.

Unacceptable/^JEbjposals for weakening the wine stabilisers should

therefore b/nre^).sted, even if ultimately the whole package had to be

referred bacKTt^^Se next Council meeting at Hanover.

THE MINISTER FOR-^aftcULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD, reporting on his

recent visit to ma/^^ted States and Canada, said that he had

encountered some sx^pMoism about the extent to which the decisions

reached at the Europea\MB$&gt;unc il would be strong enough to deter

agricultural producti^r^V^Ahough there had been widespread appreciation

of the United Kingdom&apos;^?rol^ in the negotiations, not least in relation

to the oils and fats taV-i^s^u*.    He believed that he had had some

success in getting over me^OTJit that the new commodity regimes were

tougher.    The severity of vj^^tfecisions reached on the oilseeds

stabiliser had for example x\cM^G&amp;n fully understood at the outset. A

second major theme in his visM&apos;tJra^been the prospects for the mid-term

review in the Uruguay Round ofMfegp^iations under the General Agreement

on Tariffs and Trade (GATT).    Al&lt;^g^gjv he was not himself

over-optimistic about this the UnxfcS^States Administration attached a

good deal of importance to inclusid^^r^an adequate agricultural element

in the package.    United States farme\N5 were used to the levels of

support provided by the 1985 farm bill which came up for renegotiation

next year.    If sufficient progress had not been made in the GATT

discussions the danger would be maintenance       support levels and

inclusion by the Congress of a strong expo/t^ehjiancement programme in

the successor bill. \Sa/-n

I Airbus

I Industrie

THE MINISTER FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that very^^^e progress had

been made in the Economic Community-United States taLkJPxfn Airbus on

18 March.    The United States Administration appeared i^tjike the view

that faster progress would be possible after the FrencSr^ p&lt;?&amp; ions. But

it was by no means clear that French objections to consrarao&apos;Cs on

support levels would be any different after the electionsOv yyl

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the meeting on

21 March of the Environment Council had not gone well.    The German

Presidency and the Commission had sought to isolate the United Kingdom

on the question of controls over sulphur emissions from large combustion

^plants.    In particular, the Germans had proposed the establishment of a

/fO megawatt threshold rather than the 100 megawatt threshold proposed by

^Ahe Danish Presidency.    In a brief discussion it was noted that controls

otfeye being built into new United Kingdom combustion plant and a very

a^jrtyasive retrofit programme was already being undertaken.    The German

^rp^jereals were not cost-effective and the large sums of money involved

cMyrtt^Ge spent in other ways with greater effect on the environment.

FurraVr^ork would be needed to find a basis for agreement at the next

Counirvi^:    Meanwhile it would be important to arrange for adequate public

presentation of the United Kingdom position.
