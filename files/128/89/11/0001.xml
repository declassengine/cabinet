THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that on the following Tuesday the House of

Lords would cons^3^r the reversal by the House of Commons of the

amendment made (to tyie Local Government Bill in the House of Lords,

enabling local aui#j ?3s.t ies to question potential contractors about their

treatment of disaMejjApersons.    The Opposition would make a serious

attempt to reinsert yfaff amendment, and every effort would be made to

mobilise Government Vu^ ^ters in the House of Lords against it.

2.     THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ROR^S^N IRELAND said that a serious

incident had taken place the prevfmis^Wy during the funeral in Belfast

of the three Irish terrorists who hM^bgS^ shot on Sunday 6 March in

Gibraltar, where they had been engageayyia^bombing attack.    There had

been considerable anxiety before the fofn^rlils that the Provisional Irish

Republican Army (PIRA) would do their utmost to exploit the occasion,

but assurances had been received through the Roman Catholic Church that

there would be no paramilitary display and that the funerals would be

conducted in a proper and orderly fashion.    In jtfj^vlight of these

assurances the Chief Constable of the Royal Ulfeter^Constabulary (RUC)

had decided that the police presence at the fun 2 r^fi^8hould be kept at a

low and unobtrusive level.    This decision, which We^slieved to have

been the right one, led to the funerals initially^tef^Lg place in an

orderly way, and without the risk of unwelcome coveragp^ja the media of

the police being involved in scuffles with those esccw?Mn othe coffins.

However, an unexpected act of violence had then taken pla^e^hen a man

had thrown a number of fragmentation grenades at the mou^ ^! oand also

opened fire with a pistol, killing three people and injur\&lt;(gAearly 70.

The man responsible for the attack had been beaten unconscror^ ^b\

members of the crowd before he was taken into custody by the\^06^ nd he

was now detained in hospital.    The RUC had also taken another^raHj^into

custody in connection with the incident.    There was some reason Aj^yv

suppose that the attacker was mentally unstable, and both men wereyV^


thought to have previously had no more than distant connections with

paramilitary organisations, although questions arose over the means by

\  which they had obtained their weapons.    Sinn Fein, who had vehemently

/^attacked the RUC for the policing of previous funerals, had attempted to

zvroake capital out of the incident by alleging that the low level of

^Op&gt;vlicing on this occasion was the result of sinister collusion between

^&gt;yVfik&gt;RUC and Protestant extremists, but this allegation had been

jfrp^OAated by responsible opinion among the nationalist community. The

Cni ^\pnstable would now need to consider whether it would be

prsctic^rble to maintain that approach to the policing of a number of

sens^W^funerals over the next few days.    It was possible that the

PIRA mMTTT/fcry to make a display at these but it would be very welcome

if the &gt;Ryv/were able to maintain a low profile approach.    He had issued

a statemakt calling for calm and restraint in the immediate aftermath of

the incident, and would make a further statement to the House of Commons

that afternoon.    Bishop Cahal Daly,  the Bishop of Down and Connor, had

told him, in pri^afce conversation,  that he shared his revulsion at the

sermons preached by)    Roman Catholic priests over two of the terrorists

shot in GibraltaSy&lt;i5\which the terrorists were represented as the

innocent victims o(ro* icially condoned murder.    It could be expected

that the Bishop woVtjK^eek to restrain such sermons in future.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOk\EJPKCtf MENT said that the unemployment figures

for February would be publlsTjejK^vtoat day.   The seasonally-adjusted total

had fallen by about 33,000 ihAJaVa^ry to 2.531 million,  the lowest

figure for 6 years.    Unemployra^p&lt;^h^d fallen by about 400,000 since

June 1987 and by about 680,000 in^rn&lt; \19 months since unemployment had

begun to fall.    The largest reducti^Jrevhad been in the West Midlands,

where the rate was below 10 per cent the first time since April

1981, the North West, the North and ^^^^   Unemployment stood at

9.1 per cent which was below the levelsv^jE/JMny  f our major European

competitors, including France, Belgium^fta the Netherlands. Unfilled

vacancies at jobcentres stood at a little^under 250,000. This

represented only about one-third of the number of vacancies in the

economy as a whole.    The overall position continued to be very

encouraging.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said tharTZlk^eroerat ions had

been postponed as a result of industrial action in the^&amp;^Ti^nal Health

Service on Monday and Tuesday of that week, bringing the rmjj&amp;er of

operations postponed in England since the beginning of Fe&amp;rualyt to 737.

He understood that industrial action by Scottish health wo^tej/^in

recent weeks had also caused the postponement of a significao^^Mber of

operations in Scotland. xS^W

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the Civil and

Public Servants Association had ballotted their members in Department of

^Health and Social Security offices, with a view to indefinite strike

/action from the middle of that month.    On a turnout of a little under

per cent, union members had voted by two to one against industrial

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, although strike action

by employees at/fia&amp;d Rover was continuing,  there was increasing pressure

on the Transporl/ariji General Workers&apos; Union (TGWU) to reach a

settlement:    some-^mp^pyees had already returned to work; and Peugeot

were reported to l _c^Aiidering withholding their contract for

gearboxes.   The TGWTJ^Wposed to take disciplinary action against

employees who had retuTKj ^\to work.    That development underscored the

importance of the prov^^sn^ in the Employment Bill which would prohibit

disciplinary action of thajx^ature.   The Land Rover management had made

clear that they would not^w e&quot;PAase tneir Pav offer.

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRET^p^aid that the prospects of

clemency being granted to the six Afric&amp;urheld responsible for the

murder in Sharpeville in 1984 of a black^f rican deputy mayor (the

Sharpeville Six) were at best slim.   The Government had done its best to

help.    This was an exceptional case involving allegations of torture and

a widely criticised interpretation of the legal/^owsept of common

purpose.    The Parliamentary Opposition in the iJm^eaKingdom were making

a lot if it, partly motivated by a desire to scoS-e^Joyitical points

here.    The Prime Minister&apos;s intervention on 15 MaMJb^raA done much to

take the wind out of the Opposition&apos;s sails.    The \a$ dtnews was of a

bomb at Krugersdorp which had killed three people ana ^rj^mxugh it was

not clear who was responsible, it made the possibility^^JsAcSbemency for

the Sharpeville Six even more unlikely.    Execution of the a^^might

spark a new flurry of pressure on sanctions.    The United Ymfeftym was

well placed to resist this, but possible action in the Unit^d^^&amp;tes

Congress over the Wise Bill could force withdrawal of interna-O&amp;r^J. oil

companies from South Africa. ^^&lt;^f)

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the visit to the United

States of the Prime Minister of Israel, Mr Yitzhak Shamir, was now

\ nearly over, with the final outcome unclear.   The differences between

//&apos;Mr Shamir and the United States Secretary of State, Mr George Shultz,

y^xkre now out in the open:    these related essentially to Mr Shamir&apos;s

C^e&gt;istance on the question of an international conference, on the

V^Jrfcfopsed close linkage between phases of Mr Shultz&apos;s peace plan and on

t/i /f&gt;&lt;Ninciple of exchanging land for peace.   Mr Shamir&apos;s attitude in

bioc^o-^g progress on these issues was now clear to everybody including

the^Jejo^h community in the United States.    There was a greater prospect

of eM^j^lections in Israel.

THE FOR&amp;K^fAND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said he had given lunch on

15 Marchw) the Committee of Seven of the Arab League, which had been a

good meeting.    The Arab side had clearly recognised the need to prevent

escalation of violence in the occupied territories and had claimed that

the Palestinian^^i^eration Organisation (PLO) were helping to ensure

restraint.    Th/y had stressed for example that no Israeli deaths had

been reported. ^Efe^E^.ew that they must not be seen to scotch the

American peace plan. JyThe inclusion in the group of Mr Walid Khalidi,

who was not a membV^ I/the PLO, had provided a moderate and effective

expression of the Pana&apos;jfe^iian point of view.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAL^H-^^ETARY said he had discussed with the

Iraqi Foreign Minister, Mr Ta^Oq&gt;jMiz, on 15 March latest developments

in the Persian Gulf.    Mr Az i z^&amp;^ot ihpwn appreciation of United Kingdom

efforts in mobilising the follow/e^resolution in the United Nations

Security Council while complainirfg o ^ranian delaying tactics.    He had

told Mr Aziz that the prospects in^he-^ecurity Council had been good

until Iraq had renewed the &quot;war of twg^eities&apos;&apos;.    He had pointed out that

Iraqi action had let the Russians anS^ra^r Iranians off the arms embargo

hook; and had urged restraint on Iraq.\ Mp/Aziz had defended the Iraqi

actions while acknowledging their adversA. impact on United Nations

negotiations.

He had thanked Mr Aziz for the release from prison^in Iraq of Mr John

Smith and had requested similar clemency for Mr/lara Richter. In

discussion, it was noted that while conditions vETM^S&amp;ch prisoners in

Iraq were now less cruel than they had been at thre^oyoset, great

self-discipline was required of British prisoners^E^ e/able to survive

the experience.    Quiet and patient efforts on theirvBaVa^f were more

likely to succeed than high profile publicity. ^X\V\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEATLH SECRETARY said that the United Nations

Security Council would be meeting later that day at Argentine request.

The United Kingdom had been lobbying actively.    Following his

) intervention with the United States Secretary of State, Mr George

 &lt;&amp;hultz, Argentina had been successfully discouraged from tabling a

VreXolution, although she would no doubt receive some support in the

&gt;y*ws/cussions which would take place.    Meanwhile the military

^Efitytarcement exercise &quot;Fire Focus&quot; had reached the point of greatest

resk/ X regards the possible diversion to Latin American airports by

Br fc^shOnilitary aircraft getting into difficulties en route to the

Fa lk^^d^e lands.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY recalled that Signor Giovanni

Goria had resignetKon 11 March from the position of Italian Prime

Minister.    The (President, Signor Francesco Cossiga, had asked

Signor Ciriaco ofebKE&amp;v to form a government.    Signor de Mita lacked

Ministerial experi/ncd) but apparently not political enemies.    It was

not yet clear whetn *J%e/would be able to restore a measure of

stability. ^Ksy\

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR^T^^^^ND INDUSTRY, reporting on his visit to

Japan, said that he had pursuva^h&gt;e\ Scotch whisky issue and also the

question of acquisition of a fo^Hferr-two seats on the Tokyo Stock

Exchange.    The former had been heA /wyby delays in the tax reform bill

but he believed would be satisfacYoci^j^resolved in the course of that

year.    He expected the question of &gt;aadi $onal Stock Exchange seats to be

settled within the next few months. MjuVjSfg his visit, two significant

Japanese investments in the United KingyomlMd been announced, both

without the offer of any United Kingdom^r  istance.    In the other

direction, Guinness had during his visit^Announced their intention to

set up a new company in Japan and Coates/Viyella were building a

factory on a greenfield site there.    In general, Japanese market

potential was now approaching that of the United/JJ&amp;ates and their was a

new willingness to buy imported goods.    Althougf/Br$)tish exports had

increased substantially, we still needed to expT 3&gt;6&lt;^i^is export

opportunity more effectively:  for example German q^^sLes greatly

exceeded British ones.    In a brief discussion it waV-^robed that the

severe shortage of land with which very high house prri^Aiere likely to

create social and economic problems.    Comparisons withM^O^ited States

reflecting the dollar/yen rate should be made with care: orr^L^purchasing

power parity basis United States living standards remaine ort H\ ahead.
