LO^WTELAW

1.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet were saddened by Lord

Whitelaw&apos;s resignation, on health grounds, earlier that week. Lord

Whitelaw had made an immense and unique contribution to the political

life of this country, and to the success of the Government. Her

colleagues would wish to join her in acknowledging his achievements, his

^wise counsel, and the warmth and friendliness that he had brought to all

fmis work in government.

y^^The Cabinet -

^^Mprmly endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks, and instructed the

^^Zecretary of the Cabinet to arrange for them to be conveyed to

v ^ u Whitelaw.

The National

Health

Service

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR S^efA&amp;iERVICES said that he had the previous

day seen the Presidents of the^froy^k Colleges of Physicians, of Surgeons

and of Obstetricians and GynaecaJpjjU^Jts to discuss spending on the

health service.    He had made it ctEa^/to them that the published public

expenditure figures already committre / $ie Government to significant

additional spending on health and h^Mmad not offered any commitment of

public funds beyond that.    He had als  drawn the Presidents&apos; attention

to the importance that the Government placed on generating other new

resources for health spending, as indicated by the Health and Medicines

Bill currently before Parliament.    He had a^Ceyi for the three

Presidents&apos; thoughts on all these matters,\knd^ji  would revert to these

topics in his speech in the debate the follow/WgjJjeek on an Opposition

motion on the health service. v^iXO

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion/^r&amp;d that the

Government had made a huge extra investment in the&lt;^m&amp;Mh service, and

had a very good story to tell.    The boundaries of prap-O^able medical

treatment were, however, constantly expanding, so crade^yVferly figures

on such matters as waiting-lists did not compare 1 ike^i*j^iake.

Another factor bearing on waiting-lists was likely to be^fe^e\phanging

practice of general practitioners, who now referred many^^aw^ahts to

hospitals whom they would formerly have treated themselvesv&apos;y^Harftpitals

also varied in the efficiency with which they managed occuparvcy^yit was


easy for the true picture to become distorted among so many variables.

Simple, easily understood factual indicators of the genuine improvement

in the health services should be developed, to help the Government

* maintain a consistent and positive approach.

&gt;/\      The Cabinet -

/y&apos;A 1.     Invited the Secretary of State for Social Services to be

&gt;^/\*mided by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussion.

Hong Kong

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the debate the

following week on the White Paper on the Annual Report on Hong Kong

would require careful handling.    It would raise the sensitive issue of

the prospects^f&amp;r direct elections in Hong Kong before 1997, but the

Government wquld^Jnot be able to make any announcement about this in

advance of th D&gt;irtvE&gt;\ication by the Hong Kong Government the following

month of a Whit  Paper on the subject.    He was taking steps to ensure

that the OpposiVi^ryspokesmen on foreign affairs were aware of the

position.    He habV&amp;^K&amp;ed the agreement of the Government of China to

make provision in wrj^fiviaw for direct elections, but great care would

need to be taken to^neujpp that this agreement held firm.

Bill

THE HOME SECRETARY said th^t^fcfyehandling of the following day&apos;s debate

on the Second Reading of Mr RaM^W Shepherd&apos;s Protection of Official

Information Bill was bound toM&gt;e/jJ^f f icult.    He had sought to explain to

Government supporters and the riwrai^K^that Ministers had for some time

been engaged in good faith in a ^yt a rious examination of the best way

to reform Section 2 of the Officii ets Act and that it was intended

to publish a White Paper in June wi4a&gt;^*&apos;view to early legislation

thereafter.    He had particualrly emphasised to Government supporters

that it was important that the Bill should not make progress since

discussion of a Bill of this nature in Standing Committee would be bound

to be dominated by those who would use the occasion to raise issues

relating to security. ((l)

4.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment

figures for December would be published that day.   The seasonally

adjusted total had fallen by about 35,400 since October.    This was the

18th consecutive month in which this total had fallen, with unemployment

\having fallen by over 500,000 in the previous 12 months and over 300,000

]p.n the previous 6 months.    Unemployment had continued to fall throughout

Whe country, with the largest reductions occurring in the West Midlands,

lptort*s, the North West and the North.    The rate of unemployment was now

jM^\^ that of many other European countries, including France, Belgium,

wfeNetherlands, Spain and the Republic of Ireland.    The unadjusted

toM^-^pad risen by about 10,000 in December, but this was attributable

toVsfesonal factors.   The employed labour force had grown by 84,000 in

the t)(yp  quarter of 1987.    Unfilled vacancies at job centres had fallen

by 11^600 in December; but it was doubtful whether this reflected any

real reduction in the number of vancancies in the economy as a whole.

A matter for concern was that average earnings had increased for the

second successive month and now stood at 8V4 per cent.    It was

important thattne growth in earnings should be restrained so as to

avoid underm\^ng^the otherwise excellent prospects for employment.

FOREIGN

JAFFAIRS

Afghanistan

5.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMtfH^^TH SECRETARY said that there was a lot of

diplomatic activity follow^pg/lMe visit of Mr Armacost of the United

States State Department to ra^pB^n.    The Soviet Union had claimed a

military success in relievingC^nexrown of Khost, wfiich had been under

siege by the Afghan resistance&lt;^Wh^ever the truth of this claim, the

Soviet forces in Afghanistan wers^jtsmdex sustained pressure from the

resistance.    The Soviet Union ha&lt;K ^^named May 1988 for the start of a

withdrawal.    But a cautious view ofAgW^t intentions remained in order.

Although the Soviet Union might wishv^o bring its forces out of

Afghanistan, its tactic might be to make that dependent on an end to

Western and Pakistani &quot;interference&quot; in the country and on the behaviour

of the resistance.

Israel and

the Occupied

Territories

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thai^^&amp;ion in the

territories occupied by Israel had been growing s/njra^Iate 1987. Some

35 Palestinians had been killed there since early ^ra^er. The

disturbances were probably spontaneous.    Attitudes on^J&amp;fh sides were

hardening.    The United Kingdom had urged Israel not b&amp;^pfoteed with the

deportation of Palestinians from the occupied territon^ea^and this

position had been endorsed by the United Nations Securit#^3o^ncil on

5 January.    Israel had nevertheless deported four PalestiXiap^\ The

United Kingdom should maintain a balanced position, advoca^raV^an

international conference on the Arab/Israel problem, and urgfiflg &gt;\e


Palestinians as well as the Israelis to renounce violence.   That had

been the position put forward by the Minister of State, Foreign and

Commonwealth Office (Mr David Mellor).    There had been some adverse

reactions to this during Mr Mellor&apos;s visit to the area; but the

-A. comparison made by some Israelis between the occupied territories and

C\Jlorthern Ireland was untenable, since Northern Ireland was part of the

j/&lt;ftiited Kingdom.

(^Xn^\s cuss ion, the view was expressed that the British position had been

m^aexslear and that we should watch events before deciding what further

sta^jef^ents might be needed.

Hostages in

Lebanon

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 27.2

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that no purpose would be

served by the Government&apos;s drawing attention to the first anniversary on

20 January of^th^v taking hostage of the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s

Special EnvovC Mv Terry Waite.    There were possibly two other British

hostages in LerajrOTxNand one dual Irish/British national.   There was no

public pressureUojj/Kbe Government to change its policy of making no

concession to ter&amp;dwirets.    If anything, support for the Government&apos;s

position was growirLg^x&amp;eports in the press that the Church of England

had paid out over CM^flOO^ in an attempt to obtain Mr Waite&apos;s freedom

were misleading; the mopte^Jiad been intended to cover expenses incurred

by intermediaries.    Th^P^fcagn and Commonwealth Office had advised

against this arrangemen\A^j&lt;jAch now had been abandoned by the Church of

England.   Meanwhile, there/5w^\still n  reliable information on

Mr Waite&apos;s whereabouts. \v/0

In discussion, it was agreed {Qjirtwie Government should if necessary

state publicly that it had advis^^he Church of England not to deal

with the intermediaries to whom^he^rfoney had been paid.    It was noted

that Sinn Fein had tried unsucces^torfi^ at Christmas to obtain the

release from Lebanon of the hostageXr^avMg dual Irish/British

nationality.

I Reference:

I CC(87) 34.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said^ha^ he had just returned

from a useful visit to Japan, where he had rteld^fe^lks with the Prime

Minister, Mr Noboru Takeshita, as well as witHYt^yMinisters of Foreign

Affairs and Finance and others.    He had pressea~-ftyj&gt;Ajpeness in the

trading policies of Japan and for a sense of sharey^^sponsibility in

dealing with problems of balance in the world ecorVa^f^XHe had pressed

for reform of the system of agricultural subsidies^nyja^an.    On this,

the Japanese Government faced political problems simi&lt;fej ^o those in

Western Europe and North America.    He had also raised wTey roblem of

Japanese descrimination against imports of whisky, and o&amp;^Gwed an

undertaking that Japan would put forward detailed proposav^vtjKimplement

the recommendations made by a panel of the General Agreeraewp^jn Tariffs

and Trade (GATT).    An example of Japan&apos;s continued insensitiy^ y &gt;n the


question of opening its domestic market was that Mr Takeshita had

announced that United States firms would be allowed to bid for contracts

in the public sector in Japan but had not alluded to the interest of

other non-Japanese firms in such contracts.    Meanwhile, British exports

to Japan were increasing significantly. Mr Takeshita would probably

^visit the United Kingdom before the Seven Power Summit in Toronto in

/June 1988.    The United Kingdom should keep up the pressure on Japan for

ZWe reasonable economic policies, taking advantge of its position as

/ui^Nleading recipient in Europe of Japanese investment.

Prime

Minister&apos;s

I Visit to

  Kenya and

Nigeria

THE I OE MINISTER said that during her recent visit to Kenya and

Nigeria*she had found the President of Kenya, Mr Daniel arap Moi, and

the Head of State of Nigeria, General Ibrahim Babangida, reasonable and

well-disposed towards the United Kingdom.    Large numbers of people had

turned out L&lt;^s^e the British visitors;  in Kano in Northern Nigeria, the

crowd had r^achai one million.    Her visits had demonstrated three

things.    FirVtyVCrWiy had shown that it was possible to maintain their

friendship and\X s4j/p t of African countries despite the differences of

view on the righE^^ans of seeking the dismantling of apartheid,

provided the views/wjMje- reasonably argued and supported by actions.

Second, both countr^^Ty^re seriously concerned about Soviet activities

in Africa, whether dir&amp;e  or through surrogates.    Third, the two

countries were very cM$  tmentary about the initiative of the Chancellor

of the Exchequer conceMijw^the outstanding debt of poorer African

countries.    The visits hl r&amp;&amp;n well worthwhile.

6.     THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SE^ETARY said that the German

Presidency were not yet effectively co-ordinating the follow-up to the

Copenhagen Summit.    The running had largely been left to the Agriculture

Minister, Herr Kiechle, who appeared to be &gt;r tempting to rewrite the

Danish Presidency package on German lines.f/He^iad discussed the

situation with the Dutch Foreign Minister,^fey^a&amp;s.den Broek and it had

been arranged that the Dutch Prime Minister, O^Lfubbers, should contact

Chancellor Kohl.    The British Ambassador in BdtH*^*ould also be calling

on Chancellor Kohl to follow up the Prime Minisreyf^^letter to him on

the handling of the future financing review.    The^jJn^t^l Kingdom should

take all practical steps to strengthen the position o^rtpderates in the

German Administration.    A number of contacts with ot^J^^^mber states

were also scheduled to take place over coming days. TOieJyiglo-French

Summit on 29 January would be of particular importance&gt;-^/V&quot;\

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that^kg^)rfad had a

meeting with Herr Kiechle on 12 January.    It was clear that /T* rx\Kiechle


envisaged that the meeting of the Agriculture Council on 18-19 January

should not only consider set aside but also reopen the existing

stabliser package with a view to arrangements more in line with German

interests.   He said that he had made clear that any weakening of the

^Copenhagen package would be unacceptable and would mean that a

\/Miuccessful outcome to the Brussels Council would not be possible.

XVihere was some risk that Herr Kiechle would report to his Cabinet

//t^weagues that the majority of member countries would go along with

^G^mkn ideas.    He had reminded Herr Kiechle that agreement at Brussels

v^oulpprequire unanimity.

THE^^RTARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that British Airways

had *jbfygn&amp;e&amp; civilly to the communication from the European Commission

on the\Wrger of British Airways and British Caledonian Airways and he

had some hope that this issue could be so resolved.
