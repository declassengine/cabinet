&apos;w^. PRIME MINISTER said that it was most important that the Government

^*wuld maintain its practice of refusing to make Government time

a/r^table for Private Members&apos; Bills.   Mr Alton and his supporters

snoukj^be left in no doubt that there would be no erosion of that

prae&apos;tip^in respect of the Abortion (Amendment) Bill.   Nor should the

Gove&lt;2Jiiis t\ do anything to encourage the procedure for Private Members&apos;

Bills^^-S^oe-reviewed, by the Procedure Committee or otherwise, as a

result xA/faxe. failure of Mr Alton&apos;s Bill.    While Mr Alton and his

supporteirti were assiduously encouraging the proposition that the failure

of his Bill demonstrated that the procedures for Private Member&apos;s

legislation were inadequate for coping with issues of this kind, the

truth was that tb &gt;j&gt;rocedures were perfectly adequate if the promoter of

a Bill was willfrog^o accept reasonable compromises.   Mr Alton had not

been prepared c^^j^ed in that way:

The Cabinet - &lt;yi/yy

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR T^^j^RONMENT said that there would be a

debate on a Private Member&apos;s Mwfxpri^the following Monday about the

effective application of town an\d^paktry planning legislation. This

would enable the Government spokeejran^&amp;p repeat the gist of a speech

that he had made on the previous Tug$&lt;!ay_to the Conservative Bow Group.

Sections of the press had travestieacS^rtr speech without troubling to

read it: he would circulate the full t *J^ o his colleagues.    In the

speech his main purpose had been to explore the nature of the need that

now existed for a significant increase r  the amount of housing that was

available in the South East, while still respecting environmental

considerations.   This need, which was due to higher numbers of separate

households as a result of changing social habvMTYfcther than migration

into the area, had now become very real and pKssMLg.   The pressures on

suburban areas were becoming intense, and it wasyvSryh bringing out

that   in recent years no less than 55 per cent o&apos;fvjieV/houses in the

South East had been built on re-used or vacant lan^ujLcbdn urban areas.

There was a clear requirement to bring some new land/ijraJVuse for

housing development and those who resisted this were ^prtig^a profound

disservice to their fellow citizens.    Nevertheless, it was^merging that

there was a group of Government supporters who were virMwL*fV\not

prepared to contemplate any housing development in the so^t&amp;4j&gt;rv part of

the country except by way of infilling in urban areas.    AnoJCD^r^ay of

coping with the pressures he had described, albeit not spect&amp;ij*a^fry


directed to the South East, was contained in his proposals for village

housing and new villages which he had recently circulated to

-   colleagues for their comments.

/A^ti discussion the Cabinet noted that the increasing demand for houses in

O^oral areas by people migrating from high-value housing areas was

\^*/yf)cing up the price of rural housing and thus was creating a widespread

^p^ob^em for indigenous lower-income people in rural areas.   The second

qume&amp;t in the proposals that the Secretary of State for the Environment

had/j&amp;Mulated was designed to enable the provision of more lower-cost

housiar^in rural areas in response to this problem.    On the other

handj^tfiflMiisproportionate cost of houses in Southern areas was

increasVffg/^he attractiveness of the North and thus contributing to

the soltnd&amp;n of regional problems.    It was also noted that the policy of

relocating Government activities where this was justified on economic

and management grounds also made its contribution towards relieving

pressure on the South East.

2.     THE SECRETARY OF ST^l^&amp;R EMPLOYMENT said that the strike action

by employees of P &amp; 0 Eur^se^ra/jFerries at Dover had reached a delicate,

and possibly crucial, 8tage./^Jrt\important new factor was the blockade

by lorry drivers, which had x^egW&apos;vin Calais and had spread to Dover.

But for the blockade, the Nati^jraj^Union of Seamen, on which the High

Court had the previous day impo/eJP&apos;aXfurther fine of  150,000 for

contempt of an injunction banning JB^c&gt;Qpdary action, would probably have

called off their secondary action^n^ire previous Tuesday as part of a

deal in which Sealink would have agV&amp;ed^bo employ on a temporary basis

some of the seamen who had been dismTsys^d^hy P &amp; 0.   The blockade at

Calais had now been lifted, but it was-Odjrcertain how long the blockade

at Dover would continue.    While the Dover Harbour Board were legally

empowered to move the vehicles, this could be difficult to achieve in

practice and the police had firmly advised the Board the previous day

against taking this course.   There had been a *jJ5cessful debate on the

dispute in Opposition time the previous day. (( })

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, in ^e^ections to the

national executive of the Civil and Public Services ABSoi^rtion (CPSA),

the results of which had been announced the previous da^VM&amp;itant

Tendency supporters, who had previously been in the majox^tv^)had lost

all their seats.   Mr John Macreadie, the union&apos;s deputy ge  r*^

secretary and a Militant Tendency supporter, was likely to\jfca^^jia.s seat

on the Trades Union Congress General Council later that yearV/^ltor

future, elections to the union&apos;s national executive would be Dy/*^6*et


ballot.    The union&apos;s annual conference had earlier that week overturned

&gt;   the recommendation of the union&apos;s special pay conference that strike

&lt;\ action should be taken against the Government&apos;s pay offer of 4 per cent

0)and had agreed to talks on long-term flexible pay with no preconditions.

T^ &gt;^$ETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the national executive

of ^fie^jpLectrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union had

rejee^^jJ^he findings of a Trades Unions Congress (TUC) inter-union

dispureX^ojmnittee that the union should abandon two single union deals

and hadC^e^used to accept a TUC censure over their actions at News

International at Wapping.    If the membership backed the national

executive, the union might be suspended from the TUC or even expelled

from it.   The union&apos;s General Secretary, Mr Eric Hammond, thought that

the union could wail be outside the TUC by the end of the year but it

was too early ttV&apos;ThYm a judgement on that assessment.

THE HOME SECRETARY sa^^At he would be addressing the Police

dominated by police pay i^j&amp;s, on which the Government would need to

take some important decis^rtf^n.n due course.

3.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRJ^I^R^said that after his election

victory on 8 May, President Mitterrand wid appointed Monsieur Michael

Rocard on 10 May as the new French PrimeVMinister.    President Mitterand

was likely to concentrate on defence and foreign affairs leaving

Monsieur Rocard the major responsibility for economic and social issues.

The result was likely to be a more coherent ptpCeya of Centre-Left

government in France.    Over time President Mi^^rsnd would aim to

strengthen his hold over Centrist parties, andT^MvflaNprobaby call for

new National Assembly elections before or shortl^a^fxer the Summer

Plection

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that following&lt;*W^eneral

election in Denmark on 10 May, the existing four party coal^&amp;iOiad

emerged with the same number of seats as before.   Mr Poul Scra#fi?Aj?&apos;&gt;of

the Conservative Party had lost three seats, while the Liberal^tfaoyv


gained three.   The opposition Social Democrats and Socialist People&apos;s

Party had lost two seats.    Major gains had however been registered by

\ the extreme right-wing Progress Party on a programme opposing

^&apos;immigration and tax.   Mr Schliiter&apos;s chances of re-emerging as Prime

?Oftnister looked good.    The results could be interpreted as in favour of

^^OTVtinuing Danish participation in the North Atlantic Treaty

&apos;^^Bftanisation, which had been a major theme of the campaign.    There was

Lo-kHx*. to be more opposition to increases in Danish defence spending.

Bnt i^ought to be possible to work out an acceptable solution on ship

vi&amp;rts/fb Denmark without compromising the British position on whether

or n&lt;S jB*r j.ear weapons were carried.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Wilfried Martens had

succeeded in forming his eighth government after negotiations lasting

147 days which/wasjaxceptionally long even by Belgian standards. There

would be a coaD^gjiaTr^qf five parties, somewhat more inclined to the left

than before.   The(new)Belgian Government was likely to be pre-occupied

with linguistic preE^m^ at least until the autumn.   A rapid decision

was necessary on whe nOT^fco maintain the Belgian minesweeper

contribution in the p4*^&amp;VyGulf.   Mr Leo Tindemans remained as Foreign

Minister until the end^f^tp* year but it was not at all clear that he

would last thereafter. Xx&gt;v\\

In discussion, it was notejfcfiia&amp;there was now a new Belgian Defence

Minister who was something cror/a^^nknown quantity.   There seemed little

prospect that the new BelgianxEaweyrnment would be any more robust on

defence spending. l^y\

:C(88) 16.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY^*^ that the strike of shipyard

workers at Gdansk had been called off, me result of which would be to

diminish the credibility of the organisation Solidarity in the current

public argument over economic and political reform.    It was possible

that the Polish authorities now had an opportunity to make progress on

the economic reforms necessary for reaching ag/fje&apos;emant with the

International Monetary Fund, but only if they yeye^ijcepared to act

quickly and tolerantly by releasing imprisoned stfrikajleaders. The

United Kingdom and other Community partners, havrtfcgrojeftlored the arrests

and use of violence, would have to continue to undef^^fte^the link

between economic and political reform. ^^\^

CC(88) 8.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Israeli tr&lt;to^ttad now

mostly withdrawn from the Lebanon after their retaliatory irtyjhffijl

which began on 2 May.    An attempt by Lebanon to have a resolu y^&gt;4ssed

by the United Nations Security Council had been vetoed by the WaZxp*^


States.   Meanwhile, there had been fierce clashes in Beirut between the

supporters of the organisations AMAL and Hizbollah, resulting in 150

\ deaths over a four day period.   An uneasy truce had been imposed by

yco-operation between the Syrians and the Iranians.    Such conflict in

&apos;&apos;v^eirut increased the risk for British hostages there, about whom the

P^Gjwiernment remained very concerned.    The Minister of State, Foreign and

^J&amp;mmonwealth Office, had seen relatives and friends of the hostages the

inreVraus day and he himself would be seeing the father of Mr John

ncCmtf$t shortly.   Whilst the families of the British hostages

unae&apos;ra^od the Government&apos;s firm position, it remained necessary to make

clea^Shi^Government&apos; s continuing concern about the British hostages.

Her Maw^tv^s Ambassador at Beirut was currently devoting almost half

his wow i g time to the subject.

In discussion, the question was raised whether, following the

appointment of the new French Government, more details would

emerge about a ital struck by the previous French Prime Minister,

Monsieur Jacquep Chirac, with Iran to secure the release recently of

three French ho&amp;Ca  ^\and also whether the new government would feel

free to renege or^ildjjents of such a deal.

iviet Treaty

irces

&apos; THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA-^^SECRETARY said that a number of unresolved

detailed points had emerge^in) the fine print of the Treaty between the

United States and the SoviVfe-^yn^m on intermediate range nuclear forces

(INF) which both the United^ aj . Administration and the Congress

agreed would need to be resorvy^brefore ratification.    These points had

been taken up by the United Statew/Stfecretary of State, Mr George Shultz,

and his Soviet counterpart, Mr Muara^hevardnadze, on 11 May. Although

he had not yet received any formaF^refWrt, his impression was that it

should indeed be possible to resolv&lt;Pjl*g^2 details provided the

political will was there. ^~y/

In discussion, it was noted that the spred with which the final stages

of the draft Treaty had been negotiated nad always made it likely that

last minute difficulties of this kind would emerge.   They were

legitimate points of difference about the operation of the proposed

on-site inspection regime.    It would never the Yess|i&gt;e very serious if

President Reagan was obliged to go to the forrxtsparjmj Summit in Moscow

without being able to guarantee ratification of meJ^F Treaty, which

would then appear to risk suffering the same fateVa x tte Strategic Arms

Limitation Treaty signed by the United States and wfe^J^viet Union in

The Cabinet - &lt;yyy\

Took note.




4.     THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that an informal meeting of

Community Finance Ministers would take place during the weekend

13-15 May.    It was intended that some further discussion should take

\ place at the meeting of the Commission&apos;s proposals on indirect tax

^/?approximation.   Work would be carried forward on the directive on

^f^JXberalisation of capital movements, on which the Presidency hoped that

\^ufteement could be reached in June.   The meeting would also consider

&lt;^alTp cts of the European Monetary System.    On this issue consideration

wfiMTaAin particular be given to measures to strengthen the operation of

tha^jexvst-ing systen in certain minor respects.   At the other end of the

spectrin a proposal had been floated for the creation of a European

Centi^C^nk.   With the exception of the German Foreign Minister who

would ijatlj&gt; present, it was generally accepted that such ideas were

wholly TTpemature.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the

Agriculture Council would meet on 16-17 May to consider the Commission&apos;s

price fixing prdpSteals for 1988.    He expected the discussions to be

desultory and tmprtductive.    Serious negotiations would not begin before

the meeting of T$je^-  fcncil next month.
