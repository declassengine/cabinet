SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that, during

y^pksideration of the Local Government Bill the previous day, the House

^V^^mmons had reversed the amendment, which had been inserted by the

teoiiSy^Nof Lords against the advice of the Government, which sought to

er^HHe/local authorities to ask questions of potential contractors about

theiv^Gxeatment of the disabled.

THE SECRETARY ^O^STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that on the previous

Thursday a new cl|fusaJon child benefit had been inserted in the Social

Security Bill aga^tr^^She advice of the Government during Report Stage

in the House of Lor&lt; sy^^he new clause required him to review the level

of child benefit ead^Xpwi, but there were no requirements on him to

take further action stieft^^vto uprate the level of child benefit or to

publish a report of his J^^w.    As it stood, therefore, the clause had

no practical effect.    Tho^ovHrnment would clearly need to resist any

amendments which sought tovgiy^Nteeth to the provision.    However, in

view of the importance of ttor^Wvl proceeding to Royal Assent as a

matter of urgency, and to avo^d^any loss of goodwill from those

Government supporters who f avOTra(!a/&amp;be amendment, he had agreed with the

Lord President of the Council an t]^\chief Secretary, Treasury that the

Government should not seek to del^reJrt&gt;e clause when the Bill returned

to the House of Commons the followi^^^day.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief%  tussion, said that the new

clause could clearly not be allowed to\4^and if there were any risk that

it might have some practical effect.    Tire Social Services Secretary

should consult the Attorney General as a matter of urgency to seek his

advice on that matter.

The Cabinet - X3/^~\

1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime &gt;QTJ&gt; s^er1 s summing up

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the Employment Bill was

making good progress in the House of Lords under the stewardship of the

Minister of State for Defence Procurement, Ministry of Defence, and he

expected that it would complete its passage through that House shortly

^fter Easter.

2.      THtr%ECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that, as he had

indicatevat the previous meeting of the Cabinet, he had issued a

statement on the Social Services Committee Report on resourcing the

National Health Service (NHS) to coincide with publication of that

Report.    The SeforaX Services Committee had met the previous evening to

agree the textUof \i reply, which would presumably be critical of the

Government&apos;s pos^MTomand which he understood they hoped to publish

later that day.   \ih M&gt;^des Union Congress had called for a day of

industrial action ojr^We,. following Monday in support of the NHS. It

appeared that a numDe4r^f%unions outside the Health Service, including

the Associated SocierV^a*f^ocomotive Engineers and Firemen, were backing

away from their previous s4$3jaort for the proposed action.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE F01^WA&amp;&amp;  said that the case of the geriatric

ward at St Tydfil&apos;s hospitaT^ff^Jprthyr Tydfil which had been opened by

HM The Queen Mother the prev^ira/April had been raised on numerous

occasions in the House of ComraJ&gt;ry?/^It was an example of a district

health authority seeking to ensap  mat any retrenchments were

concentrated in the most emotional ^M:ovocative areas.    District health

authorities in Wales had in fact bee&lt;^allocated additional funds at the

expense of London and the South EasT^^nr their management tended to be

poor. ^t/S?

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discission, said that, if any illegal

secondary industrial action were forthcoming on the following Monday, it

was to be hoped that employers who had been affected would be prepared

to take legal action against the trades unions/^en^&gt;lved.

Irisons

THE HOME SECRETARY said that, as part of an industriA*^fj&gt;spute at

Pentonville and Wormwood Scrubs prions, prison officex^th^re were

refusing to take in new prisoners in excess of the certiYii(pL normal

accommodation.    That action, coupled with the continuin^Jrocyeases in

the prison population, had made it necessary to accommoda\Re-^Aaund 1500

prisoners each night in police cells.    That was a danger ous-^Sraat ion

and wasteful of resources.    He might need to consider taking\V/*^

disciplinary action in the following week against prison of f i&lt;j2&apos;rre /At the

two prisons concerned.    In his judgment, such an intervention vrojM^avlae


unlikely to provoke any widening of the industrial action to other

&gt;      prisons, though that possibility could not be ruled out.    He would

naturally be in touch with the police and other services which might

//y\ need to be called on to help if prison officers refused to work normally

TH^/Sli^RETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the National Union of

Minew^xexs (NUM) had by a very substantial majority rejected the advice

of ttxg^TOesident of the Union, Mr Scargill, and voted to call off their

overtimaAb^i.    The Scotish coalfields had been one of only three areas

which hrf voted to continue the ban,  in spite of the possible threat to

their jom posed by the plan by the South of Scotland Electricity Board

to run their power stations on imported coal.    The findings by the

National Reference Tribunal, which had been published the previous week,

on the dispute/^eWjeen the National Associaton of Colliery Overmen,

Deputies and SWotfvrers  (NACODS) and British Coal (BC) had effectively

confirmed BC&apos;s pa^oVfer.    NACODS appeared uncertain about what action

to take in responieVAtit NACODS members were now working normally at all

but a few pits.    Th^^/^uation in the coal industry was therefore rather

better than it had Q&amp;eriyg^er recent weeks.    The Chairman of BC,

Sir Robert Haslam, ha^a^o^ clear that the NUM&apos;s overtime ban had cost

BC about  100 million, whvjP^was broadly equivalent to the cost of

Margham. \&lt;/)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLQjMEwX said that the strike action by

warned that, if the strike action corf inued, and their pay offer were

be revised, it would be revised dowl^r^Sa.    The strike action had

attracted very little publicity, evenqn^xe Midlands.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIEN^EV^S that Her Majesty&apos;s

Inspectorate of Schools had published a report elar_lxar* that week about

the General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE&amp;/JThe report,

which was broadly reassuring, suggested that the teaten^^ of many

subjects had improved as a result of the introducticnvpJT&apos;^be GCSE and

that pupils appeared to be better motivated.    However, rn^^eport

recorded some anxieties,  including that certain less ab ^p&lt;l ils were

being overworked and, conversely, that some brighter pupX\s^&gt;exe not

being sufficiently stretched.    His soundings of head teachej^T^Ov public

and private education suggested that they were broadly sat is&amp;rejKVith

the impact of the GCSE and that they believed that there had^^ey/s^

distinct improvements in the teaching and learning of several


subjects,  including sciences, modern languages and classics. However,

history and some other areas clearly required attention, and various

aspects of the GCSE would need to be reviewed after that summer&apos;s

^ examinations.    Once the Education (Reform) Bill came into effect, he

t^would have powers to approve the qualifications and syllabuses offered

the Examining Groups.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said Mat &lt;tfhe North Atlantic

Treaty Organisation Summit in Brussels on 2/3 na^clivlaad resulted in two

very good statements on general policy and on t^fep44^s ^or effective

defence, as well as re-affirming the arms contror~S s rada within the

context of the existing strategy of deterrence.    Tnanm^rtang had been an

impressive demonstration of Alliance unity and had p^^O^d guidance for

Defence Ministers on force modernisation. ^^^&quot;\




THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the British Oxfara

official, Mr Peter Coleridge, who had been kidnapped on 4 March after

apparently photographing a Palestinian camp, had been released on

vN,  8 March, probably as a result of pressure from a local Nasserite leader.

/^The Foreign and Commonwealth Office were dismayed that Mr Coleridge had

?v^Ta^ted without consulting them and without heeding existing consular

O^fVice.    The radical Palestinian organisation, Abu Nidhal, appeared to

^mwd been responsible for the kidnapping.    Since they had on earlier

fottajy\pns murdered British officials in Athens and Bombay, and had also

tak^n^tr Alec Collett hostage, Mr Coleridge was very lucky to have been

relex ^cL particularly as four Abu Nidhal members were held in British

pris^rr^5^/Unfortunately, Mr Coleridge&apos;s release did not seem likely to

providV/&apos;jm^ further insight into the fate of the other two British

hostage^Trlr Terry Waite and Mr John McCarthy.

THE FOREIGN Al(6 COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the &apos;war of the cities&apos;

continued.    Sontey^O^YSissiles had been fired by Iraq and 27 by Iran since

29 February.    TeWr_aV/a d Baghdad were the principal targets, as well as

the Holy City of Qo^V/Bpth sides had reported civilian casualties, but

none of these was BrLrjAhs.    Iraqi resumption of city bombardment had

confused the situatiqg^m^he United Nations Security Council on

Resolution 598, and the J^&amp;ians were seeking to take advantage of this.

The Soviet Union were stf ^s&quot;ying a new Resolution focused on the  &apos;war of

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECR^tL^ said that the United Kingdom,

together with the United States, hai -ttS2h obliged to veto the United

Nations Security Council Resolution crcrvSpAth Africa on 8 March. The

earlier moderate draft resolution tabT^Poy certain African delegations

had,  following tough statements by the^^mth African Government about

restrictions on the receipt of external funds, been strengthened to

include references to mandatory sanctions which we could not accept.

France and the Federal Republic of Germany hacKahstained.    He said that

although there had been some discussion of SdVth(/frica at the informal

meeting of European Community Foreign MinisteV ^ii-^ake Constance on 5/6

March,  it was significant that none of his colle^gyeB^there had sought

to bring pressure on the United Kingdom on the qtre^ * n of sanctions.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at the&lt;Agc^dt informal

colleagues had raised with him the subject of the current 5Xivi) fa

reinforcement exercise to the Falkland Islands, despite the^^t/fchat

the Argentine Government had been lobbying heavily in other Co^^fi^y


capitals for them to do so. It remained to be seen whether Argentina

would pursue the subject in the United Nations Security Council.

^ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that agreement had been

A*achieved at the current Geneva talks on a nine month withdrawal

^Orimetable for Soviet troops from Afganistan, of which a significant

,^P**Uportion would be withdrawn in the early part of this period. But

^ya&amp;xy. was deadlock over the question of an interim Government for

AJ&gt;gnShistan.    Pakistan seemed unlikely to drop the demand for this

unl^efsvand until the United States secured a Soviet commitment to halt

milit^/T aid to the Kabul regime.    A Soviet concession over either the

inte^rfi^&amp;bvernment or the halting of their military aid in parallel with

an endSa4xWestern aid to the Afghan resistance would be necessary in

order t^p^oDtain approval by the United States Congress for any American

guarante^ of a Geneva agreement.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTIT^efe^^RY said that on 26 February the

Panamanian Ambassador in London/^Jtr&apos;CGuillermo Vega, a supporter of

General Manuel Noriega, had termir&gt;^ t$ the appointment of his Consul-

General in London.    After first sVek^g police help in avoiding any

violent confrontation in taking poSkftff^fon  ^ tne consular offices, the

Ambassador had subsequently instructeyya &gt;  curity firm to obtain

repossession of the premises, despite^^Knings from the police.    Late on

7 March members of the security firm armed with pickaxe handles and

wearing paramilitary uniforms had driven a Landrover through the plate

glass windows of the Panamanian Consulate-General.    The police had

subsequently arrested four security guards and-^Qjfee other employees of

the firm.    The Parliamentary Under Secretary rat Sjyate at the Foreign and

Commonwealth Office, Mr Tim Eggar, had summon Jiy^S&gt;vPanamanian

Ambassador on 8 March and asked him to waive hisfown/immunity and that

of members of his staff to enable police investigajjrons and charges to

be brought if necessary.    In response,  the Panamarraa^G^vernment had

waived immunity for questioning and for civil and a&amp;Hpriaps\rative

proceedings while stopping short at the general waiver lw^ired. The

Ambassador had been informed that if the full waiver wa^^Cvreceived by

17.00 hours that day his appointment would be teminated^f^J)

! 4.      THE MINISTER FOR AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the

ficulture Council on 7-9 March had been mainly concerned with carrying

ward consideration of specific texts on stabilisers.    Discussion had

ceeded satisfactorily for most products but disagreements remained on

e&gt;    It had been concluded that the proposals here should be discussed

thejr in the Council on 28 March.    He had made clear, and this had

be^^aKcepted by the Presidency, that a final agreement on other

stabilisers would only be possible when wine was settled and there could

be a^sfKtj&amp;le overall decision on the stabiliser package.

The Min^sxer for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said that the

Agricultiyre Council had also agreed to reinstate the ban on the use of

hormone growth promoters in meat production in the Community.    He had

opposed its reintroduction on a variety of grounds,  including the

likelihood of i^trsVed complaints from the United States about the

effects of theubanvon meat exports and the prospect of retaliation.

However, the Urrrt^dHbingdom had been in a minority of one on this issue.

There had also been/^/sideration of the draft proposal for intervention

stocks of butter to b^O^iovided free to the unemployed.    He had had some

success in getting a^^ared^ of other member states to indicate that they

shared our dislike of sudj*^*.scheme.    It was now possible that it would

not be agreed.    The besC^^t^ysrae would be if the Commission concluded

that it should not bring^orVaj&gt;d a proposal at all.

 OGRAMME

 88/89

5.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Pr^S^elit of the

Council (C(88)5) about the recommendations of The Queen&quot;^Sp^kches and

Future Legislation Committee (QL) on the legislative progrir^jji&lt;*Vfor the

next Session of Parliament. Vv^xO


THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the present Session of

Parliament was an exceptionally heavy one that, despite its early start,

would be bound to run late.    The next Session, therefore, would be

&gt;^musually short, but there was an overriding political requirement for

to accommodate several major Bills that could not be postponed. In

^/^rticular, there would need to be extremely long Bills on the

&apos;/Vip^Atisation of the water and electricity supply industries, and a very

\^ng/measure on local authority housing and capital controls. Against

thf^c background, QL had drawn up the recommended programme at Annex A of

C(8i$ ^wbich contained 16 Bills of medium length or greater.

DisrSg^j^ring the Bills carried over or re-introduced from the previous

Parlia^ja^f that was the same number of medium or longer Bills as had

been approved last July for the present - much longer - Session. QL

were in rrb doubt that a programme of that size was at the outermost

limits of what would be practicable, and it followed that additions

should only be made to the programme if offsetting reductions could be

found to accommo^alje them.    It would, as always, be important for

Ministers in cxvargft-of Bills to take a close interest in their timely

preparation, and/rneYsuccess of the programme would also depend on a

sufficient number^2^?&apos;*^ighty Bills being available for introduction in

the House of Lor&amp;sfs\

The following main po&lt; t^ 5Sre made in discussion -

a.      The Conservatr^^iianifesto for the last General Election had

recognised the need i^-^^d*srnise the system of student support,

though it had not speci&apos;&gt;i&amp;a^ly promised legislation.    The matter

had been under review b&gt;XOrWDepartment of Education and Science

for the last 2 years, anov&apos;Dflre^fc.eview&apos;s recommendations in favour of

a mixed system of grants ai^Tl^aos would be available a little

later in the year.    The Secr^a&apos;npkof State for Education and

Science and the Chancellor of Jrae^gxchequer had virtually reached

agreement in favour of the rev^jS^K/recomraendations, and it would

not be practicable for the Goverrae,)^ to avoid stating its position

on the matter once it was known tMt the review had been completed.

While the introduction of loans wocud increase public expenditure

in the short term, it would lead to significant savings in the

longer term, and represented a major cultural change of the kind

that the Government wished to promote.    TT^vtecretary of State for

Education and Science believed that the tfctav effect of his

proposals would in practice be found to be^atrtrtvkctive by the

Government&apos;s supporters.    Since better-offV arVrt 6 were generally

suspicious of any changes to the student suppp^fe^svstem, however,

it was essential that the introduction of loans/ r&gt;0 &lt;id be timed to

precede the General Election, rather than to coiM^?1y?r it. The

next Session therefore presented the only politicalT^^ alistic

opportunity for legislation on the topic during th^tfpeVtent

Parliament. Y^-^yvN

b.      The privatisation of the Crown Agents also had pai^icu-iar

claims for legislation in the next Session.    The Governm^j*y^&gt;ad

been committed to this privatisation since 1984, and it wc/rJaVtease

to be a credible option if it were postponed beyond the nexL^^y


Session.    If the opportunity of privatisation were not taken, then

legislation would be needed in a later Session for an inferior and

L more expensive option, such as financial reconstruction or winding

&apos;Y\ up the Crown Agents.    On the other hand, the privatisation of the

Crown Agents was not one of the Government&apos;s front rank political

-^O^ priorities.

6/&apos;     London bus deregulation was another matter to which the

//^^Jjovernment was committed and on which the next Session represented

/XtKe only politically sensible time to legislate during the life of

/Represent Parliament.    If the legislation were postponed,

^rt&gt; fccically sensitive questions about such matters as concessionary

far/es^and subsidised bus routes would be brought into public

awareness but not resolved in time for the next London Borough

elections or a possible General Election.

d. Only a very few clauses would be needed to add to the

Elections/&lt;S5S) Bill provisions requiring candidates in Northern

Ireland lWcalVelections to make declarations abjuring support for

proscribeo^-^gamsations or terrorist acts.    These provisions would

be welcomed \by_^cnc Unionist community in Northern Ireland. Their

inclusion couT^Wowever,  lead to the Bill becoming a controversial

measure which ccAppa^not be dealt with under the Second Reading

Committee ProcecW^O^ the House of Commons.

e. The Secretary w^te for Social Services accepted that the

Children and Family raj^/rcves Bill was of higher priority in the

next Session than the jJ*fm p\Fertilisation and Embryology

(Controls) Bill, and heod^/ttot press for the inclusion of the

latter Bill in a programr^o&amp;h^ was loaded as heavily as the Lord

President had described.    Rp/&amp;&amp;heless, the postponement of the

legislation to implement theyj^rogmmendations of the Warnock

Committee would cause serious o^olems for the Government, and he

would circulate a note to his ^^KG^gues about this.

f. The Export Guarantees and Ov^yfeas Investments Bill would be a

very short measure that would saveVabout  10m a year and which was

required to meet accounting conventions.

g. The Antarctic Minerals Bill and the &gt;Rj&amp;&amp;resentation of the

People Bill might both be postponed, though ^oth measures were very

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, s^^^^at the next

Session would inevitably be shorter than usual but^t^^there were a

number of very heavy measures that could not be defeV^gcw) later

Sessions.    The House of Lords was bound to come under pr^s^ure in the

second half of the Session, as the major Bills came up ^rjm^.he House of

Commons.    The Cabinet endorsed QL&apos;s view that the prograrajieAeJ: out at

Annex A to C(88)5 was at the limits of what could be manaVeJ^vaVd

experience indicated that further legislation would becomeMeoiss^ry in

response to court judgments or other unforeseen eventual itiest ^yjrh&gt;e

Cabinet accepted that no significant additions should be made ng^nk


programme that were not accompanied by offsetting reductions, and

reductions of any size would be difficult to find.    The Education

\   (Scotland) Bill would certainly need to be retained in order to

))  accommodate certain provisions being postponed from this Session&apos;s

^^Sill, and to take control of teachers&apos; pay arrangements in Scotland. Of

^^t^e Bills likely to take much Parliamentary time,  it might be that the

\&gt;^ ooadcasting Bill and the Children and Family Services Bill were the

P*&amp;yCtvo that were not required by the Government&apos;s economic strategy or

^oV^acher totally compelling reasons.    The Children and Family Services

Bi&amp;l.,)fc)Dwever, had already been cut to meet QL&apos;s anxieties, and it was

neeij&amp;^pf the proper balance of the programme, while the Broadcasting

Bill^o^Xcained important provisions on programme standards. The

AntarcQ^^Hinerals Bill and the Representation of the People Bill might

both beMdeferred if that helped to accommodate more important measures.

Of the Bills suggested for inclusion,  the Student Support Bill was

clearly the most important,  though its policy had not yet been given

collective consideration:  it should be regarded as the first candidate

for admission/tr^Jhe programme if it received policy approval and if

means could be^ m *d. to accommodate it.    The expansion of the Elections

(Nl) Bill to reqfliAreYeandidates in local elections in Northern Ireland

to make declarat&gt;^rf&amp;^rfiainst terrorism might, on further examination,

prove to have only^Jtaytpr effect on the Parliamentary demands of the

programme.    There wa^x^g&amp;od political case for requiring such

declarations, and the^b^ovPresident and the Lord Privy Seal should

review whether it would b^Kfan age able to expand the Elections (Nl) Bill

to include the relevant^tovYsions.

The Cabinet - &lt;Y\^y&gt;

1. Took note, with approV^i^pf the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up

of the discussion. \r y\

2. Provisionally approved th^lggislative programme for 1988-89

set out in Annex A to C(88)5. ^V^/

3. Agreed that the Student Support Bill should, subject to policy

approval, be recognised as having virst claim for addition to the

programme, but that its inclusion would require offsetting

reductions.

4. Noted that the Antarctic Minerals ailljgiid the Representation

of the People Bill might be deferred to a/afTer\ Session if this

became necessary, as a contribution to any\ka4yp^ions required in

the 1988-89 programme. ^1 /&gt;

5. Invited the Lord President of the Council a^dVc&amp;e Lord Privy

Seal to review the implications of expanding the EC^jJions (Nl)

Bill to include provisions on declarations by can&lt;fea^lfaa, and to

report their conclusions in correspondence.
