1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

(tadon in

Houses

^^XECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that radon was a

vmowE^lly occurring radioactive gas, especially prevalent in Devon and

Co^wajji.    It had been known for some time that radon presented a health

hazaj^P^jumines but it had only been recognised recently that it could

build^^tn domestic dwellings and present a threat to health there.

The boy^a^hat advised the Government on these matters had now

submitt^Vreports advocating various measures and it had been agreed by

the Home vmd Social Affairs Committee earlier that week that the

Government response should be announced as soon as possible.    It would

require nice judgment to gauge the tone of the announcement in a way

that did as lit^t^Xas possible to stimulate other issues bearing on

radioactivityjVAshoVed the Government responding decisively to a

radioactive heaTQv&apos;ITlward, and yet stressed that deaths from cancer in

the areas where vXdod/pas most prevalent were lower than the national

average.    He would i^&amp;yefore welcome the views of the Prime Minister and

other colleagues on far  ^atement,  the text of which he would circulate

shortly.

Sizewell

Inquiry

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR F^R^^said that he would be announcing later

that day,  in a Written Answer ^o^a^arliamentary Question,  that the

report of the inquiry conducted/^y^S^c Frank Layfield into the proposal

for a pressurised water reactor at^&apos;H^well would be published on the

following Monday.    His Answer wouldJ&amp;f that in view of the undertakings

that had been given on the point, tr^r3^^&gt;uld be a Parliamentary Debate

of the report before Ministers took (uxYsj&amp;ns on it.    Until decisions

were taken, members of the Government^&amp;farffId not make public comments on

the matters that were at issue.    He wou^ be writing to his colleagues

to advise them of this.    If colleagues were in any doubt whether topics

on which they had it in mind to speak could be held to be relevant to

the decisions arising on the Sizewell report, b 3te&gt;uld be grateful if

they would consult his office-. (( U

The Cabinet - ((y/-

1.     Took Note.

Social

Security

Legislation

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, owing to an oitrr^^q in the

drafting of an amendment during the passage of the Social S&amp;AU i)w Act,

1986, there was no power to make the new maternity and funera^p*ym|nts

from&apos;the social fund in the way that had been intended under th/r^k^.

If the Act were left unamended, both the financial and politicaT ^^Pf


the Government&apos;s failure to implement its declared policy would be high.

l   The minute of 21 January by the Minister of State, Department of Health

f^and Social Security (Minister for Social Security), which had been

^&quot;&quot;^irculated to the Cabinet, gave more of the background and explained

v8l t the omission of three necessary words from the 1986 Act had come

^^VaMt in dealing with last-minute amendments during the Act&apos;s

VW^r&apos;l&amp;amentary passage:  the mistake had only been exposed very recently

Dyx^fty?tions from the Joint Committee on Statutory Instruments. He

cSuld^ree no alternative to the urgent amending Bill that the Minister

of v a 3 ^sought and, having consulted the business managers, he believed

that^Ws^Aould be enacted to enable the necessary regulations to be in

force %&lt;Xne requested date of 6 April.    The question of including a

provision on the Bill&apos;s application to Northern Ireland was still under

consideration but, on any footing, the Bill would be extremely short and

straightforward.

The Cabi^^)

2.      AgreedfrchaW a Bill to amend the Social Security Act 1986 so as

to enable trVs-jjCa^ng of maternity and funeral payments from the

social fund ifv//7jk }oanner intended should be introduced in the

House of Common^^KckCAx that week.

 he Prepar-

ation of

Legislation

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summingWft^^short discussion, said that the Cabinet

had noted that a number of nefc* / Bi 1 Is had required very extensive

Government amendments during ZnJk/^mxse of their passage.    On some

occasions these had been due to^xha^ffuggestions of outside Counsel

experts in the fields in questioiCf:b^&gt;gh there were also cases when

such advice had been obtained earlj^^o* eh for changes to be made to

Bills before they were introduced. ^B^Ve the machinery for preparing

legislation seemed to be under straing/jme answers were not obvious.

The preparation of Bills required very\iTighly specialised skills and

considerable experience and training.    She would be grateful if the Lord

President of the Council would arrange for these matters to be explored

further and for a report to be submitted to herein due course.

The Cabinet -

3.      Invited the Lord President of the CourV^j*&gt;^A arrange for the

working of the machinery for the preparation ^r^tg^islation to be

considered by the Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future ]/*g^^ation

Committee, on the lines indicated in the Prime ((^(Mfiwr&apos;s summing

up of the discussion, and for a report to be submit^^^to the Prime

Minister in due course. ^v^O/

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the acceptance of the

Government&apos;s offer by union leaders had now been endorsed by a

&apos;ssizeable majority of the members of the largest teachers&apos; union, and

?\Jjere was thus no longer any doubt that the agreement would be ratified.

^2 ls was a satisfactory outcome to the dispute.

 Caterpillars

: (UK) Limited

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the redundancies announced

earlier in the week by Caterpillars (UK) Limited had been a surprising,

as well as mos^wtaelcome, development.    The previous year the company

had reviewed l^s international investment plans and as a result had

announced subsray^aJv new investment in their plant at Uddingston, near

Glasgow, a decisJujn^XyKmly welcomed by the Government which had been

associated with itT^iyt Jiow appeared that another review had been

conducted at the beg/*f&amp; g of the month without the knowledge of the

Government, and as a^y^^x\^ the company had decided to close three of

its plants,  two in the Unj&lt;&amp;d States and also the plant at Uddingston.

This would result in 1, CwfKrVdundancies at the plant itself and 2,000

redundancies overall taklKg_^ count of the effect on sub-contractors.

The decision was a serious~J&amp;orft|\to the area which already had extremely

high levels of unemployment\\,^ s\

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up kr&amp;r&amp;et discussion,  said that the news

was most unwelcome and it was impp-rt&apos;ajjt to mitigate the effects on

morale in the area as much as pos-sib^?.    Scotland often felt that it was

remote from the rest of the United&lt; i g3)Dm and did not feature at the

front of the Government&apos;s concerns.^yywas important to correct this

impression; one way in which it mightvfl^/aone was for non-Scottish

Office Ministers to make more frequentNXcisits to Scotland and to be seen

to do so.

The Cabinet -

1.      Took note, with approval, of the Pri^/Jltnister1 s summing up

of their discussion. (( ))

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL,  said that it was now/  *hg

recognised that events had shown that the Secretary of tfrateHfor Trade

and Industry had been entirely right not to refer the taWaj^ \bid by

BTR pic for Pilkington Brothers pic to the Monopolies and ifer^eVs

Commission.    If he had done so,  there would have been a lengih^period

of delay and uncertainty instead of the quick and eminently sliy feme tor y

outcome that had in fact occurred.    It was most important thatWhi A


point should be stressed in Ministerial speeches and appearances on the

media.    An excellent start had been made by the Secretary of State

) himself in television and radio programmes the previous evening and

yAarlier that day.

&gt;syfl    The Cabinet -

\sv^2\     Endorsed the observations of the Lord President of the

&lt;^ ^&gt;ncil.

AFFAIRS

Monetary

Compensatory

Amounts

3.    THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at the

Agriculture Council on 19-20 January there had been a difficult

discussion and disagreement between France and the Federal Republic of

Germany on the/yfppSNication of monetary compensatory amounts to pigmeat,

poultry and eg&apos;gs- flWrlowing the realignment of currencies within the

European MonetarVVSy^oem.    This had now been resolved in a way which did

not disadvantage &gt;Qke^k^.ted Kingdom.

Distribution

of Free Food

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULT^TOfWSHERIES AND FOOD said that the Commission

had come forward with a pi^g^*r\ for making some food,  in particular

from public intervention s t # kA^ava i 1 ab 1 e free to charities for

distribution to those particfctta^jCy affected by the cold weather. Much

of the action fell within the ^ymi^sion1 s own powers.    The scheme was

not fully worked out nor were t^^impSLementing rules yet available. It

was expected that total expenditu^p&apos;inxthe Community would not exceed

50 million ecu (about  37 million; aj^^hat the arrangements would not

continue beyond the end of March.   ^iJrfrtrgh he had some reservations

about this scheme,  in particular on a&lt;Hnoj&gt;^tration and control, the

Government should give it a fair wind.^tfhe Minister of State, Ministry

of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Mr Gvmmer) was discussing its

operation with the charities best suited to carry it out.    It was a

matter for each member state to decide on the charities which might

distribute the food.    The charities themselvea^Je^e enthusiastic, and

would probably try to fit the&apos; distribution in!4 tlteir existing schemes

for helping the needy. ^^^^^^

In discussion it was said that it was important to J  *y&amp; rlear that this

action was not a way of solving the agricultural surrffjj^vroblem, since

it would involve only a very small part of Community^^tfT^ention stocks

now valued at about 11 billion ecu (about  8 billion).   Yj^ftould be

unfortunate if, under the mistaken assumption that this wjJ^SlX solve some

of the Community&apos;s agricultural surplus problems,  there ww^/ fiessures

to extend the scheme more widely.    These problems required p  ?^action

to restrain the flow of goods into the intervention stores.NNlV^i^s also

still far from clear what expenditure might be incurred on tr^&amp;%o^p and

distribution and this expenditure could be substantial.

Reference: \

CC(87) 1.4

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Budget Council on

^ 16-17 January had not reached agreement on the Community budget for

^ 1987.    Some member states, mainly those in the south of the Community,

s.Ov*d wanted to increase non-obligatory expenditure by more than the

^prfftimum rate but the United Kingdom and other member states had

^dhhyss fully opposed this.    Some northern member states had supported

At ocf^r proposal containing the device of a negative payments reserve.

Thi^fiwd also been defeated.    The United Kingdom was seeking further

legaL^nvice on the negative payments reserve.    The budget situation now

was &lt;^t ^Jilock but the Budget Council would be reconvened in due

UNAUTHORISED

DISCLOSURE OF

JCLASSIFIED

INFORMATION

4.      THE ATTORNEY^ i#Jj  AL reported that the journalist Mr Duncan

Campbell had obtainea/ ^aiIs of a highly classified equipment project,

which he had planned ^^j^bl ic ise in a film to be shown on

BBC television.    Such a programme would have been very damaging to

national security.    The &lt;$p&amp;kt\oT\ of the BBC had been drawn to the fact

that this was likely to tf^w^&gt;vered by a D Notice,  and as a result they

had decided not to show the-^ilwt and the High Court had granted an

injunction the previous af teMK^jw&gt;reventing Mr Campbell from disclosing

the information that he had s^gwfred on the project.    He had, however,

passed on copies of the film to/Gferlhiin Members of Parliament,  and it

was planned to arrange a showing^^h^^norning in the House of Commons to

a number of Labour Members.    An application earlier in the day to the

High Court for a further injunction&lt;  o--3aevent the film from being

screened had been refused on the grod^^&apos; that it would be difficult to

enforce and that this was properly a mAM&amp;r for the House authorities.

The Speaker of the House had subsequent^ agreed to instruct the

Serjeant at Arms to refuse to make a room available.    It had been hoped

to table a Motion that afternoon supporting the action taken by the

Speaker, but there were procedural difficulties^-about introducing a

Motion at such short notice,  and consideratio Ywa$\ now being given to

alternative ways of dealing with the questions\^a*s-e&lt;i by this situation.

In discussion,  it was noted that the House of ComtiHljre^elect Committee

on Defence had now asked the BBC to make available&lt; A^[&gt;jJy of the film.

The BBC were being advised not to comply with this r^fljJ^aA.  in view of

the injunction granted against Mr Campbell.    The Speavel^sHinstruction

would be effective throughout the House of Commons,  and &gt;*J* 5&amp; would be

no difficulty in preventing the film from being screenedVwftMn the

House of Lords.    But there was nothing to prevent the Menmfcf^^f

Parliament in question from arranging for the film to be sb^tfl^oats ide

the Houses of Parliament;  the High Court injunction had been^taj&amp;yn out

only against Mr Campbell and his servants or agents.    The injfcmtfpi^a

would not apply to action taken by Mr Campbell before it was gnsKftea\

The latest edition of the New Statesman, which had gone on sale ^kt^p


morning, contained a lengthy article by Mr Campbell on the project; if

^ the article had gone to press before the injunction was granted, he

^/would not be in breach of it.

^p*B PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that Mr Campbell&apos;s

&lt;^dyL4a4o8ures were highly damaging to national security; major

l&amp;ks&amp;tutional issues were also at stake.    She would wish to discuss the

mat^rVfurther with those of her colleagues most immediately concerned.

No coBjarent should be made on Mr Campbell&apos;s article, in accordance with

the % rC Mpt practice where security issues were concerned.
