PARLIAMENTARY

AFFAIRS

2&lt;^PSe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of O^fmons in the following week.

Local

Government

Legislation

THE LORD PRESIDENT informed the Cabinet of the conclusions he had

reached, after consultation with the business managers,  the Secretary

of State for tK/S-fecivironment and the Prime Minister, about the

arrangements for Kindling local government legislation in the present

The Cabinet ^~syf/

Took note. ^^^&gt;

HOME AFFAIRS

Tax Frauds

at Building

Sites

3.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE^ (&amp;N&amp;OTHERN IRELAND said that remarks by a

judge in a case of tax fraudM^^tfae building industry which had

concluded in Belfast the previoAef^dAy had attracted a certain amount of

publicity in the media.    The usSs of-^ \jch frauds by groups such as the

Provisional Irish Republican ArmyC&apos;to^knance their activities was an

established fact and a number of me^fyj^e&quot;* were being developed to

counter it.    The particular fraud wa onfined to Ulster but was

practised on the mainland by various &lt;^itj f&apos;nal elements; there was some

evidence of contact between these grouf^ and Irish terrorists.    The fact

that the conviction rate for the offence had risen sharply over the past

few years was a good indicator of the extent and success of the law

enforcement agencies&apos; activity in this area.    LL^was clearly important

to take all possible steps to prevent terrorL6^~&quot;o\rtganisations from

obtaining funds from such sources.    Another p^o^i/table source for them

in the past had been private security organisatrofis^n

Measures to counter this had been included in the ^J^^marn Ireland

(Emergency Provisions) Bill currently before ParliairtewJ^\

The Cabinet - &lt;^^\

1.      Took note.




THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he had received a letter from

Mr James Molyneaux MP, leader of the Official Unionist Party, tendering

his resignation as a magistrate on the grounds that following the

Anglo-Irish Agreement his duties might bring him into conflict with his

personal views.    Since Mr Molyneaux had not in fact sat as a magistrate

&apos;fpr more than a decade, his motivation now was clearly solely political.

^i &gt;was therefore minded to refuse to accept the resignation and instead

Jtojfarike Mr Molyneaux off the roll of magistrates;  this would make it

qjrJPfi&apos;rYto others who might be tempted to follow Mr Molyneaux1 s example

thajfe^t was not acceptable to bring the office of magistrate into

dis^30 ite by exploiting it for transparently political purposes.

Bef ora/na^eached a decision in the matter, he would wish to hear the

views rfr&apos;co1leagues, given the wider ramifications of any such action in

the NorNyaern Ireland context.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet

shared the Loi^d^hancellor&apos; s concern about any risk of magisterial

office being used(/for political ends.    In reaching his decision on how

to deal with cw^/^a-^ter, however, the Lord Chancellor would wish to

weigh the views [Axji/e&amp;sed in discussion to the effect that Mr Molyneaux

might be looking TrJ^wQublicity and even martyrdom, and that it might in

the circumstances Be/p&lt; rj^icient to accept his resignation, noting that

it was  in fact many vra^VSv^ince he had sat as a magistrate.

The Cabinet - &lt;^(^^)

2.      Took note, wittNeiJppwal, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their d^?q)ssiy)n.

iAttitude of

the Labour

Party to

jviolent

Crime

THE HOME SECRETARY said that ear 1 i^^a^. week Labour Members of

Parliament had voted against renewa^f\J$ &apos; the Prevention of Terrorism

(Temporary Provisions) Act  1984 despiy^^pne clear evidence that had been

presented of the vital importance of Act in combatting both Irish

and Arab terrorism.    In the same week cney had also voted against the

provisions in the Criminal Justice Bill to enable the Attorney General

to refer over-lenient sentences to the Court ofAppeal for review, and

to increase the maximum penalty for carrying /virejWms.    These actions

were in striking contrast with their professaJLeotLcern about violent

crime,  and he would stress this divergence in v ^To\np public appearances

he was making in the coming days. \V_ S/SS

Unemployment

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that January^^giJ^es for

unemployment would show an increase of 68,000.    The seas^OTia^/jKadjusted

figure would be up by 300.    Any increase after the recent m^&lt;fn\y

reductions was disappointing, but this was still the best Janukr^ result

since 1978.    In discussion it was pointed out that there weri^kia^y

regional differences.    In Wales there would be another fall in(J/S^\^


unemployment on a seasonally adjusted basis; in nine out of the last 10

months there had now been a reduction.    In Scotland there would be some

increase but this partly reflected the fact that there were more school

Reavers at Christmas in Scotland.

AFFAIRS

Nigeria

Reference:

CC(86) 28.3

4.    THIJX^FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Nigerian

authoriM.es had suddenly demanded the closure of the new British visa

office in Lagos.    The visa regime for Nigeria, which had come into force

earlier that month, had been criticised in Nigeria as being allegedly

racist.    The /^ra&apos;sym given for the demand for closure of the office was

traffic conge\a ioW_outs ide the premises but the real reason might

concern securit^y^s~M ce the building overlooked the military barracks

which were effec\^Lv^y\ the seat of the Nigerian Government.    It was

impossible to know^wfat^else might lie behind the Nigerian action. The

President, General LWaJ&amp;oi Babangida, who had not objected to the

opening of the visa o^^2^ was currently out of the country. The

Government were of cours^^^acting vigorously to the Nigerian action.

Lebanon

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 4.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH^^^ETARY said that there continued to be

conflicting rumours, but no re ir oi&amp; information, about the position of

the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s Sne^r^l Representative, Mr Terry Waite,

who had disappeared more than three/^ereks previously in Lebanon. The

Archbishop of Canterbury had receiv^Cd^S^reply from the spiritual leader

of the Shia community in Lebanon, SnM^nJ?adlallah, disclaiming any

responsibility for Mr Waite&apos;s kidnappyn^and providing no information.

The British Ambassador in Lebanon, Mr\lohn Gray, was maintaining contact

with as many elements in Lebanon as possible and would shortly hold a

meeting with the Druze leader, Mr Walid Jumblatt.    The Government was

maintaining pressure to dissuade the Government of the Federal Republic

of Germany from making concessions to terror nlm|a order to secure the

release of German hostages in Lebanon.    So fa^^^trevFederal German

Government was standing firm, but one could not(pe ^pnfident that there

would be no change in that position.    There werevffiapVVeports that

Israel was seeking the release of her servicemen afcly^Hjgd in Lebanon in

return for the release of Arabs in Israeli prisons .^Kwas said that

the United States would not support such a deal, butwfe^e^too the

position could change.    Meanwhile,  the United States 6th&lt;X^e t remained

in the Mediterranean but there was no indication at pres-Mt^gf plans to

take military action in Lebanon.    That could change rapicQi^^XUnited

States hostages were killed or seemed to be about to be ki^ft^v


THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY aaid that a cyclone had struck

Vanuatu on 7 February.    The death toll so far was put at 45 and the

damage to the capital, Vila, was estimated at  100 million, twice the

annual Gross Domestic Product of Vanuatu.    The United Kingdom had

immediately provided  100,000 in initial disaster relief.    The offer of

\a team from the Royal Engineers, who would probably come from Hong Kong,

^Jl d been accepted.

^jfi^vbrief discussion,  it was agreed that British aid following the

cy^tty e should be seen to be both timely and consonant with the scale of

ert^^^aster.

; United States

| Strategic

Defence

Initiative

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been various

statements by members of the United States Administration about new

moves  in the implementation of the Strategic Defence Initiative (SDI).

Remarks by the/&apos;SecVetary of Defense, Mr Caspar Weinberger, to the effect

that decisions^^n^-d-e.ployment of certain systems might soon be taken had

now been set in rarersnective.    The Government had received assurances

that any changesxjjJ^fiV United States interpretation of the

Anti-Ballistic Mis^r^/^reaty would be the subject of consultation with

allies.    The modalitrig^^f the consultations were not yet clear.

Soviet Union

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 3.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMON WE ALT^^EI^&amp;ETARY said that 140 dissidents had been

released from detention in cfte Sffibiet Union and the release of 140 more

was reportedly under consider^tyap^   The Government should welcome this

development, while pointing out/j?tiaV\many more political prisoners were

held in the Soviet Union.    The reJr^ks^of the dissidents was likely to

improve the image of the Soviet Uniorf/ln the West, and this was

undoubtedly part of its purpose. ^^^^

Britons held

in Iraq and

Iran

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Ian Richter, a

British businessman resident in Iraq, had been/^rxested in June 1986 and

had now been sentenced to life imprisonment for bribery.    Mr Richter&apos;s

lawyers and the British Consul General in BagfKtad^Iwfci been present

during the trial.    The sentence was obviously outt^of/Jproportion. The

trial had been connected with that of a former maysw^^oz Baghdad, who was

likely to be condemned to death for bribery.    The Myto^X and

Commonwealth Office were in close touch with Mr Richvj^* Vfamily.

Everything possible would be done to help him, but it^wovl^W&gt;e wrong to

raise hopes of his release. &lt;^V^\

Mr Roger Cooper, a British journalist resident in Iran beb$ ^&amp;e

Islamic revolution, had been detained in prison for over a 5(V^^y.

Despite repeated representations, only limited consular accea^ioymim


had been obtained. The Government continued to make all possible

representations on his behalf.

Anglo-

Italian

Summit

Meeting

&gt;&gt;&gt;

 ^MEL FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Anglo-Italian

/tjjmtat Meeting, held in London on the previous day, had been

^cop^Auctive and friendly, and had been well reported in the Italian

WtoM^binet -

Commission

CC(87) 4.4

5.      THE PRIMB^MdJ&amp;JKTER said that at her meeting with Monsieur Delors,

President of thej/Commission, on 5 February she had made clear that she

saw no point in &amp;  a&amp;fbing some of Monsieur Delors&apos; wider proposals

until there was ag^e&apos;anrerft on budget discipline which worked effectively

within the Community^^^^^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWE^tW&amp;NSECRETARY said that at the subsequent

meeting with British Minraitena on 5 February, Monsieur Delors and his

colleagues had been left K ^e Xpubt about the British attitude to the

review of Community f inane i^p^jrw.  in particular, the need for effective

budgetary control and reform^f^Me operation of the Common Agricultural

Policy. (Sy&gt;^

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIE^XijjPFOOD said that the

Agriculture Council on 9-10 February h^Tdiscussed the implementation of

the agreement on changes in the milk secVor and on structural measures,

but a further Council would be required.    As part of the December

agreement,  there would be an accelerated programme of disposal of

intervention butter stocks.    There would be a/w*TMrred repayment from

the Community budget to member states of the \\s^as--on these stocks.

In discussion it was said that a scheme of this tC^^Af^s open to

criticism as it would relax budgetary pressure.    Th^^Tch me, however,

took account of the budgetary difficulties in 1987 atyS$fo$ until the

full effect of the milk reform was reflected in savingyjwuwi it enabled

at least some proceeds to be obtained from a quicker sala^^v

In discussion of the separate arrangement for providing sdjjiejx^d for

the needy, it was said that the butchers had now agreed to the

beef without charge, and distribution should therefore accele^ajUO
