HOME AFFAIRS

Report in

the Name of

the Health

education

Council

^P^\THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that events

&quot;&quot;sujraj^nding the publication of a report entitled &quot;The Health Divide&quot; in

CTfe BMle of the Health Education Council had attracted attention in the

me^^^^yhe report had been commissioned by the Director General of the

Councy^fa*&gt;parently without the knowledge of the Council itself. The

firstvtK^chairman of the Council had heard of the matter was on the day

of publication, when he learnt that a press conference had been arranged

on the Council&apos;s premises.    The Chairman had then postponed the

conference so that the Council could have an opportunity to see what was

being put out Jitnier their aegis.    There had been no contact with

Ministers of p/is Department at any point.    The report, which purported

to bring up toc3Ja&lt; &gt;a report on social inequalities in health by

Sir Douglas Bla&lt;/l  iy) 1980, propogated the theory that poverty and poor

health were linKe3^J^yfi that the disparity between the health of the

poorer and more prv^i^^us sections of the community had widened since

1979, as had regionaO^^Vklances in the health of the community. The

evidence cited by the^ra^oW; was currently being examined in detail by

his Department, though if  ^ Wernment could certainly take credit for

recognising the imbalanc^iiyyiealth provision between the regions and

for consistently following a^tstag term plan to deal with that problem.

Insofar as health problems ^re^Y&gt;aUsed by poor nutrition, even the

lowest incomes in this c oun Cvy^ae/r e sufficient to support a good diet,

provided that the money was speWE^tf&amp;sely.    Health education was,

therefore, crucially important.N^TbANsovernment had already recognised,

in the context of AIDS,  the needv^c^piodel the anomalous Health

Education Council as a Health EductW^ --&amp;uthority that would be properly

accountable to Parliament.    The sou^wj^&amp;tablishment of health education

services in that way must remain the ^ay^Timent&apos; s prime objective, and

it was important that the present episxjtae should not be allowed to

prejudice the successful transition to me new Authority, which was due

to take place the following month.

lail

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the trial of those X^gS^Jl of the murder of

PC Blakelock in the Broadwater Farm riot in 1985 h^P^mwcluded the

previous week.    One of those convicted, Winston Silc/n^oXad at the time

of the riot been on bail on a separate charge of murd^yvo*. which he had

subsequently been convicted.    There had been grave publi^^^ase at this

revelation, and at the assertion of the judge who had gra&amp;edjb^il to

Silcott that the formulation of the Bail Act 1976 had ler^jJip Xp

effective choice in the matter.    The media continued to giv^^oievsubject

considerable attention:    there were press reports that day tSraJ^a/person

accused of the murder of a child had been granted bail.    So fsryfcpj^he

Silcott case was concerned, a judgment had to be made whether w^art J? d


this case.    He was therefore pursuing urgent enquiries into the facts of

the grant of bail to Silcott, and would then bring to the Home and

Social Affairs Committee as soon as possible his general conclusions

^about the adequacy of the Bail Act.

^^1E PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that it was

/ff^^sgnised that the number of untried prisoners remanded in custody had

v^grownk in recent years, but there might nevertheless be loopholes in the

S2rfl&gt;Jfct, and there was bound to be public concern about bail when

mu^^^-e&lt;harges were involved.    The Home Secretary should proceed as

qui^-Sx^as poss ible with his review of the subject, so that the Criminal

3ustvte/&amp;T\.\ could be used as a vehicle for amending the Bail Act,  if it

was cd^fluded that a change in the law was required.

Trade

THE SECRETARYV^J ATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the trade

figures for Febi/kar^) to be published later that morning, would show the

overall balance11ion in surplus, with trade in manufactured

goods approximatel^^n^Aalance.    The three months average had swung from

a deficit of nearly( }&amp;LSai 11 ion in September and November to a surplus

of nearly  180 millicw^^i^he three months from December 1986 to

February 1987.    Not too^Hjj*$$tvweight must be placed on figures for a

single month, but the la^e^tYrigure appeared to be in line with

forecasts given by the Cnxjr^^K^or of the Exchequer at the time of the

Budget, and to discredit th^yloj&amp;my prognostications being made by some

of the Government&apos;s politica^oraipnents.

The Cabinet - ^^^^

Took note. &lt;^^&quot;&gt;

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Libyan forces

in Northern Chad had suffered a series of defeats.    Their forces, which

were badly trained, had been routed in severaJy^Trtwagements by the

National Armed Forces of Chad loyal to the Pr^tidMiJ^. Mr Hussein Habre\

The culmination had been the capture by the Nati/yfaT\Vrmed Forces of

Chad of the Libyan-run air base of Ouadi Doum onW^Mrtch.    The Libyan

forces had sustained heavy losses of personnel, eqy&amp;mJipt and logistic

stocks.    There was a good prospect that the Nationa l/fi*JreX Forces of

Chad would drive Libyan forces from other parts of No^h^roChad. The

effects of these reverses was likely to be in the long nj^s weaken the

repressive regime of Colonel Qadhafi in Libya.    The LibyMO^rmed forces

would be demoralised by the defeats in Chad, and other cohJj^vJ^X in

Africa might be deterred from looking to Libya for support.^^&quot;^^

CC(87) 9T^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he was keeping in close

touch with all indications about the whereabouts of the Archbishop of

Canterbury&apos;s special representative, Mr Terry Waite, who was still

v detained in Lebanon.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Office was in

&quot;^;onstant contact with Lambeth Palace.    There were continued rumours

^tJfrich tended unhelpfully to undermine the public impression that there

-^wj ald be no concessions to terrorists holding hostages.    An extremist

/^miTS group in Lebanon, which was holding a French journalist hostage,

h^^ci^imed that it might secure a deal with France in return for the

hosjrage&apos;s release.    The Government had made its concern about

con^s** W&gt;ns to terrorists known to the French Government.    The latter

had bV^n^enying more or less consistently that it would consider a

deal, /^nere was no confirmation of reports that Iran might have played

a role^n the detention of Mr Waite.    Iran had denied reports that he

was held in the Iranian Embassy in Beirut.    The Speaker of the Iranian

Parliament had implied that Iran would be willing to help regarding

Mr Waite if tb^P^iaited Kingdom could help to secure the release of four

Iranians heldf(by (phe Phalangists in Lebanon.    The United Kingdom could

not help in ttTM^ravter and the Foreign and Commonealth Office and

Lambeth Palace *W e/ijsying to discourage this story.    There were

recurrent stories&quot;&quot;1&amp;ay Mr Waite had had contacts with the United States

Central Intelligence/)w ^ \cy, or the National Security Council which

Lambeth Palace was jK^V^eking to discourage.    He would continue to try

by every worthwhile mearre,^&amp;if ind out about Mr Waite&apos;s position and also

to maintain the public &amp;j$pfe &amp;ion that there would be no concessions to

terrorists. v^vVN

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH.SECRETARY said t/fet^ie choice of Mr Alan

Dukes as leader of the Fine Gael party in theNJ3^rt ^ic of Ireland, in

succession to Dr Garret FitzGerald, should prove/^toAJea good one.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said tMv/^^. new Taoiseach,

Mr Charles Haughey, had changed his position on the w^gw^Vlrish

Agreement.    He had now said in the Dail that he recognisvd^he Agreement

to be a binding Agreement and an integral whole,  that h^ ^ Jwd honour

it, and that it could not be changed without the agreemeM^//the

British Government, which would not be forthcoming.    This w^r&apos;ipNrfelcome

change in Mr Haughey&apos;s position, which no doubt reflected vv^v/S

expressed to him by the United States Administration during fli^jWait to

Washington.

Shipping in

the Persian

Gulf

^reW)REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was increased

ao^evoy about the safety of shipping in the Persian Gulf following the

acquisition by Iran of Chinese Silkworm missiles, which would add

somkwh^yto Iran&apos;s capability to attack shipping in the Gulf. Kuwait

had syigh/t^help from the United States and the Soviet Union.    The United

Statesvwfs providing the protection of the United States flag on Kuwaiti

oil tamers.    The United States reaction had largely but not entirely

succeeding in pre-empting Soviet help in response to Kuwait&apos;s request.

There were grounds for concern about the safety of British shipping; the

Armilla patroL^EfXthe Royal Navy had recently been given some additional

resources.    He/wa^s) seeking co-ordination of Western activity in

protection of^s3^^Sy\ so far as this was sensible.    He was also working

for concerted piWsejjrj/ation by Western countries and the Gulf States of

their deteminatrtw^uy the face of Iran&apos;s attempts to harass shipping.

An attempt was beivl^/piwz in the United Nations Security Council to

arrange for the WestfewjvCountries and the Gulf countries to support a

resolution warning again^t^attacks on shipping in the Gulf.    There might

be some people in the Uffj^eJvsStates Administration who,  following the

Administration&apos;s difficuv&lt; iei^concerning arms sales to Iran, would

favour a strong reaction M-^r*^Gulf.    There was therefore a case for

urging caution in Washingtdn^vj  

In a short discussion, the impgra^nAe of firm action to avert serious

problems for shipping in the Gu&gt;fr ira^stressed.

The Cabinet -

2.      Invited the Foreign and Conmprtyealth Secretary to

consider whether the United Kingd\fe should take any

initiative, possibly after consultation with Saudi Arabia

during the current State Visit of King Fahd, which would be

designed to reduce the dangers of shipping and to have

beneficial effects on the United Kingdon/Cs^mlations with

the Gulf countries. v-v^ s.

Saudi Arabia

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the &lt; t^ ^Visit of King

Fahd of Saudi Arabia was going well.    Press reports that^&amp;Jtfdi Arabia

was acting as an intermediary for Syria, with a view to^ere sumption

of diplomatic relations between the United Kingdom and Sy^i^^jSire

untrue. (cv/v

In discussion it was noted that although other members of th&amp;KlAg&gt;s

party had not pressed Saudi Arabia&apos;s case for offset arrangemery/s jX\


connection with the purchase of Tornado aircraft from the United

Kingdom, the Minister of Industry and Electricity, Mr Abdulaziz al

Zamil, had raised this matter in very strong terms with the Secretary of

^sState for Trade and Industry that morning.    The Secretary of State for

yjpefence had recently sent to Saudi Arabia a draft Memorandum of

^Understanding on this matter, and the Saudi reaction was still awaited.

/jnytbit was hard to be optimistic about that reaction.    Saudi Arabia

^ apoAaiced to want a contractual commitment, if possible from the

(fevewjjaent, on offset arrangements including British purchases of Saudi

oi^^p^isn the establishment of joint venture companies in Saudi Arabia

by Bf^^sh. companies.    The Government was responding actively to these

deman4 ^*ut was not in a position to direct British firms to enter into

joint Ventures in Saudi Arabia.    It was important that the Government

should snow the Saudi Government that it was treating the matter

seriously, actively and resourcefully, not least in order to avert any

Saudi tendency^ta look to the United Kingdom&apos;s competitors for very

large contrac/osira future.

for Defence, tovi^ow. to the Prime Minister on the

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE^AM^JDUSTRY said that the Japanese

authorities had not yet taken finalCwJ^ions regarding the attempt by

Cable and Wireless pic to obtain a su^/p^j^tial share in a new

international telecommunications opera^rfng company in Japan, but the

omens were very bad.    The matter mightvrag on for months. Meanwhile,

there was strong feeling in the House of Commons about the way Cable and

Wireless pic were being treated and an Early Day Motion had been tabled.

In discussion,  it was noted &apos;that the FinanciaXsevvices Act would

contain provision for reciprocal action agains^tyarfpsW.    But that Act was

not yet in force and the date of its entry intoytoj^^-was due to be

decided only after Easter.    Otherwise,  the scope in^xwetaliatory action

was not great, being largely confined to actions wn^Wv^ve Government

had earlier rejected,  such as interference with theN &lt;j!MGrQj.ons to and

from the United Kingdom of Japan Airlines.    One course wjv^fti was for

consideration was administrative delay in considering avp^^CYJzions by

Japanese financial institutions to establish a presence \x_^j)4*lJnited

Kingdom.    As regards action by the European Community, it ijErf^M^wtiated

action under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade aga&amp;sx^Ttepanese

discrimination against imports of alcoholic beverages from CogjatiVjAy

countries and was now considering action in respect of medical /aipoiYtoent

and motor vehicles.    It was for consideration whether the Prime M^^^er


should send a letter to the Japanese Prime Minister, Mr Yasuhiro

Nakasone, referring to the strong feelings in the House of Commons on

the case of Cable and Wireless pic and asking for a reply to her recent

^^^etter on the subject.

X&gt;7      The Cabinet -

yS/&amp;&gt;      Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry

3ra circulate urgently a full report,  for discussion by the

^^^abinet at its next meeting on 2 April, on what was being

^*&gt;&amp;pye to put pressure on Japan in support of the interests

Q ^ar&gt;le and Wireless pic and what more could be done, with

rMerence inter alia to the Financial Services Act; and on the

acMon being taken on related matters by the European Community

and the scope for British pressure for further such action.

5.      Inviyt^TaY\the Chancellor of the Exchequer to follow up

with the\Man}t-of England the possibility of administrative

delay in th&apos;a^p^Qcessing of applications by Japanese financial

institution^gp^Btablish a presence in the United Kingdom.

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Research and

Development

4.      THE SECRETARY OF S^ftffJpR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that the

Community&apos;s framework pro^*^n(jH&amp; for research and development had again

been discussed at a long Ri^e^r^h Council on 24-25 March.    The majority

of member states had been avXeJgcb accept a programme involving total

commitments over the five yea^pkrivd of about 5.6 billion ecu (about

 3.9 billion).    The French Pri^ev^MpsS-ster, Monsieur Chirac, had recently

made a speech calling for increas^ re*jpenditure on research and

development and,  in the light of the French had rallied to the

majority.    The United Kingdom and i^jg^6*leral Republic of Germany had

not agreed to the proposal, and the Bf^jj^Jn Presidency had asked for a

definitive view by 2 April.    The Germarf^Minister, Herr Riesenhuber, had

strongly supported the United Kingdom throughout the Council.    It was

possible that, in the absence of agreement, the issue would come to the

European Council in June.

In discussion the following &quot;points were made i\ &lt;J

a. It was essential not to make commitmedts.^wMich might put at

risk the ceiling on the Community&apos;s own resotrt^&amp;af    At the Chief

Secretary, Treasury&apos;s recent meeting on the aiLqle^^i^pn of public

expenditure baselines there had been agreement V^a^j^atid on a

programme of 4.2 billion ecu (about  2.95 billion)/^^je

Government&apos;s prime concern should be to foster Bri^^^^ecience.

b. Research and development was one of the areas fn3j!rwf&amp;ch the

United Kingdom was a net beneficiary and the extent to\&gt;wnicxN the

British Government had been able to influence the shape^j^P^njA

programme had depended on maintaining as far as possible orcmjirfoyv

ground with the French and Germans.    There were other major i^h^s


in prospect,  including budgetary discipline and the Fontainebleau

abatement mechanism, on which it was important to maintain a close

relationship with France and the Federal Republic of Germany.

Lir Transport

^HF^&amp;CRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that at the Transport Council

c^^21^4 March there had been a breakthrough on air fares.    All member

sta3*^--  w supported proposals for reduced fares.    Those member states

who^tSMy^e^en insisting on specific restrictive, non-economic conditions

for cfy^KjJg&apos;r fares were no longer doing so.    There remained other

difficM^ies to be resolved,  in particular on capacity, but a good

aviation^package now seemed much closer to agreement.    There would be a

further Council on 9 June in order to seek such an agreement.    It would

be important to^maintain the pressure in the interim.
