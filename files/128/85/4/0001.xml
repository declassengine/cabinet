Reference:

CC(87) 3.1

/H&amp;&gt; LORD CHANCELLOR said that a report in &quot;The Times&quot; newspaper earlier

{^im b&gt;Ke week had suggested that he supported the Human Rights Bill

Lrp^dttuced by Sir Edward Gardner MP.    That report was a distortion.

Whii^/ne was well known to support the concept of incorporating the

Eur^g*^/Convent ion on Human Rights into United Kingdom law, he was

mindfuV^p the need to do so in a way which did not weaken the

sovereignty of Parliament.    &quot;The Times&quot; had reported comments he had

made irrOsupport of an earlier Bill which avoided that pitfall,  and had

applied them to Sir Edward Gardner&apos;s Bill, which in fact took the wrong

approach to the sovereignty issue.

Lobbying

I Public

I Bodies

2.      THE SECRETARY OF S^^^SOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that it had come to

his notice that the Spor&lt; | Cmincil were intending to write to the

leaders of all political p&amp;r&amp;fce and to all Parliamentary candidates

asking for a statement of Ime^^pittitude to the future funding of sport.

This was obviously an attemp^O/^ar/induce the various political parties to

outbid each other in offers or /&amp;4p$ort and, as such, should be resisted.

It was questionable whether it Was/J^pper for a quasi-governmental body

to engage in such blatant politi ^^&lt;Jbbying.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a stf^r&lt;0discussion,  said that the growth

of lobbying tactics of this kind coui^h^ve an unhealthy impact on

British political life.    It was imporD^ nt that it was restricted from

the outset.    It was also important thatVa common line was adopted by all

Conservative Party candidates approached in this way.

Testing for

AIDS

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES saidl^ka^i number of press

reports that morning had suggested that the Govern J^rf/was contemplating

introducing a system of testing all blood samples tax&amp;ty^irom those

admitted to hospital,  for whatever reason,  to estabr^hXw^ich were

carriers of the AIDS virus.    The suggestion was that sucjr^ests would be

carried out without the knowledge or consent of the pa&amp;p(y? \S and that

the results would be anonymised and that there would thir^b^/o&lt;o way of

informing patients of the result.    The intention of such ta Ow&gt;uld

simply be to build up a better body of information.    In fac&amp;,^Jrfcs was a

proposal put forward by the British Medical Association in tn^ej/y\

evidence to the Social Services Select Committee which was cur^f^^


engaged in a study !of AIDS.    There were arguments both for and against

such a system,  and it had been identified as an issue which the

I  Ministerial Committee on Home and Social Affairs Sub-Committee on AIDS

?Nshould consider in due course,  though it had not yet done so.

/&gt;^0    The Cabinet -

Lr^)^      Took note.

Lenient

Sentences

THE HOMj^ECRETARY said that there had been a general public outcry at

the lenfwit sentences passed by Mr Justice Leonard earlier that week on

the perpetrators of a particularly horrifying multiple rape, and at the

insensitive remarks made by the Judge in passing sentence.    Pressure was

now building u/^fvt stern measures including minimum sentences for rape

and a prosecutionVfj^ght of appeal against lenient sentences. These

ideas had far-r^V^fTtw implications and it would clearly be wrong for

policy on them t Mj^A&gt; ecipitately changed in the heat of the moment.

The Government stlKxAroposed that the best course on the problem of

lenient sentences wadJ &amp;*take power for the Attorney General to refer a

lenient sentence to zqp^X&amp;bvt of Appeal to enable a judicial

pronouncement to be made ja^the appropriate sentence for a case of that

kind.    This arrangement(jwM\not place the individual defendant in

jeopardy of his sentence &gt;&amp;ejtnfi/ increased, but it would go far to remedy

the imbalance in the presenfc^^vtem, which only provided for sentences

to be reviewed by the highero^ou^s when they were allegedly too severe.

The provision in the Criminal^ lj|tajce Bill that embodied these proposals

was to be debated in Standing C pjmi Kee in the House of Commons the

following week.    It was a central^wwpnent of the Government&apos;s criminal

justice policies, and it was importa*^/that it should not be frustrated

by the House of Lords, who had reje^rfi^^n earlier version of the

proposal during the passage of the Prp&amp;ecyftion of Offences Act.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a shor t^j.s cuss ion, said that the public

reaction to the sentences passed that week emphasised, if that were

needed, the importance of enacting the Government&apos;s proposals to remedy

the manifest lacuna in the present law in resp^ ^\of lenient sentences.

It was to be hoped that the House of Lords wouftd (jjbw drop their

objections,  and the Lord President of the Coune^r^tsji the Lord

Chancellor should make every effort to see that Whey/did. Meanwhile,

the public might be reminded that it had been the^-dJ^wLoerately adopted

policy of the Labour and Liberal Parties to oppose^tJ^^Sayernment&apos;s

proposal for machinery to refer lenient sentences toV^wuf^Oourt of Appeal

when it had been before Parliament during the passage orVfJpe Prosecution

of Offences Act. ^^3)


The Cabinet -

2.      Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of the discussion and invited the Lord President

of the Council and the Lord Chancellor to proceed

accordingly.

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Lebanon

I CC(87) 3.3

v^^&amp;HE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was still no

b^ a\j ws about the fate of the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s Special

Rew^jfenXative, Mr Terry Waite, who had disappeared in Lebanon some two

weefe^rtteviously.    Indications were emerging from various sources that

Mr Wazfc^fj&amp;ght have been detained because he had failed to produce money

or undertakings about further arms deliveries to Iran, which apparently

had beea&gt;expected by his interlocutors in return for the release of

hostages.    These stories seemed plausible, although it would be quite

wrong to assume that Mr Waite would have had anything to do with arms

deliveries to/  vh..    The Archbishop of Canterbury had written to the

Speaker of th\/lr^hian Parliament, Hojjatoleslam Rafsanjani, and to the

spiritual leaa ^^-r&gt;\fche Shia community in Lebanon.    The Government were

maintaining clo&amp;Aj^jodph with Lambeth Palace.    But he remained convinced

that the Governme^rC^ah/ould not become involved in representations on

behalf of Mr Waite, sfrf&amp;&amp; that would enhance his importance in the eyes

of his captors. Vv\0^

There was continuous sp^vLakion in the media about movements of United

States forces in the Eas&lt;t^rp//Mediterranean, with the inference that the

United States might be coirs^aeTring military action in Lebanon. The

Government were doing every^huig vpossible to stay abreast of United

States intentions.    There weVevftl fact no signs of preparations for

military action;  such moves or/wms as had taken place had been

routine ones.    It was, moreoverf to see what type of military

operation in relation to hostageV&apos;heJ^ in Lebanon would be feasible.

There had meanwhile been rumours BMt^i^ Federal Republic of Germany

might be considering an exchange orwaian hostages in Lebanon for Arabs

in prison in the Federal Republic.    T^^&amp;overnment had made

representations to the Federal Government in support of the agreed

policy of the member states of the European Community (EC) that no

concessions would be made under duress.    It seemed that the Federal

Government would allow the normal processes of^-the law with regard to

Arabs held in the Federal Republic to take thwrWourse, and there was

no reason at present to expect the Federal R&amp;^ubpL^to abandon the

common policy of the EC countries. vC^y

&lt;

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Falkland Islands

Interim Conservation and Management Zone  (FICZ) had come into force on

1 February.    Some of the statements of the Argentine Government on the

matter had been truculent, but these had apparently been intended for

domestic purposes.    The signs were that Argentina was in fact observing

a ten mile buffer zone along the western side of the FICZ and was thus

VLikely to accept the FICZ de facto.    Licences to fish in the FICZ would

^ring to the Falkland Islands Government sums which would be

/^significant in terms of that Government&apos;s finances.    There had

yme^Kwhile been press reports that Argentina might be seeking through

Crnd^Tect contacts to arrange talks with the United Kingdom on fisheries

nw^fejjs.    It was true that indications had been received of possible

Ara j*t^n  willingness to discuss a modus vivendi regarding fishing in

the ^W^&amp;i without insisting that the questions of sovereignty should be

raiseo/O^Ule Government&apos;s reactions via the United States Government had

so far^B^en cast in interrogative terms.    It was necessary to handle

press enquiries on this guardedly.    The leaders of the community in the

Falkland Islands were being informed.

I Iran/Iraq

| War

Reference:

1CC(87) 3.3

THE FOREIGN AND WMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Iraq in the past week

had achieved some^S^tesses in the fighting, which would raise morale on

her side.    This veinfjsfc&amp;zd his opinion that Iran was probably unlikely

to be able to enter rfi&amp; \ v to isolate it.    The Islamic Conference had

taken place in Kuwait, wrttjjbut Iranian attendance, and appeared to have

made no progess in the for peace in the war.    The Secretary

General of the United Na^XonysJ Senor Perez de Cuellar, was continuing

his activity in this causeV/^terall, no major change concerning the war

was in early prospect, but &lt;t^aevafe&apos;terioration of the situation seemed for

the moment to have halted. ^4Iy\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETA&quot;R^pa&gt;d that the results of the

constitutional referendum in the Philw^nes on 2 February had

strengthened the position of the Presi^snt, Mrs Corazon Aquino. Some

75-80 per cent of a total turnout of 80^&gt;er cent had voted for the

constitution,  though votes against it had come from some of the major

military bases.    The internal situation in the .P-hilippines remained

uncertain. ffl)

Comprehens ive

Test Ban

In discussion,  it was noted that the Soviet Union haa^jg&amp;oited a

planned pause in its programme of nuclear testing in ^rwervto declare a

unilateral moratorium and to gain propaganda advantage.^uj^-the past two

days, Soviet representatives had spoken effectively on ruysikbtter on

British radio.    The Government&apos;s public position was thar^frjjjs^tfoited

Kingdom was seeking progress towards a comprehensive test hrfpvXI^B) but


that verification of such a ban presented a major obstacle.    The public

position of the United States Administration had been that nuclear tests

would be needed so long as nuclear weapons were needed.    But it had

been agreed in principle, at the meeting of the United States and Soviet

leaders in Reykjavik in October 1986,  that step by step progress towards

a CTB should be sought,  involving the bringing into force of the

^unratified Soviet/United States treaties on a threshold test ban and on

^&gt;eaceful nuclear explosions.    This development should make it easier to

&apos;vtflign the public positions of the United Kingdom and United States

/firf&amp;Brnments regarding the approach towards a CTB.

P^wajk agreed that the Government should do more to advocate their

positron in public, making inter alia the point, of which some of the

pubC^^iight not be aware,  that the United Kingdom and the United States

only Xruteptook nuclear tests underground.
