^tfE^ECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the purpose of the debate on

t&gt;^^ bort of the Sizewell B Public Inquiry on Monday 23 February was

to o^ble him to listen to the views of the House of Commons before

reat^rlrfrtVhis decision and was not an occasion for a vote for or against

the raowjHlJ&amp;ndations.    He had agreed with the Lord Privy Seal and the

Chief^f^fp that,  following the precedent of the Stansted Airport

Inquiryj^the debate would take place on a Motion for the Adjournment and

that if the official Opposition precipitated a division members of the

Government and its supporters would not vote.    The Opposition had been

informed of tMjs-sto tent ion; it was not yet known whether they would seek

a division but(as\^:he Friends of the Earth had written to all Members of

Parliament urgrrrV^ttJ^ii to vote against the Motion to show their

rejection of theU^e^/r&gt;t it seemed likely that a division would be

called.    It was or^^My greatest importance that Ministers should avoid

comment of any kina pt )oa&amp; conclusions of the Report until he had

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TOU^^PiON AND SCIENCE said that he was

extremely grateful to the Lor^^Wfe^ident of the Council and the main

Government spokesman on the BiM^Lycd Belstead,  for the adroit way in

which they had secured the passago^^the Teachers&apos; Pay and Conditions

Bill through the House of Lords wfth^flly minor non-Government

amendments being made.    The House M^erjEi^ons were to consider the House

of Lords amendments on Thursday 26 Feynaaj&gt;y.    Assuming all went well on

that occasion the present plan was fo^^eyal Assent to be announced on

Monday 2 March.    He would follow this w^;h a statement on the same day

setting out the new pay scales and terms and conditions which he

intended to introduce.    This would include some small variations in the

offer currently on the table, as a minor gestu ^towards the unions&apos;

position, but the total cost.would remain witn/Ln zlie agreed amount. He

would clear the contents of this statement wirMOc^I^iagues.    He also

proposed to set his proposals out in a letter tof^ill/headteachers and

full page advertisements in the national press. ^&amp;Zyf irst increase in

pay would appear in pay packets in May and includeVj^p^&amp;tantial measure

of back pay to 1 January.    Two unions were currentlyOjsnAVting their

members about industrial action and it was quite possrolv }?}&gt;at some

selective disruption would take place in March.    It was^j6jtf Vmportant

that the Government should keep public opinion on its si^^ Jtfhis was

the most effective sanction against further disruption by^e^fcSeirs.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had held a meeting

earlier that week with the Ministers most concerned to discuss the

^handling of the Private Member&apos;s Bill on access to personal files

\Sponsored by Mr Archie Kirkwood MP.    The meeting had considered

^?pVoposals which had emerged from discussions with the Bill&apos;s sponsors

/fofeh would involve a considerable narrowing of its scope.    It had

(Jefecptte clear, however,  in the course of discussion that, while some

  UKes of the amended Bill were acceptable, others - particularly

thog^c^oncerned with education records - were not satisfactory without

fur^^rt^fimendment.    There had also been general concern that the

enforisfmie^^ provisions were likely to place an unacceptable new burden

on the^ourts and create new bureaucracy.    The meeting had therefore

concluded that the best course was for the Minister of State, Home

Office to tell the Bill&apos;s sponsors,  that while the Government would not

seek to prevent the Bill receiving a Second Reading, he would make clear

in his speech/^r^khat debate that the Bill was still in a form

unacceptable (nptVeGovernment and that unless substantial amendments

were made the T?a^ &quot;fTyfcent would vote against the Bill at Third Reading.

THE PRIME MINISTER said tha^^^^teering Committee on Economic

morning to consider the new CoOTj^fav^s Plan submitted by the Rover Group

Board and a recommendation by the^&amp;lwd for a merger of Leyland Trucks

and some related businesses with xha^utch truck manufacturers DAF.

E(a) had approved both the Corporae^-Efia)l and the merger proposal.

Subject to any views of colleagues thsySe/rtretary of State for Trade and

Industry would make an oral statement^rfokt afternoon announcing the

decisions.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that before Christmas

he had announced that the Rover Group were inydJ&amp;.ussion with DAF and

with the American company Paccar on measures cfriatynight be taken to

restructure their truck production and relateovB^Sksses.    The Rover

Group Board had concluded that the DAF proposalsUwera/much the best on

THE^J^RETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the Public Order

(Nor&lt;c5^5??i Ireland) Order which was being laid later that day updated

public/^op^r legislation in Northern Ireland following representations

from tKs: Royal Ulster Constabulary.    Some of the changes, particularly

those concerning marches and processions, and the carrying of flags and

wearing of emblems, were likely to be criticised by the unionist parties

who would seek to maintain that they had resulted from pressure from the

HOME AFFAIRS

 ramiIs

Claiming

I political

Asylum in the

United

Kingdom

2.      THE HOME SECRETARY sN^id^tat a serious threat to immigration

control was being posed by from Sri Lanka travelling to Britain,

usually by way of third couiMjYe^} and claiming political asylum on

specious grounds.    He had tha ^wapj &gt; ordered the removal of 58 such

Tamils who had arrived at Heathq^erwJkixport from Bangladesh. An

application had been made for juc^^fa^vreview of his decision and this

was due to be heard in the Divisiona^Xpurt the following Monday: the

Tamils&apos; legal representative had aicjrSj&amp;en successful in obtaining an

order from the High Court staying the&gt;exg^btion of the removal orders in

the meantime.    The final resolution ofi^ne proceedings might well be

delayed by the Tamils taking their casevo appeal.    By coincidence, the

House of Lords would give judgment that afternoon in a case that bore on

the appeal rights of applicants for asylum.    So long as applicants

making worthless claims for asylum were able fe^a^ail themselves of the

legal protections designed for sound claims, tvherjjwas a gaping loophole

in the immigration law.    The present protectiorrsvyi^er^ meant for those

who, under the United Nations Convention on RefiMes^Z^ad a well founded

fear of persecution, and the present cases illustra^w/how they might be

exploited by anybody coming from a part of the worTcywij fNe there

happened to be conflict and violence.    Until the loop^J^e^as closed

there was a clear risk of further number of Tamils arrivujS^here, and of

increasing difficulty in sending them back to the count^^^yyom which

they had travelled.    He therefore intended to mobilise Pa^4^ajue&gt;ntary and

public opinion in ways that would not prejudice his contest&gt;i^ \jie

present legal proceedings with the utmost vigour.    He belie^wf^^b, that

it was important to maintain the sanction of detention in the^W^jot

circumstances; he had directed that space should be found for tQ&gt;er YV

purpose in the prisons, despite their gross overcrowding, and mi^t^&apos;T^k

approaching other colleagues for their assistance.    He believed tha^^Tt


might be useful to mobilise action in the European Community, other

members of which faced similar problems, and he had it in mind to

consult the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary about the possibility of

^NLnviting the Belgian Presidency to convene a Ministers of the Interior

^meeting on the subject.    Finally, there was a strong case for imposing

/^fictions on airlines who brought to this country people who required

 ^V^m. without the necessary documentation.    At present, airlines

tnem^jMves bore the cost of removing such passengers when that was

on^rea) but there was no power in Britain to impose financial penalties

on a^u^jjaes in those circumstances.    Some other countries possessed such

a pow^^o&apos;and there was a very good case for taking it in Britain.

In disc^vsion the following main points were made -

a. While there was a strong case for taking power to impose

financial nenalties on airlines as the Home Secrtary had suggested,

it should^!Je~Snecognised that bogus refugees could reach the country

by other \Q ai &amp; of transport.    The public&apos;s main anxiety would not

be focussed /am yjie misbehaviour of the carriers but upon the

vulnerabi 1 iv$^&lt; z/&amp;rie immigration system to ingenious legal evasion

and challenge V/L/y

b. The field o /nWrgration was but one example of an area in

which judicial invol^^6nt had been taken too far.    The proper

functioning of the N^ e&apos;cu)give was being eroded by the expansion of

judicial review.    Thi^&gt;^^ed constitutional questions of the

greatest importance.

c. The public&apos;s patienreynyjd^been too much tried by citizens of

other countries coming to B^itaX^si to batten on British social

security benefits.    There wa^^ijj^particular, much dissatisfaction

about the ease with which peon^^cjauld come to Britain from the

Irish Republic simply to enjoy ^sp&amp;er standards of social

provision.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the present

case of the Tamils touched on a number of related issues that demanded

attention.    Most immediately, the Cabinet agreedthat urgent legislation

should be introduced, if necessary,  to enable/W^nstocial penalties to be

imposed on airlines that brought people requiBAa^&amp;ivSas to Britain

without proper documentation, and that she should/makjp it clear in

answering questions in the House of Commons thatV^^n^hoon that the

Government had this under urgent consideration.    Tl^/Mjg^tion of

retrospectivity for that and any other legislation th &amp;$ight be

introduced to deal with these matters would require c^rt^fu^ attention.

More generally, the Cabinet was disturbed at the increasMj ^xtent of

judicial review and the way this was blurring the hither^d/aaaepted

boundary between issues of law and policy.    The Law Offic\s^?*^HJould be

asked for their advice on what might be done to protect the^i&amp;Vi&amp;imate

interests of the Government in this field, and improvements ^o^at

immigration law should be considered in the light of that advMfa^a^H the

outcome of the present cases before the courts.    As regards theC^J^S.

protection of the social security system from exploitation by cit^ems^f


other countries,  the Secretary of State for Social Services should

consider the possibility of making it a condition that supplementary

^Nbenefit payments would be restricted to people who had been resident in

^vhe United Kingdom for,  say three years.    Unease about the special

^?^aasition accorded to Irish citizens had been reflected by the

&quot;&apos;&apos;^rovGterial Group on Local Government Contingencies which had recently

WskgjjXthe Home Secretary to review the voting rights in Britain that

w^eattended to Irish citizens.    The special position of Irish citizens

und^^JJfitish nationality law might need to be considered more widely

wherM^^results of that review and the Secretary of State for Social

Servi&lt;w^=consideration of supplementary benefit payments were both to

hand. \\

The Cabinet -

1. Tool(/noty that the Prime Minister, in answering questions

in the HsiWe^e-f. Commons that afternoon, would announce that

the Governnuwntjnad under urgent consideration the introduction

of legislatv^tfv^o^enable financial penalties to be imposed on

airlines that^mmght people requiring visas to this country

without proper ttpp&amp;akn tat ion.

2. Invited the Seyerj^tVry of the Cabinet to arrange for

the advice of the Caw/&apos;Ofjicers to be obtained on the possiblities

for reducing the scojigr^ft^Niudicial review and other means of

judicial questioning or^^ovirnment decisions, especially

in the field of immigra^ipj^ycontrol.

3. Invited the Home Secr^far^X in the light of the

Law Officers&apos; advice, to coq^d^p^bringing forward

legislation for a future sessi&lt;J ^  Parliament that

would reduce the extent to whidTrt&amp;e immigration control

system could be exploited and ev^fed^

4. Invited the Secretary of StatVfor Social Services to

consider the possibility of restricting supplementary benefit

payments to people who had been resident in the United

Kingdom for a specified time. (^^^

conference, or &quot;peace forum&quot;, which had just conclude^WAjtoscow had

been predominantly a propaganda event.    The Government ha^^issuaded

from attendance most of the British people who had beenMrf^fVW. The

speech by the General Secretary of the Communist Party or^Ura^Soviet

Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, had contained no new proposalsx^rfTajTms

control.    Meanwhile,  there were contradictory indications oiwjoy^t

policy towards dissidents, and it was clear from Mr GorbachevC^yVp^tent

speeches that he was encountering resistance to some of the cha(j es^\n

the Soviet Union that he favoured.    The Government&apos;s public attitri^y\

should be to welcome any movement regarding dissidents and to presa^r_^

the release of more dissidents.1 ^^//

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, despite the very

limited power enjoyed by the President of Lebanon, Mr Amin Gemayel, it

Miad been right for the Prime Minister and himself to receive Mr Gemayel

/^uring the latter&apos;s private visit to London earlier that week. The

(/^Jdvernment had sent through Mr Gemayel a clear message to Syria that

&quot;pjp^g was no change in British policy regarding that country.    There had

^&amp;ee^M is cuss ions with President Gemayel about the plight of the

AjrafbMihop of Canterbury&apos;s Special Representative, Mr Terry Waite, who

was^^^ll held in Lebanon; but Mr Gemayel&apos;s scope for action in this

mattQ^S^^as very slight.    Mr Gemayel had been dismissive about the plight

of the/zra^^stinians in refugee camps in southern Lebanon.    In fact,

howeve^^che situation in the camps was serious.    The Government was

ready tovconsider further requests for emergency aid, if means could be

found of conveying the aid to the camps.

In a brief disrarsvti.on, it was noted that the many rumours about the

plight of Mr imitV were contradictory and there was no certain news

about him.    TheTlyOv^Anment remained in close touch with the Archbishop

of Canterbury.    Mr_JWi*te&apos;s detention might last for a considerable

time. &lt;//Iy\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEA^D  E RETARY said that progress was being made

regarding the difficulties .tf j vhad arisen with the Nigerian Government

about the new British visa c^rtp^ in Lagos.    Agreement had been reached

with the Nigerian Army on pxa^yaa^ measures to make the visa office

acceptable to them.    This agreenri &lt;vt\taeeded to be endorsed by the Foreign

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY^^id that there had been no

incidents during the football match in which England had beaten Spain in

Madrid on the previous day.    Careful arrangements had been made, with

the involvement of British Consular officials&gt;&lt;E^.control the movement

of the supporters of the England team.    Eighteen Supporters had been

arrested on their way to Madrid, and two in Ma^/^iRffcfore the match.

Press reports of incidents before the match had [igexj&amp;reatly

exaggerated, but a few people had sustained minor~-T^&gt;u  ies.    The affair

was by no means satisfactory, but no serious harm nl^^J&amp;n^done.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that an incidetrj^^

occurred at sea on 18 February 13 miles off the Isle of Man^^rw^^hich

the fishing nets of a Northern Ireland trawler had become enrapj^Jn^A with

a communication buoy of a United States Navy submarine.    Such LM ru&lt;&amp;nts

were unusual.    It was possible that the owners of the trawler1 wouj^ltygke

a claim against the United States Navy.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that it was clear that the

leader of the Fianna Fail Party, Mr Charles Haughey, would head a new

Government as Taoiseach following the General Election in the Irish

^Republic on 17 February.    It was not yet clear whether Mr Haughey would

.jjkave an absolute majority; he might be one or two seats short of it.

/&gt;|^asi8cussion, it was pointed out that Mr Haughey could seek to secure

^an^y^rall majority by gaining the support of independent members of the

^Kly^kior instance, Mr Blaney or Mr Gregory) but might not wish or need

to&lt; Sy -^rbe price for doing so.    Mr Haughey&apos;s appointment as Taoiseach

migh^r^4 !lL cause problems for the Government with regard to the

Anglo4a*^sh Agreement of 1985.    Mr Haughey,  in his Party&apos;s election

manifesto and in remarks during the campaign, had said that he did not

agree wrth Article 1 of the Agreement which concerned the status of

Northern Ireland.    Mr Haughey might seek to continue the work of the

Anglo-Irish In a&lt;eovernmental Conference, established under the

Agreement, wh/yfe~&gt;raaintaining his objections to Article 1.    On the other

hand, Mr Haugl)^&apos;) - vtt.itude to the Agreement had changed over the period

since its s ignatfyrejand apparently in the later stages of the election

campaign, and he\tej p^ in the event edge away from his objections to

ones for international trade V^rn/OUnited States,  the United Kingdom,

France,  the Federal Republic o^^eraany and Japan.    The possibility of

such a meeting had indeed been and/w^tt. sti11 under discussion, but there

was general agreement among those ca^erned that it would be mistaken to

hold a meeting unless its purpose a^d^&amp;jfcely outcome were reasonably

clearly defined in advance.    He would\ ardourse attend,  if it was

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that there had been hard

pounding in the discussion on the liberalisation of aviation at the

informal meeting of Community Transport Ministers on 16-17 February.

\What had been achieved under the British Presidency was confirmed and

^vthere had been some limited movement forward.    The French position was

/^the key to greater success, and pressure was being brought to bear on

C&apos;fotXKransport infrastructure.    The United Kingdom had opposed any new

jj^ovi^ion for this, particularly in the light of the present budgetary

siijMftLan, but the position of other members states with budgetary

con^fjTp,  in particular the Federal Republic of Germany, had been less

Community

Budget 1987

THE CHANCELLO^OtKtHE EXCHEQUER said that it was expected that the

European ParIxaWpJ: would adopt the Community&apos;s 1987 budget that day.

In the Budget CtfurficyiL on 13 February the United Kingdom alone had voted

against this bud^ *Mi Ainly because, although it respected the maximum

rate for increases^^/pon-obligatory expenditure,  it did so by the

device of a negative^pAylSents reserve.    This device was particularly

inappropriate in a y^WAra which it was known that agricultural

expenditure would oversh/?$2*.the budget provision.    Formally the budget

respected the rules of &lt;* rag&apos;e\&amp;ary discipline, but the agricultural

overrun would be a serioHS_-j^r0rblem in 1987 and,  in particular,  in the

agricultural price f ixing. /3^Me was no question of new money either

from an increase in the 1.4VpeT&gt;^ent value added tax ceiling or from an

intergovernmental agreement ti&amp;lbl&amp;gf. these budget problems.
