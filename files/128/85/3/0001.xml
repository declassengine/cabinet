PARLIAMENTARY

AFFAIRS

X^^VIhe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of&gt;&lt;j tM(ions in the following week.

Human Rights

Bill

THE HOMB^ECRETARY drew attention to the difficult handling problems

that were likely to arise on the Human Rights Bill introduced by

Sir Edward Gardner MP, which was first order for consideration during

Private Members^Zbusiness on Friday 6 February.    The Bill sought to

incorporate tti*^ p^ivisions of the European Convention on Human Rights

into United Kiivg^SS^ktatute law and thus enable questions of compliance

with the Convent LDn&gt;cJL be brought before the United Kingdom courts. The

Government had cott^sajed this matter on several occasions and each time

had decided agains /jrcra&amp;poration.    He saw no reason to change that view

on this occasion, buV ?fa?oneasure had supporters on both sides of the

House of Commons and strwtypbacking in the House of Lords.    There was a

risk that this support yMWcrow unless the Bill could be stopped from

making progress at an ea&amp;jJlqze.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summingV(ip^ brief discussion, said that the Cabinet

noted that the Bill was 1 ikev&amp;^tJaive rise to difficult problems of

handling.    They endorsed the vi/ ^^ached by the Legislation Committee

on the previous day that it would njj(\be appropriate to use the votes of

Ministers to attempt to defeat tlks E^vate Members&apos; Bill sponsored by a

senior Government backbencher and ^wj^rted by a number of others

amongst the Government&apos;s supportersV^Weihetter tactic would be to try

to arrange for the Bill to be talked (&amp;} &amp;t Second Reading. Failing

that, the Bill might run out of time a\xa later stage, though a

Committee Stage could be difficult to handle, and attract increasing

support for the Bill.

The Cabinet - .

1.      Took note, with approval, of the Prime//Miryuster&apos; s

summing up of their discussion. ^^y^/

House of Lords

I Debate on the

Inner Cities

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a debate onv^6e^)\ner cities

in the House of Lords in the following week was likely tov&amp;w jh:t a

certain amount of media attention.    The debate would be on d^rocion in

the name of Lord Scarman.    The Secretary of State for Employrap^/jwould

lead for the Government. ^^S^S

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a report of the

Aud^-C^Kommission published that day painted an extremely damning picture

or tk^state of eight local authorities in London, all under Labour

Parr^^Joftcrol     These authorities had expenditure commitments around

 400 m^uQ^^h in excess of their resources - a gap of some 30-40 per

cent,   rf^re report compared the activities of these local authorities

with twovother groups - one consisting of eight other London local

authorities under a variety of political control and the second

consisting of a group of local authorities elsewhere in the country with

similar resour ^s^and problems.    By contrast with both groups the

original eighafautvlorities were shown to have been markedly inefficient.

All in all the r^tfT^V contained compelling evidence to back earlier

Government critii^tsjjjs/of the performance of certain types of local

authorities.    The TT^f/t also contained some criticism of the present

systems of rate suppcr/t^grant and local government capital controls: the

response to this wouro^CeArly be that the Government was committed to

radical reform of both sypjpbms.    The Government would now need to

consider the steps that ^^^%\need to be taken to remedy the situation

revealed in the report, aMta^ayjpeeting of the Ministerial Group on Local

Authority Contingencies haap^^w. arranged to carry that consideration

forward.

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Lebanon

KC(87) 1.3

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Lambeth Palace had

made a generally reassuring statement the previous evening about the

safety of the Archbishop of Canterbury&apos;s Specyrf^fiepresentative,

Mr Terry Waite, who had been.out of sight in uebaipn for some days. The

Government did not play any direct role in Mr^Efci*g^6 attempts to secure

the release of hostages in Lebanon, since Mr Wai/te&apos;s))chances of success

depended on his role being independent of governme-  0The reasonably

reassuring note in the statement by Lambeth PalacevwaT^fci the whole

convincing,  though the evidence on which it was bas^v^asNindirect and

slender.    At the same time, the Government were seekiM&apos;gvjJ &gt;rmat ion

about Mr Waite&apos;s position from all possible quarters,    ijv^j&amp;ticular,

Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Lebanon, Mr John Gray, had vwrf&amp;pod

contacts in that country.    The Government should continue^Ee^i^Vnent as

little as possible on Mr Waite&apos;s plight; official comment c^tfi^jjMxicrease

the risk that Mr Waite would be held hostage by those with wro^he was

in contact.


Since April 1986, the Government had been advising British citizens to

leave West Beirut.    The number of British citizens in West Beirut now

} stood at 27.    That advice had been repeated in recent days by the

(&quot;Aritish Embassy.    There might be a case for addressing this advice to

^British citizens everywhere in Lebanon, who hitherto had received less

*S^pkpeaching advice.    On balance it was preferable not to do this at

/i^&amp;nt, since it could contribute to a growing sense of crisis. There

Vas^^-^ossibility that the Government of the Federal Republic of Germany

mi^nt^Jfcnsider a deal involving the release of two German businessmen

he l^^foejppge in Beirut in return for the discharge to two Arabs from

prisafiw^f the Federal Republic.    Against the background of the common

positiw^t the member countries of the European Community that there

should mi no deals with terrorists, the Government had sought to stiffen

the resolve of the German Government.

In discussion, Lt^was noted that one reason for optimism about

Mr Waite&apos;s pos&apos;y^Tan was that the Arab groups who had accepted

res pons ibilityV^ion^h^s safety would suffer a severe loss of face if he

came to harm.    Mr/waite and his dedicated efforts to secure the release

of hostages were^wwp^espected in Britain and he was a popular figure

with the public; buO/^tcpg^ media were beginning now to question the wisdom

of his visits to theyw r Ndangerous areas in Lebanon.    It might also be

asked whether the add^tl^nxl attention which his visits focussed on the

question of hostages migJ ^j sAise more hostages to be seized.    These were

questions on which the Gtf^rrVient should take no public position at the

present time. v^^^

The

Philippines

Previous

Reference:

CC(86) 39.2

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECf$?Al^said that the Government of

President Corazon Aquino in the Phi^ p_ines seemed to be making some

progress in dealing with the militaCjfrtS^olt which had begun on

27 January.    There would be a referena^m^Jh 2 February on the new

constitution.    It was likely that a ma^frity would vote for the

constitution.    But the difficulties facwl by the Government on both left

and right in Filippino politics were great and the position would remain

hazardous.    The Government should continue to^upport President Aquino.

Federal

Republic of

Germany

Previous

Reference:

CC(86) 31.1

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that VtT*^fekoeral election in

the Federal Republic of Germany on 25 January had Dae* ^$KM&gt; by the centre

right coalition of the Christian Democratic Union/ChSgM^p Social Union

(CDU/CSU) and the Free Democratic Party (FDP).    This sucW^i. for the

Federal Chancellor, Dr Helmut Kohl, had been accompanie^w^ev

disappointing result for his own party, the CDU/CSU, whos&amp;^raxe of the

vote had fallen by 4i per cent,  the party&apos;s worst result s u*  ^549. The

election was unlikely greatly to affect the course of the Q^rm p^S

Government&apos;s policies, but the influence in the coalition gov^ r^e^t of


the leader of the CSU, Dr Franz-Josef Strauss, might diminish and that

of the FDP, whose share of the vote had increased by 2 per cent, might

| be enhanced.

Iran/Iraq War

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 1.3

^ffE^VREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the expectation that

Ii&lt;^h npfyht be on the verge of a military break-through in the war with

Irao^ha^ -diminished.    But a serious break in Iraqi morale could still

allov^^rn a success in the sector of the front near Basra.    The war was

likely^nj^Pontinue.    If Iran achieved a substantial success on the

ground wul there was a break in Iraqi morale,  the Iraqi President,

Mr Saddanr Hussain, might fall:  that was the Iranian objective.

Meanwhile,  there was an increase in international consideration of moves

for a settlement.    The current meeting of the Islamic Council, which

Iran had not heygfTN^ble to prevent, was providing a forum for a number of

interested couA rr a to discuss the war.    The United Nations Secretary

General, Senor Ptfy^zSpe Cuellar, was in the area.    The Foreign Ministers

of the member coua j ^* of the European Community were again discussing

the possibility of ^piptal arms embargo.

The Cabinet -

1.      Took note. &lt;^^^)

Soviet Union

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SE^^^VY said that it was too soon to make

a full appraisal of the major spej^Xf^wv the General Secretary of the

Communist Party of the Soviet Union^fr Mikhail Gorbachev, at a plenary

meeting of the Party&apos;s Central Comiff^re^Don 27 January.    It was possible

that Mr Gorbachev had not secured fronytJ&gt;Aplenary meeting all the

changes he had wanted in the Soviet le^wership.    In particular, the

veteran Party leader in the Ukraine, Mr\yladimir Shcherbitsky, retained

his membership of the Politburo.    Although Mr Gorbachev had clearly

become a powerful leader, there appeared still to be limits on what he

could do.    His speech, on first reading, appea^^vto be long on analysis

of what was wrong in the Soviet Union but lesefsp^Jbi f ic on what should

be done to correct the weaknesses.    Mr Gorbacne^^ ^\energetic and

restless but might not yet be clear about the reHed/as, to propose.

In discussion,  it was agreed that the actions that^fys/^^red

Mr Gorbachev&apos;s speech would be more important than rtrt^^eech itself.

At the same time,  it was noted that the very suggest ion ^   the limited

use of the secret ballot to elect party officials was o^J&amp;g if icance in

the context of the authoritarian Soviet system.    For the\&lt;Qjp*/being, the

Government should adopt in public a sceptical &quot;wait and se^X^O^ation

about Mr Gorbachev&apos;s suggestions, avoiding any implication x^hai^phese

could be taken at face value. ^^/^^


The Cabinet -

2.      Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary

to circulate an analysis of Mr Gorbachev&apos;s speech and

the meeting of the Central Committee of the Communist

Party of the Soviet Union, once these had been fully

^studied.

COMMUNITY

Settlement of

Trade Dispute

with the

United States

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 1.4

4.    TH^J^REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that the European

Communr &lt;j  and the United States had reached agreement that morning on a

settlement of the dispute over the possible effects of the enlargement

of the Commuinty on United States&apos; exports, particularly of maize. The

Community would open a quota with a reduced levy for maize and sorghum,

remove a partL^^Mservation of the Portuguese grain market for

Community suppliesVapd give tariff concessions on some other products.

The United StatesyffattN agreed to withdraw the measures which they had

threatened to pu^Via^^seffeet at the end of January,  including action

against British gin^^ALthough this agreement was welcome, the

protectionist pressu/fjP^ H the United States remained strong; other

action recently taken^^iXc&amp;e United States, such as the superfund levy

on oil, discrimination oJ^Kght aircraft, customs fees and threats to

the Airbus were still a N^rfJreaNf or concern.    In discussion it was said

that the scale of the Unrra^ *Xtes&apos;  trade deficit posed risks.    It was

a paradox that the world&apos;s i^s^e^t country should be the largest

importer of capital.    There^erV^differences of view within the United

States&apos; Administration on theC fro &gt;^ance of, and the likely development

of,  the decline in the dollar. ^^^^

International

Trade

Negotiations

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARr^^^d that agreement had also been

reached in the difficult discussions in^eneva on the next stage in the

preparation of the trade negotiations under the General Agreement on

Tariffs and Trade.

The Cabinet - &apos; (( I)

o

Took note. K^^J

ACCOUNTA-

BILITY OF

MINISTERS

AND CIVIL

SERVANTS

5.      The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lo Seal

(C(87) 1) to which was attached the proposed Government r&amp;stefee to the

reports on accountability from the Treasury and Civil Servic^S\ftect

Committee and the Liaison Committee. vv

THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the draft Government response attAQfe \to

his memorandum was in reply to reports on the accountability of ^^^^


Ministers and civil servants from the Treasury and Civil Service Select

Committee (HC 62), and the Liaison Committee (HC 100).    These reports

I   had arisen from a statement in the Government&apos;s reply to the Fourth

?^Report (Session 1985-86) from the Select Committee on Defence that &quot;the

&gt;\ cSfcvernment proposes to make it clear to civil servants giving evidence

tsyfl Select Committees that they should not answer questions which are or

t^kh&amp;ax to be directed to the conduct of themselves or of other named

0&lt;Wi&gt;\dual civil servants&quot;.    This statement had been designed to combat

tlqf^sjwing tendency, evidenced by the Select Committee inquiries on

West^mcL^and into the Tin Crisis for Select Committees to inquire into

whetti^^mdividual civil servants were to blame for particular events;

but it/X&gt;K^led to controversy with Select Committees over its intended

scope. \\he proposed response, reaffiriming traditional Select Commitee

practicey made clear that it was not acceptable that Select Committees

should act as disciplinary bodies and judge the conduct of individual

civil servants.    The response would place on record the respective areas

of accountabil^yvbf Ministers and civil servants, particularly when

appearing bef&lt;\i&amp; 9g_lec t Committees, and guidelines attached to the

response would c/ar&apos;Tw for official witnesses appearing before Select

Committees the d\kt^ajj*ion between questions seeking to establish the

facts of what had c-^el^rred, which they would be expected to answer, and

questions seeking to/avS&amp;Vn criticism or blame to individual civil

servants.

It appeared unlikely th*&lt;x ria\Liaison Committee would overtly endorse

the Government&apos;s views on^t^Aevmatters, but there seemed a good

prospect that the Committee^v^u^ accept them as a working basis for

future Select Committee inquArr^^ywithout further public dispute. The

controversy had at least provCawf^rtie opportunity for a clear

restatement of the longstanding^p&lt;Snv&amp;ntions in this field, which had

been threatened by recent inquirL^f^wud for obtaining a clear

acknowledgment from the Liaison ComjB^fcree that Select Committees should

not act in the role of discipl inary^r 3 pnals.    It was proposed that the

response should be published in the faom^f a Command Paper,  in the

name of the Prime Minister, the MinisfVVof State, Privy Council Office,

and himself, on 5 February, and that tny? should be announced in

response to an arranged Written Question.    A commitment had been given

to the Liaison Committee to give them an opportunity to consider the

guidelines before their formal issue to offici^KN though they might not

in the event wish to do so.   *It was accordingi^ p&lt; &gt;posed that the

guidelines should be formally issued towards ch^^rraNof February.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion&quot;-S^ ythat the Cabinet

agreed with the terms of the draft response and gura/ v&amp;s attached to

the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s memorandum, and with his propoSrfra^&apos;reangements for

their issue.    A Confidental Final Revise should be sent^fja^Xhe Chairmen

of the Liaison Committee and of the Treasury and Civil ^^rde Select

Committee (Mr Terence Higgins MP) two hours before publia&amp;tj^A. but to

no one else.    No press notices should be issued. ?&apos;wCvi


The Cabinet -

1.      Approved the draft Government response and draft

guidelines attached to the Lord Privy Seal&apos;s memorandum

(C(87) 1).

&gt; 2.      Invited the Lord Privy Seal to proceed with

^\he arrangements for the publication of the

 ^Mwernment&apos;s response on the lines indicated in the

Minister&apos;s summing up.
