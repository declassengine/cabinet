?T&amp;E SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he had been considering the

fqertpxt of the  inquiry conducted by Sir Frank Layfield into the proposal

JfcrS&amp;&lt; Pressur ised Water Reactor (PWR) to be located at Sizewell.

S j cuVory responsibility rested with him under Section 2 of the

Eleg^icity Lighting Act 1909 to give consent to the construction of the

pow^&lt;^fation,  and under the Town and Country Planning Act 1971 to give

plannonv^ermission.    He had decided that it would be in the national

intere^^co proceed with construction of a PWR at Sizewell as

recommenced in the Layfield Report.    In arriving at this conclusion he

had considered the findings of the Layfield Report, and had also taken

note of the views expressed in the Parliamentary debates that had been

held to discus^She Report.    He had also had to consider whether any

events that hac! occurred since March 1985 (the date the Inquiry had

closed) should^e^fd-Nim to modify the conclusions he had reached on the

basis of the Layvxie^zoJteport.    Of particular importance were the

accident at the ntrtfpaan: power station at Chernobyl in the Soviet Union

in the previous yeSr/^Kjd changes in fossil fuel prices.    As far as

Chernobyl was concerr ^^wie Soviet Union had been very forthcoming in

allowing examination ancP^sr^scussions amongst nuclear experts, and the

reasons for the acciden /w *ns now well understood.    The Chief Nuclear

Inspector in the United &apos;^Qnjgaom had advised that the accident at

Chernobyl had been caused^-b^&apos;/rvcombination of design faults, errors in

engineering and human erro^wp^stype which could not be replicated in

the entirely different type W/fea  tor being proposed for Sizewell B.

and had accordingly concluded ^Ira-tothe accident did not call for any

reconsideration of Sir Frank Layfi^i^&apos; s conclusions on safety. He

accepted that conclusion.    As fa&lt;*/as/ he second point was concerned, it

was true that there had been a coivylec^ble shift in the oil price (and

therefore in international energy pT*w aL since the Report had been

prepared, which meant that the probability of a coal-fired station

having lower costs than Sizewell B waaAabout one in seven rather than

the one in forty calculated in the Report.    But the critical factor was

not the present world oil-price but that in the 1990s. which could well

turn out to be higher than forecasts based on^cesent prices and market

conditions might suggest.    It was relevant too^traat France, West

Germany, Japan and the Soviet Union were all\g*jb) fc-antially increasing

their nuclear energy capacity.    If the United Hrngodm were not to do

likewise and the cost of other fuels rose,  thisxjrgj^h seriously damage

future industrial competitiveness.    Amongst other&lt; ^Vj&gt;Ars in reaching

his decision he had also taken account of the bene^e^^K impact on jobs,

particularly in the North of England, of cons true ti&lt;4&amp;* yyhe power

station, 93 per cent of which would be of United Kingdoif^jioufacture.

Finally, since most nuclear power station projects aroiwwrthje world now

involved use of the PWR,  improving United Kingdom experc^s^itv this area

would strengthen export potential.   He would announce his ^ e&amp;^&amp;ion in an

Oral Statement to the House of Commons that afternoon. ^^^^^


The Cabinet -

1.      Took note, with approval, of the Secretary of State for

Energy&apos;s decision to give the necessary consents for the

v      construction of a Pressurised Water Reactor at Sizewell.

jelays in

lajor

instruction

&gt;rojects

THl 32*$#5 MINISTER,  summing up a short general discussion of the length

of tiw^&apos;Ujken in the United Kingdom between conception of major

constsu^fon projects and their fruition, said that the Cabinet thought

that a^^gnificant reason for delay was that those affected by the

project usually had little financial incentive to see it concluded.

Experience with some projects in the oil industry showed that where a

company was abi^^to offer some tangible benefit of its presence - for

example, the ppns^ruction of a community centre - local hostility was

much reduced a fly^5&amp;J eliminated, enabling the project to be completed

much more quickW.   )un France, those in the neighbourhood of nuclear

power stations be&amp;e&amp; ited from a local purchasing policy and from

specially reduced vldtj^^city prices.    Alternatively,  incentives might

be given through theCAj ra?Xrating system.    While there was obviously a

cost to all these propos L ^ it could be more than offset by the project

being brought to a quicjj^^ooclusion.    The Secretary of State for the

Environment,  in consultation/with the Secretary of State for Energy, the

Secretary of State for Tratve^q^^ and the Chief Secretary, Treasury

should urgently consider whwcN^yjht be done to reduce local opposition

and thus the amount of time t^k^y tp carry through major projects, and

bring forward a paper to the Mi/r^ecial Steering Committee on Economic

Strategy, Sub-Committee on Economip^AAfairs as soon as possible. In

carrying forward this exercise hevwou^ need to consider how best to

deal with the pressure that would ar i *j4rom those who had already

received compensation to have the befl^^xs-of a new system extended to

them. ^X^^^

The Cabinet - ^

2.      Invited the Secretary of State for th -Environment to

proceed as indicated in the Prime Minist/jrsYBumming up

of their discussion. ^^^&quot;&quot;&quot;&quot;X

HOME AFFAIRS

Zeebrugge

Ferry

Disaster

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that ngements

made following the loss of the passenger ferry &quot;Herald Q^^JN

Enterprise&quot; off Zeebrugge on 6 March were being taken aho^&amp;r am he had

described in his Statement in the House of Commons on 9 Ma&lt; to^Nrhe

trustees of the disaster fund, who had been assisted by lega^^dVLce

from the Law Officers and the Treasury Solicitor, would be me^ra* the

following day to sign the trust deeds:    one trustee would be SryA^er

Lazarus, a former Permanent Secretary of the Department of Trans^ort^A

The formal investigation that he had ordered under the Merchant SlfcrfTp^Jg


Acts was precluded under that legislation from starting work within 30

days of its establishment.    The Department of Transport&apos;s preliminary

inquiry would continue in the meantime, and all the information it

Soollected would be made available to the formal investigation. The

jpelgian authorities were also conducting an inquiry; there was clearly

^Byfome risk of overlap, but relations with the Belgian authorities were

IvyxfK good, and everything possible would be done to reduce the risk of

^ovpr&amp;ip or conflict between the British and Belgian inquiries. A

n*rtio&lt; l memorial service for the victims of the disaster would be held

on^&lt;^) t0 ^e arran8ec*.    The Belgian authorities&apos; response to the

distrSfayrhad been extremely impressive, and one of the matters that he

wouldv^e^a to consider was whether the port safety arrangements in

BritairVAcould command similar confidence.    He would be visiting Belgium

again wrthin the next two weeks and would explore this aspect further.

A number of his colleagues had assisted him in concerting the Government

response to tha^-disaster, and he wished to thank them all.

THE PRIME MIN^gJEfr-said that the Cabinet would wish to put on record

their condolences^ fan those bereaved and injured in the disaster, their

gratitude to thev8 &lt;gj^n Government for the efficiency of the rescue

operations and the^iYaJJteements made for the survivors, and their thanks

to the people of al] jjjtf ^ns who had been involved in the rescue

operations.    The Cabfe ^tfpuld also wish to congratulate the Secretary

of State for Transport Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,

Department of Transport &amp;pryjBrabazon of Tara) for the admirable way in

which the Government&apos;s reS^loj&amp;jN.to the tragedy had been handled.

Nothing that was practicab]$&amp;^aoM&gt;een left undone.

The Cabinet - &lt;/r^^

1. Recorded their condolea(^s^j&gt;r those bereaved and injured in

the Zeebrugge ferry disaster. --\

2. Invited the Foreign and ComMpjtffHilth Secretary to convey their

gratitude to the Belgian Governme^^, and their thanks to other

Governments concerned, for the res&amp;oe operation that had been

mounted and the care that had been extended to the survivors of the

disaster. __

3. Congratulated the Secretary of Stat^VjEoJ^-Ixansport and the

Parliamentary Under Secretary of State, T&gt;ep fuSmt of Transport

(Lord Brabazon of Tara) on the handling of VJke^efternment&apos; s

response to the tragedy. ^/^^^

Higher

Education

White Paper

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Home and &gt;S e^*\Af fairs

Committee had the previous day approved the draft of a Whit^^A^r on

higher education that the Secretary of State for Education avd^^yence

proposed to publish in the first week of April.    This was an &amp; fJ&amp;foly

important subject on which, as the White Paper would make clear{^he&gt;\

Government had a very good story to tell.    Subject to the approva^x^^


Cabinet in due course, a Bill to give effect to the White Paper would be

brought forward in the first Session following a General Election: it

|   would be an important component of the legislative programme at that

S\t ime.

attendance

allowance:

Case of

Mrs Moran

T$^^iRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that a judgment with

poti^Koally important implications would be given in the Court of Appeal

on txE ^^5llowing day.    Attendance allowance was a benefit for severely

disabW^u^jJ^ople who needed much attendance or supervision. The

allowarw^was available at two rates,  largely depending on the degree of

supervision that was required during the night.    Hitherto the

Department&apos;s interpretation of this point had been upheld in numerous

cases, but it was possible that the present case, brought by Mrs Moran,

who suffered fe^cmyepilepsy, might go against the Government.

SubstantiallywidM^entitlement to the higher rate of allowance could

have significan^vx^Mfiditure implications, but much would depend on the

precise terms ofVCbeVj^dgment.    He had already been in consultation with

the Lord President^w/che Council and other colleagues about the need to

appeal to the House /*^ frds if the case was lost in the Court of

Appeal. ^^\&gt;&gt;\

The Attorney

General v.

Heinemann

Australia

and Wright

THE PRIME MINISTER said thao^o^0ent was about to be delivered in the

Government&apos;s application in tX^yNej^ South Wales court for an injunction

to prevent the publication of a/$doVNi&gt;y the retired Security Service

officer, Mr Peter Wright.    The jud^Hteot was expected to be available

early the following morning, and cop^aerable interest could be expected

in the media.    If the judgment wen ^*g33^st the Government, the

intention was to appeal.

Dis-

qualification

of Members of

Liverpool

City Council

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said th ^J$&amp;House of Lords

would that day deliver judgment on the appeal brougmt^ $^v5 Labour

members of Liverpool City Council against their disqualrvi^tion from

office.    The timing of the judgment was such that, if t)&amp;y^\

disqualifications were upheld, any consequent by-electioly^wJJld fall to

be held on 7 May at the same time as the regular elect ion s*- ^&gt;&quot;CTqe third

of the City Council.    If the 45 Labour members&apos; removal frojjv^i^pse was

confirmed, Liverpool City Council would pass into the controtX*ra/he

Liberal Party, at least until the elections on 7 May.    The Libe/r^ttar ty

would doubtless wish to make what it could of that situation, bcft sy\


Liverpool City Council had made a valid rate, there was no question of

immediate financial collapse, and the Government would certainly wish to

keep its distance from the matter.

3. &lt;^WffiT&gt;FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Signor Craxi had

resignj r as Prime Minister of Italy, and Signor Giulio Andreotti of the

Chris&amp;La&apos;irDemocratic Party had been invited to form a new Italian

Government.    He was trying to do this from among the five parties which

had made up the previous coalition, but had initially received a rebuff

from the Socialist Party.    There would be difficulties in forming a

coalition, and^gxly elections could ensue in Italy.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMO^wE^^l SECRETARY said that the Federal Chancellor

by the Bundestag on 11 M^^chlj He had received a very narrow majority,

indicating that some membei*^d!K the Coalition Parties had voted against

him. There were no s ignif i^^O&lt;hanges in the new Federal Cabinet,

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETA$/W d that Mr Charles Haughey had

been elected Taoiseach on 11 March, arcer the Speaker of the Dail had

given his casting vote in Mr Haughey&apos;s vavour.    Dr Garret FitzGerald had

unexpectedly resigned the leadership of the Fine Gael Party,  in order to

allow his successor time to gain experience before the next elections.

Mr Haughey&apos;s Government contained no new face^^in\important positions;

Mr Brian Lenihan was the Foreign Minister.    &quot;Bne ij^w Government was

likely to pursue rigorous economic policies ana&quot;&quot;/2&apos;6~yte supported in this

Hungary

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had ^aid^ra

interesting visit that week to Hungary.    The Hungarian regvrfJeO^nl ike

others in Eastern Europe, was encouraged by the new polic ie^Vf-^he

Soviet Union under Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.    Hungary was 1 ikely&lt;^%ress


ahead with its own economic reform programme.    The party leader,

Mr Janos Kadar, was firmly in the saddle and seemed still to enjoy good

health.    Mr Kadar had told him that the policies of Mr Gorbachev were

^Viecessary for the Soviet Union and that the West in response should be

^with cautious and ready to put Mr Gorbachev&apos;s statements to the test.

THE^pO&amp;E-lGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there was no news about

the ^^^W5ishop of Canterbury&apos;s Special Representative, Mr Terry Waite,

who wag^^ill held in Lebanon.    He was apparently held in the southern

part oMBeirut,  in an area dominated by the Shia Moslem grouping known

as Hizborlah.    The Syrian intervention in the area had further

complicated the predicament of the Western hostages held there. Syria

might wish to release hostages but could not do so without the

co-operation a^lnVbollah, which was unlikely to be forthcoming.
