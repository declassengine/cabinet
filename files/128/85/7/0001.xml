1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

A.

Abolition of

Domestic

Rates etc

(Scotland)

Bill

4ffif^CRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Ministerial Steering

C^jprnitpree on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on Local Government

Finarj ?^j( (LF)) had that week agreed that the Abolition of Domestic

Rate^^^r (Scotland) Bill should be amended so that the move from

dome st^c^ates to the community charge in Scotland took place in one

step inV^989, rather than over a transitional period of three years as

the Bilr^resently provided.    This change, which would be effected

during the Bill&apos;s report stage in the House of Commons the following

week, had been requested by the Scottish local authorities and, by

avoiding the i&gt;&amp;e^\ljo run two systems in parallel, would lead to

considerable 9Ajjiij&amp;4L in cost and administration.

THE LORD PRESIDER^-^J^SHE COUNCIL said that, while E(LF) had been

persuaded that the:^llepjsion was in the best interests of securing the

abolition of domesti/^rjKjXs in Scotland,  they realised that it created

problems for the aboICrtAnvof domestic rates in England, where the

transitional period curre^Kr proposed and the range of potential

community charges were g^kaxeyti than in Scotland.    The Secretary of State

for the Environment was cai* &gt;^\ing ways to reduce these problems, which

were disproportionately con^aflA^ted in London and which were partly

attributable to the Inner Loffdoj^ducation Authority.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATICTraSj^SCIENCE said that, assuming

that all went well with the House of OompKj&amp;s consideration of House of

Lords amendments that afternoon,  the Tochers&apos; Pay and Conditions Bill

would receive Royal Assent on Monday 2 B&amp;rch.    He would issue briefing

to accompany this event to all Members of Parliament explaining the

action he then intended to take, which would be as outlined to Cabinet

at its meeting the previous week.    Since that i^e^e^ing he had met with

the various teachers&apos; unions.&quot;   It was clear tlat ttgy felt very strongly

on the issue of negotiating rights and (as he FraTM^ayped colleagues) it

seemed likely that there would be industrial actWsuj^jf^some kind during

March.    It was too early to say what support this udfyA have amongst

ordinary teachers; the mood in the schools now was v/ry^*ifferent to

that of 18 months previously. \Sx\^

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that a

difficult situation had arisen in the London Borough of Haringey where a

baptist preacher, Mr Rushworth-Smith, was embarked upon a hunger strike

in protest at the plans of the local Council to carry out a policy of

?promoting amongst school children a positive image of homosexuals and

&lt;Jfr^nosexuality.    The hunger strike was now well advanced.    He had just

^Me)n informed that the Council had offered a meeting with

/Wr/^Rjishworth-Smith, but this was unlikely to be productive of a

dpXutX^ri.    He himself was constrained from action at this stage by the

fa^JxtnAt the Council had still not taken any action on which the

Educa^fojuAct 1986 or any other legal powers he posessed would bite,

thougS^&lt;^ey had made their intentions so to act plain.    He had written

to the ^fatfjrcil putting a number of questions to them, and was now

puttingpressure on them to produce an early response.    The media had so

far showtv^little interest in the case, although that might change as the

hunger strike progressed.

THE PRIME MINI^ERU summing up a short discussion said that the Cabinet

shared Mr RushW^tfr^Smith&apos; s antipathy to the actions of Haringey Council

which they would (s/eettjto counter in all the ways that they could. It

would be desirable^Tw^y the pressure of public opinion should be brought

to bear upon the CovfiZj^}    It was important, however, that any action of

the Government in rei J$ r\of this hunger strike did not prejudice its

freedom of manoeuvre rn Rtes-pect of future hunger strikes for less

desirable objectives.    T$e^ c*tuation would need to be monitored

carefully.   There was lil^Qyyea be growing media and Parliamentary

interest in the case.

The Cabinet -

1.     Took note. &lt;s^&gt;

Allegations

that War

Criminals

were Resident

in the United

Kingdom

THE HOME SECRETARY said that there were^likely to be considerable

problems in dealing with the allegations by the Simon Wiesenthal Centre

that a number of war criminals from the former Baltic republics were now

living in the United Kingdom.    Earlier that w^elcyhe had met the

all-party group that had interested itself ini^4l_fltatter and had

informed them of the numbers (though not the nairas~))\of the alleged war

criminals who were known to be still alive and VvvjumJS in the United

Kingdom.    This meeting had attracted some public i^y^fa^h was likely to

be repeated when he saw Rabbi Hier and some of his ^yW^agues from the

Simon Wiesenthal Centre in the following week.    EvenK/Tt^Mie Government

considered that convincing evidence had been produced a^a^KNt the

individuals concerned, there was considerable difficult^ltyjidentifying

what action might be taken.    Extradition to the Soviet Unt^^as at

present precluded because of lack of an extradition treatyoy%np.in any

case such action would be repugnant as there would be no guap^nrpee of a

fair trial.   Alternatively, if British citizenship had been ob/tra *ed by

fraud, it would be possible to deprive the individuals concerne&lt;L.&lt; ^it

and subsequently to deport them, although they would have an app aL^2


against the destination chosen.    Another option would be to accept

retrospectively Israeli claims of extra-territorial jurisdiction for war

JNcrimes against Jews.    There were manifest difficulties with all of these

^cvmrses.

TfV&amp;kRlViE. MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that the Cabinet

\agre&lt; X that,  if there was evidence that the individuals concerned were

g^Tty^pf the horrific crimes alleged, then it would be desirable that

the^impwld be brought to justice.    It was, however, equally important

to s^atfJ^DY the fundamental principle of United Kingdom law that a

person^a^ffled innocent of a crime until he was proved guilty.    To date

the onl^^evidence that had been produced to support the allegations were

references to books and documents not available in Britain. The subject

was a highly emotive one which the progress of the current war crimes

trial in Israelxould only exacerbate.    Nor did strong feelings run

entirely one wVfTVthere were some, including members of the Jewish

community, whoAd ni&lt;ired what they saw as the exploitation of terrible

grief and suffer/mfjfc&gt;r publicity purposes.    The Home Secretary should

continue to moniK^*o^&amp;elopments carefully, and should consult his

colleagues again ii^&amp;4x.ight of his meeting with Rabbi Hier the

following week. v^\^^

4.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said Uhd/the report would

appear that day in Washington of the Commission, cttptaejL by former

Senator John Tower, which had been investigating tn&amp;f^t\ of the

National Security Council with regard to arms sales Ng^^&amp;n and the

diversion to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua of funds gerre^ted by such

sales.    The contents of the report were expected to be ^JatJjmmiI to the

Administration.    The Government should be careful, in anV^cOTments on

the matter,  to avoid saying anything that could make the y^jC\&lt;

Administration&apos;s position more difficult. VlV^a

In discussion, it was noted that the continuing preoccupation vtyt&amp;xms

sales to Iran and diversions of funds to Nicaragua could well aam^f^f.he

strength of government in the United States for the remainder of^xhyy


Presidency of Mr Reagan.    There was a lack of co-ordination of domestic

policies.    As regards foreign affairs,  the new National Security

^NAdviser, Mr Frank Calucci, was proving as effective a co-ordinator as

^Vould be expected in the circumstances.    There was nevertheless a risk

^^bnat the remainder of Mr Reagan&apos;s Presidency would be an inactive period

ffi&amp;ftreigrx policy.    It was possible that a rapid reaction by the

Otmnjrf)\stration to the Tower Commission&apos;s report, including the

r^poap^pient of Mr Don Regan as White House Chief of Staff, would satisfy

the^^^Mcess, which was conscious of the President&apos;s continuing

popiJj^^ycy in the country.    But more reports by congressional committees

on th^/ ^S* sales affair were in preparation.

Nuclear

Weapons Test

by the Soviet

Union

THE FOREIGN AW^C^MMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Soviet Union had

that day carrvtd Mit an underground nuclear weapons test, the first test

since the Soviet//fnmn had declared a unilateral moratorium on testing

in August 1985. \|5h^3t&gt;vernment should point out in public that the

moratorium had beei^w^kLace for a period when the Soviet Union had

evidently not needed/^A^arry out tests and that this test must have

been in preparation &amp;g&amp;Vec ie months.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALT^^^ETARY said that the Prime Minister and

he had met on the previous day&apos;^fp^au 1 Nitze and Mr Richard Perle, who

had visited London as represenl(a^iv^\ of the United States

Administration for consultations^&amp;ouf* the Administration&apos;s policy

regarding the Strategic Defence Ini^tj^e (SDI).    Mr Nitze and Mr Perle

had said that further studies concexlJ*5&amp;&apos; SDI had been started in

Washington and there would be consultJU!^erJJte with the Congress as well as

with the allies of the United States, ^ne Prime Minister had made clear

to them that the Government supported r$e SDI research programme and

that it was a matter of common sense that research should be taken to

the point of establishing feasibility.    Mr Nitze and Mr Perle had

described the decisions on SDI which the Adrain^rtSsat ion needed to

consider.    There was no question of a decisidnonvearly deployment of

SDI; and the United States recognised that deprowfleTyt would be a matter

for negotiation with the Soviet Union, as had be\4n^^  ed by the Prime

Minister and the United States President at Camp L^^roin 1984. The

issue which the Administration had not decided was vrcfeyfax to change the

ground rules for the SDI research and testing prograflJme^O^d to start to

plan future tests on the basis of a broader interpretat raij^if what was

allowed under the Anti Ballistic Missile Treaty.    The P^^^Mdnister had

told Mr Nitze and Mr Perle that this question should depBM^J^yJ&apos;hether

it was clearly demonstrated that a change was necessary in ^ercdfeX to

establish feasibility, that a change would affect the prosptteM^tVr arms

control and that the United States should therefore put forvZykllyy

suggestions designed to preserve the prospects of achieving ari^PtOTtrol

agreements. ^^y/^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Ministers

of the member countries of the European Community (EC) had issued a

^statement on 23 February which gave a modest nudge to the peace process

j\in the Arab/Israel dispute.    They had said that their countries were

v^plsepared to welcome an international conference on the Middle East, but

&lt;^oJw not sought to suggest the participants or terms of reference for a

X^cja^terence.    The moderate Arabs would welcome this statement, which

vylp^also be helpful to the Foreign Minister of Israel, Mr Shimon

PejresAVrhe EC countries would need to proceed carefully in further

In dis^of^lon, it was pointed out that the idea of a conference had been

put forwVW^Dy Jordan.    Because of the way the Belgian Presidency had

handled the announcement, press commment on the statement by the EC

countries nad suggested mistakenly that it had been a reaction to Soviet

views.

THE FOREIGN AND COMl^^ALTH SECRETARY said that the move of Syrian

forces into West BerVu^j&amp; 22 February had taken place at the request of

various groups in the^t&amp; \\although not of the President of Lebanon,

Mr Amin Gemayel, who had &gt;rx*s&gt;essed his condemnation for the record. It

was not clear whether the^S^rran forces would succeed in reducing the

chaos in the area; nor whe^wie^/their intervention would increase or

reduce the dangers facing tfr^W&amp;^tern hostages held there.    The United

States and Israel had reacteaN,w*&gt;ft restraint to the Syrian move. The

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY^a^a that talks about Afghanistan

under United Nations auspices had resumep in Geneva on the previous day.

The member countries of the EC had made^lear to the Soviet Union on

23 February the need for a speedy timetable for the irrevocable

withdrawal of Soviet forces.    The Government wasalso giving support to

Pakistan, which was taking a courageous positi^tT\\in the face of the

major problems caused by the large number of A^h)MKrefugees on its

territory. (C3v

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that Brazil&apos;s decision to suspend

interest payments on its debts to commercial banks had been discussed at

the meeting of Finance Ministers and Governors of central banks of major

^Western countries in Paris the previous weekend.    The economic position

^af Brazil had deteriorated and the strength of the government of the

.&quot;Resident, Mr Jose Sarney, was uncertain.    The meeting in Paris had seen

Brazilian move primarily as a negotiating ploy, designed to secure

&lt;S^Yp^r terms in negotiations on their debts than had previously been on

c/fj!reo\ Negotiations between Mexico and the commercial banks about that

courf r&quot;VLs debts were well advanced.    The most important other country

facin^^cute debt problems was Argentina; but Ecuador and Chile were

also &lt;j3^frfficulty, as were some smaller countries.    It was hoped that

agreeme^jkcs^ould be reached quickly with Mexico and the smaller

countrie^^ leaving Brazil and Argentina as serious problems to be dealt

with.    ThV international debt problem, which had started in autumn 1982,

had become worse because many of the countries concerned were once again

in greater economic difficulties and a number of the creditor banks were

losing patienceVTmt it had improved in that many of the banks,

including the B^t^ta-h ones, had strengthened their balance sheets and

become less vulne(Yabpa to defaults by debtor countries.    In sum, the

problem posed by wg&amp;xb&apos;s action might not be as bad as it seemed,

although any agreera^rilVr^ached with Brazil was likely to be weaker than

agreement reached in(pije^a^st with other debtor countries.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHE^tf&amp;V^aid that the meetings of Finance

Ministers of developed Wester^/Jrauntries in Paris the previous weekend

had been well prepared.    The pu/ r s&lt;v had been to promote a greater

degree of stability in the foreiga^x^hange markets.    The United States

had undertaken to bring down its %udg t deficit and to stop &quot;talking

down&quot; the dollar.    The Federal Repwili^of Germany had agreed to make

further tax cuts, beyond those to wrCiyythey were already committed.

Japan had promised further measures tfy-^rxpand domestic demand and had

since cut interest rates.    There had be^n agreement to foster stability

of exchange rates around current levels.    Detailed agreement had also

been reached on the circumstances when concerted intervention in the

foreign exchange markets would be undertaken./&lt;5b&gt; far the markets had

reacted well to the outcome of the meetings, (butvgiven the surrounding

uncertainties, particularly in the United StareVP^h was unpredictable

how long this effect might last. V-^^O

It had been intended initially that an informal mee/fcnw^of the &quot;Group of

Five&quot; Finance Ministers - those of the United States^J^&amp;i&amp;United

Kingdom, France, the Federal Republic of Germany and JajriKKV- should take

place on 21 February, followed by a meeting of the &quot;Grqwp&apos;on Seven&quot; -

also including the Finance Ministers of Canada and Italyv^&gt;Mj\the

following day.   The informal meeting of the Group of Five &lt;f iawily taken

place, but the Italian Prime Minister, Signor Bettino Craxr^&gt;pia decided

at the last minute to withdraw his Finance Minister and the cmmor of

the Central Bank of Italy from the meeting of the Group of SeWn^retause

of the fact that it had been preceded by a meeting of the Group&lt;!of)^ve


from which Italy was excluded.    Signor Craxi faced an early general

election and appeared to be trying to enhance his prospects by playing

. up the international importance of Italy.    Signor Craxi had tried at the

\\Seven Power Summit meeting in Tokyo the previous year to have the Group

Jj8$ Five replaced by the Group of Seven.    As a compromise,  the Group of

^fi^e had been maintained but the Group of Seven had also been set up.

\p*jr)United Kingdom&apos;s interest was that the Group of Five, which was an

&lt;&amp;yBy ient body, should continue in existence.    Signor Craxi&apos;s threat to

cforceJ&gt;\Lhe Seven Power Summit in Italy later in 1987 need not be taken

sergpusfc.    But it was likely that he would continue to try by other

mean$/t^&gt;ecure the abolition of the Group of Five.

Tamils from Sri Lanka finding their way to Britain without proper

preside, were anticipated to start sffietame the following week.

Whichever way the decision went,  the ^fc^^^side would doubtless take

the case to appeal.    He was determined^^^Jlght the case vigorously, and

the Tamils were being kept in detention ^^ij^the case was pending. The

costs of their detention would be rec over aE^^ferom the airline only if

they were eventually sent back again within^a^Jktain period.

Since it might be some time before these legal proceedings were finally

resolved, and their outcome could not be confidently predicted, he had

no choice but to ask Cabinet to confirm their provisional decision at

the last meeting that urgent legislation should be introduced to enable

financial penalties to be imposed on carriers who broui^^kpeople to

Britain without the necessary valid documentation.    TmeBf^^t was that

there were very large numbers of people around the worlS^^^Lwould

prefer to live in the United Kingdom than in their own c^nto^^s and who

might not hesitate to travel here with bogus documents anoj^^^pnpt to

establish a toe-hold with more or less specious claims for^^laiLcal

asylum,  if that opportunity was left open for them. Maintena^K^f

immigration control required constant vigilance to block off d^ffifk for

evading the controls as they appeared.    The establishment the P*^R?|^

year of a visa regime in respect of the countries of the Indian

sub-continent had largely dealt with the problem of people from thq^^^l

i


countries entering the United Kingdom under the guise of short-term

visitors.    The abuse of political asylum status bid fair to furnish a

comparable loophole, unless urgent action was taken to deal with the

Imatter.    His proposal for taking power to impose financial penalties on

fl^irriers was in line with action by other countries, notably Germany,

^^aada and the United States,  and it should not expose the United

W Kjkdom to charges of stepping out of line with international opinion,

^restatement the previous week that the Government had such legislation

under urgent consideration, and that it might have to be retrospective,

had been reinforced by the Prime Minister in answering questions earlier

that week.    These statements were holding the position but it was an

essentially vulnerable one, and provision for sanctions to be imposed on

carriers^sW^ld be taken as soon as possible.    The proposals  in his

raemorandBSmi a fixed penalty enforceable in the civil courts took

account or^^H^stions by the Solicitor General at a meeting chaired by

the Lord Pr^^fe^^of the Council earlier that week.    The penalty should

initially be^^^J  per person, but be amendable by order.    He sought

Cabinet&apos;s appr^mK^ his announcing that afternoon that the legislation

would be introdu^Kjpd enacted as soon as possible.

THE SOLICITOR GENE^^^%j.d that two aspects of the Home Secretary&apos;s

proposals raised leg^J i^^ies of some  importance.    First,  although this

was ultimately a mattej ^^policy,  it would in his judgment be very

difficult to maintain that the proposed financial penalties should be of

a strict liability nature without any defence of &quot;due diligence&quot;. This

was particularly so because the present power to require carriers to

reimburse the expenses incurred in accommodating persons refused entry

to Britain specifically did noU^^end in respect of persons the falsity

of whose documents was not reaftn^ apparent.    He was sure that the

Home Secretary was wise to inclt^Ej^^somparable defence in his present

proposals.    Second, there was the^Mfe^^on of the proposals&apos;

compatibility with the European Com^^n on Human Rights  (ECHR). He

believed that the ECHR organs at Str^^^Wg would take the view that,

for the purposes of the Convention,  th^^ryosed penalty should be

regarded as criminal in character, even^BRfch it might be expressed as

an administrative penalty enforceable by*5^^^Llaw procedures in British

domestic legislation.    It was likely that^OT Aurt procedures the Home

Secretary had in mind would satisfy the guara i^ required by Article

6 of the Convention but more substantial proWems were raised by Article

7, which required that no-one should be held guilty of a criminal

offence in respect of an act which did not constitute an offence at the

time it was committed.    He was of the firm opinion that the ECHR organs

at Strasbourg would take the view that a carrier&apos;s act^^ing rise to

liability for the proposed penalty was protected by Am^rticle&apos;s

prohibition of retrospect ivity.    He believed that the^K^Brability

under the ECHR of any proposal to give retrosepct ive ef^Jfc^o the

proposed penalties would not escape attention during the^|^Pfclation&apos;s

passage through Parliament.    It  followed that he welcomed  efact that

in his memorandum the Home Secretary had dropped the ear 1 ie^^j^osa 1

for retrospectivity. ^JK^.


In discussion the following points were made -

| a.     The proposed legislation had severe implications for the

management of the Government&apos;s legislative programme. The

Opposition was unlikely to facilitate the Bill in any way, as the

^ Conservative Party had assisted the passage of the Commonwealth

^^^^ Immigration Act 1968, and the flow of legislation to the House of

Lords was therefore bound to be disrupted to some degree. The

major Bill that might be at most risk was the Criminal Justice

Bill, on the timetable for which a useful understanding had just

been reached with the Opposition in the House of Commons. Both

the ^^sent proposals and the Criminal Justice Bill raised issues

offtM^tand that customarily led the House of Lords to play its

rol?5rfWrevising chamber with care.    There was,  therefore, a

signr^Rfc^t risk to the Government&apos;s room for manoeuvre with the

legisnft^^^ rogramme as the Summer Recess approached,  and that

risk shcMW^W accepted only if the threat to immigration control

left absol30^^^no alternative to urgent legislation.

b. Any obv^^^^W.ocking by the Opposition of the Criminal Justice

Bill or the pr%^n^proposals would be likely to offend public

opinion.    On the^^^r hand,  it would not be difficult for the

Government&apos;s opponents to find ways of slowing down the progress of

these measures without the dilatory objectives for their actions

becoming evident.

c. If the present propos^fc were to be regarded by the ECHR

organs as being of a criAm^lcharacter,  there might be advantage

in taking the logic of thaK^kroach to its conclusion and

legislating to establish a^^^Ttiminal offence,  triable on

indictment,  rather than a prw^^fce enforceable in the civil

courts.    Such an approach wou^^n^id any difficulties of judicial

review.    On the other hand,  any^d^^tages it offered might be

bought at the price of yet  furtherJl^Miculties in Parliamentary

d. Without the agreement of the Op^s^p n to facilitate the

passage of the legislation, it would b^^everal weeks before the

Bill proposed by the Home Secretary could be taken to Royal Assent,

and it was unlikely that all the points raised in the current

judicial review proceedings could be taken to conclusion during

that period.    Introducing a Bill without retrospective effect would

simply highlight the vulnerability of the posittiWm A better

course might be to introduce the legislation wi^jp^a^fcrovision

giving it retrospective effect to the date of ita^^^ fncement, but

to be prepared to drop that provision towards the^^J^tthe Bill&apos;s

passage through Parliament.    That course would obtai^tW practical

benefits of a threatened retrospective power while avlfcd^^any

risks there might be from the ECHR.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that the C^B^L

agreed that the measure proposed by the Home Secretary was requ^e&lt;Jk

its merits:  the only real question was whether it should be taken^Jearl


on an urgent timetable or postponed until the following Session. Any

further disruption to the legislative programme was certainly unwelcome,

k   but the Government&apos;s duty was clear and Cabinet had concluded that the

^kpiH should proceed as a matter of urgency.    The Bill should include a

^^^due diligence&quot; defence as the Home Secretary proposed.    It should also

^ b^kintroduced with a provision giving it retrospective effect to the

of its formal announcement in Parliament, though the possibility of

deleting that provision later in the Bill&apos;s passage should be reviewed

in the light of events.    The Home Secretary should make an announcement

in the following week of the Government&apos;s intention to proceed with this

legislation.    That announcement should be made before the judicial

review proceedings concluded and,  if possible,  before they commenced.

Every eVvrV should be made to prepare the Bill and   bring it to

LegislatT^^tffcnmittee as quickly as possible.

1. Apprca^^^ie proposals  in C(87) 3  for legislation to enable

the iraposifinancial penalties on carriers,  subject to the

inclusion or^^H^ision giving retrospective effect as indicated

in the Prime ^k^s5fer&apos;s summing up.

2. Invited the^Jome Secretary to make a statement in the

following week of the Government&apos;s intention to proceed with this
