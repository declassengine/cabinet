1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the week beginning 20 April.

Westland P^Oy

^EHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he would make a statement

&apos;ftfp&apos;&amp;he House of Commons that afternoon about support helicopters and

&apos;&apos;Wes^land pic.    The Chairman of Westland pic, Sir John Cuckney, would at

tire s^)ne time be announcing to the workforce that there would be a

resj^jio-feur ing of the company involving a loss of capacity and job losses

whie+y^^ght amount to some one-third of the current workforce of 6,000.

Sir JyfaT/Cuckney would make clear that these retrenchments (which

reflecXfed previous over-manning and restrictive practices) were

unavoidable, regardless of the level of orders which the Government

might realistically place.    Indeed, the Government&apos;s orders of 16 Lynx

helicopters, 25^-jitility EHlOl helicopters and 7 Sea King helicopters,

together with/zwlmk. already in hand, had been instrumental in preventing

larger losses\^of H bs.    There might be criticism in some quarters about

the Governmentrs(ypoyition to pull out of the NH90 collaborative

helicopter proje^tv^Bhe Government&apos;s position on this was readily

defensible:  the ta&amp;tljkps that there was no requirement for medium-sized

helicopters of that/mr &lt;&amp;e.    Even if orders for NH90 helicopters had

been placed by the G^yftsWnagnt,  this would not have produced any jobs at

Westland over the next  d5*p-\pr five years, and would not therefore have

alleviated the cutback &lt;%/enmloyment by the company which would be

concentrated over the nex^-^^e\years.

Industrial

Action in

the Civil

Service

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR^fl^YMENT drew attention to the

implications of threatened industri-^Jr action in the Civil Service for

the payment of unemployment beneflt^Tr^rae effect of the action could

well be to inflict serious hardship oj/&apos;prfemployed people and others

dependent upon social security benefi&lt;T ^

The Cabinet -

1. Invited the Secretary of State for /SSeSsal Services and the

Secretary of State for Employment to con^ide^r urgently ways in

which any hardship created by industriaF^Z^roJi, in unemployment

benefit and social security offices for thas^gyoje-pendent upon

benefits could be mitigated. SslIs\

2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury (in^jJ^Ta^sence of the

Chancellor of the Exchequer) to co-ordinate with tn^Secretaries of

State for Social Services and Employment the presearaTyon of the

Government&apos;s position in relation to the indus triaSX^c^icvn.

3.      The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the problems of opening the

Japanese market to overseas, and particularly British,  trade and

investment.    In the discussion the following main points were made -

a.      Public hopes had been raised of early and favourable

^l/y   developments.    The apparent absence of such developments was giving

^/^rise to criticisms in the media of the Government&apos;s handling of the

v^\?ub ject.

The Government could make no comprehensive statement of the

^^yyfo\tt.t until various matters had been further considered and in

Varaficular until the Parliamentary Under Secretary of State,

Department of Trade and Industry (Mr Michael Howard) had returned

to this country after his visit to Japan.    There was a need for the

greatest possible urgency in reaching decisions and pressing for

decisionaries, be reached by the European Community (EC).

c. The^fiw 3~  policy should be to persuade Japan to behave more

fairly in fctoniiiic relations, while avoiding unfavourable side

effects frota fewjOmethods used to achieve this.    The Government had

been trying ixfo^^ipng time to advance along this path. The

appreciation ot^$f wen could be expected to be the biggest single

factor tending p6&gt;oh)S*^ge the pattern of the balances of Japanese

trade and paymenta^M^hough its effects were taking some time to

work through. ))

d. The three main avi^a^^f current interest were, first, the

attempt by Cable and IftMiiis pic (C&amp;W) to secure involvement in

the operation of telecom1nwH^&quot;tions in Japan; second, financial

services, where British iWtLAXions were not securing access to

Japan nearly as easily as J^Janp^e ones were securing access to the

United Kingdom; and third,  th^^j&amp; *all imbalance in visible trade

between this country and Japari^^J^&apos;

e. On C&amp;W, the Government must^le careful not to adopt a more

ambitious position on the company&quot;* behalf than the company itself

would be prepared to accept.    Discussions between C&amp;W and the

Japanese authorities on the share that the_^former might obtain in a

new consortium to operate telecommunicatfVo&apos;naWere continuing. It

was possible that the company might secure, arrangements which it

could accept as satisfactory. u^x)

f. In the financial field, the Government l^^mp^ed to bring the

reciprocity provisions of the Financial Servic s^&lt; K into force as

soon as possible. That would provide greater l&lt;y ^iwe for helping

British institutions to gain access to Japanese frp^&amp;J&amp;al markets

and in particular the stock exchange. It was impo^atmjto bear in

mind the risk that Japanese institutions might choo9^^ ^\ocate in

Paris rather than in London, to the detriment of Lond^^NA^Xan

international financial centre. \\y^l


g. On trade matters,  the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,

following the discussion in Cabinet on 2 April, had obtained

agreement at an informal meeting of EC Foreign Ministers the

S.        previous weekend to rapid consideration of four matters:

^V,^     proposals to impose anti-dumping duty on electronic components from

Japan, rapid action to avoid the diversion of Japanese exports of

/^^.semi-conductors to Europe if the United States took retaliatory

v^^Xjiction on these products, an early decision on the EC&apos;s position on

^^Jfegotiations with Japan under Article XXIV. 6 of the General

^^Cgj^eement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), which might involve the

C^tfJ&amp;inding of tariffs, and re-examination of the Community&apos;s case

)&amp;asrf&amp;t Japan under Article XXIII of the GATT.    Trade experts from

tlG^Community countries would study further action on these matters

at M meeting on 10 April.

h. The work already commissioned from officials concerning new

Japanese/woyiicts such as digital audio tape players, which might

soon be ^KfiOK^d in bulk to the United Kingdom, should be completed

as soon as /y$s&quot;s |ble.    It would be necessary to deal with the risk

that,  if tWeVJJut^ed Kingdom made the import of such products

difficult, th^PlfiAght nevertheless reach this country through other

countries in tbe Bj&amp;\  That underlined the importance of persuading

other Community ^en5niyries to take action as well.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  sumtfrfrf^yp the discussion, said that the criticism

in the media about the G owa^jpekn t&apos; s handling of the subject was an

additional reason for work ^^^kC^e matters discussed to be taken ahead as

fast as possible, with a viaiV^^Vioves by the EC and the United Kingdom

which would help to persuade ^kpap^to take early and effective action.

The Cabinet - &lt;^&gt;\

1. Took note, with approval^cl^pie Prime Minister&apos;s summing up

of their discussion. /

2. Invited the Secretary of the^^binet to ensure that the study

by officials of new Japanese products, which might soon be exported

in large volume to the United Kingdom, be rapidly completed.

Pakistan

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that ther^^^ been discussions

with the delegation accompanying the Prime MinisteVyM^akistan,

Mr Mohammad Khan Junejo, on his current visit to Br^^^V^About the sale

of three frigates to Pakistan.    The delegation appeared^p^iave arrived

without any united view.    They had pressed for concessi^ $ ^Akgarding

financial arrangements for the sale of frigates, and it ^radJdroved

possible for the Government to offer slightly more attractw^arms

within the existing policy decided by Ministers.    The mostxjvB^rX

arrangement would be for two frigates to be supplied to PakrOT^w/and a

third to be constructed there.    His aim was to secure from the ^ej^fe tani

Prime Minister&apos;s delegation a public commitment to this sale sovtb  \


detailed contractual arrangements could be worked out afterwards. He

would report back to colleagues.

In discussion, it was pointed out that it would be advantageous to place

^\a time limit on the cover offered for the frigate sale by the Export

^Mlredits Guarantee Department, so that other exporters who wished to take

/^advantage of the credit could do so if the frigate sale was not

w^Jwluded within a reasonable time.

THE^F^B^I AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Syria had deployed

troopsv&amp;t two camps of Palestinian refugees in Beirut.    This should ease

access Vb the camps and provide some relief of the suffering there. But

such relief was not certain to last.    The United Nations Relief and

Works Agency wer_e refusing to send in more convoys until they received

guarantees ofiySa^ty.    There was concern in Parliament at the plight of

the Palestinjv^asjiji the camps and also about the safety of a British

doctor, Dr Pauriye~sVitting, who worked for Medical Aid for Palestine in

the camp at BourN^-a^^Aarajneh.    There had been reports of death threats

against Dr Cut t ing^y 55be had refused to leave the camp until a

replacement doctor wa^/rfMowed in.    The Government was ready to help

with arrangements for^hAjrOdeparture when she wished and conditions

allowed.    The visits to^fcfoewJn i t e d Kingdom of King Fahd of Saudi Arabia

and Mr Walid Jumblatt, &lt;~tn &apos;&apos;foaader of the Lebanese Druze Community, had

not produced news about c^ve^Ai*ight of Mr Waite or of other Western

hostages held in Lebanon,  x^ha^Qovernment would continue to warn British

citizens against unnecessaryXvWy^ts to the dangerous areas of Lebanon.

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the informal

meeting of Community Foreign Ministers on 4-5 April had discussed East-

vWest problems.    There had been a widespread welcome for the Prime

&apos;Minister&apos;s presentation of Western views during the recent visit to the

*/8Vviet Union.    On Arab-Israel problems there had been some pressure

&lt;ytfi&gt;fain the Community for Ministerial contact with Syria.    The United

/J^nS^pm was seeking to dissuade Mr Tindemans, as President of the

Cowcvl,  from making such contacts.    There had also been discussion of
