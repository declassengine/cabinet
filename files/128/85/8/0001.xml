1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Commons in the following week.

Rate Support

Grant: Legal

Challenge by

Greenwich

Borough

Council

(Jtfxf^M) PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Sub-Committee on Local

AuM^efroty Expenditure of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic

Stra^^gy (E(LA)) had that morning considered the action that should be

tak ^i2^}response to the ruling in the High Court the previous week on a

legal^oaLjpenge brought by Greenwich Borough Council.    The effect of the

ruling^#&gt;s that the Secretary of State for the Environment was prevented

from proceeding with the main Rate Support Grant Report for 1987-88 and

the First Supplementary Report for 1986-87 in a way that corrected, as

he had intended, an error in the apportionment of road maintenance

expenditure bet^S^n London boroughs after the abolition of the Greater

London Council//   u(rjtil the error was corrected, Greenwich and other

boroughs that cS^^w^ernment would not especially wish to help would

continue to receixe^jncney that was unfairly gained at the expense of

other London borougtte^wiat had made greater efforts to control their

expenditure.    This Tn^eri^pty would certainly have to be put right, and

the choice before E(lv$^aA whether immediately to introduce yet another

piece of validating legislation or whether in the first place the

Government should appealr^fgypM^st the previous week&apos;s High Court ruling.

Even if the appeal were s\^c^4/sful,  legislation would be necessary

before the situation could^b^r^oaally rectified.    The statutory

provision on which the Gover\nm  u \s interpretation had been rul d

against had been drafted withXe^rf/c^al care in the previous year and an

opinion on its effectiveness hacTnveiflv obtained at the time from Mr

Robert Alexander QC.    For these and^rQaer reasons E(LA) had decided that

the right course on this occasionMTou^JP be to appeal against the High

Court ruling,  and they were minded ^?j a-fc^M necessary the appeal should

be pursued to the House of Lords.    TneNyeosetary of State for the

Environment would that afternoon annousru^^the decision to appeal,

together with the fact that he had no immediate choice but to lay Rate

Support Grant Reports prepared in accordance with the law as the High

Court had stated it to be in the previous week&apos;s case.

THE HOME SECRETARY said that it had become appareW^&amp;^the end of the

previous week that the Government were likely to kj&amp;^judicial

review proceedings brought against them by a number ^J^awLls claiming

refugee status.    The point of vulnerability had not beerrOtJfe original

point on which proceedings had been brought, namely the ^^^^ion of

access to independent advice from the United Kingdom ImmiSa^ai/ys Advisory

Service (UKIAS), but a separate point about the validity vm3^r&gt;cbe

Immigration Rules of the way in which the cases had been prMe^gBi. In

the light of this development he had decided to refer the 64^^^ ted

cases to UKIAS and thus ensure that the judicial review proceed tftt^g&apos;K

would not take place.    At the same time he had made a statement^emdj^kig

from future applicants for political asylum any legitimate expectwrfluya^


they might otherwise have of a right to have their cases referred to

UKIAS.    He had also announced the introduction of the Immigration

j   (Carriers&apos; Liability) Bill which would enable the imposition of a

^N&gt;enalty on carriers of entrants lacking valid documents, on the lines of

^AtyLs proposals discussed and approved by Cabinet in the previous week.

!&gt;/^Bhris Bill had had a good reception amongst the Government&apos;s supporters

^Afi^qRe House of Commons but was likely to have a difficult passage in

Vffe/ftouse of Lords.    Part of the problem was that there was insufficient

pvcepjpion of the fact that the United Kingdom&apos;s traditional welcome of

refrf^e-s  rom political persecution was now being exploited by people

from^J^fd World countries as a loophole in immigration controls:  in the

previoy^^eek alone there had been 48 claims for political asylum. It

was impVctant to ensure that the facts were more widely appreciated, so

that the^robust controls that were needed could rapidly be got into full

working order.

THE PRIME MINISTENt^kftming up a brief discusssion of the general issues

raise by these matu^ry^^aid that both the Greenwich challenge and the

Tamils&apos; case were fu w  Nillustrations of the way in which Ministers&apos;

proper exercise of thW&apos;r^Ksponsibilities was being endangered by the

expansion of judicial x^fc&amp;Qs.  It was clear that the utmost vigilance

was needed, both in the ^frrmiiDation of legislation and in the exercise

of powers under it,  to ens^tr^^Xat the risks of successful challenge

were minimised.    The Law Of^c^vhad already been asked for their

advice on what might be done\tct^ rotect the legitimate interests of the

Government in this field.    A MmmM question that needed exploration

was whether the resources avail&amp;fclVAjS  the Law Officers were sufficient

to enable them to carry out their^prcnjAr functions in this context.

2.      THE HOME SECRETARY said &apos;that, as foreshadtw *L&lt;t the previous

meeting of the Cabinet, he had met the head of trjf^jVon Wiesenthal

Centre, Rabbi Hier, at the beginning of that week|&gt; ^TpAbi Hier had shown

somewhat greater realism than he had expected and,^H^^  all, the

meeting had passed off reasonably well.

jof Appeal ^

THE HOME SECRETARY said that there had been recent reports in the media

that he was intending to refer to the Court of Appeal an allegedly

wrongful conviction in the Guildford bomb case.    In adherence to the

N&gt;ractice established by his predecessors,  the yardstick he used for

^c&amp;ciding whether to refer allegedly wrongful convictions to the Court of

^fgfpeal was whether any new and substantial consideration had come to

X^Jft. which had not been available to the court of trial.    A television

Vrog ffmme earlier that week had produced what it claimed was new

eweoA of an alibi in respect of one of those convicted in the

Gui i*f^)j?&lt;k case.    He would be considering this to see whether it met the

testMkS^iad outlined.

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Nuclear Arms

Control

3.      THE FOREIGN 1M0NWEALTH SECRETARY said that the statement the

previous weekend by^dh^^Seneral Secretary of the Communist Party of the

Soviet Union, Mr Mikl^a^^Gorbachev, changing the Soviet position

concerning reductionsWt^lYfcermediate Range Nuclear Forces (INF) had

been a response to long s^wfling proposals of the Western Alliance and

should not be described arv&apos;arajoffer initiated by the Soviet Union.

Mr Gorbachev&apos;s statement ,^iJipj5Nhad provided for the elimination of INF

in Europe, had improved the^Muyvphere in the negotiations on INF

between the Soviet Union and^h^United States in Geneva.    The positive

aspects of the statement include^p^fte setting aside of the link between

an agreement on INF and curbs os^h^Ajni ted States Strategic Defence

Initiative; and confirmation that^fene^&amp;oviet Union was no longer seeking

the inclusion of British and French-^dcl-ear weapons in negotiations on

INF.    Important points remained for^JSj^&amp;tiation.    The first was

verification of a treaty on INF.    Worl ^*^ his was well advanced among

the Western allies, but there was a neM^for further consultation before

definite proposals could be advanced byVhe United States in Geneva.

The position being considered by the Western countries would provide for

rigorous measures of verification,  including inspection of sites where

INF were declared to be deployed and challengayfnsWction of possible

undeclared sites.    This would&apos; involve the pos^vhiW-tv of Soviet

inspectors visiting Greenham Common and MolesworOt^ayp possibly other

military sites in Britain.    The second importantV^wjyprt where more work

was needed in negotiations was constraints on short^r^rjmge INF. North

Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) communique&apos;s follcwJfw \the Prime

Minister&apos;s meeting with the United States President a&lt;^&amp;m David in

November 1986 had made clear that the West sought constra^&amp;J^on the

longer range systems within this category and a provisio^ fiM NATO

could match Soviet levels, as well as agreement to hold fNq^ro^rX

negotiations on shorter range INF. (&lt;\V^

Some 316 of the 572 INF warheads which NATO had decided to dep^^^re

in place. A treaty eliminating INF in Europe would be a signifv*aiip\

success for NATO and a worthwhile consequence of the defence and ^ms^^


control policies of the Government.    In the next stage, the Government

should put the emphasis in its arms control policies on the elimination

^f chemical weapons and on negotiation towards a balance in conventional

forces in Europe.

 ^itf/di s cuss ion,  it was stressed that the SS-20 missiles which the Soviet

/J#$ro v would be allowed under an agreement to hold outside Europe should

De &gt;^s^ioned well beyond the Urals, since otherwise they could be moved

rapidj^pwithin range of Western Europe.    It was also pointed out that,

altKfflietC^in arms control agreement on INF would be between the Soviet

Union^Gyf t^ie United States, there had been close consultation between

the XSxMbysStates and its allies, notably those countries including the

United Kingdom where INF were based, on the positions taken in the

negotiations.    It would take some time, perhaps a number of months, to

negotiate the provisions about shorter range INF for a treaty.    A treaty

text would need^tra be agreed in 1987 if it was to be ratified while

Mr Ronald Reaj/an namained President of the United States.

It was pointed o&lt;cc tftat some spokesmen of the Opposition were publicly

stating that Mr Gtto&amp;nev&apos; s move was a success for the Campaign for

Nuclear DisarmamentVan^J^a setback for the Government.    The truth was

that, if the opponen^a^SvChe stationing of INF in Western Europe had

had their way, there wm&amp;T^kave been no chance of removing through

negotiations the large of Soviet SS-20 missiles threatening this

country and thus no prosf6rct)c)f a &quot;zero-zero solution&quot; eliminating INF

in Europe.    It was importaft^c^at the Government should stress this and

also all the various elemen^^v^the statement issued after the Prime

Minister&apos;s meeting with the States President at Camp David in

November 1986.    There would ottiYjw  e be a danger that Soviet attempts

to advocate a nuclear weapons f&gt;ee&gt;eftVie in Europe as a development of a

zero-zero agreement on INF would ^ain^urrency and the importance of

achieving a balance in conventiona^^ P  s would receive insufficient

attention.    The presentation of the^dj^rnment&apos; s position on the INF

negotiations and related matters shou(/^r considered collectively by

Ministers. \&lt;f

The Cabinet -

1.      Invited the Foreign and Commonwealtky^eriretary

and the Secretary of State for Defence tj)VxijJ&amp;^late

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, following publication

of the Tower Commission&apos;s Report on United States sales of arms to Iran,

^he President, had made three important appointments of - Mr Frank

^Oarlucci as National Security Adviser, Mr Howard Baker as White House

sOClrief of Staff and Mr William Webster as Director of the Central

^Httpll igence Agency.    All three appointments were good ones, especially

jtfl^vof Mr Baker, whose good relations with Congress would be an asset

fcy^eoAdministration.    In a speech on television the previous evening,

tms President had gone further than many people had expected in

acce^jf-ijjj^responsibility for what had happened.    It was hard to see how

he couyd/Vave made a more effective broadcast in the circumstances. But

the siVxt^lon would remain difficult, not least because more reports

would bevmade on the question of arms sales to Iran and the diversion of

funds to the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.

 Italy

THE FOREIGN AND (^MMj^WEALTH SECRETARY said that the Italian Coalition

Government led byVj^^^ttino Craxi had resigned on 3 March.    It had

served longer than vw^^K&amp;her Italian Government since 1945.    Contrary to

earlier expectationsV^VWis not certain that the Christian Democratic

Party would wish to provvdjp^a new Prime Minister.    It was therefore

possible that elections ^^H^vbe held quite soon.

Court Cases

Involving

[Members of

[Foreign

[Embassies in

London

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH  ^Jx$&amp;X said that the two current court

cases in London demonstrated the^cH^j^iculty of countering the interest

of the media in running stories avout,^lleged abuse of diplomatic

immunity.    The first concerned the ^^jj^sn Embassy in London. An

attach^ at that Embassy had seen a c-^e&amp;ision programme about murder of

prostitutes in London and had subsequ^^^y&apos;approached the police. The

Mexican Government and their AmbassadoV&amp;ad made it clear that they

would waive diplomatic immunity if police enquiries made it appropriate

for charges to be brought against this attach^.    He had undertaken that

he would be available to help the police in the^Lx enquiries.    The second

case concerned a chef at the Jordanian Embass/fwjro had been arrested on

suspicion of committing a series of indecent a&amp; a urt&gt;s on women and had

later been released.    The Jordanian Embassy were/iCo-^perating fully with

the police and had said that they were not claim\Jjj v4*^lomatic immunity

for the person concerned.    These two cases demonst^raraw:he Government&apos;s

success in making clear to Foreign Missions in Londop^^^t they should

not seek to misuse diplomatic immunity.

Reference&gt;-^

CC(86) 27.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the trial was taking

place in Malaysia of Mr Derrick Gregory, a British citizen accused of

possessing heroin.    In Malaysia the death sentence was mandatory in such

 &quot;^oases, but Mr Gregory had been arrested before it had been made

^msnadatory.    If the death sentence was imposed, legal appeals could take

ydIzq&amp;siderable time.    The British High Commission in Kuala Lumpur were

Ae^Jrog Mr Gregory.    It would not be appropriate for the Government to

coiM^f^ on the substance of the case.

4.    THE MINISWRqa AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at the

Agriculture CoKtrsj^^n 2-4 March decisions had been taken which had

finally endorsed(che/iuts in support for milk production agreed at its

meeting in DecembVc-^i 6.    In particular the new decisions meant that

from the beginning Vfi^l ^1987 milk marketing year butter intervention

could be suspended \{y&amp;ttxs to intervention exceeded a specified level.

The Council also c omp tenyd^kt s work on the package of socio-structural

measures which had been &lt;rf  ej^d in outline the previous December. The

Council had agreed not ta^^c/lJude within the package a potentially

costly scheme for paying nw^Jer^to retire early; whereas it had

retained two particular fea ?^s^if importance to the United Kingdom: a

scheme to encourage a more ex^rfftfrve type of farming which linked

directly with British ideas for/t^^^al land diversion; and a scheme

which would allow for CommunityWundJAg for environmentally sensitive

areas, a concept which the United^uj^j^om strongly supported.

Energy

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said^at on a number of occasions the

Commission had wanted to open talks between the Community and the

Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries  (CiREC).    In view of the

United Kingdom&apos;s general antipathy to a dialorfyre&gt;^tween producers and

consumers it had opposed such ideas.    The Comm^^s be&lt;v had then suggested

that talks could be at a technical level, about wnicw the United Kingdom

had again shown its concern.    At the end of 1986\ jrj ^2^mmissioner

responsible for energy matters, Commissioner Mosar^^oo^publicised in

the Luxembourg press the idea of technical talks betmp&amp;^he Community

and OPEC which could lead to political talks.    WithinV^^ommunity the

United Kingdom had made clear its dislike not only of th^^tjcess

proposed but also of the action of the Commissioner in pl^funng

initiatives favoured by only a minority of member states.vj&amp;Mjteped that

the United Kingdom would take advantage of any further oppo^luai^ies to

make its views known to the Commission. ^^^fy/y
