The Budget

Isy^bY, PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to congratulate

ana^K^^s presentation of it on the media.

Unemployment

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 5.3

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he would later that day

announce the u^fgj&amp;sloyment figures for February, which showed the largest

fall since recrard^) had been kept.    The unadjusted figure had fallen by

71,000.    The s^a^S^ily adjusted figure had fallen by 44,000. The

seasonally adjusf^dytfi^ure had now fallen by 150,000 in seven months.

The seasonally a*j J^eyu figure for January had been revised:  instead of

showing a very smart^Mjj^ease in unemployment,  it now showed a fall of

2,000.    Vacancies fdVj^OT^had fallen slightly in February. These

figures were encouragong*&gt;^rhey were for a five-week period, which

included a time of part^^S^aMy cold weather.    The figures had fallen

despite there having beew^io/increase in the number of people starting

work under the Government^s^r e\ial employment measures.    On the other

hand,  the &quot;re-start&quot; prograrome^^phich helped unemployed people to find

work again, and the programms^^wAesting, to ensure that people were

available for work when they ryn^^cegistered for unemployment benefit,

were clearly having positive erfec,ire ^n the unemployment figures. The

availability tests were now beinjy&apos;und^taken at the great majority of

benefit offices.    The seasonally a^JjsJjg^ unemployment figure was likely

to continue to fall at an average raT&amp;^r^about 20,000 a month. It

would be widely expected that the tot4^^dmber of people unemployed

would fall below 3 million some time d\xing the summer months of 1987.

He would not himself make predictions or this kind, but equally would

not discourage them.

In discussion, the following, points were made^^^^

a. The economy was now generating jobs at//a nwch faster rate than

in recent times.

b. The fall in unemployment in February had h^^^^Ation-wide.

Wales had had the greatest fall of any part of weT^njied Kingdom.

In Scotland,  there had been the largest monthly f aLj ^j l\the

seasonally adjusted figure since April 1978. \C j)

c. The fall in vacancies for jobs in February had t&gt;e^f^V 

concentrated in south eastern England;  in Wales and otn\r^*eas the

number of vacancies had increased. /rs^


d. The Government&apos;s practice had been to assume that the number of

registered job vacancies should be increased by a multiple of three

in order to indicate the likely number of jobs available in the

^ country.    It was possible that the number of registered job

\\ vacancies was falling as a proportion of total vacancies available,

and it would be worth considering whether to undertake market

^Jly/y   research in order to establish whether the multiple needed to be

(y/^^^ce v i s e d.

It y&amp;s also noted that the Retail Price Index, which would be published

larK^it week, was not likely to be greatly changed from the previous

TK^Cabinet -

Took note.

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Finland

3.      THE FOREIGNSttJ^OOMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that,  in the general

elections in Finland/&gt;Br^^5-l6 March,  the Centre-Right parties had won a

majority for the firss^jrtme since the Second World War. Coalition

governments based on varr^Jte combinations of parties were possible.

Whatever the compositio&lt;vj f&gt;*ivhe new Government, British interests were

unlikely to be affected.\X_^/J,.

)C(86) 42.4

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECTO^RY said that the Foreign

Affairs Council on 16 March had discussal trade relations with Japan,

with a view to further action to open up the Japanese market. The

Japanese response to the Community&apos;s pressure on alcoholic drinks had

been inadequate, and this was being pursued undeivthe procedures of the

General Agreement on Tariffs, and Trade (GATT)tf   Tnte. Council had now

invited the Commission to examine the scope fo&lt;3b^^er access to the

Japanese market for other specific sectors,  in pfc^tijaular automobiles

and medical equipment, and to follow this up witrs!!&amp;J Wapanese

Government.    At United Kingdom initiative the Commvsy3xiar^would report

progress to the Council in July so that the Council v^^Vt nsider what

further action might be needed.    The Council had alsoMnaoe^jlear that,

if the United States were to take further protectionist^JJ  j&amp;res

affecting Community exports, action would be taken. Thi^o^a )intended

to strengthen the hand of the United States AdministratiorK-K^p&amp;sisting

protectionist pressures from Congress or particular interesx&lt;^g^oMos. In

discussion it was said that the recent Japanese record in pr&amp;rj&amp;ins

opportunities for foreign suppliers to compete in their marker //vr?ry

unsatisfactory.    It appeared that the Japanese authorities wereMfow \


taking steps to squeeze Cable and Wireless pic out of a good share in

the opening up of telecommunications in Japan.    It was important that

Japan should make a greater contribution to the open trading system from

\which she drew so many advantages.    It was for consideration whether the

^vtaited Kingdom Government should use its own powers on financial

^services to exert some pressures on the Japanese.    Ministers would need

/fty&amp;pok further at the question of trade relations with Japan.

^5&gt;e Cabinet -

^^7/ .Invited the Secretary of State for Trade and

ywjtfrry,  in consultation with the Foreign and

Commonwealth Secretary and the Chancellor of the

Exchequer,  to submit a further memorandum to the

Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy,

Sub-Committae on Economic Affairs on ways of improving

United KjWgdjrtn opportunities in the Japanese market.

Commission

Proposal for

a Tax on Oils

and Fats

THE FOREIGN AND COMM^JSaklH SECRETARY said that,  on a United Kingdom

initiative, the Forer#ri&quot;^r airs Council had discussed on 16 March the

external aspects of the J^HjJmission&apos;s proposal for a tax on oils and

fats.    The member statesV&amp;apdarting the tax had taken a low profile.

The United Kingdom&apos;s oppoVfcf^erfjXto the proposed tax had been strongly

supported by the Federal Reral&amp;r^of Germany and Portugal and slightly

less strongly by the Netherl^tad^ind Denmark.    It was satisfactory that

the Dutch Cabinet, despite som^Aw^arent differences of view among

Ministers, had now decided to o^ pos^Ahe proposal.

In discussion it was pointed out th^^^i re were two strong arguments of

trade policy against the tax:    the ( ^^&amp;e on the trade of a number of

developing countries and the prospect/^^etaliation by the United

States against Community exports.    In Wfe agricultural price package,

however, there would be pressure on theVederal Republic of Germany,

which was particularly concerned with agri-monetary proposals, to change

its view on the tax in order to achieve its othejL objectives.

ir Transport

revious

ef erence:

C(86) 37.4

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that Com^^f/ppev Sutherland

had now persuaded the Commission to take legal actioi// ^^ast Alitalia,

Lufthansa and Olympic Airways, this action being suspa( d^jvEx&gt;r three

weeks in order to maintain pressure on them.    This action^ ^ \welcome,

and improved the chances of making progress on further li &amp;fal\sation

and lower air fares. ^^/V^v




THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reported that the Commission had

now given its agreement to the  680 million of aid associated with the

disposal of the truck and bus operations of Rover Group.    It was very

^satisfactory that the agreement between the Secretary of State for Trade

, yfid Industry and Commissioner Sutherland had brought this to a

^itronclusion without controversy.

Central

Electricity

Generating

Board

Ordering

from British

Firms

THE^s 5p(ETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that it appeared that the

Commi^^i^i services were probing the extent to which the Central

Electricity Generating Board (CEGB) was placing orders with British

firms. Mie considered that the Commission should be pressed to desist

and that Lord Cockfield should be approached.

In discussionyfFSvkas pointed out that questioning of CEGB action by the

Commission se^roejjHjarticularly inappropriate in view of the difficulty

experienced by tfjfit^y Kingdom companies in obtaining certain orders,

such as that for^r^rfVy for Brittany Ferries, on which other

Governments had ap(p^aXeja*ly brought pressure to bear in favour of their

own companies. ///^\
