Opposition Day}

(5th Alloted

bay)

^Hfi/RRIME MINISTER,  summing up a short discussion of the Opposition

Moc^ouvfor 20 January entitled &quot;The Divided Nation - Failure of the

Gover^w^nt&apos;s Economic Policies&quot;,  said that the prosperity of the north

and^sojaj^h of the country was by no means in such sharp and simple

contMjtSjB the Opposition made out.    In many ways the contrast between

the inxivy cities and the outer suburbs and smaller towns and cities was

more stVpv&apos;and more intractable.    There were many stories of success

from aliwie regions:  the pattern was a subtle and complex one. The

underlying problem, which was shared by all Western industrialised

countries, was the shedding of jobs from the traditional manufacturing

industries, and.^eta\ geographical concentrations of those industries.

The Leader of tne Opposition had indeed recognised this.    The Government

had consistentry^p*3i*S.ed home its belief that the way forward must lie

in the encouragementJQf enterprise and of an inventive and

entrepreneurial spw?#^7  In contrast,  the Opposition&apos;s policies of

economic management^apt^iot likely to encourage investment by

multinational organisw^ccrfTO, and, at a local level, the activities of

some left-wing dominated^ioejal authorities did not provide a propitious

climate for industrial iwgxfchent.    Furthermore the Labour Party&apos;s

policies on nuclear power\^nd/ Jthe nuclear weapons programme would tend

to increase unemployment in^t(aw)\parts of the country,  including in the

north and in Scotland.    The &lt;Gov^rj ment&apos; s policies on these matters were

consistently positive and no okj&amp;ytunity should be lost to present them

in a positive fashion. ^^/\

Criminal

[justice

Bill

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Crimi^aV^ustice Bill was a very large

and important measure that touched on mffqy Departments&apos; interests,

especially in respect of commercial crime, and would excite a good deal

of interest in both Houses.    He still hoped that in order to ease the

Bill&apos;s passage in the Lords it would be possible -to take the Bill

through the House of Commons without recourse/fo a)guillotine motion,

but in order to achieve this he might need to^cgk^f&amp;r his colleagues&apos;

co-operation at short notice on various matters.(f ))

The Cabinet - &lt;^^^\

Took note. &lt;^\&gt;yy


HOME\$0^ 

Unemp 1 oyra^j^V

figures \^^/

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he would be

announcing that day that the seasonally adjusted figure for unemployment

I had fallen by 28,000.    The cumulative fall over the past six months was

^ow over 100,000 which was most encouraging;    unemployment was now lower

^bXan it had been a year ago.    While the figures for Scotland in December

N*Lar&amp; been disappointing,  it was noticeable that the fall in unemployment

yifyiy\the year had been greatest in the north,  in Wales,  in the north

md West Midlands.    In announcing the figures he would however take

caipe^rtystress that the current period of bad weather would affect the

empioyj^nt figures in two months&apos; time.

THE PRIrffl^M^NISTER,  summing up a short discussion, said that one

drawbac^^T the present recording system was its in-built delay. The

picture presented by even the most up-to-date official statistics was

therefore already an inaccurate representation of the actual position,

and understated the buoyancy of the economic recovery.    One useful

measure of acty^?5\which had been used in the United States, was a

comparison of { e \eituations vacant&quot; columns of local newspapers over a

period of time.^^mF^eymaster General should consider what research

work might usefulw_J&gt;j//carried out along these lines.

The Cabinet -

1. Took note, withj^Mroval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their^d^tfaksion.

2. Invited the Paymasj r&lt;^&amp;neral to proceed

as indicated. X\

Takeover Bid

for Pilkington

Brothers pic

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND^Ofl&amp;TRY said that he had received

advice from the Director of Fair Tr adifr&amp;^J^t there was no case for

referring the takeover bid by BTR pic fa^Ti Iking ton Brothers pic to the

Monopolies and Mergers Commission (MMC)/^He was satisfied that the bid

fell quite clearly outside the category of cases to be referred to the

MMC under the guidelines governing such referrals and he had therefore

decided, acting in the quasi-judicial capacity Jt(&amp;&amp;ad to adopt in such

cases, to accept the advice and not to refer tHeby to the MMC. He

should warn colleagues that this decision was lrky y-^p be challenged in

the House of Commons where an Early Day Motion urt^n^g/Aim to refer the

bid to the MMC had attracted over 70 signatures. ^&quot;/O^Aa

Effects of the

Exceptionally

Severe Weather

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the a^^&gt;enient

earlier in the week that exceptionally severe weather paymen|#^b$Ud be

guaranteed for that week for all those within qualifying grouwy^ met

with a generally good reception in the media.    A decision woulq^a^ejKto

be taken shortly whether to repeat the procedure for the followii^p^we&amp;k.

He had also asked his junior Ministers to ensure that there was sen^pfl^


co-operation between his Department and voluntary organisations about

the problem of single homeless people sleeping rough.    These exchanges

had been misleadingly reported as implying open-ended financial support

i  for the activities of such organisations in this field; steps were being

^^aken to correct this.

^&gt;

&apos;/yl/y^ The Cabinet

^&quot;^^     Took note.

3.      TH^^OREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Soviet Union

had declared a ceasefire in Afghanistan starting that day.    This was

part of the generally skilful efforts of the General Secretary of the

Communist Party^-o-t the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev,  to present a

more accommodatingjand peaceful face to the world.    It came at a time

when Pakistan xgj^*ajs.ing increasing difficulties because of the presence

there of 3 milli p rijEugees from Afghanistan and when a further round of

the United Nat ions^jo^tftiat ions on Afghanistan was due soon to take

place; and at a tiilS^yg^^ear when weather made military operations

against the resistan^ ^ rces especially difficult.    The Government

would be active in drSw^g^sublic attention to the real nature of Soviet

policy in Afghanistan, oa$^* ularly the continued presence there of some

110,000 Soviet forces. &lt;X^j)

In a short discussion,  it w^p^voved that the Soviet Union, which was

occupying Afghanistan, was i^&gt;^Qect asking the national resistance

forces to lay down their arms Tftfw &gt; he occupation continued. Those

forces seemed unlikely to obligW^&gt;^\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY\&lt;aid that the Foreign Minister of

Spain, Senor Fernandez Ordonez, had visited London on 13 and 14 January

and held talks with himself and with the Prime Minister.    Senor Ordonez

was not an impressive figure.    His manner, with^his own officials or in

talks with British Ministers or before the meiyS^yuas always benign and

nervous.    He had tried to give the press the \tar^Ls&gt;ion that his line

with British Ministers on Gibraltar had been morie/Tonus t than in fact

had been the case.    The Government were trying tsQ-^wJr&apos;tove the atmosphere

surrounding the matter of Gibraltar by co-operatiofyO/jthe area between

Spain and Gibraltar.    There was no serious difficult^^^Vaintaining

this policy. &gt;\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Iran had launched an

offensive in the southern sector of the front on 24 December 1986, which

\Iraq had rapidly repulsed, using chemical weapons among others,

 ^.second offensive had begun on 9 January east of Basra.    There were now

vreuiorts that fighting might have started in the central sector east of

,Sf ^idad.    There had also been more air attacks than for some time by

^eflptWcountry on the other.    The situation had worsened and the risks to

BdrttLfiA citizens in the area had increased.

Lebanon

THE FOROGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that Mr Terry Waite, Special

Representative of the Archbishop of Canterbury, was visiting Lebanon.

Officials of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were in touch with him.

Two British hostages in Lebanon, Mr Alec Collett and Mr John McCarthy,

might still be/^rTryve and there was also one dual national.    Mr Waite

would be makinW^nVuiries.    There had been unconfirmed reports that

Mr McCarthy mignf/^Seyteleased.    Mr Waite had given foreigners in Lebanon

the sensible advi^&amp;^Aaf. they should keep away from West Beirut. A

French national hao^wsKUseized by gunmen in West Beirut since

Mr Waite&apos;s arrival, dmjXfrtVe number of French hostages in Lebanon now

stood at six, compare^^Xfv four at the beginning of 1986.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTHoSK^RSTARY said that the United States

Secretary of State, Mr George^KM^, with whom he had held talks in

Bermuda on 6 and 7 January, had p eX\in good form.    He was carrying on

with his job, and believed that th^S&apos;Oate Department might now have come

through the worst of the effects of^Hfent revelations of United States

arms sales to Iran and the diversio^tffi^esulting funds to the Contra

forces in Nicaragua.    Mr Shultz was t^Mij^a close interest in the

question of further moves in arms conC^M^negotiations with the Soviet

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had discussed

with the United States Secretary of State, Mr Shultz, at their recent

l meeting in Bermuda the dispute over the effects of the accession of

fin and Portugal on United States exports.    He had made clear to

Shultz that the Community would respond with equivalent measures at

same time if the United States were to impose the restrictions they

^threatened to impose on certain Community exports to the United

tass.    The volume of Community trade affected by the proposed United

Stg^s^restrictions was about $400 million, of which about $80 million

wouLOe^exports of gin from the United Kingdom.    The Community&apos;s

counljg^^Sfieasures would be concentrated largely on United States supplies

of corny^Hj^en feed; if the dispute were not settled, the size of the

supplementary charge would be decided by the Foreign Affairs Council

later in\^anuary.    It was important that the United States should

understand the seriousness of the Community&apos;s purpose, since the United

States claims were too high and would have to be brought down if a

settlement wer^t^vbe reached.

THE SECRETARY OF^Ta^E FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that there would be

further talks be^vepwXhe Commission and the United States before the

Foreign Affairs Cou ^*/on 26-27 January.    The United States measures,

if implemented, would&apos;/fo^k pricing British gin out of the United

States market.    He traugla^it right that the Community&apos;s

counter-measures should cjxj^entrate on corn gluten feed, which was

important for the sectoiC^&amp;Xbmited States agriculture which was most

directly concerned with Nte^^erj^inal area of dispute.    Nonetheless, it

was clearly in the Britisti&apos;JnS^vest that a settlement should be reached

during January,  since a comp^pwi^B* would be better than a potentially

escalating trade war.    He had^^^tnwid that,  if an agreement had not been

reached at the Foreign Affairs /tjmit^il,  the Community might offer

binding arbitration.    It would De^^J^se, however, to signal this

possibility in advance while negoria^ons continued.    More generally, he

considered that the protectionist ^a^Ves in the United States would

continue to be strong over the comin^y^ea^ and might give rise to

further difficulties.    At the heart o^o^Jre problem was the United States

trade deficit, which was about $170 bii\ion for 1986 and about

$19 billion for November 1986 alone.

In discussion the view was endorsed that it woj*WL be in the British

interest to reach a settlement if possible diming))January, since the

effects of a trade war would be likely to spre^oL^I&amp;sther  The

possibility of arbitration had already been sig//llad by Dr Bangemann,

the Federal German Minister of Economics, but itS*t *C  be appropriate

only if an agreement could not otherwise be veach4 WL&gt;^&gt;

The pressure on United States opinion of the trade de-fTlyiXA their

imports now being twice as large as their exports, was with the

United States budget deficit and diminishing confidence wgtjm dollar.

Substantial expenditure by the Japanese authorities in suppejF^of the

dollar in a recent period had had little or no effect.    Tr a^ \t Ma s i on

also reflected the big change in world agricultural export m^j^aVs as

improvements in domestic production in former importing countr^^&amp;Losed

off outlets for United States grain land the products of other aevejj^ed


countries.    These changes supported the arguments which the United

Kingdom had been making for reforms in the operation of the common

|^ Agricultural Policy.    This effect would be even more marked if the

^?&quot;Soviet Union, now an importer of cereals, were able to make good the

&quot;^^ficiencies in its domestic production.

THE^^GJLLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that, despite the efforts of

the fitSarfp^d Kingdom Presidency,  there had been no agreement between the

Councithe European Parliament on the proposed Community budget for

1987.    tj((e Community was therefore operating on the regime known as

provisional twelfths.    The conditions for reaching an agreement had been

improved by the decisions of the Agriculture Council in December. The

Commission and the Belgian Presidency were now seeking an agreement

which, while n^^&amp;Aceeding the 1.4 per cent value added tax ceiling,

would involve Womn xments above the maximum rate of increase for

non-obligatory ex^eTToiture.    The United Kingdom would not agree to

exceeding the mawiauK^rate and seemed likely to be able to rely on

support from France^MWJihe Federal Republic of Germany to defeat it.

The Commission and Be/Tflfijffnv Pres idency were also proposing an arrangement

of doubtful legality i^y*&amp;v&amp; form of a negative payments reserve. It

might be necessary to takp/*j*rther legal advice on this point.    It was

expected that there woul^K&amp;e&apos;y\ further Budget Council the

following day. v~&quot;^^*V
