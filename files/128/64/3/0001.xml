^rliamentary1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.^reignaffairsSo^alia^fe^nce:S^B) 10thw^eions,Ml*ute 3 &apos;2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that at a meeting with president Siad Barre of Somalia on 21 June, the President had pressed strongly for us to supply his country with arms.    He had made it clear that it was not possible for us to do this so long asSomalia&apos;s problems with Kenya were unresolved.    The president was entitled to sympathy for having extricated his country fromSoviet domination and we were of course providing civil aid.There was a strong anti-Marxist element in Somalia, which was probably larger than the pro-Marxists.    It was important that thecountry should not move back into the Soviet sphere, but they wanted arms and these we could not provide.The Cabinet -Took note.AF^IUNlTY 3, THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said he was disturbed about recent Press stories which gave the**- erroneous impression that individual Ministers were taking extremeCqjj^ positions in Brussels which were not in conformity with what had^8he ^ been agreed collectively in the Ministerial committee. Moreover,f*o^ ries at the recent Council of Fisheries Ministers, there seemed to havebeen a widespread impression that the position taken by the United^tevjo Kingdom on the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) was based solely^efc,.   8 on electoral considerations.CoM^ *2th THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODMinUte8^0n8, confirmed that several of our Community partners appeared tobelieve that our position would be more flexible after a GeneralElection.    While some elements in our position were negotiable,it seemed unlikely that there could be any change in our principalrequirements.    The attitude of our partners had made it impossibleto reach any agreement on revision of the CFP and some nationalconservation measures would now be necessary.    But we could probably count on the understanding of the Commission and other member States were expecting us to take action, especially to banherring fishing off the west of Scotland,    This restriction would bear more heavily on our own industry than on others.The Cabinet -Took note.
 form ofAction 2 of&quot;he officialecrets act9u: draftfHXTE paper4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home SecretaryCP(78) 65 to which were attached revised paragraphs on opengovernment for a draft White Paper on the reform of Section 2 of theOfficial Secrets Act 1911.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Cabinet had previously agreed that*tevj the passages on open government included in the draft White Papertefe 0US circulated with his memorandum CP(78) 61 should be recast, but had*M(7o\nCe: deferred a final decision on whether the White Paper should be published;0n . &apos; ?^th until he had seen a deputation from the National Executive Committeefcaut^0118&apos; (NEC) of the Labour Party.    He had now met the NEC, who seemed toaccept that, although the White Paper would not meet the Manifestocommitment to put the burden on public authorities to justify withholdinginformation, reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 was a necessary precursor to any wider measure of this kind.    The best way todeal with this situation would be to leave   the issue open in the white paper and promise further study.In discussion it was accepted that even though a White Paper on the lines proposed would be unwelcome to those who were committed to freedomof information legislation, this was not a reason for not publishing it.The draft met the commitment in The queen s Speech to bring forwardlegislative proposals for the reform of Section 2 of the Act, and thosewho were not satisfied could continue the debate after the White paper had been published.    Access to official information had to be seen inthe context of the need for efficient government and unrestricted access,even within defined limits, would reduce efficiency.    Those who acceptedresponsibility for taking decisions should be entitled to some privacywhen doing so.    For ordinary people, the appointment of theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration (under a former labour government) had more significance than the ability of the Press to gainaccess to official files.    The Government1 s proposed categories ofinformation covered by criminal sanctions closely resembled theexemptions from the right of free access in the United States, and swedish legislation which some critics were urging the Government tocopy, and in practical terms their effect might not be very different.In further discussion it was suggested that the White Paper should recognise that there was not necessarily a conflict between openness and security and that indeed the maintenance of a stable, democratic societydepended on free access to information.    The public had in recent yearsbecome much more aware of what was happening in government and thistrend was to be encouraged.    Even though United Kingdom legislation should not be unduly influenced by United States or Swedish practice,which reflected different constitutional systems and different politicaltraditions,   wa had to recognise that the United States and Swedish Actscontained a positive right of access to information which was not specifically exempted.    This could make a crucial difference to theattitudes of, and relationships between, Ministers and officials on theone hand, and Parliament and the public on the other.
As regards the proposal for further study of the practice in othercountries, the Home Secretary had proposed that officials mightassemble more detailed information about practice   elsewhere andrelate this to our own circumstances and the cost that would be involved.    The study could be published in due course.    It wassuggested that it would be better to appoint a Select Committee toconsider the scope for greater openness:  it could include formerMinisters and other Members with a wide variety of experience ofgovernment and other organisations;  its discussions would be public;and its appointment, with Members from both sides of the House, would recognise that the issues went wider than questions of party or evenParliamentary interest.    On the other hand, there was a risk that a select Committee composed on traditional lines would be ineffectiveand much would depend on its composition and the Members1 owninclinations and interests.    It would therefore be better for theGovernment not to refer to such a possibility at this stage.The following points were   then made on the draft text.Paragraph 39*    The first sentence provided an unsatisfactory link between the sections on reform of Section 2 of the Act and OpenGovernment.    The words &quot;especially sensitive&quot; should be omitted fromthe fourth sentence.    The last sentence should make clear that reform of Section 2 was also necessary on its own merits.Paragraph 41.    It was agreed that the sentences referring to roadplanning should be slightly expanded to include references to opennessin other fields.Paragraph 42.    The use of the word &quot;feasibly&quot; in this paragraph andin paragraph 45 was inappropriate and an alternative expression shouldbe found.Paragraph 45.  The first sentence should be redrafted to acknowledgethat the Governments proposals did not match up to the wording of the1974 Manifesto.    The draft should then go on to explain that theGovernment was not yet convinced that the latter approach was the rightone but that it had an open mind.Paragraph 46.    Various figures had been quoted in the Press and inParliament as estimates of the cost of operating the Freedom ofInformation Act in the United States, and there were wide differences between them.    The figure given in this paragraph was too uncertainto stand as an authoritative estimate and would be open to considerable criticism.    The point about costs should be made, but in more general terms.Paragraph 48.    It was for consideration whether the draft should includereferences to possible non-statutory means of securing more opennessin Government, for example on the lines of the recent proposals by theInternational Committee of Jurists (although that body should not be mentioned specifically).    The word &quot;statutory&quot; should be deleted from
the second sentence.    The fourth and fifth sentences should be deleted and a sentence on the following lines should be added at theend of the paragraph:&quot;We shall initiate a more detailed study than has so far beenpossible of overseas experience and its relevance to ourown constitutional system, in order to see what further action, statutory or otherwise, may be desirable, and weshall announce our conclusions from this study in due course&quot;.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved publication of the proposed White Paper on the reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 19X1, but the HomeSecretary would revise the draft paragraphs on open government,annexed to CP(78) 65, on the lines indicated in the discussion.There had been no agreed view in the Cabinet on the question whethera Select Committee should be appointed to examine the scope for further measures to promote open government, and the White Paper should therefore not refer to this possibility.   The Home Secretary should circulate a revised text of the draft section on open government to members of the Cabinet for any final comment before arranging for publication of the White Paper.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theHome Secretary to proceed accordingly.top Bt^BODY:k   &quot; Report5.

AcumenT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO 36CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 23rd Conclusions, Minute gThursday 22 June 1978 at 10. 30 amty^f^fcJES      The Cabinet had before them the 10th Report from the Top SalariesIPq^ BODY       Review Body (TSRB), together with a memorandum from theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(78) 64) setting out the main questions for decision as identified by the Ministerial Committee on Economice 0Us Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)).^ 8th THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the problem ofte^0118&apos; t0^ sa*ar*es ^ad always been a difficult one.    Successive Cabinetshad avoided implementing the recommendations of the Top salaries review Body, with the result that very serious anomalies had nowgrown up.    The longer a solution was delayed, the more difficult theproblem would become.    The worst case was that of nationalised industry board members (NIBMs) whose pay scales had been determined as long ago as 1969, and brought up to date in 1972.Since then, average earnings had risen by 135 per cent and the earnings of executives generally by 68 per cent, whereas those ofthe chairmen of nationalised boards had risen by only 7 per cent upto last September.    Real salaries had therefore fallen by almosthalf, while the post-tax drop was even larger.    This had led to serious demoralisation throughout the industries, and to great difficulties in recruiting suitable candidates for the boards of nationalised industries.    Various expedients had been adopted toavoid these difficulties, but none of them were satisfactory. TheTSRB had applied the criteria which the Government had asked themto use.    They had operated in the same way as the Armed forces pay Review Body (AFPRB) and the Doctors and Dentists Review Body(DDRB).    Not surprisingly, their recommendations involved broadly similar rates of increase in pay:  these averaged 31 per cent above those recommended in the 6th Report of the TSRB in 1974 and35 per cent above salaries currently in payment.    They proposed thatthey should be paid with effect from 1 April 1978, or, if staged,spread over not more than 3 years so that they were fully operative
by 1 April 1980, and updated in the intervening years.    If stagingwere adopted, they recommended that the nominal salary should beaccepted for pension purposes, and that there should be no discrimination among groups,    indeed the Cabinet had agreed earlier in the year that the nationalised industries should be treated inexactly the same way as other groups when this Report came to beconsidered.    A particular complication arose from the legalentitlement of some members of the groups covered by the Report tothe second instalments of the previous round of increases, which hadnot yet been paid.    EY(P) had examined the report, and identified8 issues for decision.    A majority of the Sub-Committee wouldanswer &apos;yes&apos; to the first five questions listed in the paper, but all were concerned about the possible impact of these decisions on thenext round of pay policy.    His own personal view, as one who was involved in discussions with the trade unions about future pay policy,was that acceptance of the recommendations would indeed complicatethese negotiations, but the precedent had already been set by the forward commitments made to the doctors and dentists, armed forces, university teachers, firemen and - in due course - to thepolice.    However, there would never be a more favourable opportunity for grasping this nettle, and in his view the report should now be accepted.    Its presentation would however need very careful handling.    In particular, the comparatively small level of post-tax increases would need to be emphasised.In discussion, it was argued that to accept the recommendations ofthe TSRB would damage the prospects of Trades Union Congress (TUC)acquiescence in another round of pay policy.    Since this was criticalto the survival of the Government, it would be foolish to jeopardise the chance of success by agreeing to very large increases for highly-paid people.    Some of the pre-tax increases proposed were indeedlarger than the actual salaries of some Cabinet Ministers. even after tax, the increases were larger than the take home pay of manyindustrial workers.    Such a decision would be seen as inequitable,given the failure to do anything about the problem of the low paid inthe present pay round.    It was inconsistent with the line taken overcertain nationalised industries: for example, Ministers had attempted to reduce the proposed pay increases for steel workersbecause of the losses being made in the industry, yet it was not suggested that the members of the British Steel Corporation shouldbe penalised in the same way.    Salaries in the public sector wereinevitably lower than those outside.    The motivation was entirely different, and it would be a mistake to appoint to a public board orany other public position a man who was only interested in the levelof salary.    The present proposals protected those running the economy from the consequences of their own failures.    The whole system of the TSRB had been a mistake.    It aroused expectations,which became self-fulfilling, and the very large pay increases to which2
it led from time to time led to great pressure elsewhere in the public sector for improved pay.    For these reasons, it might be better to limit pay increases in the present round to 10 per cent, and to enterinto no forward commitments until the shape of the next round wasclearer.    Alternatively, the 10 per cent increase in the present roundcould be coupled to pensions based on the notional rate recommendedby the TSRB, together with a promise to reconsider the rest of therecommendations in the course of the next round.    A thirdpossibility was to distinguish the implementation of the 1974 report(TSRB 6) for nationalised industry board members from considerationof the 10th Report.Against this, it was argued that there was no advantage indistinguishing between the two reports.    To implement the 1974Report in full would mean giving increases of more than 10 per centin the present round to NIBMs.    It was better to look at the 10th report as a whole, since it subsumed the recommendations of the 6th Report.The 10th Report recommendations should be seen as a total package.Any attempt to differentiate between different groups would inevitablycreate further anomalies.    The proposals could clearly not be implemented in full immediately.    There was general agreement that increases in the present round should not exceed 10 per cent.But it would be easier to present a 10 per cent increase, which woulddisappoint many of those concerned, if it were accompanied by a clear statement about the Government1 s intentions for the future.Salary levels in private industry might well be too high.    This wasin part the consequence of a steeply progressive tax system, whichin itself was a problem which required further study.    But it wouldbe wrong to discriminate against the public sector.    The nationalised industries were in the same market for senior executives as companieslike the General Electric Company and British Petroleum.   The public services should not be cinderellas.   The Government was committed tothe creation of successful and efficient public enterprise.   Thi I required the recruitment and retention of the best people at board level. the example of the steel industry, already quoted, was a good one.Members of the British Steel Corporation had received increases of4 per cent gross since 1972.    During the same period, blastfurnacemen&apos;s earnings had risen by 130 per cent.    In this situation it was impossible to persuade executives to accept Board appointments,with the accompanying insecurity as well as loss of salary.Similarly, miners had done much better than members of the national coal Board.    Indeed the National Union of Mineworkers, nodoubt for their own reasons, had recommended higher salaries for members of the board.    The situation was the same in the judiciary.The Presidents of the three Divisions of the High Court had taken theunusual step of presenting a joint memorandum to the Lord chancellor on the subject of pay.    It was proving impossible to persuadesuccessful barristers to accept appointment to the Bench. The3
Civil Service unions had made a similar approach to the Lord Privy-Seal, and had demanded that there should be no discrimination against the higher Civil Service, where the problem of morale was becoming serious.    In all these groups, the proposals involved arestoration of relativities judged appropriate in 1974, rather than any fresh advance.    The average annual post-tax increases were notin fact large by comparison with those received by other sections ofthe community over the same period.The Cabinet then turned to the issues for decision identified in theChancellor&apos;8 paper.a. Should the recommended salary scales be accepted in principle?    In the earlier part of discussion there hadbeen a clear majority in favour of accepting the recommendedsalary scales in principle, and this was agreed.b. Should the recommended salary scales be adopted now for pensions purposes?    This was agreed.c. Should the Cabinet accept the TSRB recommendations that the staging of implementation of the present award shouldbe completed by 1 April 1980?    In favour of this course, itwas argued that it would be a mistake to modify the proposalsof the TSRB.    Spreading over more than two years would not help in presenting the decision to those who would in any caseobject to such large increases.    Against this, it was argued that an attempt had been made to distinguish the special cases and anomalies to whom forward commitments might be given.That distinction became impossible to defend if two yearstaging were agreed for all the groups covered by TSRB.During the present round, the Government has successfullyinsisted that all anomalies should be accommodated withinthe 10 per cent ceiling.    Many deserving cases had been rejected because of this general policy.    A forwardcommitment of this kind might prejudice the chance ofsecuring a low basic norm in the next pay round.    But more seriously it would make it very much more difficult to findan acceptable way of dealing with anomalies in the private sector in the next round.    It would in effect establish a pattern in which all quantifiable anomalies which could beverified by some external body would have to be eliminatedwithin two years.    The effects of this could be very damaging to the wages outturn.4
d. Should the first stage be one of 10 per cent in thisround?    It was pointed out that this would involve toppingup the increases of those NIBMs who had received less than10 per cent earlier in the round, and this was a technicalbreach of the 12-month rule;  nevertheless this might be acceptable provided that no-one received more than 10 per centin total.e. Should the Cabinet accept the report&apos; 8 recommendations that the proposed rates of pay should be &quot;brought up to date by tht nornaal review process&quot; during the staging period?On this point, it was argued that, for the reasons given at c.above, it was desirable to limit the forward commitment tothe sums necessary to implement the recommended scales by1980, without any automatic obligation to update these scalesduring the intervening period.    In fact, the TSRBrecommendations would require the continued existence ofthe TSRB until the scales were fully implemented, and this might be undesirably inflexible.    In the longer term, therewas a case for removing some of these groups, including thehigher Civil Service, from the operation of the Review Bodyaltogether, perhaps by establishing a fixed percentagedifferential between them and the lower grades in the sameService.    Alternatively, it might be possible to re-establish an earlier pattern, under which top salaries were reviewedless frequently than every year, but it would be difficult to do this until rates of inflation generally were lower.f. Should there be special arrangements for the NIBMs?It was agreed that there could be no question of increasesabove 10 per cent in the present pay round and that no specialbias need be inserted into the staging process in favour of theNIBMs providing they received adequate assurance on thequantum and timing of staged increases to the levelsrecommended.    Nevertheless a general increase of 10 per cent for all of the groups covered by the Report could be backdatedto 1 January 1978 for the NIBMs, subsuming as necessary the increases agreed earlier in the year for them. Stagedincreases in future years, and any further settlements, should operate from 1 April starting in 1979.g. What should be done about the possible legal right ofsome civil servants and members of the judiciary to paymentof the withheld part of the 1974 award?    There was wideagreement that, of the three courses outlined in paragraph 4g.of CP(78) 64 that in paragraph 4g.i. was to be preferred,namely to offer 10 per cent to all concerned from 1 January 19785
and to persuade those with residual legal claims to forgo them.It was pointed out that the normal settlement date of some ofthe judges was in July.    Given that these judges had claimsextending back to 1 January 1977 it would be reasonable to ask them, too, to accept the date of 1 January 1978 for a10 per cent increase in this round.    All of those covered bythe TSRB Report would thus share a common date of1 January this year moving to 1 April next year.h. Consequentials.    While the proposal that the generality of consequential settlements should be made onthe basi6 of traditional pay relationships was acceptable inprinciple there could be a number of problems arising inparticular cases.    These should be discussed separatelybetween the responsible Ministers and the Chancellor of theExchequer once the Government&apos;s response to TSRB 10 hadbeen made public.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the salary scales recommended by the TSRBshould be accepted in principle.    They should also be adopted in fullfor pensions purposes on the basis set out in the Report. Thestaging of implementation of the present award should be as recommended by TSRB 10 and completed by 1 April 1980.    The first stage should be one of 10 per cent in the present pay round, and thisshould include topping up the salary of those nationalised industry board members who received less than 10 per cent earlier in the round.    All the 10 per cent increases should be payable from1 January 1978.     The remaining stages should be paid from1 April 1979 and 1 April 1980, but should be confined to the sumsnecessary to bring the salary scales up to those recommended bythe TSRB.    The question of whether to accept the TSRBrecommendation that the proposed rates of pay should be brought upto date by the normal review process during the staging period shouldbe expressly reserved for later consideration.    Those with residuallegal claims to payments before 1 January 1978 should be persuaded to forgo them on condition that the 10 per cent increases were payablefrom 1 January 1978.    The question of consequentials should befurther considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultationwith the other responsible Ministers, following publication of theTSRB report.    He would himself announce the Government1 s decisions on 29 June by way of an arranged written Parliamentary reply.Meanwhile, complete secrecy must be maintained about the Cabinet1 decisions.    No minutes of the meeting would be circulated until after the announcement had been made.    Knowledge of the decisions should be strictly confined meanwhile to Cabinet Ministers and members of the Cabinet Secretariat.6

PP document is THE PROPERTY OF HER DRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT36COPY NOCADINET. 0u8LIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 23rd Conclusions, Minute  Thursday 22 June 1978 at 10. 30 am the Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the Lord President of theCouncil (CP(78) 63) setting out his proposals for pay increases for ministers and Members of Parliament.THE LORD PRESIDENT said that the pay of Members of parliament and of Ministers and of office holders in the Commons might now,under the 12-month rule, be increased from 13 June, while that ofMinisters and office holders in the Lords might similarly be revisedfrom 30 July.    He proposed that the pay of Members of parliament should be increased by 10 per cent.    This would involve continuingwith two rates of Parliamentary pay, for those who had disclaimedtheir increases under Stage 1 of the present pay policy, and for thosewho had not.    He suggested that the pay of Ministers should beincreased similarly by 10 per cent, both on their Ministerial salaries and on their abated Parliamentary salaries.    Pensionable pay ofMembers should be increased by incorporating the Stage 1  6 per weekincrease into the pensionable pay, together with the further 10 per cent which he now proposed.    This would keep pensionable pay as close aspossible to the rate recommended by the Top Salaries Review Dody(TSRD) in 1975 as updated since then.    He also suggested thatSecretarial allowances should be increased by 10 per cent, togetherwith a further  144 for the increased National Insurance employer&apos;scontributions.    In the longer term, there was no doubt that Membersof Parliament were grossly underpaid.    Many representations hadbeen received on this point, and there would be considerableParliamentary pressure in any debate on the subject.    He therefore suggested that the Government should ask the TSRD to make a freshreport on the pay of Members of Parliament and of Ministers, whichcould be considered after the election.    It would be necessary, in announcing this, to make it clear that the Government intended to implement the recommendations of the report as soon as possible.
In discussion, it was suggested that there was a case for staging the increases already recommended by the TSRD over two years, in line with the procedure just agreed for other top salaries.    Against this,it was argued that most Members would prefer the higher nominalrate which would result from the Lord Presidents proposals,particularly since pensions would be related to this.    Increases inthe present round could in any case not exceed 10 per cent.    It wasalso pointed out that the House of Commons had voted to establish a fixed relativity between the pay of Members of Parliament and someexternal salary rate, possibly in the Civil Service, despite the factthat the TSRD in its 1975 Report had rejected this course.    The TSRDshould therefore be invited to take full account of the views of Membersof Parliament in formulating its fresh proposals.    Special problemsof members of the Government in the House of Lords would need careful consideration, but since any major change would require legislation, it could not be introduced in the short term. Therewere also difficulties about increasing the secretarial allowance tocover National Insurance contributions.    Not all Members ofParliament paid these contributions in full.    On the other hand,without a supplementary increase of the kind proposed, somesecretaries would receive less than a 10 per cent increase.    It was important not to dissipate the goodwill which existed between the two parties on these issues, and there should be informal discussion withthe Opposition before the announcement was made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the proposals put forward by the Lord President.He should arrange to make an early announcement on these lines assoon as possible after the announcement about the 10th Report of the top Salaries Review Body.    He should discuss separately with theLord Privy Seal the problem of Whips and members of the Governmentin the House of Lords.    Before making any announcement he shouldhave informal consultations with the Opposition.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office27 June 19782
