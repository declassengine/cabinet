1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had received a message from^Fevious t^ie Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary proposing that the revisedTerence- Anglo-United States proposals for a settlement of the Rhodesia conflictC^(78) 30th should now be sent officially to Mr Smith, the Rhodesian Prime Minister,^elusions to a^ t*ie Part*es and to the Front Line Presidents, as a prelude to^minute 1     &apos; inviting them to talks on the basis of the proposals.    If any of those concerned refused, the talks might go ahead without them. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary personally did not think that theproposals would be found acceptable and that it might be necessary to publish the proposals soon so as to have them on record with the united nations.    But in a recent statement Mr Smith had indicated a readiness to join in talks provided there were no pre-conditions;  and the UnitedStates Government felt that they had been wrong-footed by this statement and that it should be put to the test.    Secretary of State Vance and dr Owen had therefore agreed in discussion that Mr Smith should becalled to the State Department to be given the full proposals. TheFront Line Presidents and the other parties would be given the proposals at the same time.    The Prime Minister had authorised actionaccordingly, but on the understanding that no decision would be taken at this stage to involve the United Nations.    He would have preferred to seek colleagues&apos; agreement beforehand but had thought it right toaccept the urgency which Mr Vance and Dr Owen had attached to thematter.    It remained to be seen how Mr Smith and also Mr Nkomo andMr Mugabe would react, but the alternative was a continuation of thewar which was likely to intensify in the approaching rainy season.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.S^C^r 2&apos; The Cabinet had Defore them a note by the Lord President of^Wv? ON THE   the Council (CP(78) 104) to which was attached a revised draft of TheIs-79   AXWLJi;        that the Government would be able to secure a majority for the motion on the Address.    This should be achieved, and Ministers should^vj0l assume that the Parliamentary Session would run its full course.^  fvj ^.^^ Queen&apos;8 Speech on the Opening of the new Session.    The note also^Sl set out certain changes in the legislative programme,tyfc   N ANDJ^QISta THE PRIME MINISTER said that one of the factors which had^^RA.^^^ influenced his decision not to call an autumn election was his judgment^80* ^ME that the Government would be able to secure a maioritv for the Motion ^erei^ The Government would face greater difficulties with no automatic^(7$) 23 majority but Mr Steel, the Leader of the Liberal Party, had said,^cluQiQX^ privately that after The Queen&apos;s Speech the Liberals would consider^Ute ^   S* each measure on its merits:  they would not wish to vote regularlywith the Conservatives.    It would however be necessary to construct amajority for each Bill, and Ministers sponsoring Bills would need to consult individually with the minority Parties.    The arrangements
for consultation would be under the general oversight of theLord President of the Council with the assistance of the Chief Whip.A succession of defeats on Second Reading would be damaging: ifthe Government was likely to be defeated it should be on a measure and at a time of the Governments own choosing.    The Governmentshould however be able to complete a   worthwhile programme oflegislation during the course of the Session.    A meeting with theLabour party  s National Executive Committee (NEC) had been arranged for the following Monday:  this would provide an opportunity to hear the NEC8 proposals and for an exchange of views if the meeting could take place on a basis of discretion and mutual confidence.    He was intouch with Mr Hayward, the General Secretary of the Labour Party,about the character of the meeting and he would let colleagues know the outcome in due course.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the revised draftof the Speech took into account the discussion at the Cabinets earliermeeting on 28 September, and subsequent consultations with ministers concerned with particular measures.    The references in square brackets were subject to confirmation in the light of the Cabinet&apos;conclusions on public expenditure later in the meeting;  and some finaladjustment might be thought appropriate following the meeting with theNEC.In discussion the following points were made and amendments agreed: -a. The reference to The Queen&apos;s forthcoming visit to Iranmight not be well received in view of the present politicalsituation in that country;    if the visit had not already been announced it might be better for the reference to be omitted.The point should be taken up with the Foreign and commonwealth secretary on his return from abroad.b. The paragraph on the Governments economic policiesmight include a stronger reference to measures designed to overcome inflation and to co-operation with the Trades UnionCongress and with the Confederation of British Industry. Itwas accepted, however, that these matters would be fully dealtwith in the Debate on the Address and that further additions tothe Speech should be avoided if possible.c. Similar arguments applied to a suggested expansion ofthe sentence on the amendment of the Local Government Act1972 (&quot;Organic Change&quot;) to include a reference to consulta-tions with the local authority associations.d. The paragraph on open government and the reform ofSection 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 had been consideredby the Ministerial Group on the Disclosure of Official Information(GEN 29):  the undertaking to make information on public policymore readily available might prove difficult to fulfil, but subjectto some drafting amendments the form of words proposed byGEN 29 was agreed.
e. The provisions on school government in the proposedEducation (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill were to be further discussed in the Home and Social Affairs Committee (HS) onthe following day,f. Since some of the provisions of the proposed Housing bill would apply to Scotland, the reference to England and wales should be omitted.g. The Bill on Public Lending Right would be introduced earl^in the Session.    Some of its earlier critics were understood tobe ready to withdraw their objections and it now stood a good chance of enactment in the coming Session.h. Consultations with both sides of the industry were proceeding on the Bill to reorganise the electricity supply industry;  it would need to be mentioned in The queen s Speechbut it would not be ready at the start of the Session and thewords &quot;as soon as possible&quot; should be deleted.i. Following discussion in HS Committee the Bill on social security benefits would be reduced in scope and it should beready for introduction early in the Session;  the words&quot;certain aspects of&quot;   should, however, be omitted.j.       The passage dealing with compensation forpneumoconiosis should be amended to read &quot;my government are examining schemes to provide compensationfor those such as slate quarrymen who have sufferedrespiratory diseases caused by dust in their employment, but who are unable to obtain such compensation through the courtsbecause their employers have gone out of business&quot;.k.       The paragraph on protection for individuals&apos; savingsshould be amended to omit the reference to malpractice andthe paragraph should start &quot;Bills will be introduced ...&quot;,The Chancellor of the Exchequer would propose a form of wordsTHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft Speech,  subject to the amendments agreed and to final revision in the light of their subsequent discussion on public expenditure and, if necessary, of the forthcoming meeting withthe NEC.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,3
(Sf ENSATION FORretimeA^^NG SCHEMEK/possible, ERNATIVEviousil?8)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Education and Science and Paymaster General(CP(78) 101) seeking endorsement to the recommendations ofthe Ministerial Group on Unemployment Amongst Young People(GEN 27) about deferment of legislation to introduce a schemeto compensate short-time working and the operation of alternative employment measures prior to introduction of the statutoryscheme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND science and PAYMASTER GENERAL said that the present arrangementsfor short-time working were an unsatisfactory combination of guarantee payments by employers and Unemployment Benefit(UB).    In their consultative document, published last April,the Government had proposed to replace them with a short-time working scheme under which those on short time would get75 per cent of normal earnings from their employers.    In mormal times employers would be able to claim 50 per cent reimbursementfrom a Fund to which they and the Government would contributeequally.    In times of recession employers would get 100 per centreimbursement.    On 6 July the Cabinet had agreed to give priority to the scheme within the headroom for additional expenditure in 1979-80, assuming that legislation would be passed in time to allow the scheme to start on 1 April 1979. TheTrades Union Congress (TUC) had welcomed the proposals butthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI ) were strongly opposed.    Further consultations with the CBI and the TUC weredesirable with a view to making the proposals less unacceptable to the CBI and to discussing the possibility of paymentsguaranteed on a weekly rather than a daily basis which was achange sought by both the CBI and the TUC.    More time was needed also if the Bill was to be introduced in a form whichwould not require much Government amendment in Committee.The problem was that the delay entailed would mean that thelegislation could noc be passed in time to allow the scheme to start on 1 April 1979.    GEN 27 had nevertheless reluctantlyendorsed the Secretary of State for Employments recommenda-tion that it was right to allow more time for consultation and for improving the Bill.    They had accepted that this would mean thatthe scheme could probably not start before 1 April 1980. . Againstthe background of 170, 000 new entrants to the labour market in1979-80, GEN 27 were firmly of the view that there would need to be alternative measures operating from 1 April 1979 whichwould aim to make at least the same impact on unemploymentin 1979-80 as the statutory scheme would have done. Earlierestimates had suggested that the scheme would reduce unemploy-ment by about 150, 000 in 1979-80 at a cost of about  230 million.More recent estimates were around 100, 000.4
GEN 27 would be considering possible alternative measures inDecember.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, in his memorandumon public expenditure (CP(78) 99) had proposed that, for planning purposes, a figure of  200 million in 1979-80 should be set aside for these measures whilst recognising that if amounts up to 230 million turned out to be necessary they would have to beprovided even if offsetting savings were not available. Sherecommended that the Cabinet should endorse a figure of 200 million and that up to  230 million should be made available if suitable measures could be found.     Finally she asked theCabinet to endorse GEN 27&apos;s proposal to give urgent considerationto ways of reducing the expected 50, 000 short-fall by 1 April 1979in the effect of measures now operating to reduce unemployment.In discussion there was general agreement that introduction ofthe Bill should be delayed and that this would mean that thescheme could not start on 1 April 1979.    It was argued that consideration should be given to starting the scheme as soon aspossible following legislation rather than deferring it until1 April 1980.    It was noted that the employers&apos; contributionscould not readily be collected before that date because they wouldbe obtained through National Insurance contributions but that this did not rule out an earlier start to payments to employees underthe scheme.    There was no argument on public expenditure groundagainst introducing the scheme during the course of 1979-80provided expenditure on unemployment measures kept within the agreed limits.    Introduction of the scheme at the earliest possible date was highly desirable on political grounds.    It was alsoargued that a good way of ensuring that adequate alternativemeasures operated until the scheme was introduced would be toextend the Temporary Employment Subsidy (TES) beyond1 April 1979.    Opposition to this by the European economic community Commission could be met by pointing out thetemporary nature of the extension.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the introduction of the Bill for the short-time scheme should be deferred to allow more time for consultations and drafting.    They accepted that this meant thatthe scheme could not operate from 1 April 1979.    They thoughtit desirable that it should nevertheless operate as soon aspossible thereafter.    The Secretary of State for employment should give consideration to the possibility of a start earlier than 1 April 1980, and should report his conclusions to GEN 27eThe Cabinet also agreed that alternative measures should operate from 1 April 1979 with the aim of achieving at least thesame reduction in unemployment in 1979-80 as the statutoryscheme would have done.    GEN 27 should put forward cos tedproposals as soon as possible.    They should include in their consideration the possibility of temporary extension of TES.5
Subject to later consideration of the proposals to be put forward by GEN 27 the Cabinet agreed to the planning figure of expendi-ture of  200 million for 1979-80 on the basis proposed by theChief Secretary, Treasury, i. e. that up to  230 million couldbe made available if suitable measures could be found to absorbthis sum.    Finally, they agreed that GEN 27 should give urgent consideration to measures to reduce the shortfall now anticipated in the effect of employment measures during 1978-79 ascompared with earlier estimates.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretary of State for Employment to be guided accordingly.6
J;no   ^ 40 The Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the chief^79 NDlTURE, Secretary, Treasury, (CP(78) 99) setting out his proposals for theft   TO level of public expenditure in the four years 1979-80 to 1982-83.They also considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for?fe . Education and Science and Paymaster General (CP(78) 102) on theWp10118 implications of these proposals for the education programme, a*M(l%?Cea: letter dated 13 October from the Secretary of State for Social&quot;0Mu ^5t^ Services to the Chief Secretary, Treasury, about the implications1^    81ons, for the health and personal social services programmes, and a4 memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, (CP(78) 103)mjuqj about the employment consequences of public expenditureWJiute8^ons&apos; nrocrammes.programmes.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that Cabinet had decided in July upon the overall levels of public expenditure for each of thefour years under consideration.    He had been asked to discuss with the spending Ministers changes to their programmes whichwould allow the totals to be kept within the limits laid down by cabinet.    The results of these discussions, and his proposalsbased upon them, were set out in summary form in table 1 of his 7.paper (CP(78) 99).    Line 3 showed the amount of &quot;headroom&quot; leftwithin the totals agreed by Cabinet after taking account of variousestimating changes since their last discussion.    Line 4 set out hisown proposals.    He suggested that the Cabinet should concentrateupon the first two years of the period.    It would be unrealistic to conduct major policy arguments over the final two years, on which no final decisions were needed.    He had proposed a contingency reserve of  800 million in 1979-80, as compared with the 700 million originally proposed, and of  1, 500 million in 1980-81(a reduction of  100 million on his original plan).    It was alreadyclear that a reserve of something like this size would be needed:the reserve for the current year was already almost exhausted.He had agreed a number of minor changes with colleagues in thecourse of bilateral discussions, and had put forward suggestions inrespect of certain other smaller programmes which he hoped wouldbe acceptable.    The major remaining difficulties concerned the programmes for employment, education, health and social security,and environment and housing.    The Cabinet would have to decidethese issues.    It was unsatisfactory that Ministers had been unableto find savings to offset the new, and politically important, bidswhich had been put forward.    A better method was needed ofreflecting the Cabinet political priorities in a review of ongoingexpenditure programmes.    Until this could be done, there was nohope of providing savings on the scale required to absorb all theclaims which had been put forward.In preliminary discussion it was agreed that the provisional decision taken at the previous meeting about the Christmas Bonus for 1978should now be confirmed and announced that afternoon.
In discussion of individual programmes, the following points were made:defence the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, proposals allowed for a 3 per cent increase in defence expenditure over the first two years. this involved a small reduction in the first two years compared with thePublic Expenditure Survey but the Secretary of State for Defence&apos;salternative proposals would require substantial additions in the lasttwo which would leave virtually no room within the existing headroomfor improvements in other programmes.     The Chief Secretary,Treasury, had therefore proposed in his paper to leave the figures for1981-82 and 1982-83 at the level indicated in the original public expenditure Survey.     This would however draw attention to the UnitedKingdom&apos;s failure to match the agreed North Atlantic treaty organisation target of 3 per cent growth in defence expenditure. TheUnited Kingdom was the only country to penalise itself by publishingprojections of expenditure 4 years ahead.     There was no dispositionin the country to make further cuts in defence.    Against this it was argued that the United Kingdom already devoted a higher proportion ofa smaller gross domestic product (GDP) to defence expenditure thanits allies,, and that there was considerable opposition within theParliamentary Labour Party to additional defence expenditure. TheWhite Paper on Public Expenditure could explain that decisions for the later years were left open.Foreign and Commonwealth office the figures proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, were agreed.Overseas development the figures proposed for the first three years were agreed,providing for an annual increase of 6 per cent in the aid programme.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, had been prepared to accept asteeper increase of 8 per cent in the final year, which would have brought aid expenditure to about 0.4 per cent of GDP, comparedwith the United Nations target of 0. 7 per cent.    Against this it was argued that the aid programme already showed a steeper increasethan any other part of public expenditure.     There was no need forthe Government to commit itself so far in advance, although if additional resources could be found, this was one area which shouldbe given high priority.    It would be desirable to treat it in the same way as the defence programme,    Alternatively it would be possibleto maintain a steady 6 per cent rate of growth throughout the period.8
agriculture the figures put forward by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, were agreed, noting that it should be possible to absorb some smalladditional expenditure for sea defences within the programmes of the regional water authorities.Forestry CommissionTradeDepartment of Prices and Consumer ProtectionThese programmes were all agreed.industry it was noted that there were likely to be substantial claims on the contingency Reserve in due course for assistance to Rolls Royceand to British Leyland.employment the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had proposed reducing the provisionfor the new short term working scheme from  230 million to 200 million in 1979-80 on the understanding that any additional cost would be found from the Contingency Reserve if necessary.It was noted that while expenditure on the new scheme might take time to build up, it was important that it should be a success andthat its scope should not be artificially restricted for lack offinancial resources.    Although there had been substantial under-spending on previous manpower programmes, it was realistic toprovide  200 million in 1979-80 for the new scheme on this basis.However, the once-for-all cost( 13 million) of changing over tofortnightly payments of unemployment benefit should be added to the approved programmes for 1979-80 and not offset against theprovision for the short term working scheme.    The figures for1980-81 and later years had been agreed between the Secretary ofState for Employment and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.energy the figures put forward in the Chief Secretary, treasury s paper were acceptable.    There might however be a substantial additionalclaim for further support for the coal industry.    It was relevant tothis that the German Government appeared to support the german coal industry to a much greater extent than we did, with the resultthat German coking coal was cheaper, the German steel indusrty was able to supply the German motor industry at much lower prices,and this contributed to the penetration of German car manufacturers
into our domestic and export markets.    The Secretary of Statefor Energy would circulate a note to the appropriate CabinetCommittee about these comparisons.transport the proposals put forward by the Chief Secretary, Treasury,were agreed.environment the Chief Secretary, Treasury, had proposed savings of  50 million in 1979-80 on the Survey figures, and of no increases in the Surveyfigures in 1980-81, despite very large additional bids in both years.In support, it was argued that there was persistent high under-spending on housing capital expenditure, only partly offset byadditional expenditure on improvement schemes.    From the figuresfor new starts in the past months it was already possible to predictthe out-turn for 1979-80 with some confidence.     This shortfall was largely the result of policy decisions taken by Conservativecontrolled councils.    It was wrong to persist with the publication ofartificially high figures which would not be borne out in practice.This merely required other programmes to be cut, and added to theproblem of shortfall during the year (although in the process it leftmore room for manoeuvre for the Chancellor of the Exchequer inthe forthcoming budget).    More consideration should be given, inany case, to the possibility of carrying over some part of under-spent expenditure, as was already permissible for the national health Service and part of the aid programme.Against this, it was argued that the provision for other environ-mental services was already overspent.    Capital programmes hadbeen heavily cut in the last two years and these cuts must be partially restored.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s, proposals made no allowance for additional expenditure on the urban programme.    Growing current expenditure as new facilities were completed tended to squeeze out further capital expenditure withina constant total, and an additional  30 million was needed to correct this tendency.    On housing, the new starts programme had already been cut to its lowest level for many years.    But thehousing programme as a whole was not seriously underspent, andit was too early in the present year to predict the outcome. Itwas not safe to put all the blame upon Conservative councils, andthe Government would inevitably pay a political price for inadequateprovision.    A purely arbitrary reduction in the housing and otherenvironmental programmes was politically unattractive.    It wouldbe possible to ease the situation by treating some  50 million ofexpenditure by the housing corporation as private sector expendi-ture outside the public expenditure totals;    there was already an agreed procedure for this.    It might also be possible to agree that
a proportion, say the first  100 million, of changes in interest rates should not score as public expenditure, either up or down;but against this it was argued that the interest charges had to becarried either by the housing programme or elsewhere within thepublic expenditure totals.    Decisions on the total of eligibleexpenditure were needed no later than 2 November if the rate support Grant negotiations were to be completed by the appointeddate of 24 November.    An acceptable compromise might be toreduce the provision for the Department of the Environment (and related Scottish and Welsh expenditure) by  20 million instead of 50 million as proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, and fora further  50 million housing corporation expenditure to be trans-ferred to the private sector.Home OfficeIt was argued that the additional expenditure proposed by the chief secretary, Treasury, on prisons, while welcome, did not solve thewhole problem, and that ideally additional expenditure would be permitted on courts and police services as well.    There was in anycase a substantial potential claim on the Contingency Reserve forincreased police manpower if recruitment improved following therecent pay increases.    But the most serious need was for additional provision for the proposed new ethnic grant, to which there was a reference in The queen s Speech but no financial provision.Although the bid was submitted by the Home Office, part of theexpenditure would in fact be borne eventually by other Departments,mainly the Department of Health and Social Security and theDepartment of Education and Science.    It would be reasonable torequire those Departments to absorb half of the costs, whileincreasing the provision for the Home Office by  5 million in1980-81 and by  8 million and  12 million in the two subsequent years.Lord chancellor s department the figures proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, were acceptable cn the assumption that increases in 1981-82 and 1982-83could be accommodated within the headroom available in thoseyears.Property   Services Agency, Civil Service Department, treasury solicitor, Ordnance Survey and OPCSThe figures for these Departments were all acceptable.Northern IrelandThe figures proposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury were acceptable, but it was noted that there might be a substantial additional claim upon the Contingency Reserve as the result of increased expenditure on the meat industry.
WalesIt was accepted that the Welsh Office would have its agreed share ofthose services for which provision was calculated on an England andWales or on a Great Britain basis.    It was however argued thatthere was inadequate provision within the Chief Secretary, treasury sproposals for additional expenditure in support of areas affected bythe closure of steelworks.    Against this, it was argued that therewould be substantial savings available on the programme of the WelshRegional Water Authority, and that the full extent of the steelclosure programme could not yet be estimated.    Any additional expenditure on steel closure areas would therefore fall to be met from the Contingency Reserve in due course if it could not be absorbed within ongoing Welsh Office programmes.scotland in addition to the Scottish share of services calculated on a GreatBritain basis, there was one specific additional bid of  8 million in 1980-81 for the Scottish Development Agency which was politically important to avoid publishing reduced figures for thisessential programme.Education and health in preliminary discussion of these items, it was suggested that changes in the prices of school meal6 were made for non-educationalpurposes, and it was therefore wrong to reduce the main educationprogrammes on that count.    Apart from school meals, it should bepossible to absorb all the other additional bids from the Departmentof Education and Science within the existing provision. It might bepossible to reduce the claim for the new Educational MaintenanceAllowance scheme to a cost of about  30 million, and to regard this as offset against the  30 million reduction in the bid by theDepartment of Employment.    To maintain a rate of growth ofZ-g per cent in the expenditure on the Health Service would require afurther  74 million in England and Wales, and  90 million for GreatBritain as a whole, in 1979-80 and of  120 million in 1980-81. Theminimum desirable increase on social security was  12 million in1979-80 and  33 million in 1980-81, compared with an original bidof  79 million in the first year.    It was not possible to reach agreement on the relative attractions of these various claims in thetime available, and the Ministers concerned should meet separatelyto see whether an acceptable compromise could be devised before thenext Cabinet discussion.12
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had now confirmed its provisional decision to pay aChristmas bonus for 1978 on the lines agreed at their previous meeting.    He would discuss further with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, the question of possible new machinery for Ministerial consideration of priorities in public expenditure, but this did not affect the 1978 Survey nowunder consideration.    The Cabinet had approved the chief secretary, Treasury&apos;s proposals for the defence programme for thefour years covered by the Survey, with the proviso that the figuresfor the later years need not be regarded as final at this stage andthat this would be made clear in the White Paper.    They approvedfigures for the aid programme which would allow a 6 per cent increase in each of the years after 1979-80.    They approved aprovision of  200 million for the short term working scheme in1979-80, noting that if a more ambitious dcheme proved practicable,the cojts would fall upon the Contingency Reserve.    They approved a reduction of  30 million in the provision for the Department of the environment in 1979-80, compared with the figures included in theoriginal Public Expenditure Survey, on the condition that  50 million of expenditure by the Housing Corporation in that year would betreated as private sector expenditure.    They agreed to additional expenditure of  5 million in 1980-81 and of  8 million and  12 million in the two subsequent years, on the Home Office provision for thenew ethnic grant,    noting that similar sums would be absorbedwithin the programmes for the Departments of Education and science and of Health and Social Security.     8 million would be added to theprogramme for the Scottish Development Agency in 1980-81. the contingency Reserve for 1979-80 should be reduced to  800 million,compared with  900 million suggested by the Chief Secretary,Treasury.    The decision they had already taken would use up 43 million of this additional  100 million for programmes. Theremainder, should if possible be divided between the Departmentof Health and Social Security and the Department of Education and science, in a proportion to be agreed between the two secretaries of State concerned and the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    The resultsof that discussion should be reported back to the Cabinet before their meeting on 2 6 October.    The remaining programmes for 1979-80and 1980-81 would be included in the White Paper on the basisproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in Table 1 of CP(78)99.The provision for the two final years of the Survey period, 1981-82and 1982-83, would be treated in the way suggested by the chief secretary, Treasury, in paragraph 10 of his paper, as modified by the decision taken that day on the aid programme and on thenew ethnic grant.    &apos; The Chief Secretary, Treasury should arrangefor officials to consider whether a proportion of any unspentallocations could be carried forward from one financial year to thenext, and should report on this possibility before the end of the year.13
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing- up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office17 October 197814
