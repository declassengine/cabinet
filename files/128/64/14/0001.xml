^AlRsPeanetaryNousS*78) 26th**ite 31. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that a group ofMinisters under his own chairmanship had taken stock earlier in theweek of the discussions regarding the proposed European monetary system (EMS).    He would make no commitment about this in histalks with Chancellor Schmidt in the following week and the cabinet would have the opportunity for a full discussion on his return. Forthat discussion they would have a paper setting out fully the implications both of joining the EMS and of staying out if other member states decided to go ahead.The Cabinet -Took note.^Oj^j^^^S 2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Social Services and the Minister for Social Security(CP(78) 97) making proposals for a 1978 Christmas bonus.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SEP VICES said that theCabinet earlier in the year had consciously left aside the question ofa Christmas bonus as a likely call on the Contingency Reserve for1978-79.    He and the Minister for Social Security did not regard abonus as having a high priority in their field of expenditure, and to repeat it for a further year might increase the likelihood of itspermanency.    However, the political pressures for a 1978 Christmasbonus were very strong:  the Conservative Party had already committed themselves to a Christmas bonus this and every year;  and the TradesUnion Congress were in favour of it.    There would indeed be pressuresfor a higher bonus than  10, which was the sum that he proposed. he also proposed, however, that the coverage of the bonus should beextended from that of last year to include people drawing supplementary benefit (SB) at the long-term rate, and to those who had been receivingfamily income rupplement (FIS) or the short-term rate of SB for a continuous period of 6 months.    This would mean that about three-quartei s of a million additional people would receive the bonus,bringing the total rumber of recipients to slightly over 11 million.The administration of the extended scheme would be heavily dependenton staff goodwill, which he believed would be forthcoming. Therewere very strong arguments for the extension.    It would bring in the poorest of the poor and many one-parent families.    Its extension torecipients of SB at the short-term rate would help to compensate themfor the fact that next month1 s uprating of short-term benefits, whichhad been based on the Treasury forecast of 7.1 per cent price increases in the 12 months from November 1978, would not matchactual price inflation, now expected to be 8.8 per cent.    At the same1
time, it would be a political blunder not to show concern for theworking poor by including the 70, 000 families on FIS.    His reasonfor proposing a 6-month qualifying period, rather than 12 months,for those in continuous receipt of SB and FIS was that, in the case ofSB recipients, it was common for the contributory national insurance benefits payable to an unemployed person to keep him above theSB level for 6 months out of a year&apos;s continuous unemployment. A12-month qualifying period would therefore mean that such a personwould have to have been unemployed for 18 months or more. Itwould be necessary to give effect to his proposals by legislation,which would have to be introduced very early in the new Session and receive Royal Assent by 24 November, in order to enable payments to be made in the week beginning 4 December.    Even then somepayments to the proposed new groups of recipients would extend intoJanuary or February.    If the scheme were so extended, it would bedesirable to make an early announcement in order to securemaximum staff co-operation.The Cabinet first considered whether a 1978 Christmas bonus shouldbe paid at all.    It was argued that the political impact of the bonuswas diminishing and that, although its discontinuance would causesome resentment, the Government should seriously considerspending the same amount of money on alternative ways of helping the same group of beneficiaries.    For example, a subsidy forelderly people on the television licence fee would be very popularand would cushion the effect of the expected large increase in the fee.Alternatively, an increase in National Health Service expenditure ofthe same amount as the Christmas bonus would make an enormousdifference to that Service and to the morale of those who worked init.    A national scheme of concessionary fares for old people, whichwould cost about the same amount, was a further possibility whichshould be considered.    Initiatives of this kind, if added to anextension of the mobility allowance for people above retirement age,would be seen as holding out greater social benefit than the christmas bonus, but they would be likely to be pre-empted if the bonus were repeated for another year and so become a permanent feature.    On the other hand, it was argued that if the government wished to discontinue the Christmas bonus, they should have done so last year.    The political case for a 1978 bonus was no lesscompelling, and the social case was just as strong as for a subsidy on the television licence fee which would also benefit the rich elderlyas well as the poor and could be divisive in its effects.    It waspossible, also, that ways might be found of exempting pensionersfrom the next increase in the licence fee.    The Christmas bonus wasfree spending money, and there was evidence that pensioners, whooften found difficulty in saving, greatly appreciated it as a means of enabling them to give gifts to relatives and grandchildren.2
In discussion of the proposed extensions to the coverage of the christmas bonus, there was general agreement, particularly in thelight of the Cabinet1 s doubts about the merits of the bonus as apermanent feature, that it would be unwise to go beyond last year&apos;scategories of recipient.    To do so would create fresh anomaliesand resentment; it was noted from paragraph 6 of CP(78) 97 thatthere would still remain some 38 per cent of households in the lowestquintile of the income distribution, an estimated 1.4 million households,who would not receive the bonus.    If the Government wished to do more to help the long-term unemployed or recipients of SB generally,they should find other more direct means of doing this in the widerpublic expenditure context.    It was noted that the September retail price index figures presented a reasonably encouraging picture of theactual rate of price inflation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed in principle that there should be a 1978Christmas bonus, but that it should be confined in its coverage to thesame groups as the 1977 bonus.    They would, however, confirm thisdecision at their discussion of Public Expenditure on Tuesday,17 October, with a view to an early announcement immediately thereafter.    The Secretary of State for Social Services should clear the text of an announcement with the Chief Secretary, Treasury.In the meantime, it was important that strict confidentiality shouldbe maintained.    The Cabinet also agreed that the Government should indicate at a later stage, possibly in the course of a Ministerialspeech in the House of Commons after publication of the White paper on Public Expenditure, that they did not regard the Christmas bonusas a permanent feature of public expenditure.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.3. The Cabinefs discussion is recorded separately.
The Cabinet1 s discussion is recorded separately.5. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, following the Labour party conference at Blackpool, he and a few senior Ministers had haduseful discussions with a number of trade union leaders about thebest way of structuring further discussions about pay policy with theTrades Union Congress (TUC).    It was clear from these talks thatthe lines of communication between the Government and the TUCwere still open.    The TUC wished to move in line with theGovernment.    They wholly shared the Government1 s policy objective of keeping inflation within single figures.    They recognised theirown obligation to put forward proposals which would help to achieve this objective.    To this end the Economic Committee of the TUC had met on the previous day, and had authorised the six negotiatingmembers to open further discussions with the Government on thebasis of a paper which the TUC would provide.    The paper wouldbe discussed at a meeting the following week between the TUCrepresentatives and the Ministers who had conducted the previous negotiations over pay.    The Cabinet would have a full opportunity ata later stage to discuss any proposals which emerged frpm thesetalks.    It was his objective if possible that any agreement that mightemerge should be concluded before Parliament resumed. Meanwhile,it was desirable to avoid any publicity for the next round of talks, andthe date and place of these should remain strictly confidential.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of this statement by the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office12 October 1978
f^CUMENTIS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETft;fence:* 3LIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 34th Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 12 October 1978 at 10. 30 am the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP(78) 100) on the forthcoming talks onNamibia between the Foreign Ministers of the Five Western membersof the Security Council and the South African Government. they also had before them a minute of 10 October 1978 from the Secretaryof State for Trade to the Prime Minister.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thepresent impasse which had been reached with the South african government over Namibia had its origins in an initiative which theFive had launched 18 months previously.    It had become clear at thattime that South Africa was seeking to install a government in Namibiabased on the Democratic Turnhalle Alliance (DTA) which was likelyto be regarded by the international community as a South Africanpuppet administration.    To avert the risk of Namibia being seen as another Transkei the Five had taken an initiative aimed at bringingNamibia to independence under the auspices of the United Nations.After several months of difficult negotiations their proposals had beenaccepted by both the South African Government and the South West AfricanPeople&apos;s Organisation (SWAPO).    But in the course of the politicalmanoeuvring inside the South African Cabinet over the succession toMr Vorster South Africa had withdrawn its acceptance of the Five&apos;sproposals and had decided to go ahead unilaterally with elections fora constituent assembly for Namibia which they claimed could decide whether to go straight to independence or whether to implement the plans which the United Nations Secretary General had drawn up basedon the Five&apos;s proposals.    If such elections were held SWAPO wouldnot take part, and the United Nations would refuse to recognise thenew Government.    The Security Council had passed on 29 Septembera resolution which approved the United Nations plan, called on SouthAfrica to co-operate in implementing it, declared that any unilateralelection in Namibia would be regarded as invalid and asked the
Secretary General to report on the implementation of the resolution by 23 October.    If by that date there was no evidence that SouthAfrica was prepared to co-operate over the United Nations plan andto abandon its intention to hold elections unilaterally, there was likelyto be very strong pressure in the Security Council for mandatorymeasures against South Africa.    It was in an attempt to resolve thiscritical situation that the Foreign Ministers of the Five were proposing to visit South Africa at the beginning of the following week for discussions with the South African Prime Minister, Mr P W Botha.If, as was likely, the South Africans were not willing to change their position, it was for consideration whether the Five Foreign ministers should give them a direct warning, which could be in either general or specific terms, about the measures which might be taken against them.    With this possibility in mind, officials of the Five had studieda range of possible steps that might be taken against South Africa andhad concluded that the two measures most likely to administer the short sharp knock which it was hoped might bring the South Africansround, were a mandatory embargo on air transport to and from SouthAfrica and an embargo on imports of agricultural and food products from South Africa.    Both of these measures would cause the UnitedKingdom more damage than the other members cf the Five. TheSecretary of State for trade s minute to the Prime Minister brought out the penalties of an air transport embargo for British Airways.Nor should we underestimate the domestic political difficulties whichwould be caused by an embargo which would prevent individuals inthis country seeing their South African relations and friends andwhich would also close the main route for people wishing to leaveRhodesia.    Officials of the Five had also considered oil sanctionsbut had not given such a measure high priority because it would be slow to take effect.    There was however no doubt that pressure foran oil embargo would build up, but this was not something on whicha decision was needed now.    It was important to understand the significance of threatening the South African Government withmeasures against them.    Once the threshold had been crossed, evenif it was by the application of only one or two measures, the pressure to step up action against South Africa would grow.    Such measures would cause gieater harm to the United kingdom s interests than tothose of any other country, and we had made this clear to the othermembers of the Five.    It was essential that any threat that was madeto the South Africans in the forthcoming talks was made by the Fivecollectively.    While we should not let ourselves become isolated,there was equally no question of the United Kingdom taking the lead.In fact, the latest indications were that none of our partners would want to refer to specific measures in the talks with the South Africansand that the most that they would be ready to do would be to make ageneral threat.    He was seeking the Cabinet1 s agreement that heshould be ready to join in with all the other four Foreign Ministers in2
making a general threat and that if, contrary to expectation, theywere prepared to make an explicit threat of embargoes on air transport and food and agricultural imports, he should also join them.In discussion it was argued that what happened over Namibia was ofgreat importance for the future of Southern Africa as a whole. Wehad rightly been trying to remove Namibia from South Africa&apos;control.    If the Five&apos;6 proposals and the United Nations plan nowcollapsed, this would be an enormous victory for the South african government.    It would greatly strengthen the internal position of the newly-elected Mr Botha;  because of our close involvement in theproblem it would be bound to affect our relations with Black Africafor the worse; and it might destroy that growing readiness of theUnited States Government to involve itself actively in African matters which had been a most welcome development over the last year or sobut which was not without its critics inside the Administration and in congress.    Moreover, a victory for South Africa on Namibia might encourage Mr Botha to take a harder line on Rhodesia and the BlackAfrican States to be less co-operative.    For all these reasons weshould continue to do all we could to achieve the implementation ofthe United Nations plan.    This meant that the Fi *e Foreign ministers had to have some bargaining power in the talks with the South african government, and the authority which the Foreign and commonwealth secretary was seeking seemed the minimum basis on which the Fivemight hope to conduct a successful negotiation.    Indeed, if the Fivewere not able to make at least the threat of embargoes on air transport and food and agricultural imports if it became necessaryto do so, it was questionable whether it was worth embarking on the talks at all.On the other hand, it was argued that we needed to look very carefullyat what precisely had brought the Five and South Africa to theirpresent position on Namibia.    There was no doubt that any electionsheld under South African auspices in Namibia would be rejected bythe majority of members of the United Nations.    But there was equally no doubt that such elections were likely to be fairer thanthose held in many other African countries.    It appeared that nearly90 per cent of the people of the territory had registered to vote, andthe South African Government seemed ready to allow outsideobservers to attend the elections.    We had to ask ourselves whetherthe course which South Africa was proposing to take was sooutrageous that we should be ready to embark on a confrontation with her which carried very serious political and economic risks for theUnited Kingdom.    The history of the Rhodesia problem suggested thatthere were times when quick and resolute action might have provided a solution.    But it was doubtful whether this was true of Namibia.It was not likely that a short, sharp knock would move the SouthAfrican Government:  on the contrary, it was more likely to make them3
dig in further.    But by then we should have crossed the thresholdof an ever growing series of measures which could do the UnitedKingdom a great deal of harm.    Our economic links with SouthAfrica were closer than those of any of our partners.    We were seeking to disengage ourselves, but this was a long-term process.At present our manufactured exports to South Africa represented80, 000 jobs in this country, and above all we were criticallydependent on the supply of certain key minerals from South Africa.Our food imports from South Africa were twice as large as those ofthe other members of the Five combined, and an embargo would undoubtedly mean continuing shortages in certain commodities.Even if the Five acted in unity in taking measures against SouthAfrica, we should suffer more than the other four as a result. Thisargued strongly for some form of burden-sharing to equalise the penalties, but it was very unlikely that any arrangement of this kind could in practice be worked out with our partners.In further discussion it was pointed out that it was important to keep a balance between our actions on Namibia and our policy on Rhodesia.The British public recognised that Rhodesia was a problem in whichwe were directly involved, but they were not generally aware thatwe had a major responsibility for the future of Namibia about whichthey knew little.    Moreover, the situation in Rhodesia was muchmore serious than in Namibia, where SWAPO&apos;s guerilla activities were on a very small scale compared with those of the Patriotic Front,and more demanding of an urgent solution.    It would therefore be hard to explain to the public why it was necessary to contemplate takingmeasures of far-reaching significance for this country against SouthAfrica over Namibia which we had not thought it necessary toundertake in the context of Rhodesia.    On the other hand, it might appear inconsistent if we were ready to accept an internal settlement in Namibia but not in Rhodesia.In subsequent discussion it was argued that our aim in the talks withthe South  Africans should be to keep them in play and to avoid a breakdown.    Mr Botha had claimed in a message of 9 October to thePrime Minister that his Government was ready to try to widen theareas of agreement and narrow the areas of difference.    There was still a prospect that the South Africans would be prepared to move from their present position.    To persuade them to do this it mightbe necessary to talk in general terms of the consequences of a failure to reach agreement on the United Nations plan.    We should howeveravoid mentioning specific measures.    This might in any case be unnecessary now that the United States Government appeared to be reluctant to hint at the threat of particular measures.    Our concernin the discussions in the Five had been not to appear to be draggingour feet and so become isolated.    This now seemed unlikely. TheAmerican reluctance to mention specific measures might be due to a4
growing awareness of the likelihood that Congress would reject such steps against South Africa as an air transport embargo. it remained, however, a real possibility that if pressure for mandatory011 sanctions built up, they would not use their veto.    It was also likely that France would not veto oil sanctions either.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theprospects of a satisfactory outcome to the problem of Namibia hadfluctuated over the past 18 months.    We should not assume now thatthe attempts to find a solution were going to fail.    The South Africanshad already moved a great distance over Namibia, especially by their acceptance of free elections, and the gap was not so wide that it couldnot be bridged if both sides were prepared to move further. this might, however, require the Black African countries to show some flexibility as well as South Africa.    A direct threat of international action against South Africa was not likely to make the South african government give way, though they might be influenced to considermoving more in our direction if they were aware of the prospect ofconcerted economic pressure on them.    The Cabinet accordinglyagreed that if, in the light of the way the talks with the South Africanswere going, it was the judgment of the Five Foieign Ministers that itwould strengthen their position if they were to give the South Africansa warning in general terms of the consequences of a decision on their part to go ahead unilaterally with elections, they should do so. Butthis step should be taken only if all the Five readily agreed to it, andwe should not take the lead in pressing for it.    The Cabinet were not ready to agree that possible specific measures such as embargoes on air transport and food and agricultural imports should be mentioned to the South Africans.    We had to recognise the extreme vulnerabilityof the United Kingdom if economic sanctions were taken against SouthAfrica and also the fact that, unlike Rhodesia, Namibia was not inrebellion against the Crown.    We might well have to take painfuldecisions eventually, but that moment had not yet arrived. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should bring the matter backto Cabinet, as necessary, in the light of the outcome of the talks withthe South African Government.    Finally, it was essential for theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s negotiating position that theCabinet&apos;s conclusions did not become public.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office12 October 19785
THlS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENT*.hodesiauActionsfurther Inquirydevious^ierence:inclusions minute 4COPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 34th Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 12 October 1978 at 10. 3C am the Cabinet had before it a note by the Prime Minister (CP(78) 98)covering the text of a possible White Paper about Rhodesian sanctions and the question of a further inquiry following the Bingham Report.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, as agreed at their earlier discussion,he had instructed the Cabinet Office to prepare ? draft White Paper sothat the Cabinet could decide whether they wanted to publish one, andif so, what modifications the present draft would require.Part 1 of the draft consisted of the final section (Chapter 14) of theBingham Report, containing its main factual conclusions, a summaryof the arguments advanced on behalf of the oil companies, and certainconcluding observations.    In discussion, it was argued that it wouldbe helpful to the House to reissue this in the form of a White Paper.The only version of the Bingham Report available to Members ofParliament at present was a very large roneoed document. Theconclusions themselves had been published in extenso in the Press,but Press cuttings would not be a convenient format for the debate.Because of a dispute at Her Majesty&apos;s Stationery Office, it was unlikely that the printed version of the Bingham Report would beavailable before the debate.    However the Bingham Report was onlya partial account.    It concentrated heavily on the period up to 1970,although the inquiry had had access to all later Departmentaldocuments on which advice to successive Governments had been based.It was concerned only with the relatively unsuccessful oil sanctions,which were a small part of the total economic sanctions appliedagainst Rhodesia.    Yet this was the area where the Government was most exposed to criticism.    There was a strong case against thepublication of Part 1, particularly if it were decided not to proceedwith the other parts of the White Paper.1
Part 2 of the draft contained an historical summary of events affectingRhodesia from October 1964 onwards, primarily concerned with oilsanctions.    In discussion of this section, it was argued that it wouldbe useful to bring out fully for the benefit of the House the background to the Bingham Report.    The record would demonstrate that theGovernment of the day had genuinely and conscientiously tried to makesanctions work - a fact which was not as yet widely recognised orappreciated.    But the argument in the House would be primarilypolitical.    A purely factual account would not help greatly.    It wouldbe easier to correct and defend the Government&apos;6 record in debate.It would be particularly appropriate for this to be done by the presentForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, who had not been a member ofthe Administration concerned.    His task would be easier if theGovernment were prepared to concede in advance the principle of afurther inquiry.    Part 2 of the draft White Paper, or an oral account,would be no substitute for an inquiry.    There were still further factsto emerge, especially as concerned the role of oil company executivesand of civil servants involved at the time.    The present draft failedto identify those Ministers who had been directly involved (none ofwhom were now in the Cabinet).    Nor did it explain who had been toldabout the oil swaps between Shell and British Petroleum on the onehand and the French company Total on the other.    It failed to cover the two points which arguably were, in retrospect, the worstmistakes that had been made:  the failure to consult the Cabinetcollectively about the Total swap, and the failure to considerprosecution of oil companies within our jurisdiction concerned in earlier breaches of sanctions policy.    Like the Bingham Report itself,the text failed to deal adequately with the period of the conservative administration or at all with that covered by the present Government.It failed to justify the decision of the 1964 Government not to risk aneconomic war with South Africa.    Yet to do this in any depth would prejudice our position in   current negotiations about Namibia. Noamount of redrafting would get round these difficulties.    It would bebetter not to publish anything of this kind in advance of the debate.Part 3 of the text dealt with the possible forms that any future inquirymight take, and of the arguments for and against each.    It wassuggested in discussion that it would be useful to have these optionslaid out before the debate, particularly if no firm recommendationwere made.    It would be easier to do this than to set them out in thecourse of an introductory speech, which would have to concentrate on many other problems.    However it might be equally effective forthese options to be deployed during a Government intervention later in the debate, perhaps by the Attorney General.    While there werearguments in favour of suggesting a course of action to the House, this might actually be counter-productive and lead to a result other thanthat which the Government intended.    The present draft concentratedtoo heavily on the difficulties involved over any form of inquiry. If2
an inquiry was inevitable, such a draft might prove an embarrassment.If it were decided not to publish a White Paper in advance, there wasno need to reach a decision at this stage on whether to have an inquiry,or on the form it might take.    It might be best to reserve any suchjudgment until after the debate, and for the Prime Minister to make this clear in winding up.    However, the Cabinet should reconsider thewhole question of an inquiry, and provision of Cabinet documents andthe conduct of the debate nearer the time.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that no White Paper should be issued. Theywere also agreed that no decision need yet be taken on whether tohave a further inquiry into these matters, what form such an inquirymight take, whether and if so what Cabinet documents should be madeavailable to any inquiry, or on the line to be adopted by theGovernment during the debate.    The Cabinet would return to thesematters well before The queen s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister, and agreed to resume their discussion at a later date.Cabinet Office13 October 19783
