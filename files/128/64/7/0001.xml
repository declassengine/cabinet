1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons before the Summer Adjournment, and that itwould be proposed that the House should rise on Thursday3 August until Tuesday 24 October.In a brief discussion of the forthcoming Supply Day debate onunemployment and with reference to recent Press comment, THECHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the figures providing the basis of the Governments assumptions about futureunemployment levels for the purposes of the January 1978 white paper, had been published by the Government Actuary in december last year.    They were working assumptions only and in previous years had regularly proved to be pessimistic.The Cabinet -1. Took note.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he was concerned that theGovernment appeared to be heading for defeat in the remainingdays before the Adjournment on both the draft Dock Labour Schemeand a Dividend Control Bill, if that were introduced.    It was not clear why the former could not have been introduced earlier or be deferred until the autumn.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the dock Work Regulation Act, which was passed in November 1976,imposed a statutory duty on him, having prepared a draft Schemeand undertaken consultations on it, to lay the Scheme beforeParliament for approval.    Without the Scheme the majorclassification provisions of the Act could not be implemented.Time had been occupied in securing trade union and employeragreement to the draft Scheme and in attempting to construct a parliamentary majority for it.    It had also been thought desirableto defer laying the Order until the completion of proceedings on theFinance Bill.    Both the Opposition and the Liberals however had confirmed that they intended to oppose the Scheme, and the DockWork Regulation Act had not been supported by any of the minorityparties.    Nevertheless, there was a strong case for going ahead with the Motion on the Scheme and accepting the risk of defeat.Undertakings had been given to the Trades Union Congress (TUC)Transport Industries Committee that the Scheme would be introducedthis Session;  and it was on this understanding that the employersand dockers had been persuaded to work the existing Scheme. The1L^-toENTARY^ployment, 011 the)oUr
Transport and General Workers Union fully understood that theOrder might not be carried but they had given assurances that ifthe attempt were made they would be able to stand out against the unofficial industrial action which seemed likely in the event of itsfailure.    If the issue were deferred to the autumn, on the otherhand, their position would be greatly weakened and, given theserious discontent which already existed in the dock industry,particularly with the potential dock closures by the Port of london authority, there would be a risk of widespread industrial action.This would be politically more damaging to the Government overthe next month or so than a Parliamentary defeat.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, TREASURY said that thesuccess or failure of the Motion would depend on absences. he expected some Members from the minority parties to be absent,but the issue would be very finely balanced.In discussion, it was argued that, in the absence of any industrial action so far, it was far from clear why the dockers should resort to this if the Government chose not to introduce the Scheme in the face of likely Parliamentary defeat.    The overall political situationrequired that the Government should not unnecessarily risk defeatat this time, and if the choice lay between attempting a Bill to controldividends and attempting the Dock Labour Scheme, there was nodoubt that the former would be of greater importance to the TUC.Moreover, the unions were not wholly united behind the Dock labour scheme, and there appeared to be a risk of abstentions by some government backbenchers.    The right course therefore would be toexplain the situation to the trade union leaders concerned on thebasis that it would be to their own and the general advantage to wait until the autumn when, if a General Election were held and theGovernment returned to power, the Scheme would have a better chance of being carried.   On the other hand, there was considerable support in the Cabinet for the view that the discontent amongst dockworkers had to be taken seriously.    It was argued therefore thatthe critical question was whether this would more easily be contained by an attempt to introduce the Scheme.    There was apossibility that it might be carried and even if it were not, the attempt would encourage many of the Government1 s traditionalsupporters who were critical of some other aspects of currentpolicy.    Moreover, the Scheme had the support of both employersand unions and could be presented to the House on that basis. the onus of thwarting Parliaments will, as expressed in the Dock WorkRegulation Act, would then fall on those who voted against theScheme.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that amajority of the Cabinet endorsed the judgment of the Lord Presidentof the Council and the Secretary of State for Employment that the motion on the Dock Labour Scheme should be proceeded withdespite the risk of defeat.    But it was important that every effort should be made to secure a majority for it.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.t^j^^t THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that an assurance&apos;H U^    n8 had been given to the House of Commons in 1974 that Ministers^Conoi^Pean would never agree to Community legislation in the Council of^***rri  C Ministers in advance of a debate recommended by the Scrutiny&amp;eb^Ull**y Committee.    More recently there had been Parliamentary pressure to embody this unqualified assurance in a Resolution of the house and he had undertaken to arrange a debate before the end of the session.    He therefore sought the agreement of his colleagues tomove a Resolution in terms that would make any Ministerialagreement to Community legislation given in advance of a debatesubject to the subsequent approval of the House.    This would be inaccordance with the Government&apos;s commitment to maintain theauthority of Parliament.In discussion it was argued that such a Resolution would not simplymaintain Parliaments authority but would increase its powers atthe expense of Ministers.    The Attorney General was aware of noprecedent for the imposition by Parliament, by Resolution ratherthan by or under a law, of a duty in mandatory terms on individual ministers as to the future exercise of particular executive orprerogative powers.    The Lord Presidents proposal would go well beyond the terms of the Governments present undertaking in deference to the views of a minority of backbenchers who were wholly unreconciled to our membership of the Community, and itcould have far-reaching implications for the discharge of Ministerialresponsibilities in relation to the Community and for the organisationof Government business generally.    Ministers would be unable togive their approval to Council legislation in urgent cases without therisk of being held in contempt of Parliament.    Moreover, theproposal was substantially different from that which had beendiscussed by the relevant Ministerial Group and accepted by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.    It raised important issues which required careful consideration on the basis of properdocumentation.    It was also suggested that the present arrangements3
for Parliamentary scrutiny and debate were working notunsatisfactorily, and there would be considerable opposition tofurther concessions to minority opinion.    The constitutionalinnovation inherent in the present proposal could however be avoided, and the promise of a debate redeemed, by a Motioninviting the House to take note of a Government undertaking. Onthe other hand, it was argued that a Motion to take note of aGovernment undertaking would not command sufficient Parliamentarysupport, and there would be a risk of the Government being facedwith a Resolution imposing an absolute obligation of the kind whichhad been averted in the debate last November only because theGovernment had undertaken to look at the whole matter afresh andto come back with a proposal before the end of the Session. AResolution in the terms now proposed would require Ministers whogave their agreement to Council legislation in advance of debatesrecommended by the Scrutiny Committee to bind themselves to seekParliamentary approval retrospectively; this would accord withthe Labour Party Conference Resolution that the Government should seek to extend Parliamentary control over Community legislation.The lack of a precedent for Parliament imposing a duty on Ministersabout the exercise of a particular executive or prerogative power was not relevant to the present issue where the concern was aboutthe restriction of the legislative authority of Parliament byMinisterial prerogative.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that important issues were raised by the lord presidents proposal for a Resolution in the terms suggested, andthey were not ready to form a judgment on it.    He would arrangefor further consideration to be given to the matter in a ministerial group which would include Ministers with responsibilities for business in the Council of Ministers.The Cabinet -3. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMiniscer&apos;8 summing up of their discussion.4
^aJGN 2&apos; THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said-^^S that at a breakfast meeting that day he and the United States Secretaryof State, Mr Vance, had reviewed Southern African problems. OnIta ern Namibia the next step was to go to the Security Council and it was expected that the debate there would take place early the following week.    As regards Rhodesia, their agreed aim was to get the;eje  Us leaders of all the main parties to the dispute to meet together&quot;^7ft\nCe8: privately and he hoped it might be possible to achieve this by the*jJicl second week in August.    If there were to be any prospect of success^t^?0118&apos; it was important that plans for this meeting should as far as possible&apos;kho\   anc* remain confidential and that its proceedings should be conducted inr58126th P&quot;vate.The Cabinet -Took note.5
^Tpr 3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the11 JULY Exchequer (CP(78) 83) covering a draft White Paper entitledSevio &quot;The Attack on Inflation:  The Future Course&quot;.    They also had;f6r^8 before them a letter from the chancellor s Private Secretary dated-Mho\ 19 July covering a draft of the accompanying statement which the&apos;:i*clu - Chancellor proposed to make to the House of Commons the followingVte^0118&apos; day* 2111(1 a letter dated 14 JulY from the Secretary of State for employment to the Chancellor of the Exchequer, proposing analternative formula for dealing with the pay of low incom3 groups.^eliV THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the White Paperset out a policy for stabilising, not reducing, the level of inflation.If the policy was successful, then after a temporary rise, the rateof inflation next summer should be about the same as at present,and it might fall further towards the end of 1979.    This requiredthat the rate of earnings increase should be halved, compared withthat during the third stage of incomes policy.    Making a suitableallowance for slippage and for drift, this suggested a norm of5 per cent.    Anything higher than this implied a return to doublefigure inflation.    If inflation were rising again by next summer, itwould be impossible to reduce the rate of earnings increase even further then.    The present time was the best opportunity theGovernment was likely to see to break the vicious circle of risinginflationary expectations.In discussion, it was argued that there was a margin for judgement in settling the pay guidelines.    Wages were not the only factorcausing inflation, although inevitably a major one.    A very low paynorm would not be credible, and would simply be ignored by theunions in negotiation.    Any norm should leave room for special treatment for the low paid, and if possible for dealing with the accumulated anomalies of previous stages of pay policy. the desired earnings outturn was only an average, and some groupsespecially in the public sector would receive significantly less than per cent.    Those who only received the suggested 5 per centbasic norm would suffer a reduction in the purchasing power oftheir gross pay, and in some cases their net real standard of livingwould also fall.    The Government should guarantee that there wouldbe no reduction in the standard of living.    If this were not possible,it should promise to take corrective action in the next Budget toprotect those who suffered as a result of pay policy.Against this it was argued that the overriding objective was to stopinflation rising again.    This might inevitably mean that some would suffer a small reduction in living standards.    But most of the low paid, particularly those with families, would gain from the recent
tax cuts and prospective improvements in social security benefits.Some rough edges were inevitable.    It was too early to assesswhat might be possible in next year&apos;s Budget.    The Governmentshould not give guarantees which it might not be able to honour.Experience of the previous round suggested that a reasonablemargin must be left for drift and for settlements above the norm.A 5 per cent guideline for settlements was therefore the right course, although it should not of course be implied that theGovernment expected any slippage.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that theCabinet should be conscious of the social justice of the claims ofthe lowest paid groups.    Three rounds of incomes policy had onlysecured a slight narrowing in the spread of income distribution,even after taking account of tax and benefits.    The Governmenthad supported the Trades Union Congress (TUC) target of a  30a week minimum wage in 1975.    As a result of the three subsequentrounds of incomes policy, the equivalent would now be  44. 50.He had therefore proposed, in his letter of 14 July to the Chancellorof the Exchequer, that higher percentage increases than the normshould be allowed for those whose resulting earnings would be no more than at this figure for a normal full time week.    The effect ofthis would be to extend the exemption for Wages Council groups,already in the present draft, to all whose earnings were approximately at the same level.In discussion, there was general support for this proposal.    It was recognised that the effect might be to add between 0. 25 and 0.5 percent to the national wages bill.    The danger of repercussions abovethe level of  44. 50 was not large, though it was noted that the scales of local authority manual workers began just above this figure.In discussion of this section, it was argued that paragraphs 15 and 16,taken together with paragraph 24, could exclude the re-establishmentof pay research for the non-industrial Civil Service in 1979, andadoption of the fair comparisons principle for the industrial CivilService.    It would be necessary to give assurances to the national staff Side and the industrial unions on this score, and there was aserious risk of industrial action.Against this it was argued that the Civil Service should not be singledout for special treatment. The Government should not give in to the threat of industrial action.    The Cabinet were committed to the
reintroduction of pay research, but this did not automatically mean that its findings would be implemented; they might in any caseneed to be staged.    The Lord Privy Seal should discuss with theChancellor of the Exchequer the exact nature of any reassurancesto be given to the Civil Service.In further discussion of this section, it was argued that the guidelineshad not been deliberately framed to encourage flexibility, and therewas very little room for its application.    The various special caseslisted in paragraph 15 (firemen, police, armed services, top salarygroups and university teachers) were not exactly comparable. Anumber of drafting changes were made to this section to reflectthese points.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said dividend controlsin one form or another had continued since 1973.    The legislation would run out on 31 July.    It could not be renewed in the Finance Bill.A separate Bill would be required, which would need the approval ofthe House of Lords.    In the Commons, the Government could not depend on the support of the Liberal Party, which after initialhesitation had now decided that it would not vote for the Bill. the tuc was anxious to see the control renewed.    Several big companies were known to be planning large distributions, involving increases in dividends of as much as 200 per cent in some cases.    If legislation were not possible, the alternatives would be to make it clear that itwould follow in the next Parliament.    The best course, if it were possible, would be to introduce a 6hort two clause Bill the next day,and to have the second reading immediately after the debate on theWhite Paper, concluding the remaining stages by the end of July.In discussion, it was argued that an attempt to extend dividend control was politically essential.    The abandonment would be completelymisunderstood.    The White Paper would strain the loyalty of some members of the Parliamentary Labour Party, but they would rallyto an attempt io maintain dividend controls.    It would be better to risk defeat, which could be blamed on the Opposition and the liberals, than not to try at all.    Against this, it was argued that theBill would require several critical votes.    If it survived secondreading, there would still need to be a guillotine motion, or a wholeseries of closure motions on individual amendments , which might benumerous.    There was no scope for drafting the Bill so as to minimise the risk of amendment.    A defeat on second readingfollowing immediately upon a successful vote on the White paper would detract from the political impact of the latter.    A successfulsecond reading, followed by a protracted debate which caused the
Government to withdraw the legislation, would be almost as bad.There would also be serious problems in the House of Lords. Thebest course might therefore be to separate at least the Committeeand remaining stages of the Bill from the debate on the White Paper.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR PRICES AND consumer protection said that following the Prime Minister&apos;s meeting withthe Confederation of British Industry (CBI) the previous day, he had himself met the Director General, Sir John Methven.    It was clearthat the CBI would not withdraw their opposition to sanctions and topay clauses.    It would however be wrong to abandon pay clauses,or to confine them to the remainder of Stage 3.    This would be interpreted as a weakening in the Government1 s position.    If theGovernment persisted, the CBI might moderate their support forthe White Paper, but this was not an essential factor.In discussion, there was general agreement for the proposition thatthe sanctions policy and pay clauses should be continued. the relevant paragraph of the White Paper would however needredrafting in consultation with the Attorney General.In further discussion of the text of the draft White Paper, a numberof detailed drafting changes were made.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the policies set out in the draft White Paper.Inflation should not be allowed to accelerate once more. this meant that the pay guideline must be set at 5 per cent for the following12 months, as proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. TheCabinet agreed to the proposal of the Secretary of State for Employmentabout special treatment for the low paid in full employment earningbelow  44. 50 a week, and the White Paper should be amended on thelines he had suggested.    The Lord Privy Seal should discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer the exact nature of any reassurancesabout pay research and fair comparisons to be given to the CivilService unions.    On dividend controls, the Cabinet agreed that aBill should be introduced to extend the controls for a further12 months.    The debate on the White Paper should take place on tuesday 25 July, and all stages of the Dividend Control Bill shouldbe taken on Thursday 27 July.    If following consultation through theusual channels with the Opposition and the Liberal Party, the lord president wished to propose any change in the timing of these arrangements it would be necessary for the Cabinet to consider thematter further.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should amend thedraft White Paper to include all points which had been agreed in9
discussion.    He should discuss the precise wording of paragraph 26with the Attorney General.    He had editorial discretion to makeany further minor drafting changes which were necessary withoutaltering the sense of the White Paper.    He should publish it onthe morning of Friday 21 July, and make a short accompanyingstatement in Parliament.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer andother Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office20 July 197810
