ftPaRUAMENTARY    1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.FOREIGN^FAIRS* * *A*ricadevious^erence:^M(78) l9th^lusions.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the line which had begun to emerge on Africa during the north atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO) Summit meeting had at one timecaused strong anxiety.    In particular there was a tendency by the americans to see the problem of Zaire in terms solely of East/west relations.    President Carter seemed to have been influenced by atalk with President Giscard a few days earlier, who had persuadedhim to take a firm position on the need for intervention and theestablishment of an African force.    This line had received some support from President Carter1 s advisers.    But the Prime Ministersintervention had ensured that the problems of Africa were seen in amore balanced way and as a result the communique put the situationin the right perspective.    This had in turn influenced the subsequent meeting of United States, French, German, Belgian andBritish officials in Paris.    Instead of dealing primarily with proposals for security intervention, that meeting had concentrated on the essential political and economic problems, and there had beenagreement that any solution to the Zaire problem could only comefrom improvements in the political structure and also that some waymust be found of dealing with the situation in Shaba.    There was tobe a further meeting in Brussels on 13/14 June which would concentrateprimarily on these aspects.    The arrival of 1500 Moroccan troops inZaire would introduce a greater feeling of security which should encourage the Europeans to stay on in the mines.    He had discussed the situation with the Prime Minister of Angola in New York on  June and as a result felt that the Angolan Government wasexercising as much control as was possible in the circumstances.The situation was aggravated by the presence of 200, 000 refugees from Shaba in Angola and the same number of Angolan refugees inZaire.    There had been separate meetings between President Kaundaof Zambia and President Neto and between President Kaunda and president Mobutu and any settlement which could be reached would depend very largely upon what could be agreed between these three.This was an African problem in which the Organisation for AfricanUnity should involve themselves.    Although they were reluctant, itwas in our interest to press them to do so.The very long border between Zambia and Zaire was difficult for theZambians to control and there was little doubt that the Katangese had crossed into Zambia without the knowledge of the authorities there.President Kaunda feared that a breakdown of law and order in Zairewould spread across the border to the Zambian copper belt, where thesituation was already difficult.    Our relations with President Kaunda
were at present better than they had been for a number of years andhe was being helpful over Rhodesia and Namibia.    He had welcomed the recent financial aid we had offered to make available and it wasin our interest to give him all the support we could.    He faced an election later this year, which he would probably win, although by a smaller margin.THE PRIME MINISTER said that President Nyerere of Tanzania had written to him and was very bitter about the French and Americanattitudes.    But in his speech at Annapolis on 7 June President Carterseemed to have redressed the balance and to have taken exactly theright line on Africa.    The important thing was to recognise thatwhile the Russians would continue to exploit targets of opportunity in africa we must look for the solution to these difficulties in the Africancontext.    The paper on Soviet policy in Africa which the cabinet had commissioned on 18 May had to some extent been overtaken: butthe Cabinet could with advantage consider a paper on African problemsgenerally and the response we should make to them, and the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should arrange for a paper on theselines to be circulated.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto proceed accordingly.Sovi    States/ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thate* Relations        President Carter&apos;s speech at Annapolis on 7 June should have asteadying effect.    While firm in tone it contained commitments to try to get reasonable Strategic Arms Limitation (SALT) and comprehensive Test Ban Agreements and made clear that there wasno direct link with the negotiations on either subject with the situationin Africa.    Political attitudes towards these negotiations were boundto be influenced by Soviet activities in Africa but any specific linkagewould be wrong.    The line taken by President Carter had reinforcedthe authority of the United States at a time when this was needed:but he had also been careful not to refute Dr Brzezinski, whorepresented the views of the powerful right wing in Washington. Whenhe (Dr Owen) had seen Mr Gromyko, the Soviet Foreign Minister,in New York he had been questioned intensively about the seriousness of President Carter&apos;s personal commitment to detente, and he hadreassured Mr Gromyko about this.    There was clearly a need for ameeting between President Carter and Mr Brezhnev, but it might be some time before this could take place.    As regards Mr Brezhnev1 s
own position, he appeared firmly committed to achieving a SALTagreement before his departure from the political scene, whichmight be expected within the next year or two.    It was very muchin our interest that he should succeed in this.The Cabinet -2. Took note.3
3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that at therecent meeting of the Energy Council there had been no agreement on the restructuring of the oil refinery industry and that the italians had blocked the proposals for support for Community coal production.The proposal that these matters should be considered by the ForeignAffairs Council was a potentially dangerous attempt to by-pass the energy Council     A move was being made by the Commission to challenge our landing requirements for North Sea oil.    This raisedimportant issues which would need to be considered by the ministerial committee on European Questions.In discussion it was pointed out that energy questions would inevitably be discussed at the next meeting of the European Councilin Bremen:  and the Foreign Affairs Council had been given generaloversight of the preparation for this.    It was helpful however thatthe Germans, who would have the Presidency at Bremen, had shown considerable scepticism about findingearly solutions.    These Community energy questions would not featureat the Bonn Summit where discussions on energy would concentrate on United States policy.    The President of the Commission hadbeen warned of the political sensitivity of North Sea oil andCommissioner Vouel had given the Foreign and commonwealth secretary an assurance that he would not seek to make this a publicissue but would be ready to have private discussions with theMinisters responsible.    It did not seem likely that the issue would arise within the next two months.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up, said that the ministerial committee on European Questions should consider the best tacticsto deal with a possible challenge by the Commission to certain aspects of our North Sea oil policy.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.4
theEconomicsituation4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that recent developments in thefinancial markets and elsewhere gave grounds for concern.    It wasproving difficult to sell gilt edged securities, and the money supplyfigures were deteriorating.    At the same time production was increasing faster than expected, and probably faster than the published figures indicated.    In these circumstances the Chancellorof the Exchequer was anxious to take action which would avoiddifficulties arising later in the year.    The main immediate question was whether or not to recoup the  500 million tax reductions forcedon the Government by the Opposition during the passage of theFinance Bill.    The Government has always made it clear that itmight prove necessary to do this.    It was also for consideration whether immediate action should be taken on the minimum lendingrate (MLR) and on the Supplementary Special Deposits scheme (the&quot;corset&quot;).    Action on all three elements, taken and announcedtogether, should avoid the risk of renewed pressure on sterling oron interest rates later in the year.    Provided that there could alsobe moderation in wage demands in the coming year the measures should assist in containing inflation.    Good progress had been madebut the current inflation rate of around 8 per cent per annum was still too high in relation to our main competitors and wage settlementsof around 5 per cent would be needed to hold the position.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the underlyingeconomic situation was still very good.    The figures for output,unemployment, prices and investment were all improving.    But thefinancial situation had remained worrying since the Budget, when the markets saw the  8.5 billion Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR) as at the outer limit of acceptability.    The Oppositionamendments to the Finance Bill had added to the PSBR, and therewas now no prospect that the Parliamentary situation would allow the amendments to be reversed.    Nor was it now safe to regard this additional stimulus as the United Kingdom contribution to a summitreflatioaary package.    The market situation would not allow this.There had been some erratic trade figures;  the monetary aggregateshad exceeded the planned target for the year just ended, and lookedlike remaining high unless offsetting action was taken.    Bank lendinghad increased rap:.dly, partly in anticipation of an expected control of advances, but had been directed mainly to commerce and the personalsector, rather than to manufacturing.    This might mean a further increase in imports later in the year.    Pressure on sterling had increased as the dollar had recovered in international markets,leading to a depreciation of 7 per cent in the effective exchange ratesince the start of the year despite heavy intervention by theauthorities.    This would have some effect on inflation at the end ofthe year, but it need not be serious provided that wages were held ata reasonable level.    In this situation it was tempting to sit tight and hope for an improvement, but the longer the Government waited, the
more severe the measures which might be needed if the deteriorationcontinued.    There was always a risk that unforeseen externalevents could provoke a sterling crisis, which would be highlyinconvenient in the autumn.    It would be better to act at once bothon the monetary and on the fiscal sides.    He therefore proposed thatthe MLR, which was now significantly below commercial rates,should be increased by 1 per cent, and that the &quot;corset&quot; should beintroduced immediately to restrict bank lending.    If the cabinet agreed, these measures would be announced at 12. 30 pm that day.They should be accompanied by action to recoup the lost revenue.Clearly this should not be done by reducing public expenditure. Itwould be unwise to increase the tax on beer or tobacco - which wouldhave an immediate effect on the Retail Price Index - and there wasno Parliamentary majority for an increase in petrol tax. the alternatives were therefore to unify the rate of Value Added Tax(VAT), at present 8 per cent and 12-1 per cent, or to increase theNational Insurance surcharge.    A single 10 per cent VAT rate wasin economic terms the best measure, and was administrativelyeasiest.    It would yield  300 million this year and  800 million in1979-80.    It would marginally help trade through the rebate on exports.    But it would add 0.9 per cent to the Retail Price Index, on top of the 0. 25 per cent increase which would follow from the building societies&apos; impending decision to increase their mortgage rates. Thiswould be very damaging to the Government1 s credibility and to paypolicy.    He therefore recommended that the surcharge on theemployers&apos; national insurance contribution should be increased bya further l\ percentage points from October.    This would yield 490 million in the current year and  1, 500 million in a full year.The full year effect would leave room for tax cuts in the 1979 Budgetto help secure the acceptance of pay policy in 1979.    It would haveno immediate effect on the Retail Price Index (RPI), although over12 months it would bring about a rise of 0.8 per cent.    It would bring the rate of social security contributions more in line with thatof our main competitors.    It would have an adverse effect on business liquidity, but the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)had indicated privately that it would not object to such action to pay for reductions in income tax.    Administratively, this measure wasvery difficult.    But it was the least damaging option in a verydifficult situation.    Taken together, these measures should help with the funding of the PSBR (although this could not be absolutelyguaranteed) and avoid the need for severer measures later in the year.In discussion there was wide agreement on the need for the measures proposed by the Chancellor.    Many people had considered theBudget PSBR forecast of  8. 5 billion as at the outer limit ofprudence.    The measures now proposed would only return the PSBRto that level.    Because they exactly offset the tax reductions forcedthrough by the Opposition, they would have no employment6
consequences.    By contrast, a sterling crisis later in the year would have a much more damaging effect.    The Chancellor&apos;sproposals were possibly a little over-cautious, but in this situation it was best to play safe.    It was emphatically not a crisis situation,but one which required only a minor correction whose importanceshould not be over emphasised.    The two previous increases inMLR had gone by without serious criticism.    Against this it was argued that there was no need to take precipitate action. Politicallyit was damaging to propose additional taxation in an election year.The case for doing so rested on purely monetarist arguments which no-one in the Cabinet believed.    It was not sensible toincrease United Kingdom taxes simply because the dollar hadstrengthened.    The chancellor s proposals would have a markeddeflationary effect, and would further increase unemployment and damage the prospects of a successful outcome to the Bonn Summit.Monetarist opinion in the City was deliberately creating a crisisatmosphere.    It should be met by a robust counter attack.    If action was needed, it should take the form of completely differentalternative measures.In further discussion it was suggested that the present difficulties were caused in part by the present organisation of the gilt edgedmarket, which would need attention once the Government had a parliamentary majority and was in a position to make changes. Thefuture organisation of the markets should be studied carefullymeanwhile.    But it was unwise to delay action, because of the expectations already aroused in the City and elsewhere which if not met might cause the situation to deteriorate further.    While it was unfortunate that the Cabinet chould be faced with the need to take adecision on a major economic issue of this kind without properpreparation, the alternative was to wait for a week or more, duringwhich time the situation might get worse and thus require strongercorrective action.In continued discussion, it was argued that the Government faced a difficult choice between the different ways of restoring the lostrevenue.    There was a case for putting the choice before the commons, which might prefer to return to the original Budgetproposal.    Against this it was argued that there was no chance ofsecuring a majority for the restoration of the lp cut in the standard rate of income tax, and no certainty that the  100 million lostrevenue on the higher income tax band could be restored at report stage of the Finance Bill in the following month.    Nor would it be safe to prolong uncertainty until then.    The arguments againstincreasing VAT were strong.    It would undermine the assumptionon which this year&apos;s National Insurance benefit uprating had been calculated.    It would have an immediate effect on the RPI whichwould work through to the July figures which would be published in
August.    The expectation of this RPI effect would have a verydamaging effect on negotiations with the trade unions over the nextphase of pay policy.    Against this, it was true that VAT increaseshad no effect on exports because they could be rebated. while there was a case for re-examining the present differential ratestructure, and perhaps maintaining or increasing the upper band,it should be remembered that the higher rate, at present 12-1 per cent,applied to many goods which were in general use, as well as toluxuries.    There were serious disadvantages in action on national insurance contributions.    The course proposed would require 900additional man years of work (compared with some 64, 000 staff employed on national insurance benefits) though part of this couldbe provided by increased overtime.    The increased cost would beat least  5 million.    It would consolidate the National Insurancesurcharge, originally adopted with reluctance because it ran counter to the contributory principle on which the whole present system hadbeen based since 1946.    It would awaken damaging memories ofthe first imposition of the surcharge in 1976, in a crisis situation.It would have a very damaging effect on contribution records,especially difficult in the first year of the new pensions system.There would be an increase in the number of defective records whichcould not be automatically corrected by checks in the computersystem, and the number of cases requiring investigation and appeal would increase steeply.    It would also, unavoidably, have someeffect on industrial costs and thus on inflation, and the Cabinet should consider whether these might be offset in some way through actionon other prices which would prevent the RPI from rising in thecoming months.    If such action could not take the form of a reductionin the mortgage interest rate, then other measures might be examined.    Finally, though an increase in longand short term interest rates in the immediate future was politicallyunfortunate, there was a good chance that the combined effect of themeasures proposed would allow interest rates to fall again in thelate summer and autumn as gilt edged sales got under way.In further discussion, it was argued that the Parliamentary tacticsand the presentation of the measures required great care. Therewas no need to table an immediate Ways and Means Resolution, the wording of which would in any case need attention to reduce the riskof amendment, provided the Government made clear its intention of setting down a resolution at the appropriate time.    While the fiscalmeasures should be clearly linked to the monetary ones, the Houseof Commons should be left in no doubt about the intention of the overall package.    This might best be done when the Prime Ministeranswered Questions that afternoon.    Step6 should also be taken toexplain the position to the liberal Party and secure a public promise of their Parliamentary support for the offsetting fiscal measures.The Chancellor of the Exchequer might join the Prime Minister in
explaining the background to the Parliamentary Labour Party.He could   also seek appropriate television coverage, to offset theeffect of the Conservative Party political broadcast the same evening.    There was no doubt that the Opposition would seek to exploit the situation.    The Government1 s reputation had dependedlargely on the way in which the firm measures it had taken in 1976had restored the economic situation.    That reputation might nowbe damaged by what would be presented as a panic response todeteriorating market conditions.    It would be important to presentthese measures as a small correction designed to offset their responsibility of the Opposition during the passage of the finance bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that action should now be taken to restore the revenuelost as a result of the Opposition amendments to the Finance Bill.This restoration should take the form of an increase in theemployers1 National Insurance contribution surcharge by Z\ percentagepoints from October.     This increase should be accompanied by anincrease of 1 per cent in minimum lending rate to 10 per cent, andby the imposition of the &quot;corset&quot; on clearing bank advances. TheChancellor of the Exchequer should arrange for the Governor of theBank of England to announce these two monetary measures at12.30 that day.    The Chancellor would announce the fiscal measuresat the same time.    He would himself use the opportunity of PrimeMinisters Questions that afternoon to put them into their politicalcontext.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should arrange to warn the Liberal Party in advance and seek their public support for themeasures.    He and the Chancellor of the Exchequer should meetthe Parliamentary Labour Party later that day and explain the background to them.    The Chancellor should seek short televisioninterviews that evening in which he could put the case to the country.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for prices and Consumer Protection should consider what might be done toreduce the impact of these measures on the Retail Price Index inthe late summer, and bring proposals before the Cabinet at a later stage.    The Chancellor should also consider how in the longer term the organisation of the gilt edged market might be improved to avoid a recurrence of the situation which had faced the Cabinet that day.All Ministers should observe absolute secrecy about the measures proposed until the appropriate announcements had been made.9
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office8 June 197810
