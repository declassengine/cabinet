a^airsJ^evi,1. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe meeting in Pretoria between the Five Western Foreign ministers and the South African Prime Minister, Mr Botha, had achieved the aim of avoiding an immediate crisis.    In public presentation the present  . efforts of the Five were devoted to trying to make the agreement^vious reached with the South Africans sound better than it really was. ButeilCe&apos; the major problem was that the South Africans were already goingr&quot;nfti) 34th back on the understandings.    The South African Foreign MinisterfyiniifU8*0n8&apos; had claimed in a broadcast that the United Nations representative,Mr Ahtisaari, would have to negotiate with whoever won theforthcoming election in Namibia.    The United States Secretary ofState, Mr Vance, had shown considerable annoyance over this andwas trying to get back to what was agreed.    It was important toarrange for Mr Ahtisaari to return soon to South West Africa inorder to resume discussions-    The key purpose would be to get theSouth African Government involved in negotiations for electionsunder United Nations auspices in the summer of 1979.    We hadbought time, but it was not a hopeful augury for future dealings withthe South African Government under the new Prime Minister if theywere prepared to abandon understandings so soon ofter they had beenreached.    This would make our task in the United Nations verymuch harder.    There was likely to be a debate in the security council in November under the chairmanship of Gabon and we wanted to be able to propose that further discussion should be deferred untilMr Ahtisaari&apos;s report was available.    But if the United Nations werenot prepared for him to return to South West Africa in the light ofthe South African Government1 s attitude, we should face difficulties over pressure for sanctions.    We must in any case expect a furtherdebate in December.    But it was important, so far as possible, toavoid confrontation with the South African Government during thenext few weeks while we needed their co-operation over Rhodesia.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that*j*evi0li various steps had been taken following the arrangements made^fe*e 8 between the prime Minister and President Kaunda in Kano.&quot;&apos;^S) Agreement had been reached on details of the copper purchase,&quot;^clu .    ^ Some arms were being sent to Zambia within the next few days:&quot;^^t^8^0113&apos; these would be light arms and ammunition, some anti-aircraft gunsand Tigercat missiles, which were less sophisticated than Rapierbut would provide some protection for Lusaka airfield. Theserepresented a continuation of our military aid to Zambia and theywere provided on the basis of assurance that they would not be passed on to third parties.    The Nigerians had also offered military support, which would probably be in the form of a battalion, butthey had made it clear that this was not to be used in the borderareas or in support of the guerillas.    The military assistance we were
providing was minimal but it should be sufficient to meet theimmediate requirements.    There had already been some hints in thePress of this since the Kano meeting.    It should not therefore comeas a surprise and we should be able to deal with any public criticism.Moreover, given that the Commonwealth Heads of GovernmentMeeting was due to take place in Lusaka next year, it was important that we should be able to say we had responded to President Kaunda1 request for help.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.2
&apos;^^!U^ITY 2.       THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER recalled that^-S discussions about a European Monetary System (EMS) had begun atthe meeting of the European Council in Copenhagen in April when alltUrQ the Heads of Government had recognised that continuing currencyKon ^ean instability was damaging to growth and development.    They had agreedthat a zone of greater monetary stability in Europe would be desirable and had asked the Finance Ministers of the European economic community (e.c.) to prepare proposals.    He had succeeded in getting^fei.0U8 the Finance Council to put forward guidelines which stressed the needCe: for any system to favour rather than restrain economic growth; totaicl impose symmetrical obligations on the weaker and stronger currencies;lUnut 81l0n8* and to be accompanied by a less perverse system of transfer of the 1resources within the Community, involving among other things a drasticrestructuring of the Common Agricultural Policy,    At the EuropeanCouncil in Bremen in July, however, the French President had tried to secure the adoption of different proposals and, although the PrimeMinister had safeguarded our interests, these proposals had been referred back to the Finance Council for further study.    The subsequenttechnical discussions had turned on whether, as in the present &quot;snake1&apos;arrangements, intervention obligations would fall equally on the weakerand stronger currencies, which would merely serve to help theGermans keep down the rate for the Deutschmark (DM), or whetherthe obligations would fall more fully on the deviant currency. InSeptember we had appeared to be isolated, but at the last meeting ofthe Finance Council in October we were supported by the Irish and theItalians in pressing for a system which would put automatic obligationson the deviant currency.    Even the position of France, Belgium and luxembourg had moved closer to our own and only the Danes and theDutch were supporting the Germans in their original position.Upward pressure on the DM just before the November Council meeting had added DM10 billion to the German money supply and had led to are-alignment of the &quot;snake&quot; currencies.    These developments hadreinforced the hostile attitude of German banking circles towards EMSand even to the &quot;snake&quot; arrangement.   Discussions between centralbankers and officials were continuing, and there would be a further meeting of the Finance Council on 20 November.    There were alsointensive bilateral contacts.    The Prime Minister had metChancellor Schmidt and during November would meet President Giscardof France and Senor Andreotti of Italy.    He was himself hoping to meetthe Italian and French Finance Ministers.    It remained to be seen whether it would be possible to develop a scheme which would holdout the prospect of greater currency stability at less potential costto the reserves.    The possibility of making changes in the rate shouldthe underlying economic circumstances require it had already beenconceded.    But the German position with regard to the interventionobligations was hardening and the latest developments with the UnitedStates dollar would not help.    It was also relevant that because of his desire to have an early scheme, the French President was likely tomake concessions to the German position.    The scheme was genuinelydirected towards achieving greater exchange rate stability rather thanEuropean Monetary Union: but we had to consider it in a hard-headed
and practical way and decide whether it would fit our economic interests and in particular the priority we had to give to fightinginflation.    He would be submitting a paper for discussion in Cabinetin the following week.     Final decisions could come later and perhaps not before the European Council on 4-5 December. there seemed to be a growing feeling that the other members of theCommunity might in any case find it difficult to reach agreement ona scheme which could start on 1 January 1979.In discussion it was urged that the Cabinet should consider not onlythe technical details of the scheme (including the extent to which it involved co-operation on monetary as well as exchange rate policies),but also the wider implications of EMS and how it would relate tothe Governments wider policies.    The procedure by which the EMSproposal had been developed also merited discussion.    It hadoriginated in a Franco/German initiative and there seemed to havebeen a commitment in principle at the European Council. Thisraised questions both of collective Cabinet responsibility and of the role of theEuropean Council under the Rome Treaty. Theconstitutional implications of any limitation on the Governmentsfreedom to decide its exchange rate policy would alio need to beconsidered.    Finally it was suggested that the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s paper would need also to deal with the consequences of britain staying out of EMS, especially in the light of current and prospective developments of the United States dollar.THE FHIME MINISTER   said the Cabinet would have a first full discussion of EMS in the following week on the basis of a paperprepared by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.    It would cover the implications both of joining and of staying out of an EMS as fully aspossible:  but in view of the sensitivity of exchange rate question and the risk of leaks, it would not be possible to circulate detailedworking papers.    He wished to emphasise that at the EuropeanCourcil in Bremen there had been no commitment in principle to thescheme and President Giscard had expressly acknowledged that notonly he, but the Prime Ministers of Italy, the Irish Republic, andthe Netherlands had not been prepared to make such a commitmentat that stage.    He had given the Cabinet a prior indication of the linehe intended to take at that meeting and he had adhered to it. Hewould arrange for the report of hi9 Press conference at Bremen to be circulated to members of the Cabinet.    In his talks with ChancellorSchmidt in the previous week he had sought to convince him that our approach to EMS was not a question of being for or against Europe,but whether the scheme was likely to be in the interests of the UnitedKingdom and the wider objective of greater monetary stability. Itwas important that the Governments approach should continue to be presented in that light.    Otherwise we risked prejudicing our position on other Community matters, e,g fish where progress was being madein conjunction with the German Presidency.    He had made it clear toChancellor Schmidt that the Government intended to give overriding4
priority to fighting inflation and that part of his scepticism about EMSarose from doubts about its viability if the existing divergent trends in inflation rates were to continue.    They had also discussed thesituation of the United States dollar, where Chancellor Schmidttended to take a resigned view about President Carter&apos;s ability tocontrol the situation.    Since the meeting, the United States dollarhad weakened much further.    If the decline in the dollar were tocontinue, it could have most serious psychological and commercialconsequences.    Rather than dwelling on the failure of the americans to act earlier, we should consider giving them some encouragement and possibly suggestions for remedial action.    He intended to discuss this urgently with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers directly concerned and also with the United States Ambassador. Hewas considering sending an appropriate message to President Carter.The Cabinet -Took note.5
public expenditure^79-80 TOOUTSTANDINGISSUESdeviousTerence s:^78) 35thConclusions,Minute 4; and\ inclusions,Winnie 53.       The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury (CP(78) 107) and a joint memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Education and Science and Paymaster General, the Secretaryof State for Social Services, the Secretary of State for Scotland, theSecretary of State for Wales and the Minister for Social Security(CP(78) 108), both dealing with proposed increases in the programme for Education and for Health and Social Security for 1979-80 and later years, together with a note by the Central Policy Review Staff(CP(78) 111) commenting on these two papers.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY , said that at their last meeting, the Cabinet had instructed him to discuss with the other ministers concerned the allocation of  57 million which the cabinet had agreed to transfer from the Contingency Reserve to deparmental programmes in 1979-80.    He had not been able to reach agreementwith the Ministers concerned, who contended that  107 million was theirreducible minimum which they could accept, requiring a further 50 million to be deducted from the Contingency Reserve for 1979-80.He had no authority to agree to this further transfer.    Indeed hewould strongly resist it.    It was essential, for reasons of confidence,that the Government should publish a Contingency Reserve for 1979-80which was at least as large as that which it had published for 1978-79&quot;at the beginning of that year.    The allocation for 1978-79 was alreadyknown to be almost entirely used up.    If Cabinet reaffirmed its decision to transfer only  57 million from the Contingency Reserve,his own personal preference would have been to allocate this entirely to the Health and Personal Social Services programme.    But he was prepared to accept, as an alternative, a split of 2:1 between that programme and education, giving  38 million to Health and personal social Services, and  19 million to Education.    Decisions were alsoneeded on the size of the school meals price increase in September1979, where the choice lay between an increase of 3p or an increaseof 5p.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that the Cabinet discussion at itsprevious meeting had been curtailed for reasons of time, and it hadnot been possiole to deploy the arguments in favour of the additionalbids for her programmes.     She did not believe it would be possibleto find room for these, and for essential additional expenditure onthe Health Service, within a provision of only  57 million from the contingency Reserve, and accordingly she recommended reopeningthe earlier Cabinet decision.    The main pressures on her pro-gramme arose from earlier Cabinet decisions on school meal charges.Successive Public Expenditure White Papers had included a run of figures which assumed regular increases in school meal charges.But subsequent Cabinet decisions had postponed these increases sothat it would now require a 23p increase in September 1979 to returnto the level of provision assumed in the public expenditure survey.This was clearly unrealistic.    The cost of previous postponement6
of increases in school meal charges had been borne from the contingency Reserve in the year in which they took effect, andit might be argued that the whole cost should again be found fromthe Contingency Reserve for 1979-80.    She was however preparedto find  47 million from her departmental allocation, provided that 50 million extra came from the Contingency Reserve.    Even thiswould seriously reduce her ability to meet additional demand,totalling some  93 million, from the savings of  91 million whichhad already been identified in her programmes. Expenditureon the arts, sciences, teacher retraining and nursery education wouldbe severely cut.    In their paper (CP(78) 111) the CPRS had argued that educational expenditure had not fallen proportionately to thenumbers now in education.   This was misleading, because thereduction in numbers was at the primary stage, where costs werelowest, while the numbers in secondary and higher education were still rising.    On Educational Maintenance Allowances, she believedthat it was important to make provision within the four year timespan of the Survey.    The Government was publicly committed to theintroduction of such a scheme, although the timing and rate of granthad been deliberately left open.    The modified scheme proposed in cp(78) 108 would cost only  17 million in the first year.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he supported the proposals of the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General.    His own proposals covered bothsocial security and the health and personal social services. Theproposed extension of long term supplementary benefit rates to thelong term unemployed had been scaled down to the minimum practic-able level.    His proposals for health and personal social services(which it was important to take together) would add only  45 million in 1979-80.    This was only just sufficient to maintain the momentumgiven by the  50 million increase in the 1978 budget.    He had tomeet a number of other additional increases during the year, notably 14 million additional costs on the family practitioner services,leaving only  23 million real growth, or less than 2 per cent. Itwas important that the health service should grow at least as fast asthe rate of public expenditure as a whole.    This was the only way in which important new initiatives in health care could be taken.In discussion, it was first argued that the Cabinet had already taken a decision on the level of Contingency Reserve for 1979-80 which itwould be wrong to reverse.    Whether or not the United Kingdomentered the proposed new European Monetary Scheme there was a risk that sterling would come under pressure during the winter.This could only be resisted if overriding priority were given to the counter-inflationary programme, which involved both fiscal action and restraint in public expenditure.    It would therefore be wrong to publish a Contingency Reserve figure for the ensuing year which was clearly inadequate and would inevitably be overspent.    The Cabinet1 discussion was concerned solely with very small margins on very7
large ongoing programmes.    It was a defect in their arrangements that Ministers were unable to consider more fundamentally the wholequestion of priorities between and within ongoing programmes. ThePrime Minister was already in discussion with the Chancellor of theExchequer separately about possible new machinery to deal with this problem.In further discussion it was argued that the Contingency Reserve for1979-80 did not necessarily need to be as large as that which had beenprovided for 1977-78.    In that year, the Contingency Reserve had beenestablished in the knowledge that there would be a large claim for newemployment measures early in the year.    But in 1979-80 it was proposed to allow for these within departmental programmes from the start, and the Contingency Reserve could be correspondingly smaller.Against this, it was argued that the Contingency Reserve for 1977-78was already virtually spent, and it would be unrealistic to begin1979-80 with a reserve significantly smaller than  800 million:recalculation of the cost of social security benefits might in any casereduce this to  700 million before the year began.    On the questionof underspend, it was unrealistic to take additional credit for thisunless the Ministers concerned were prepared to reduce their owndepartmental programmes accordingly.   In particular, there was noreason to suppose that the programme for employment services would be significantly underspent in 1979-80, when the causes ofunderspend on individual components in 1977-78 had now disappeared.In discussion of Educational Maintenance Allowances, it was argued that in her discussions with the local authority associations theSecretary of State for education and Science and Paymaster general had made the Government proposals appear firmer than in fact theywere.    The original scheme was not cost-effective, particularly in comparison to other employment measures, and was unlikely to be politically popular.    It might indeed lead to considerable criticism.It was certainly not of sufficiently high priority to justify a largeclaim on the Contingency Reserve at this stage.On school meals, it was argued that the figures in successive public expenditure White Papers had always been unrealistic.    The cabinet would never be prepared to agree to rncreases on the scale whichwould be required to validate them.    Such increases would bepolitical dynamite.    It would be possible to postpone a decision on the size of the next increase, in September 1979, until the Budget of thatyear.    The cost of any further postponement of the increase could then be met from the Contingency Reserve as it had been in previousyear8.    It was only because the Departments concerned were trying to get decisions in an orderly fashion in time for the Rate support grant (RSG) negotiations that the issue arose in its present form.However, if a decision were not reached in time for RSG talks, the costs would be borne 100 per cent by the Government, instead ofbeing added to the total of eligible expenditure and divided between government and local authorities.    The cost of providing school8
meals, at 48p each, appeared excessive in relation to food costs.But although those employed on the service were largely low paidpart-time women, labour costs were a large part of the total.There might be scope for further economies in the service beyondthe 10 per cent reductions which had already been made.    But itwas clear that a significant price increase was essential inSeptember 1979, after a lapse of two years, and it would be wrong for the Government to flinch from this.    To do so would be to ignore the very substantial improvements in Child Benefits whichhad been made in the last year.    If the Trades Union Congressmade an issue of school meal charges during the current round oftalks about pay policy, they should be resisted.In discussion of the social services provisions, it was argued thatthere was little political credit for the Government in any further assistance to the long term unemployed, but that this was ameasure which any Labour Government should undertake as a high priority.    Many of those concerned were disabled or otherwisedebarred from permanent employment.   It had already been decided not to extend the Christmas bonus to help these people, and some change in the scale of their benefits was long overdue.    As for theprovision for the Health Services, it was important to preservesome flexibility as between the National Health Service and LocalAuthority services within whatever total was available.    If thattotal were as little as  57 million, there was a strong case forallocating the whole of it to these services at the expense ofeducation.In further discussion the question of expenditure in 1980-81 was raised.    There were a number of individually small but politicallyimportant items of expenditure which could be accommodated inthe programme for that year if the Contingency Reserve was reduced by  100 million out of the budgetted  1, 500 million.Against this view it was argued, first, that the  1, 500 millionContingency Reserve for 1980-81 had to be preserved for the sake of credibility and, second, that it would be more appropriate todiscuss new claims on public expenditure in 1980-81 nearer thetime when priorities could be more readily assessed. there could be no question of new decisions for 1980-81 being taken intime to be reflected in the public expenditure White Paper.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the dicussion, said that theCabinet could not reopen their earlier decisions and were nowconcerned only with the allocation of the remaining headroom in1979-80 between the education programmes and the social servicesprogrammes.    They agreed that an additional  50 million should be allocated to Health and Personal Social Services (but not to social security) and an additional  19 million to the education programmes,for the United Kingdom as a whole in each case.    This meant a contingency Reserve of  788 million to start 1979-80 which was9
sufficiently close to the Cabinet&apos;s earlier decision.    The planningassumption for school meals should be that there would be a price increase of 5p in September 1979, and the RSG negotiations shouldbe conducted on this basis.    Educational Maintenance allowances would not be provided for in the White Paper but the Secretary ofState would be free to put forward a proposal in due course thatthey should be considered in the ordinary way, and with anyfurther additional bids, as claims on the Contingency Reserve inthe course of the year.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.10
4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President ofthe Council (CP(78) 113) to which was attached a copy of the draft ofThe queen s Speech on the Opening of Parliament incorporating the amendments made at the previous meeting and in the form in whichit had been approved by The Queen.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Cabinet had agreed at their previous meeting that there should be an opportunityto consider the draft Speech again in the light of the meeting with theLabour Party&apos;s National Executive Committee (NEC) on 23 October,and to make final amendments if necessary.    That meeting had now taken place;  most of the suggestions put forward had already been anticipated in the draft Speech, or could be covered in speechesduring the Debate on the Address, but he proposed two additions.One was to add a reference to the benefits of North Sea oil in the paragraph on the Government&apos;s economic policies;  and the otherwas to include a more general reference to the National health service in addition to the individual proposals for legislation in the paragraph on the social services.    A consequential amendment wouldbe to place the reference to the proposed Bill on L^gal Aid at the endof that paragraph.    In addition, the Secretary of State for Scotlandhad proposed that the reference to legislation to establish newnegotiating machinery for teachers in Scotland should be omitted inview of the difficulty of securing support for that Bill. the description of the proposed Education Bill for England and wales would need to be reconsidered in the light of the discussion on public expenditure earlier in the meeting, but the reference to the social security (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill could now be confirmed.In the course of a brief discussion the following amendments were agreed -a. Page 2, third paragraph.    The fourth sentence should read:   &quot;Building on the stronger domestic economy now established, and using the benefits of North Sea oil further to improve long-term recovery, they will vigorously pursue their policies designed to promote the success of industryand to increase productivity&quot;.b. Page 3, first sentence, to read:   &quot;My Governmentwill seek to ensure that respect for the law is maintained andwill give full support to strengthening the Police Service&quot;.c. Page 4, second paragraph.    The first sentence should read:   &quot;Legislation will be introduced to improve the law on education in England and Wales and to enable grants to bemade in Wales towards the cost of bilingual education&quot;.11^HE QUEEN&apos;Ssp ECH ON^HE OPENING0* PARLIAMENTdevious^(78)k^ons,ence:-vO 35th
d. Page 5, first paragraph.    This should be revised asproposed by the Lord President of the Council, while retaining the sentence on the measure to extend benefits for the disabled.e. Page 5, third paragraph.    The words referring to new machinery for negotiating teachers1 salaries andconditions of service should be omitted as proposed by theLord President of the Council.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet now gave final approval to the draft Speech, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.    The meeting with the NEC hadbeen useful;  he proposed to hold a similar meeting next year but atan earlier stage of the discussion of the draft Speech.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.^CTt^ 5* THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that Press^ reports that morning, notably in The Times newspaper, had suggested that the Government would be trying to limit the Rhodesia^evi0 debate, during the Debate on the Address, to the report of the^fej,^8 Bingham Inquiry and that this was not acceptable either to the Official^t?8) Opposition, the Liberal Party, or a number of the Governments own[0Mu backbenchers.    Questions had already been raised about whether, and^Ute ^0ns&apos; ^ so *n what form, the House would be able to vote on these matters.The Press reports were untrue but care would be needed to explain the situation to the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) to avoid unnecessary dissension.    The meeting of the PLP on Thursday,2 November would provide an opportunity for this and the Chief Whipcould also circulate an explanatory note to all members of the PLP.The Cabinet -Took note.12
6. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that,following up the Prime Ministers speech at the Party Conferencejjj  , in Blackpool in September Ministers had begun discussions with the^efg&quot;10118 Trades Union Congress (TUC) about pay policy.    Three meetingsexiCe: had been held so far with the TUC representatives on the National^78) 34^ Economic Development Council (the &quot;NEDDY 6&quot;).    Ministers werec*Usion8, operating firmly within the context of the Prime Minister1 s publiclIiute 5statement that the objective was to see whether a better way ofcurbing inflation than that set out in the White Paper could be foundand that if no preferable alternative was agreed then the Governmentwould stick to the policy in the White Paper.    It was clear that theNEDDY 6 could not accept Government intervention in pay policy generally as they were clearly bound on this point by the decisions by the TUC Conference and individual union Conferences.    But therewas agreement on the objective of keeping the rise in inflation nextyear to S per cent or less and union leaders were making a genuineeffort to reach as much agreement as possible on how this might beachieved.    The NEDDY 6 wanted to operate on prices rather thanpay and had put forward some possible ideas.    But they had not sofar shown how precisely these would work nor had ihey said whatguidance they would be willing to give to union negotiators. Equallythey had not offered ideas as to how to secure that any such guidancewould be observed.    More detailed proposals from the NEDDY 6 were expected.    For their part Ministers had expressed their willingness to consider whether more might be done for the low paid and,possibly linked with this, to consider the scope for a special approachin the public services taking account of the pay research arrangements which currently operated for the Civil Service.    But he emphasised that nothing could be agreed in these areas unless Ministers were satisfied that TUC support could be obtained to ensure that any special arrangements were not inflationary.    He expected the discussions tocontinue for at least another two weeks.    The NEDDY 6 would thenneed to clear any agreement reached with either or both the EconomicCommittee and the General Council of the TUC.    The Cabinet wouldalso wish to consider the outcome particularly if any modification tothe policy in the White Paper was proposed.    The Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) were disturbed at the apparent switch of attention from pay to prices and economic Ministers would be seeingthem later that day.    It was clear from the discussion already held with the NEDDY 6 that it would be very difficult to reach a satisfactory agreement with the TUC and it was too early to feel at all confident.Nevertheless there was *o doubt that the NEDDY 6 were concerned toavoid confrontation which they realised could be damaging to them aswell as to the Government.    They were accordingly anxious to reachas large a measure of agreement as possible though their room for manoeuvre was constrained.    He was encouraged by the apparentgrowth of public support for the Government&apos;s stance on inflation and pay policy.    There had in fact been considerably fewer breaches so13
far this year than at the same time last year and those breacheswhich now seemed likely, for example,   Ford,  British Oxygenand Road Haulage were areas where breaches had occurred lastyear also.   But there were also one-third fewer settlements sofar this year than last year.    Negotiators were holding backbecause of the uncertainties about pay policy.    Some newspaperswere already writing off the 5 per cent policy.    This was damagingand misleading, and it was important for Ministers to continue tosupport the policy in public with confidence and determination.In discussion it was argued that, notwithstanding any possible swingof public opinion in support of the Governments policy, it was of thehighest importance to achieve an agreement with the TUC. Therewere in any case great difficulties ahead particularly in relation tothe low pay problem with which a TUC agreement could give consider-able help.    There was a great desire on the part of the  TUC toreach agreement and the longer the talks went on the more importantit would be to ensure that they had some positive outcome.    It wouldbe particularly valuable, whatever else was agreed, if the TUC were able to resume giving guidance to negotiators.    Ministers concernedin the discussions might usefully deploy the argument that those proposals involving public expenditure to which the TUC attachedparticular importance had inevitably to be dependent on a sensibleoutcome on pay.In further discussion it was argued that there was no evidence so farin this round that employers were caving in to unrealistic wagedemands.    Indeed the resistance by the Daily Express, Vauxhalland Ford managements suggested the opposite even though at Fordthe settlement might be above the guideline.    Given an atmosphere of responsible negotiation Ministers should recognise that somesettlements would come out above the guidelines.     A rigid policyof applying sanctions to all who broke the guidelines could be damaging to the Government&apos;s position.    It was, for example, clearthat sanctions against Ford could be little more than cosmetic.There was no chance that they would affect the Ford settlement andthey might well simply result in harmful publicity for the Government.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet wanted the talks with the TUC to succeed and should theybreak down, to avoid any impression that the fault rested with theGovernment.    But the Governments basic and overriding objective was the control of inflation and any agreement with the TUC wouldhave to serve that end.    The Government could not, and would not,seek agreement at any price.    There were signs of growing publicrealism about the need for pay restraint.    It was also clear that ifadequate restraint could not be achieved then there would be no alternative but to impose higher taxes.    It was important to leavethe public in no doubt of the Governments determination.    To that end it would be necessary to apply sanctions against Ford should they breach the guideline otherwise the credibility of the Governments
approach would be undermined.    There wa6 support for theGovernment1 s policy amongst the trade union rank and file generally and the problem often lay with the extent to which power had fallen,or been given, to shop stewards who were not in line with thethinking of either the rank and file or that of senior union leaders.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.^tLREPORTCcm    e select&quot;committee ONs\OCED*re,^SSIon 1977-787.       The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (CP(78) 109) to which was attached a copy of a report bythe Official Committee on Parliamentary Procedure.    The noteinvited the Cabinet to consider how the initial Government response to the Procedure Committee&apos;s report, published on 3 August,should be handled and whether any Government viev should be expressed on the recommendation for a comprehensive system ofselect committees, with broad terms of reference, covering the responsibilities of all Government Departments and the nationalised industries.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that support had been expressed in many and varied quarters for an extension of the role of select committees such as the Procedure Committee had recommended.    There had been support from the National ExecutiveCommittee and the Annual Conference of the Labour Party, andmost recently by the Opposition spokesman, Mr Francis Pym;and he noted that a majority of Permanent Secretaries wouldfavo&quot;.r going along with a system of departmental select committees.In evidence to the Procedure Committee he himself had put the opposite case, to which he still adhered.    He considered that itwould in any event be a mistake to rush in and accept the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s recommendations on select committees, which wouldhave far-reaching implications for relations with Parliament andfor any Labour Government&apos;s ability to carry through programmes of reform.    He believed that the Government should arrange for theProcedure Committee&apos;s report to be debated on an AdjournmentMotion and that any further action on the report should be delayed until the next Parliament.    If the Government were returned with a clear majority at the next Election, it would, in his view, be quitewrong to extend the role of select committees in a way which wouldenable the Opposition to impede the Governments programme.He also genuinely believed that the system recommended by theProcedure Committee would have the effect of damaging, ratherthan strengthening, backbench power, whose present force lay inthe access which any backbencher enjoyed to the full procedures of the House of Commons itself.
In discussion, it was argued that there was a widespread demandfor more power to control the actions of the Executive and matit was very doubtful whether the Government could resist this,even if it were desirable to do so.    There was in fact a strong case for extending the select committee system.    Much depended on the role which was actually assigned to any particular committeeand on its membership, but it would be wrong to argue against anextension of the system simply by reference to the performance of particular select committees in the past.     There was no reasonto suppose that an extension would prejudice the pursuit ol partisanpolicies, since the select committee role was essentially one ofscrutiny and of making recommendations which the Governmentcould accept or reject.    With Governments intervening more andmore in the country1 s economy, it was right that parliament should want and receive more information than in the past.    On theother hand, it was pointed out that the Procedure Committeethemselves saw the problem as being one of shifting the balance ofadvantage between Parliament and Government which they believed to be weighted in favour of Government to a degree which was&quot;inimical to the working of our Parliamentary democracy&quot;.    It was argued that this was a wrong assessment and that the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s proposals could substantially alter and reduce thenature and role of the Chamber.    Nothing would be achieved by reducing the power of the Executive beyond the limit where it couldact under our present Parliamentary system;  and, irrespective ofthe arguments for and against an extension of the select committeerole, there were real disadvantages in adopting any comprehensive system comparable with that in the United States.In discussion of the handling of the Governments initial response tothe Procedure Committee&apos;s report, it was agreed that theGovernment should indicate their readiness to have an early debate in the new Session and that the choice lay between a &quot;take note&quot;motion and a debate on the Adjournment.    The former would howeverun the risk of amendment.    The debate and the Governmentshandling of it would require careful consideration, but theGovernment posture should in general be one of listening to thearguments before reaching any conclusions.    One possibility mightbe to arrange for the debate to be initiated by the Chairman of theProcedure Committee,THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the dicussion, said that themajority of those who had spoken were opposed to the ProcedureCommittee&apos;s recommendations for a comprehensive system of departmental select committees.    The Cabinet agreed that theGovernments initial response to the report should be to indicate;their readiness to arrange an early debate in the new Session, the precise form of which the Lord President of the Council would16
BELTS 8.       The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the present Secretary of State for Transport (CP(78) 110) proposing therefore^0US preparation of a Bill in the coming Session to make the wearing ofCui^Gllce&quot; seat belts compulsory, with the possibility of a &quot;contracting out&quot;C      / 27th provision to allow individuals to claim exemption if they considered^.    u8ions, that such compulsion infringed personal liberty;  and a memorandumnUte 4* by the Home Secretary (CP(78) 112), setting out the objections to a&quot;contracting out&quot; provision.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the merits of the case for the compulsory wearing of seat belts were well known:it would save lives and money on a large scale, as indicated inparagraph 4 of his memorandum.    As a possible means of mitigatingthe opposition which had been expressed when similar measures hadbeen before Parliament in the past, he had put forward a suggestion for a &quot;contracting out&quot; scheme:  he recognised that it would be anunusual provision and would prefer to introduce the Bill without it,but if it was argued that legislation for this purpose raised uniquequestions of principle and personal responsibility, a &quot;contracting out&quot; provision might be thought justified.    He considered that a Billon seat belts would command a majority in the House of Commons;that informed opinion would be strongly in favour of it;  and that theGovernment would be open to severe criticism if no Bill were brought forward in the coming Session.    The wider popularity of the bill was very difficult to judge, but the saving of lives represented astrong case for introducing it;  many of those who might objectinitially were likely to accept and observe the legislation once itwas passed.    He therefore proposed that the Government should introduce a Bill early in 1979, with time to ensure its passage beforethe end of the Session.    Its pro visions would not however take effect until 1980.THE HOME SECRETARY said that he did not regard a &quot;contracting out&quot; clause as an acceptable option in relation to the criminal law.Police opinion was divided on the general issue of seat beltslegislation and the police would not take seriously the enforcement of a voluntary law.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he shared the Home Secretary1 s objections on grounds of law.In discussion of a possible &quot;contracting out&quot; clause, it was pointedout that once the principle of voluntary observance had been acceptedthere would inevitably be attempts to extend it into other fields, forexample to legislation on health and safety, with potentially serious consequences.    Where exemptions were justified on objectivecriteria, for example on medical grounds or while the vehicle wasbeing driven in reverse, they could be provided and generally applied.It was agreed that for the reasons which had been advanced against it, the possibility of a &quot;contracting out&quot; scheme should not be pursued.18
In discussion of the merits of introducing the Bill without a&quot;contracting out&quot; clause in the coming Session, it was pointedout that the Road Traffic (Seat Belts) Bill which the Governmenthad introduced in 1975-76 had been left to a free vote on SecondReading in the House of Commons, and it would be difficult not tofollow the same procedure in the coming Session.    If this were done there might be problems in securing the Bill&apos;s passage through its remaining stages.    Bills on both seat belts and public lendingright had previously fallen to the determined opposition of a minority of Members;  a fresh Bill on public lending right was to be introducedearly in the coming Session and the Government hoped to ensure itsenactment, but a Bill on seat belts was unlikely to complete its passage without a timetable Motion which the Conservative opposition were unlikely to support for a measure of this kind.    Their attitudemight lead to problems in the management of Parliamentary businessgenerally.    In addition the Eill could affect opinion in the country at large where it might be regarded as unwelcome Government inter-ference in matters of individual choice and personal responsibility and might cause considerable resentment.    It was further aorguedthat any Bill which attempted to regulate conduct in matters whichwere &quot;self-regarding&quot; with only the individual himself at risk, wasobjectionable in principle;  it was right for the State to warnindividuals about the danger of actions which might harm themselves(of which smoking was another example), but it was not appropriate to make them into crimin/al offences.Against this it was pointed out that many countries now hadlegislation to make the wearing of seat belts compulsory and matthe Second Reading of the Road Traffic (Seat Belts) Bill had in factreceived a large majority on a free vote in 1976.    The earlieropposition to a corresponding measure proposed for Northern ireland had largely disappeared:  an independent Committee, including representatives of the trade unions, had considered the argumentsand had reported overwhelmingly in favour of compulsion for whichthere was a strong case on grounds of compassion and humanity.Last year road accidents caused three times as many deaths inNorthern Ireland as acts of terrorism, with an economic cost of 22 million a year.    Such Parliamentary opposition as remained to a Northern Ireland measure was largely on constitutional groundsunrelated to the issue of seat belts as such.    The criminal lawalready contained many provisions whose purpose was to requirepeople to protect themselves from injury, and the large number ofvictims of road accidents who had received crippling injuriesthrough not wearing seat belts would unanimously support legislation to make the practice compulsory.    Those who remained opposedmight arouse some temporary feeling during the passage of the Bill,but it could be expected to disappear once the Act was in force.19
THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that legislation should be introduced to make thewearing of seat belts compulsory, without a &quot;contracting out&quot;clause.    The more difficult question was whether it should beintroduced in the present Parliament or left until the beginningof the next.    The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was that legislation should be introduced in the House of Commons earlyin 1979, with a free vote on Second Reading;  if the vote were carried by a large majority, the Government would then give further consideration to a timetable motion to prevent filibusteringby a minority of Members and to secure its passage before the endof the Session.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Transport to proceed with thepreparation of a Bill accordingly.Cabinet Office26 October 197820
