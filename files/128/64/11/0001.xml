^REign I THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^AIRSranIthe situation in Iran was at present very unstable.    It was difficult to foresee how events would develop, but he was inclined to believe thatthe armed forces would remain loyal to the Shah and would restorelaw and order and that the country, which had been through similarcrises in the past, would return to stability.    The opposition to the shah came from a strange coalition of highly reactionary right-wingMuslim forces, groups of intellectuals and elements of the extremeleft.    The mullahs were predominant in this coalition, and indeed itwas their rise that had brought matters to a head.    They had alwaysbeen bitterly opposed to the Shah&apos;s policies of modernising andliberalising Iran, which we and the United States Government hadencouraged him to pursue.    The Shah had tried to placate them byappointing a conservative Prime Minister but this had had no effect.If the opposition was successful in bringing down the Shah, it was likely that Iran would be plunged into chaos, since it was veryimprobable that a coalition of such disparate elements would holdtogether for long.    If this happened, the stability of the whole regionwould be seriously threatened.    The recent coup in Afghanistan had moved that country closer to the Soviet Union;  the pakistan government was feeling increasingly isolated and was wonderingwhether it should reach some kind of accommodation with the Russians;and Turkey was showing signs of instability.    It was therefore in ourglobal interests that the Shah should survive.    Moreover, ourconsiderable economic links with Iran pointed in the same direction.For these reasons we should support the Shah in the present crisisand encourage him to continue with his policies of modernisation andliberalisation.    The United States Government appeared to be moving towards the same view.In discussion it was pointed out that the process of democratising atyranny was always a difficult one.    In the case of Iran, where the shah had been moving as fast as he reasonably could, the problemhad been made much worse because of the new phenomenon of there-emergence of Islam as a force in the political and social fieldsas well as the religious.    In deciding what our attitude to thesituation in Iran should be it was important to take account not only of our politico-strategic and economic interests but also the human rights factor.    We should use our influence, here as elsewhere, not so much to propose what political and constitutional changes shouldbe made but to ensure that policies were adopted which would resultin ordinary people being treated as humanely as possible. there seemed little doubt that human rights in Iran were more likely to be improved if the Shah was able to pursue his present policies than ifhe was replaced by the Islamic opposition.In further discussion it was suggested that human rights were becomingan increasingly important factor in deciding what our policies shouldbe towards other countries.    This was an aspect that was already beingtaken into consideration, for example, in relation to our aid programmes and our attitude to loans by the International Monetary Fund.SECRET
Moreover, it was a matter to which the Labour Party attached greatimportance.    What weight to give human rights issues in our foreign relations was, however, a very complicated issue, and there couldbe no question of developing a general policy on human rights whichcould be applied uniformly in all situations.    The ministerial committee on Relations with the Developing    Countries had had some interesting discussions of the practical aspects of human rightsand there might be advantage in the Cabinet having a discussion of thegeneral question at an appropriate time.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said we shouldincreasingly have to take into account the rise of Islam as a politicalforce in a large part of the world.    It was not yet clear whether itsimpact would be for good or ill.    More immediately, we needed todecide our attitude to the situation in Iran.    The Cabinet agreed thatwe should continue to support the Shah and to use our influence withhim to encourage him to press forward with his policies of liberalis-ing and modernising Iran.    The main elements opposing him soughta more reactionary society in which human rights would not be likelyto be improved, and we should have much less influence with them than we had with the Shah, if they succeeded in overthrowing him.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary toproceed accordingly.e East       THE PRIME MINISTER said that when he had seen King Hussein of jordan the previous day, the King had been particularly concerned that if, as he expected, the Camp David talks broke down, the repercussions could be very serious for the economies of the West.He had revealed, in strict confidence, that against this contingencyhe was seeking, through Saudi Arabia, to arrange an Arab summit meeting.    In this way he was hoping to exert a restraining influence and to prevent individual Arab States acting on their own.    The Kingalso felt that the United States Administration was making a mistakein not keeping the Soviet Government more closely informed about its efforts to solve the Arab-Israel dispute.    The Soviet Union couldnot be shut out of the Middle Eastern problem and their acquiescence,at the least, would be needed in any solutions.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.2
2. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that onreflection he had concluded that more time was needed for adecision about a further inquiry.    The Cabinet would not therefore be discussing that aspect at their present meeting and he had agreed with the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary that the Bingham Report should be published without anyaccompanying Government statement on 19 September. TheCommonwealth Secretary-General had expressed to him the viewthat African countries were less concerned about a further inquiry into the past than with making sure that sanctions were not still being evaded.    His own view was however that an inquiry into the handling of the sanctions policy by successive Governments was probably inevitable.    The difficult question was the form whichthis inquiry should take.    He would circulate a paper about this for discussion   by the Cabinet on 21 September.    He was alsoarranging for the Leader of the Opposition to be shown a copy ofthe Report in advance of publication, since an inquiry would haveto cover the period of the 1970-74 Conservative Government andhe might need to consult her at short notice about this.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theDirector of Public Prosecutions had now reached the opinion that publication of the Bingham Report would not of itself prejudiceprosecutions for breaches of the Sanctions Order providedAnnex III &quot;Evidence of Criminal Offences&quot; was omitted. Printingwas proceeding accordingly and the published version would make itclear that this Annex had been deleted.    In the meantime the Sunday times had alleged that the British oil companies were stilldeliberately helping to supply oil to Rhodesia despite the assurances given to the contrary.    Discussions were taking place with thecompanies, and he would report to the Cabinet next week. Oilsanctions on Rhodesia, short of a maritime blockade, couldhowever only be made effective if all countries were prepared toco-operate in determining South africa s essential needs and ensuring that no more oil than was necessary to meet these reachedSouth Africa.The Cabinet -Took note.^ODESIA*he Bingham^quiry^reVi0U8Reference-?*(78) 30thfusions,Minute Z3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that president Giscard of France had written to the Prime Minister andother European Economic Community (e.c.) Heads of Governmentsuggesting the appointment of Three Wise Men to study the institutional and other problems of enlargement of the Communitiesto Twelve.    The French President was under pressure fromM Chirac and from the Communists to block the accession of spain and this initiative might be a device to permit the reopening of thewhole enlargement question.    There had always been a danger thatthe French would try to limit the enlargement of the Community to greece whereas we wished to see both Spain and Portugal as well asGreece included.    The French were likely to come under considerable criticism for this initiative and we need not be in any hurry to respondpositively.In discussion the question was raised whether we should seek to useSpain&apos;s wish to join the Community as a way of resolving the frontierproblems with Gibraltar.    In reply it was pointed out that, so far, wehad deliberately sought to keep the two issues separate, but it was generally understood that the issue would have to be resolved beforeSpanish entry.    Negotiations had taken place in which the political leaders of Gibraltar had been included, but progress had been extremelyslow.    The restrictions on communications were among the issuesbeing discussed.The Cabinet -Took note.In discussion several questions were raised about the conduct and timing of the forthcoming direct elections to the European Assembly.In particular, it was suggested that the amount of money which wouldbe made available to political parties for their own use had beenreduced and that the Commission intended to spend considerable sums of money themselves in promoting the elections.    This was contraryto the tradition in this country and might even give rise to legalobjections which were currently being examined.    It would be betterif the available money were distributed to the political parties.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that boththe European Parliament and the Commission had financialallocations to promote the first direct elections and that part of themoney voted by the Assembly was being made available for use by political parties.    The European socialist group had decided to distribute their share to individual parties and he had understood thatthe Labour Party was content with its allocation.    The commission were aware of the sensitivities on this issue and planned to use theirfunds in an educational and non-political way.    On the question of the timing of elections, there was no restriction on holding nationalelections at the same time as the elections to the Enropean Assembly.
THE PRIME MINISTER said he would take into account the dates ofthe European elections when deciding on the date for a GeneralElection, but he had no intention of reopening these dates in theEuropean Council.    The Selection of candidates and questions aboutthe possible conflict between candidature for Westminster and theEuropean Assembly were matters for the Party and not for theGovernment.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary wouldnote the views expressed about expenditure, particularly by theCommission.    The desirable course was for as much as possibleto be made available to the political parties.    He should thereforemake further enquiries about the plans of the Commission and theEuropean Assembly and report back to the Cabinet in due course.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.5
^forward 4. THE PRIME MINISTER said that, in his minute of11 September 1978, he had invited his colleagues to come to the present meeting of the Cabinet prepared to identify the priorities which should inform Government policy in the period ahead and the ways in whichthese priorities might best be achieved.    Now that he had announcedthat there would be another session of the present Parliament startingin the autumn the Government faced an active and vigorous year.Preparation of The queen s Speech for the opening of Parliament was already in hand but more than this was needed.    The Government hadto have a coherent approach to the future and to adopt attitudes andpursue themes which would stand not just for the next 12 months butfor the next 5 years.    It would be fatal for the Government to approach the new session of Parliament as if it were simply waiting for theelection or to behave as if their actions were conditioned solely bythat election.    There could be no question of massive public expenditure increases or pursuing soft policies which would allowinflation to get out of hand.    The Government had to face its problems and not duck them:  and should not depart from the course on which ithad already embaiked.    This was particularly necessary with incomes policy.    Some in the trade union movement were arguing that thedecision not to have an election this autumn imposed an additional strain on the trade unions.    This was not so.    The need for the policy wouldhave been the same if the Government had won an autumn election.There were difficulties ahead, most immediately on the Ford and theLocal Authority Manual Workers settlements, and the Governmentwould have to approach these in as rational a way as it could.    He knew what burdens the detailed implementation of incomes policy placed onhis colleagues, not least on those who served on the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Pay (EY(P))and he would wish to place on record hisformal thanks to that Sub-Committee for the work they had done and stillhad to undertake.In discussion the following main points were made:-a.       In terms of public perception there was no doubt that unemployment was the dominating issue.    Moreover it wasnot simply the absolute levels of unemployment, bad though they were, which dominated popular thinking but the fear ofspreading unemployment as technological change acceleratedand overseas competition increased.    It was this fear whichunderlay much of the current trade union preoccupation with various forms of work-sharing like the ahort*r working week and early retirement, and which could explain industrial attitudes to increased productivity.    However misguided the work-sharingapproach might be in economic terms it was a natural reaction of those who felt that their jobs were threatened.    It was essential that the Government should succeed in impressingupon the population that conquering unemployment was still anattainable goal and that its policies were directed to this end.
b. However the fact that unemployment had overtakeninflation as the main public worry reflected the fact thatinflation was, for the time being, under control.    If prices were once more to rise at an accelerating rate inflationwould rapidly become the priority target again.    It was forthis reason among others that the successful implementation of the Government&apos;s pay policy was essential. difficult negotiations lay ahead and there would be continuing pressure for the restoration of differentials.    But the success of theGovernments general economic policies was criticallydependent upon maintaining the 5 per cent pay policy. Successwould also depend upon maintaining a tight control of public expenditure.    There was little room for manoeuvre and majorincreases in expenditure could not be afforded.    This did not however mean that the contribution to national life made by thepublic services must stagnate.    There was a good deal of scope for obtaining better value for the money spent on the public services and other improvements in the quality of life could beachieved with little extra expenditure.    The harnessing of voluntary effort could also make a substantial contribution.There were institutional difficulties to this    course but theycould and should be overcome.c. In the public services public attention focussed most strongly on education, the Health Service and housing. Therewas no doubt that extra money could help improve these services.    But public dissatisfaction with them was not confined to matters which money could put right.    In the case ofeducation public concern concentrated most on what was seen as falling standards despite evidence that standards were in factrising.    The difficulty was that standards varied widely and thata great deal depended on the quality of the individual school andof its staff.    A number of the teachers recruited a decade agowere of relatively poor quality.    Teachers trained more recently were often of high quality but parents tended to judge the system as a whole by their own particular experience andthat of their children.    In the case of housing and the health service, as indeed in local government services generally, agood deal of public dissatisfaction could be traced to the growth of apparently unfeeling and incompetent bureaucracies. TheNational Health Service sometimes gave the impression ofbeing designed for the people who administered it rather than for the sick.    And the defects of municipal housing were well-known.    It was vitally important in those areas where public services impinged directly on the public that they should appearresponsive to, and careful of, the needs of those they existedto serve.    Similar criticisms could be levelled at those of the nationalised industries, gas and electricity being the mainexamples, where there was widespread contact at personal levelbetween the population at large and the industries concerned.
d. Quite apart from the defects of the social bureaucraciesthere was scope for the Government, too, to show a moreimaginative and caring attitude to the more disadvantagedcitizens.    The Winter Fuel scheme and recent travelconcessions by British Rail were good examples. Considerationought to be given to further acts of this kind including perhaps arebate on television licences for the elderly.    The Governmentcould also help in Parliament by, for example, making time available to worthy Private Members Bills 6uch as that on thePublic Lending Right which had been unable to make progressunder the normal rules.e. Public concern about law and order was real thoughsometimes exaggerated.    The fact was that in all respectsexcept possibly vandalism our record was at least as good,and often better, than other Western societies.    Much had beendone already, e. g. the implementation of the Edmund-Da viesReport on police pay and the introduction of Community ServiceOrders as a fitting punishment for hooliganism.    But more could be done within existing resources.    For example,relatively few policemen appeared to be on the beat whereasexperience showed the visible presence of the police was oftenenough to cut crime rates significantly.    As with other areasof public expenditure, greater attention to obtaining maximumvalue from the resources available could pay significantdividends.f. The inner cities brought many social problems togetherwith the added strain, in some cases, posed by immigrantpopulations.    It ought to be recognised, however, that theproblems of absorbing immigrants were not new and historyshowed that the second generation could settle into, and beaccepted by, society with minimum strain.    The Governmentsrecord on immigration, and the treatment of immigrants, was good.g. Greater attention should be paid to the furtherance of democracy in all its aspects.    There were many of these.Freer access to information, reforms of the Official Secrets Act,the problems of patronage and Quangos, industrial democracy,public enquiries and so on were all part of the process of associating people with the communities in which they lived andworked.    Part at least of the problems of modern society arosebecause the old bases of authority were breaking down and hadnot yet been replaced by self-discipline or an acceptance of newauthority.    The machinery of the modern state, whether in theNational Health Service or in central or local government, wasoften too distant and too remote from the people with whom itdealt.    And within industry, too, sheer size and a lack of unity of purpose was at the root of many problems *uch as those
currently being experienced by British Leyland.    Any steps which engaged people more closely in the issues and authoritiesaffecting their lives could yield considerable dividends. Theordinary citizen must be made to feel that he mattered.h.      Public attention, particularly in the media, tended to concentrate on failure and to give a depressing picture of a country in decline.     There were however many industrialsuccess stories to be told and efforts should be made to get them across.    Similarly our strike record was grosslyexaggerated and widely reported abroad with harmful effects oninward investments    We should take whatever steps we could to bring the truth and the success stories to public attention athome and abroad.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet fully recognised the importance of solving our economic problems.     This was fundamental to everything else.    But it was alsoclear that, beyond this, the Cabinet accepted the desirability of placinga greater emphasis on the rights and duties of citizens.    Concern hadbeen expressed about the need to provide a human face to the institutions and authorities with which the ordinary citizen had to deal.There was alsc a clear desire to seek to engage the citizen more closely as an individual in the processes which affected his daily life.Much could be done to these ends without necessarily spending more money.    The discussion had been a valuable one and should continue.To this end he would establish a small group of Ministers, under thechairmanship of the Lord President of the Council, to consider andreport back to the Cabinet on the themes which might informGovernment action and publicity.    The group would take as theirstarting point the points which had been made in the Cabinet&apos;discussion:  but it would assist them if all Cabinet Ministers were tosend in, as a matter of urgency, a:one-page note on how they saw the aims and objectives of their Departments.    These notes need not be confined to action which was practicable in the next Session since thepublic recognised that the Government could only fulfil its aims overtime and as resources became available.    The Lord Presidentsgroup would also consider the possibility of better interchange between ministers of information on the Government1 s actions and achievementsto provide the basis for a co-ordinated public attitude.    It should meetbefore the Party Conference and should report back to the Cabinetimmediately after the Conference so that the present discussion could then be resumed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office14 September 1978 9
