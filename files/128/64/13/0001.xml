^vising^NmG OF1. THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had consulted the Speaker about a proposal that the Opening of parliament for the coming Session should be televised.    The British broadcasting corporation had asked for this and The Queen would agree, if soadvised.    The Speaker saw no objection provided that the other parties were consulted.    The question was whether the Cabinet saw advantageor not in the proceedings being televised.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet&apos;s view was that there would be advantage in televising theOpening of Parliament.    They took account of the fact that there was now regular sound broadcasting of Parliamentary proceedings and thatthe Opening was an occasion which reflected the full dignity ofParliament.    The Lord President of the Council should thereforearrange for the Chairman of the Liaison Committee of the Parliamen-tary Labour Party and for the other Parties to be consulted on the basisof the Cabinet&apos;s view.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.
NewsRogationJ^g of?evi0U8f?8) 31st^sions.^te 42. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP(78) 92) to which were attached drafts ofThe Queen&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and Opening of Parliament.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the ProrogationSpeech did not normally attract much political or public attention andthe draft was reasonably straightforward.    Some improvements had however been suggested in correspondence since it had been discussed in The Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QF), andothers might be agreed in discussion.In discussion it was agreed that the references to inflation, social security benefits, the Common Agricultural Policy, and law enforce-ment and the police should be made more positive and more precise;and that references should be added to the winter fuel scheme, theCo-operi*tive Development Agency Act, improved community servicesand the expansion of medical and nursing staff, and the study of ways ofincreasing the numbers of young people who receive vocationalpreparation in employment.    The reference to legislation on matri-monial and other family law should be abbreviated.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet approved the draft of the Prorogation Speech, subjectto amendments on the lines agreed.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of this part of their discussion.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that in preparing theOpening Speech QF had sought to avoid provocation for the minorityParties to vote against the Motion on the Address, and for this reasonthey had omitted some material which would be attractive to theGovernments own supporters and on which the Governments positionwould need to Le reaffirmed.    Material of this kind might usefully beincluded in the Prime Minister&apos;s speech or in other speeches made inthe Debate,    There were certain matters for which the policy had notyet been approved or financial provision agreed, but there would be timefor the Cabinet to consider these again before the Speech had to be finally agreed.In discussion it was agreed that the form and length of the Speech were satisfactory;  although longer than the previous year&apos;s Speech it wasabout the same length as the Speech for 1976.    It was noted that theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary had proposed a number of adjust-ments to the opening paragraphs.    These were agreed.    It was also
agreed that the references to legislation to bring about an independentZimbabwe, and to other institutions with which the United kingdom would collaborate in promoting international co-operation should be omitted;  and that the reference to legislation on the Crown Agentsshould be trensferred to a paragraph later in the Speech.    An adjust-ment was agreed to the paragraph on economic policies to give equalemphasis to inflation and unemployment as the two most serious evilsafflicting the nation.    It was recognised that the absence of a referenceto the Governments White Paper &quot;Winning the Battle against Inflation&quot;might attract comment, but to include it would provoke unnecessary and damaging argument within the Labour Party and it would be betteromitted.    It would be important for additional financial provision forthe National Enterprise Board to be accompanied by additional provisionfor the Scottish and Welsh Development Agencies, and the references tothose Agencies should stand.The passage on compensation for short-time working raised twoproblems:  the type of scheme which should be introduced, and whetherit required legislation.    The existing provision for compensation wasvery limited and few firms took advantage of it;  discussions of a possiblenew scheme, and on a further scheme for compensating employers at times of high unemployment, had taken place with the Trades UnionCongress and the Confederation of British Industry, and there was general agreement that legislation was required.    The annual cost would however be considerable -  230 million rising to  460 million -and the financial provision had still to be confirmed by the Cabinet.At this stage the reference in the Speech would have to remainprovisional, and it should in any event be shortened and clarified. the paragraph on social justice, respect for the law and racial toleranceshould be divided so that the material on social justice and racialtolerance would be separated from the material on strengthening thepolice service and on crime and vandalism.    The paragraphintroducing measures to strengthen democracy should be recast in amore direct form;  the paragraph on industrial democracy should refer to further consultations on the proposals in the White Paper, but shouldnot promise the introduction  of legislation &quot;at the earliest opportunity&quot;.In further discussion it was argued that a commitment to legislation toreplace Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act 1911 and to fresh action onopen government should be welcomed.    The continuing difficulty of operating Section 2 as it stood would be removed and action on the linesof the &quot;Justice&quot; proposals for a code of practice monitored by theParliamentary Commissioner for Administration should be seen asuseful progress towards greater openness, without involving thedifficulties inherent in freedom of information legislation on UnitedStates or Swedish lines.     Against this it was argued that a Bill onSection 2 alone would provoke opposition from the Liberals and from some of the Governments own supporters;  it would be at risk of defeat
on Second Reading and would be open to prolonged debate and extensiveamendment in Committee.    Action to implement the &quot;Justice&quot;proposals would also be resisted by an important section of the LabourParty, on the ground that the scheme bypassed Parliament.    A saferapproach might be to promise that the Government would further con-sider their proposals to reform Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act1911 in the light of comments stimulated by the publication of their white paper, and would continue their study of ways of expanding opengovernment;  but this would add little to what had been said on previous occasions and would provoke an equally strong reaction from theGovernments critics.    An alternative would be to omit this passagealtogether.In continued discussion it was pointed out that the reference to studentawards should still be provisional pending the Cabinet1 s discussion of thepublic expenditure involved.    Some provisions of the Housing Bill would need to apply to Scotland, and the draft should be adjusted, if possible,to take account of this fact and should also indicate more clearly whowould benefit from the proposed assistance to home buyers. the reference to the Bill dealing with offshore oil and gas installationsshould be strengthened and the Speech should include a positive commit-ment for the Government to introduce a Bill on public lending right assoon as possible.    The reference to measures necessary to conservefish stocks should also be strengthened.    Legislation on free school milkwas still subject to agreement on the necessary financial provision anddifferent views could be held on the importance of the legislation itself.There was general agreement that free school milk in junior schoolswas a socially desirable measure, but it could be argued that other measures should take higher priority in terms of public expenditure andthat it was not of sufficient importance to justify removing the discretion of local authorities.    In political terms it was significant that mostlocal authorities which did not take advantage of the discretionaryarrangements for free school milk were Conservative-controlled. Thepolicy therefore needed further discussion;   but it was agreed that legislation on this subject was not of sufficient importance to justify a reference in the Speech.    It was noted that those provisions of theproposed Socia1 Security Bill which would extend benefits were stillsubject to decisions on the expenditure required and, although a Bill to correct and clarify certain aspects of the latter would be needed in any event, it would only justify a reference in The queen s Speech if anextension of benefits could be included.    The reference to commercialarbitration should be moved to the following paragraph.In discussion of omissions from the Speech, it was argued that theBritish Broadcasting Corporation and the Independent broadcasting authority would expect to see a reference to broadcasting and that itsomission would be seen as an indication that the Government were nowready to retreat from their proposals.    The Bill would be complicated
and could not be prepared in time for introduction in the coming session, but it was agreed that the draft should include a reference tothe fact that the proposals set out in the White Paper would be pursuedwith a view to legislation in due course.    It was also pointed out thatthe Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries was about to produceits report on the reorganisation of the electricity supply industry andthat the report would include a statement that the industry would have further legitimate cause for complaint if the Executive failed to bring forward legislation in the next Session.    The difficulties which had sofar prevented the Government from proceeding with the Bill would remain in the coming Session, but both sides of the industry attached great importance to the Governments continuing commitment.    It wasagreed therefore that a re affirmation of the commitment to are organisation of the industry and to legislation as soon as possible should be included.    Other matters which might be considered for inclusion were the dock labour scheme, the restructuring of the fishing industry and compensation for slate quarrymen, but these were thought to be more appropriate for speeches by the Prime Minister or other ministers in the course of the debate.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the draftwould be revised in the light of the discussion and that the cabinet would have a final opportunity to consider it after the Party Conference.In the meantime the Ministerial Group on Disclosure of official information (GEN 29) should meet, under the chairmanship of the lord president of the Council, to consider what should be said in the Speechabout reform of Section 2 of the Official Secrets Act and open government.The Cabinet would consider the public expenditure implications of theprovisions on compensation for short-time working, student awards,legal aid and social security benefits at a future meeting. Finalamendments would take account of their conclusions.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 3Thursday 28 September 1978 at 10. 30 amLAThe Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Prime Minister(CP(78) 93) reporting the outcome of the talks which he had held with president Kaunda of Zambia on 22-23 September at Kano in Nigeria.32nd THE PRIME MINISTER said that the issues covered in his talks with0a*i President Kaunda were very sensitive ones and i&apos; was essential thathis report to the Cabinet should be kept 3ecret.    He and the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, who had accompanied him to the talks,had found the President very concerned about the future of Zambia and about the major decisions affecting his country which he would shortlyhave to take.    In the military field he was worried about the greatlyincreased strength of Mr Nkomo&apos;s guerrilla forces.    They now had the ability to launch very big attacks on Rhodesia, and he understood thatthey planned to undertake a major offensive in a few weeks1 time.This would be likely to prompt immediate retaliation by the rhodesian government.    One of the principal guerrilla camps was close toLusaka, and it was possible that a Rhodesian attack on the camp would turn into an attack on the Zambian capital itelf.    At the same timePresident Kaunda was faced with pressing economic problems. Inparticular the shortage of foreign exchange was such that there was avery real danger that it would be impossible to buy overseas the seedand fertilisers needed for the maize planting in October and November.In the political sphere the President felt that urgent new steps, based onthe Anglo-American Proposals (AAP), were essential.    He believedthat the only way of preventing Mr Nkomo from going ahead with the planned military offensive would be to engage him meaningfully in talks in the next few weeks on a transfer of power in Rhodesia.    It was against this seriously deteriorating background that the President had turned to us as a fellow Commonwealth country with which Zambia had very close links, and in the Kano talks he had asked us bluntly what wecould do to help him.    Although he had not said so explicitly, there wasa clear implication that if we were unable to answer his appeal for help,he would have to turn to the Soviet Union and Cuba.    He was most
reluctant to take this step, even though there was some pressure on him from inside the Zambian Government to seek the assistance of Cuba.He had recently had a message from President Brezhnev whichprobably offered him help.    Faced with this request for assistancefrom another member of the Commonwealth which shared many of theattitudes of the present British Government and which had suffered agreat deal because of the Rhodesian situation, the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and he had felt it right to be ready to offer asmuch help as possible.    He had offered to send out to Zambiaimmediately a military adviser, Major General Fursdon, to assess whatwas required to bring Zambian defences, and in particular the air defence of Lusaka, up to standard.    He had also agreed that both governments should consider, without commitment, whether it would bedesirable for the United Kingdom to provide a small number of RoyalAir Force Phantom aircraft fcr the limited role of the air defence ofLusaka.    Any question of British troops being sent to Zambia would beas sensitive a matter for President Kaunda as for us.    He and thePresident had agreed that as a corollary to any military assistance which we gave the Zambian Government, it would be essential for mr Nkomo&apos;s forces to cease attacks on soft targets in Rhodesia.President Kaunda had described this as a moral issue for himself andhad accepted that both he and the British Government should pressMr Nkomo to give the necessary undertaking.    The Secretary of Statefor Defence would pursue the question of military assistance when general Fursdon had reported on his return from Zambia. a preliminary report from General Fursdon indicated that the Rapier air defence system around Lusaka was in very poor condition and needed a major overhaul.    As regards aid, the Minister of State for overseas development had begun discussions some time ago with a view tooffering Zambia  20 million of additional aid but, against the background of the Bingham Report, he had not felt it appropriate to offer this money at the Kano talks.    As an alternative and in order to deal with Zambia&apos;s immediate problem of a lack of foreign exchange he had undertaken thatthe British Government would finance the immediate purchase of 20 million of Zambian copper stocks at current prices for delivery at a future date to be arranged.    President Kaunda had been very grateful for this proposal, and the Minister of State for Overseas Developmentwas now making the necessary arrangements.    In response to the presidents concern about the political situation the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and he had agreed that it was necessary to convene during October an all-party conference for the purpose of implementing the AAP.    They had judged that the risk of the talksfailing, for example because of the refusal of some parties to attendthem, was outweighed by the danger of an intensification of the war ina few weeks1 time.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary was nowdiscussing with the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, how anall-party conference should be arranged.    Very little time had been spent on the Bingham Report and the President had made clear, as had
separately General Obasanjo of Nigeria, that this was not a major issuefor him and that he was much more concerned with the problems of thefuture rather than with those of the past.    President Kaunda had taken ahelpful line in reply to Press questions on this subject.    Our responsesto President Kaunda1 s concerns had been very well received by him.If they had not been made, relations with Zambia would havedeteriorated badly.    But this had required him and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary to make decisions on the spot, and he was now seeking the approval of the Cabinet for the line they had taken.In discussion there was full support for the offers of help which thePrime Minister and the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had madein their talks with President Kaunda.    It was right that we should take all possible steps to prevent a very serious situation becoming evenworse.    It was vital that the President who was one of the last bastionsof moderation in Southern Africa should survive.    But in giving Zambiamilitary assistance, and particularly if we stationed Phantom aircraftthere, we should need to take great care not to be drawn into a possibleconflict between President Kaunda and Mr Nkomo over how theguerrilla war should be conducted and even more not to allow ourselves,in the longer term, to become involved militarily in Rhodesia, unless itwere as part of a United Nations operation.    We had already had areport that Zambian officials, who were probably not aware precisely what had been agreed by the Prime Minister and President Kaunda on military assistance, appeared to be interpreting the agreements reached in Kano as involving firmer commitments by Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment than the texts justified and were expecting more ofGeneral Fursdon&apos;s visit than his instructions permitted.    It might benecessary to broaden his terms of reference somewhat, though hie taskshould remain, as agreed in Kano, to make an assessment, without commitment, of Zambian requirements for training and equipment and how we might meet them.    It was already clear that urgent action was needed if the Zambian Rapier system was to be brought back intooperation quickly, and this required a very early approach by theMinistry of Defence to British Aerospace who would have to undertake the necessary repair work, even though this increased the risk of aleak.In further discussion it was reported that the arrangements for thepurchase of the Zambian copper were going ahead smoothly. Althoughunorthodox, it was a legitimate way of providing aid and was appropriate to the aid programme.    The Department of Industry had agreed to manage the stockpile.    It had been necessary to consult theLondon Metal Exchange about the proposed transaction, and this had shown that it would be important to announce it quickly once it had beenfinished.    A report had, however, just been received that Zambianofficials were taking the line that any profit from a resale of the coppershould go to the Zambian Government, and this was something that we
should need to consider further.     The  20 million from the sale of thecopper would enable the Zambians to purchase their immediate requirements for seeds and fertilisers.    If there were difficulties overtransporting them, the Americans might be asked if they could help withan airlift.    More generally, we were giving Zambia assistance in anumber of fields, including agriculture and their internal rail system,and we were hoping to help them restore the Benguela railway whichwould make the transport of copper much easier.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that he was grateful for the Cabinet&apos;s endorsement of the responses which he and theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary had made to President Kaunda&apos;s appeal for support at their talks in Kano.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary should pursue the question of holding an all-party conference on Rhodesia within the next few weeks and should submit his detailed proposals to the Ministerial Group on southern africa (GEN 12).    The Secretary of State for Defence should similarlybring forward his recommendations on military assistance for Zambiawhen he had received General Fursdon&apos;s report.    In the meantime heshould consult the Prime Minister about the proposed expansion ofGeneral Fursdon&apos;s terms of reference and he should approach BritishAerospace about the repair of the Zambian Rapier system. TheMinister of State for Overseas Development, in consultation with theChief Secretary, Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster, should conclude the arrangements for the purchase of 20 million of copper from Zambia.    If necessary, she should explore the possibility of seeking the help of the United States Government withthe transport of seed and fertilisers to Zambia.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary, the Secretaryof State for Defence and the Minister of State for overseas Development to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office28 September 1978
DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTsCOPY NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 33rd Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 28 September 1978 at 10. 30 amSIAN The Cabinet resumed discussion of the questions raised by the BinghamReport on Rhodesian sanctions.    They had before them two memoranda by the Prime Minister (CP(78) 91 and 94) together with minutes from theSecretary of State for Energy and the Lord President of the Council tothe Prime Minister of 22 and 26 September respectively.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been considering the various*: points raised in the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion.    He did not believe. nc* that any significant new facts would emerge from a further inquiry. It^0ns* would be primarily about how the established facts had been handled bythe Governments of the day.    It would involve judgments on individualreputations and on the performance of those Governments andparticularly of the Labour Government of 1964-70.    That Governmentwas already being tried and condemned unheard by the Press and othercritics.    But the fact that any inquiry would be into reputation ratherthan criminal liability meant that it was all the more important to bescrupulously fair to those who had done their best to make the sanctionspolicy work and had failed.    There would be problems over any form of inquiry.    A Select Committee, for example, would inevitably have to hear evidence from the oil companies and from people like Mr Rowlandof Lonrho.    Unsubstantiated allegations would be made which couldonly be dealt with by cross-examination.    There would be a demand forwitnesses to be represented by counsel.    The procedure would then bevery close to that of a judicial tribunal under the 1921 Act to whichobjection had already been seen.    A legal procedure involving a judgewas inappropriate for the making of political judgments about those concerned.    He had not yet been able to discuss the matter withMrs Thatcher.    He had however spoken on the telephone toSir Harold Wilson in the United States.    The latter&apos;s initial reactionwas to favour an inquiry but he thought the right course would be to havea debate first and decide in the light of that.    If there were to be an inquiry it should be conducted by three Privy Counsellors under thechairmanship of a former Lord Chancellor.    The Prime Minister had also had an unexpected opportunity to discuss the matter with Mr Heath
who was against any inquiry and thought a judicial inquiry would be particularly wrong since matters of political judgment were involved.He also felt strongly that it would be wrong in principle to produceCabinet papers if an inquiry was held.    If however the labour government produced its Cabinet papers to an inquiry he wOTild do like-wise but would make it clear that he thought this was wrong in principle.He thought the right course was a major debate in the House, though he accepted that following this an inquiry might have to be conceded.Mr Steel, to whom he had also spoken, would favour a judicial inquiry and was opposed to a Select Committee:  but he also saw the advantageof a debate before a final decision was taken.    In the light of these various reactions, he had considered how best to proceed.    It was essential to avoid any impression of an attempt to cover up what had happened.    On the other hand it would be wrong to do unnecessarydamage to the reputation of the previous Labour Government. Theright course might therefore be to take things in stages.    The first step would be for the Government to set out its reaction to the Bingham Report,together with any further facts which would help the House in consideringthe matter including the advantages and disadvantages of the various forms of further inquiry.    This could perhaps be done in a White Paper.The Government would then arrange for a substantial debate of two orthree days when there would not be a substantive Motion before theHouse.    He himself would wish to open such a debate with a majorspeech.    Sir Harold Wilson and Mr Heath would probably also speak.There might be a parallel debate in the House of Lords as well. Thiswould allow former Ministers in either House to put their positions on record.    The Government could then decide its attitude to an inquiry in the light of the debates and could perhaps give a lead to theHouse of Commons at the end of its debate.    No impression would begiven that the debate was intended to close the matter, but the outcomemight well be agreement that this was a political issue which was not worth further independent investigation.In discussion there was general support for the proposal that thereshould be a full debate in the House of Commons.    This would give theGovernment a chance to defend the policies of its predecessor in1964-70.    A further inquiry without the opportunity for such a debate would leave the critics free to make their case without any chance of aGovernment reply.    A debate could also be presented to the House as amatter of natural justice, which would give the former Prime ministers concerned a chance to state their position clearly.    There was,however, no doubt that they would be in some sense on trial before theHouse, and that the debate could be a very emotional one.    But formerMinisters would not be the only target of criticism.    Many Members ofthe House would wish to consider the culpability of the oil companies.In their case criminal prosecutions were already under consideration,although a final decision would not have been taken by the time of the debate.    It would therefore be necessary for the Speaker to warn
Members to avoid anything which might prejudice the chances of a fairtrial.    Some Members might however be reluctant to accept such a limitation, and the Speaker&apos;s rulings might divert attention from themain issues of the debate.    The debate should cover the whole field,including the Tightness or wrongness of the sanctions policy. Therewould be a number of other points which Cabinet should consider beforethe debate.    These included the position of present Ministers who hadbeen members of the previous Labour Government, and the conduct ofthe oil companies after the period covered by the Bingham Report. Onthe question of a further inquiry, it was argued that the Governmentshould give a lead to the House and indicate its own preference. against this it was suggested that it would be better to leave the matter entirelyopen, and for the Government to say merely that it was ready to accept afurther inquiry if that were the House&apos;s wish.    The Government should certainly not oppose an inquiry at the start of the debate, since there wasa danger that it might be overwhelmed.    The atmosphere had howevercooled somewhat since publication of the Bingham Report, and it was difficult to anticipate the mood of the House.There was also general support for the proposition that the cabinet should consider a draft White Paper.    It was however recognised that itwould be a difficult White Paper to write and a final decision should thus be reserved until     the Cabinet had considered a draft text. Itwould help the conduct of the debate if this included a summary of themain points of the 650 pages of the Bingham Report.    Many members would not have read this in full.    It might also be possible for the white paper to correct the imbalance in the Bingham Report, whichconcentrated unduly on the period of the previous and present LabourAdministrations.    However, it would be difficult to do this without having access to the papers of the Conservative Government.    One wayround would be to set out clearly and briefly the main stages through which the sanctions policy had evolved.    These were matters of publicrecord.On the question of a further inquiry, the view was put forward that therewere still fresh facts to emerge.    There was some evidence thatBingham had n^t uncovered the whole story.    It was possible that some ministers had been misled and information withheld at relevant times,and that British Petroleum, apart from questions of criminal liability,had failed to observe their obligations to the Government laid down atthe time when the Government shareholding was first acquired.    It was however argued that any inquiry would necessarily take a long time, andwould extend beyond the next General Election.    Previous select committees had proved unsatisfactory instruments for investigating theconduct of past Ministers, and tended to divide along Party lines. a judicial inquiry, such as that carried out by Lord Justice Denning intothe Profumo scandal, had many defects which had been pointed out bythe Royal Commission under Lord Salmon.    There were attractions inthe idea of a group of Privy Counsellors, but for varying reasons thethree former Lord Chancellors still living did not seem appropriateChairmen.
It was also suggested that the Government would need to decide upon its next steps before the Party Conference the following week. Therewould be motions at the Conference critical of the Government andcalling for a further inquiry.    These criticisms might be met if theGovernment were prepared to announce now that there would be a fulldebate in Parliament when it resumed and that the Government would notresist an inquiry.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with his suggestion of a debate on the whole question ofthe Bingham Report, provided it was made clear that the Governmenthad not rejected the possibility of a further inquiry.    There was a clearneed to move forward in stages.    The decision to hold a major debatewas the first step.    Theru was no need now to accept or reject an inquiry either directly or by implication.    That decision and, ifnecessary a decision on the form an inquiry should take, would be madeby the Cabinet at a later stage.    The Cabinet would also need to decidelater whether to make a recommendation to the House of commons before, or in the light of, that debate.    The Cabinet should also consider in advance of a debate whether the Government should publish a White Paper which would set the tone.    The Se :retary of the cabinet should prepare the draft of such a White Paper.    It should cover afactual summary of the contents of the Bingham Report;  a discussionof the possible forms of an inquiry, including their legal implications;and the wider background to the sanctions policy.    The Cabinet would consider this draft after the Labour Party Conference, and reach afinal decision on its approach to the debate.    Meanwhile, in preparation for the Party Conference, the Government should make itclear that there was going to be a debate on the major issues raised bythe Bingham Report, which would give those concerned a chance to state their position;  and that it would be for the House of Commons toconsider what action, if any, should follow the debate itself.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister!summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office29 September 1978
