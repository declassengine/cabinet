^Ll^MENTARY      1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in^*&amp;S the House of Commons during the following week.-IGN 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidFrAlRSthat the Press contained reports of a letter which the PrimeMinister had received from President Brezhnev protesting againstthe proposed sale of arms to China.    This letter, which had only been received through the Soviet Embassy two days earlier,appeared to have been leaked by an East European source. Thequestion of what response we should make to Chinese requests forthe purchase of arms, in particular Harrier, was a difficult onewhich had been discussed on several occasions in the Defence and oversea Policy Committee.    Our aim was, as he had stated publicly,to ensure that decisions were taken in the context of a balancedrelationship with China, taking into account also the need for a balanced relationship with the Soviet Union.   But, as had beenmade clear, we could not allow the Russians to dictate our policy towards China.    Decisions would need to be taken over the nextfew months and pressure on the Government over Harrier wouldprobably increase.    It was important that we should give measuredconsideration to the issues involved, including the need to consultour allies, and not allow ourselves to be rushed.In discussion it was pointed out that Harrier was sensitive becauseof its unique capability and technology, although it had only a shortrange of 200 - 300   miles.     The French were proposing to sellhelicopters to the Chinese, once a decision in principle had beenreached in the Co-ordinating Committee on the InternationalEmbargo (COCOM) and Harrier might be regarded as an advancedform of helicopter.    Nevertheless, it must be seen in perspectiveagainst the pattern of our trade with China as a whole;  and equallywc must not allow the Chinese to blackmail us by saying they wouldnot buy anything else if they could not have Harrier.    It had been explained to Vice Premier Wang, during his recent visit to theUnited Kingdom, that we were not prepared to become only asupplier of arms to the Chinese, and that it would make it easier for us to consider the possibility of selling Harrier if this could beseen in the context of developing relations in the cultural andeconomic field as well as over arms sales.    It was clear that theChinese were indeed interested in other purchases, including largeitems of scientific equipment, such as a proton accelerator, and medical equipment.    We could not supply all they wanted but it wasin our interest to develop our commercial relations to the maximum extent possible, not only for balance of payments and employmentreasons, but also because of our need to diversify sources of essential raw materials, such as chrome, manganese andvanadium, for which we had at present to rely almost exclusivelyon South Africa,
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hehad made clear to Vice Premier Wang the importance we attachedto a balanced relationship and that while we were prepared toconsider the sale of defensive military equipment this must be only as part of our overall trade.    We should need to handle the questionof arms sales, especially Harrier, very cautiously, but if theChinese were willing to do  8 -10 billion worth of trade with usover the next few years, as had been suggested during VicePremier Wang&apos;s visit, this would provide a more positive back-ground against which to consider the question of Harrier. the secretaries of State for Industry and for Trade should be kept informed by other Ministers whose Departments might be makingimportant sales to China in the industrial and commercial fieldso that an overall picture could be obtained.    As regardsPresident Brezhnev1 s letter, he would be replying robustly.Indeed if the Russians really wanted to prevent us selling arms to china, they were going about it in a way which was more likely toproduce the opposite effect.The Cabinet -1, Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.*8ia THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the Foreign and^ Commonwealth Secretary had agreed that there was little immediate prospect of progress on the Anglo/American proposals and that,&apos;kh^Qe: without some further move on our part, the situation was likely to&apos;*) 39thget worse before there would be any sign of improvement. Thisj\8l0ns&apos; view was shared by the American Administration and there was some concern that, because of the lack of progress, they might come under pressure to abandon their joint efforts with us.    It was important to avoid this because we needed American support.There had also been some pressure in the House of Commons for himto intervene personally.    He would now be willing to call an all-Party conference under hie chairmanship if there was a realpossibility of it being successful.    It would how ver be important to establish first whether or not there was such a possibility.The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and he had agreed that thebest way of finding this out would be for him to send out to Africa a personal representative who would talk to all the leading figures,including the South Africans and the parties in Salisbury, with aview to assessing the prospects for a conference which might beheld in London in the New Year.    Mr   Cledwyn Hughes hau acceptedhis invitation to take on this task and President Carter had welcomed the idea, and had agreed to attach Ambassador Low, who had been associated with our earlier joint efforts to secure an all-party conference, to Mr Hughes&apos; staff.    The idea had been put to the
Parties in Africa and so far President Nyerere of Tanzania and president Khama of Botswana, the Zambians, the South Africansand all the Parties in Rhodesia had welcomed it.   In Mr Nkomo&apos;sabsence members of his staff had been non-committal andMr Mugabe had not yet been contacted. Replies from Mozambiqueand Angola were awaited.    There were undoubtedly some risks involved in taking this initiative, but he felt that the risks of taking no action in a deteriorating situation, with the Americanspossibly slipping away and growing domestic criticism, would be greater.    Mr Hughes had excellent standing in the House ofCommons and if he came back with a report that the time was notripe for an all-Party conference this would carry conviction. on balance, the odds were against success, but at least this movewould give us time, during which developments in Southern Africamight begin to move in a more favourable direction. Theimportant thing vrae to keep up the pressure for negotiations. Hewould be making a statement about this plan in the House of commons that afternoon.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.3
^mvunity3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and other Ministers had had useful talks the previous day with the Italian Prime Minister and sign or Pandolfi, the Italian Minister of Finance.    Signor Andreottihad given a useful account of his recent visit to the Middle East. On^ 0* EMS, the Governor of the Bank of Italy was now satisfied with ther Andreotti       credit provisions and with the intervention arrangements, which included a special wider margin for the Italian lira.    The italians were concerned to ensure that membership of the EMS would be compatible with their Three Year Plan.    They were anxious tomaintain a common line with us and the Irish at the European Councilover the question of transfer of resources.    We should co-ordinate our line with them beforehand.    Signor Andreotti had expressed the hopethat we would go to the European Council with a flexible mandate soas to maintain the pressure to secure further concessions.    In reply the Prime Minister had indicated to Signor Andreotti that if EMS wasto be set up as a Community scheme we wculd wish to see it super-vised by the Council of Ministers (Finance) with our full participationeven if we did not apply the exchange rate regime.    We intended totake a tough line on CAP prices.The Cabinet -1.      Took note.!jj^0n THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD saidtle6 Policy      there were signs of progress towards a solution on the Common^Yj Fisheries Policy.    The Commission had now tabled a working:f0Us document which implicitly recognised that our approach fell within^a?061 ^e terms Q* ^e Treaty of Rome.    The French might be willing to^&apos; ^3rd give up certain of their less important historic rights and those^8l0l*s, which they regarded as essential were not considered by our ownfishing industry as very significant.   The Danes had now movedcloser to our position on conservation;  and the Germans could accept that the United Kingdom should have some preference over thegrowth of stocks.     It should be possible to make progress in general terms at the ITisheries Council of 23-24 November, although, as theGerman State Secretary responsible for fisheries had remarked,&quot;the devil was in the details&quot;.    Nevertheless, he was hopeful thatthe broad guidelines for a settlement could be agreed before theEuropean Council on 4-5 December.Council THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that, at the Council ofMinisters (Budget) on 20 November, we and the Italians had resistedpressure to reject an amendment proposed by the European assembly to increase the European Regional Fund from 620 million units of account to 1, 000 million units of account.    We could not securesufficient support for a proposal to put the increase into a reserve4/
pending the outcome of the European Council.    During a confusedprocedural discussion, the French had attempted unsuccessfully to invoke the Luxembourg compromise to ensure that the Assembly&apos;amendment was rejected.    The result was that the amendmentproposed by the European Assembly had formally been accepted bythe Council but since this was incompatible with the maximum rate ofallowable increase on commitment appropriations, the issue wouldhave to go to the European Council in December.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that we hadbeen placed in a particularly difficult situation on this occasion bythe handling of the Presidency.    But in general we had to be very careful not to appear to be supporting the European Assemblyagainst the authority of the Council.    Moreover, it was an important matter of principle for us that if another Member State sought to invoke the Luxembourg compromise we should not oppose them. on previous occasions, the French had stood by us when we had sought to prevent the Council taking decisions by majority vote where we considered that vital national interests were at stake.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.5
Paper on the proposed European Monetary System (EMS).     They also4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of the^M^Y Exchequer (CP(78) 121) to which was attached the text of a draft Greenhad before them a letter from the Chancellor of the exchequer s Privatelj  8 Secretary dated 22 November 1978, covering a copy of the memorandum&apos;7a% Ce: which had already been circulated to the House of Commons by the11 39thici,   &apos;tn Chancellor of the Exchequer.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet should consider the text of the Green Paper against the background of the recent negotiations and the prospects for the next few weeks.    It was not yet possible toestimate the impact on sterling of the introduction of an EMS, whetheror not the United Kingdom were a member of the exchange rate regime.If we decided not to participate, it would be essential not to bemanoeuvred into a position of weakness, or one in which we appeared tobe wrecking the EMS for non-Communautaire reasons.    The green paper should therefore emphasise the United kingdom s support for theprinciple of stable exchange rates, which was in our interest as a majortrading nation.    It should leave the way open for extension to a widerand more durable agreement on stabilisation in the currency markets.He was not asking the Cabinet to reach conclusions on the schemeitself that day.    For tactical reasons it would be important to delay thefinal decisions until later.    The only issue before the Cabinet was thepublication of the Green Paper.    The final decisions would be takenlater.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the draft green paper had been prepared in great haste by those engaged in the ongoingnegotiations.    Its purpose was to update the memorandum submitted tothe House of Commons on 1 November by giving an account of theFinance Council discussions on 18 November.    It explained the EMS inthe form in which it had emerged from negotiations and spelt out the criteria against which we had consistently said that it should be judged.It discussed its possible effects on the exchange rate and the domesticeconomy, and gave reasons why we were unlikely to join the exchange rate scheme unless there were a significant change in the Germanposition.    In thj negotiations in the Finance Council, the Germans had come some way to meet us, but there were still substantial differences.There were signs that the French were nervous about the effect on the franc but they remained politically committed.    The Italians were alsovery undecided and would be influenced by our decision.    But privatelythey acknowledged that the scheme as now devised would provide theeasiest way for them to depreciate their own currency with support from other members of the Community.    They supported us fully onresource transfers.     The Irish were now politically committed to large-scale assistance from the Community as a condition of theirentry.    The exchange rate scheme itself was only a limited part of the framework of the EMS.    If we decided not to join that part of the
system, it would still be important to retain our influence over thedevelopment of the rest of the EMS.    Community decisions would berequired which would give us some leverage.    This would help in theestablishment of new machinery for concerted action on economicperformance,    which in practice meant persuading the Germans toreflate their economy.    It would also help over the &quot;concurrent studies&apos;and on the relationship between the EMS and the dollar.    If these aspectcould be dealt with, it would reduce the chance that introduction of EMSwould damage the British economy.In discussion a number of detailed changes to the text were suggested.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the publication of a Green Paper on the SMS, on thelines of the draft attached to CP(78) 121.     They had agreed a number oftextual changes.     Any further drafting suggestions should be sent to theChancellor of the Exchequer in the course of the day.     The Chancellorof the Exchequer had discretion to make any further minor draftingchanges.    The Green Paper would be published next day, 24 November.A debate would follow on 29 November.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.7
,hCTlONS:^yviouso78) 39thute 4s,5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by me Lord Chancellor(CP(78) 119 and CP(78) 120) reporting the views of a Group ofMinisters which had met under his chairmanship (GEN 151) on thepossible form of a further inquiry into Rhodesian sanctions,THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that when, at previous discussions,Cabinet had considered the nature of the forms of inquiry whichmight be undertaken it had concluded that a Select Committee ofthe normal type was unsuitable for the purpose.    As a result, a group under his chairmanship had been asked to examine what formsof inquiry might meet the objectives which the Cabinet had identified.Two possibilities had emerged from the Group&apos;s study.    The first was a Special Commission set up by Resolution of both Houses withthe kinds of constraint which Cabinet thought appropriate embodied in the Resolution,     The Clerks of the Houses had at firstconsidered that legislation rather than Resolutions would be needed to achieve the Governments aims but they had now agreed that aSpecial Commission could be established by Resolution.    It was clear that such a procedure would be unprecedented in severalrespects, and might run into difficulties on this account,particularly in the House of Lords.    Moreover the Resolutionswould be subject to amendment, and such amendments couldfundamentally change the arrangements from those the Cabinetintended.    If this course were decided upon, therefore, it would be essential to obtain prior assurances from the Opposition that theywould support the passage of the Resolutions in the form proposed.In the last resort, however, the Government might have to make itclear that they would release the relevant documents only on thebasis provided for in the draft Resolution.    The alternative to aSpecial Commission would be a Royal Commission the Royal Warrantfor which would give effect to the Cabinet1 s criteria for the proposed inquiry and which would not be amendable by Parliament.Parliament could nevertheless be associated with this procedure bybeint* asked to approve Humble Addresses asking for the RoyalCommission to be established.    If it were thought desirable, the names of the proposed members of the Royal Commission could beadded to the Resolution or Address, or announced during the courseof the Debate.    Of the two alternatives, the Group had favoured aSpecial Commission established by Resolution of both Houses, solong as consultations with the Opposition indicated that theResolutions would command a majority in an unamended form. Ifsuch assurances could not be obtained, the alternative would be a royal Commission.In discussion, there was strong support for a Special Commissionestablished by Resolution of both Houses as the most satisfactory way of achieving the Cabinets objectives, provided that the safe-guards recognised as essential by the Cabinet could be secured.To this end consultations would be needed both with the liason committee of the Parliamentary Labour Party and the OfficialOpposition.    In these consultations, and if necessary more widely,8
it would have to be made clear from the outset that the Governmentwould only agree to produce Cabinet papers on the basis proposed.These consultations should take place before a final decision wasreached about the form of inquiry.    If the results were not satisfactory, there would have to be resort to a Royal Commission.It was stressed, however, that much of the procedure associatedwith the setting up of a Special Commission by Resolution wasunprecedented and it must not be assumed that the procedure would go unchallenged.    This was particularly true of the House of Lordswhere strong opposition might be expected on procedural groundsas well as on the merits of the proposal.    On the other hand theHouse of Lords might take the view that the subject of the inquirywas predominantly the concern of the House of Commons and, onthat account, not press its objections to the limit.In further discussion, consideration was given to the composition ofthe proposed inquiry.    It was agreed membership should be small but not necessarily limited to six as suggested in earlier discussion.If the limit of six members was adhered to there would be, inaddition to the Judicial Chairman, two representatives nominated by each of the two major parties and one nominated by the Liberals.It was argued that at least two members should ^e from the Houseof Lords and that this might be a condition to securing the approvalof that House to the proposal.    On the other hand the House ofCommons would be likely to insist on the majority of the Committeebeing drawn from among its Members.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, of thetwo possible forms of inquiry, the Cabinet favoured a special commission established by Resolution of both Houses.    This view was predicated on the assumption that the Resolutions establishing the Commission would conform with the criteria which the cabinet had identified and which were set out in CP(78) 119.    A judgment on whether it would be possible to achieve Resolutions in the required form would depend on the consultations to be held with theLiaison Committee and the Opposition.    The Lord President of theCouncil should now put these consultations in hand and report backto the Cabinet as soon as possible.    No final decision would betaken until his report had been received.    The question of member-ship should also be held over until the results of the consultationswere known.    The Cabinet were agreed that a small membership of six - with perhaps two members from the House of Lords - was desirable.    They would however be prepared to consider appointingone or two additional members if the consultations revealed mat thiswould help secure the acceptability of the Cabinet1 s preferredprocedure.    The consultations should be completed before any statement was made to Parliament.    It would also be necessary atthe appropriate time for him to consult again with the previous9
Prime Ministers concerned and to make a submission to Her Majestyabout the release of Cabinet documents to an inquiry. Meanwhileanswers to questions could take the form that certain consultationswere still needed but that the Government hoped to make a statement in the following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theLord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office23 November 197810
