incisionsdeviousMerence:delusions,1..1SHAVENUEThe Cabinet1 s discussion ts recorded separately.2. The Cabinet considered papers on this subject by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP(78) 86) and by the Secretary of State forEnergy (CP(78) 87).THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that Ministers had decided to make a number of major changes in the structure and rateof Petroleum Revenue Tax (PRT), which would bring in an additional 2 billion revenue in the 1980s.    The only outstanding issue was whether the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) should continue tobe exempted from PRT.    Any change would have no real financial effect.But exemption was a substantial irritant which would be made worse ifthe tax were increased, especially since BNOC was wrongly believed tobe pressing for that increase.    It would not be sufficient to refer in the account to the amount of PRT which would be paid had BNOC been liable.There was no question of changing the relationship between BNOC and theGovernment.    BNOC had both an advisory and a commercial role, andassurances had been given on both of these.    To end the exemption would remove an unjustified fear of unfair competition and would take away theonly grounds on which the Opposition could attack the government decisions on PRT.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the decision hadbeen taken in 1975 to exempt BNOC from PRT, and he had defended it undeiconsiderable attack at all stages of the Petroleum and SubmarinePipelines Bill.    The exemption was of little practical consequence.All the earnings of PNOC were surrendered to the National Oil account and were available to the Treasury anyway.    But BNOC was different from other nationalised industries and had a close relationship with theGovernment.    To change that relationship now would put BNOC into thesame position as British Petroleum which was totally outside any effective Government control.    The original criticism of exemption hadsubsided, and the point had not been raised by the oil companies recentlydespite Press leaks about the Government1 s intentions on PRT. Itwould be a mistake to give the Opposition a minor victory on this issue.Cabinet should support the views of the Departmental Minister who was responsible for defending the policy in Parliament.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that a ministerial group (GEN 137) under his chairmanship had considered the variouscomponents of the proposed PRT package.    They had agreed on all points save this, on which the Secretary of State for Energy had been ina minority but had reserved his position.    His own view was that this represented a very small change of policy which would be justifiedbecause it would remove an anomaly which had become a source of criticism, without giving any offence to BNOC.In discussion it was argued that there was little or no revenue at stake.The exemption had made little difference to the oil companies whenBNOC was originally established.    But now that BNOC had a majorexploration role, its continued exemption from PRT might influence itscommercial decisions and affect its competition with other oil companies.BNOC was in any case required to pay Corporation Tax.    Its financialposition was now very strong, and to make it liable to PRT would not affect its standing.    However, this was a very sensitive area in relations with the oil companies.    The Governments decision toincrease the rate of PRT could be misrepresented as a breach of the assurances which were given to the oil companies at the time when the tax was introduced.    However ill-founded such allegations might be,relations with the oil companies would be soured.    It would be a mistake to complicate them further by continuing the exemption of BNOC, whichwas widely believed to have supported the increase and which might besupposed to benefit as a result.    Criticism on this score could destroy the political advantage to the Government of the increased rate of PRT.Against this it was argued that to withdraw the exemption now would beseen as an unexplained change of policy by the Government.    It wouldcast doubt on the reasons for the original exemption.    It could bemisrepresented as a minor victory for the Opposition and the oil companies.    It would certainly not remove the oil companies&apos;suspicions of BNOC.    It was in any case useful to maintain some clear distinction between BNOC and the other oil companies.    Its revenueswere all regarded as public money, whether paid over in tax orsurrendered to the Treasury.    The Cabinet should take seriously theposition of the Departmental Minister.    If it were decided to retain the exemption, it would be better to say nothing on this point in thestatement later that day about PRT.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of continuing the exemption of BNOC from the PRT.    There was no need to include any reference to this point in the Chief Secretary, Treasury&apos;s statement that afternoon.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the chief secretary, Treasury, to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office2 August 1978
THlsdocument is the property of her britannic majesty&apos;s government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 29th Conclusions, Minute 1Wednesday 2 August 1978 at 11.15 am the Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for Industry^Ojjp  ACE (attached to his Private Secretary &apos;s letter of 1 August 1978) and a noteY by the Central Policy Review Staff (attached to CP(78) 88) on^6 . developments on aerospace policy.C0Us^eT0^ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that decisionsConcjJ ^4th had already teen taken to allow British Aerospace (BAe) to proceed8lQns, with the HS 146 feeder-line aircraft and to permit British Airways(BA) to purchase Boeing 737s to replace their ageing Trident fleet.It was however becoming increasingly urgent to settle the launching of the -535 medium-thrust version of Rolls-Royce&apos;s RB 211 aeroengine;further aircraft procurement for BA;  and collaboration policy forBAe.    As for the RB 211-535, Rolls-Royce (RR) had a good chanceof making money on it provided it was the launch engine for the boeing 757.    If this could be negotiated, they estimated that theycould sell a thousand -535 engines by 1992, as there was a largemarket for aircraft carrying just under 200 seats.    If they failedto achieve launch engine status for the -535, however, it was questionable whether the development costs could be justified. Butthere was a very good opportunity to launch the engine because BAconsidered the Boeing 757 to be the best plane for their particularneeds, and they now sought approval for a launch order of 19 copies.Eastern Airlines (EAL) were also ready to place a launch order for21 757s with the -535 engine and this would enable Boeing to launchthe plane.    The -535 engine would produce between 3, 500-5, 500 jobsdirectly with 5,000-9,000 jobs with suppliers.    Decisions wereurgent, however, as there could be another launch customer in theUnited States who would want the alternative General Electric engine.To allow BA to purchase an initial order of 757s would not necessarilyexclude their buying some European aircraft in future:  the decisionon which would turn on analysis of their fleet requirements in relationto routes and traffic.    They would not therefore totally exclude the1
possibility of some future order going to the European BIO. Oncollaboration, BAt had the technological capability of building anyaircraft, but it was market forces which determined commercialsuccess.    Fifty per cent of the world market lay in the United States,and a further 25 per cent in Europe.    Boeing had 60 per cent of the totalworld market.    There had been extensive consultations on where our interests lay.    The Prime Minister had had discussions with Boeing,McDonnell Douglas (MD) and EAL, as well as with Chancellor Schmidtand President d&apos;Estaing.    He for his part had discussed the problems with his French and German counterparts and BAe had held numerousmeetings with Airbus Industrie (AI), Boeing and MD.    At firstcollaboration with Boeing had seemed the most promising option, butthere was a gap of  250 million between BAe and Boeing on the supplyof 400 wing-sets for the 757.    Moreover it would be straight sub-contracting work with no design element.    MD were much moremilitarily orientated, but were not prepared to go as far as a 50:50share in collaboration with BAe on their proposed advanced technologymedium range (at mr) aircraft.    The French and the Germans, though not ruling out tripartite collaboration, had not so far given thepossibility of collaborating with MD a great deal of thought. BAewanted to join AI as a full partner on the B2/B4 and the B 10. Thiswould mean renegotiating the present profitable contract for construct -ing the wing of the B2/B4.    On the mid-point estimate of B 10 sales,which Department of Industry officials thought too optimistic but BAeconsidered conservative, there would still be a loss.    Even so, he considered that BAe should be allowed to join AI mainly because if theydid not do so they might have no significant part in any sizeable civil aircraft project other than the HS 146 for many years.    In addition,collaboration with the French and Germans on civil aircraft wouldsignificantly improve the prospects of collaboration on profitablemilitary projects.    He would want, however, to make three conditions for such collaboration:  first, that we could not persuade BA against their wish to buy aircraft in the airbus family;   second, that the enlarged AI should enter into early and serious discussions with MD on future collaboration;  and third, that AI should examine favourably thepossibility of installing RR engines in their products.    As for finance,BAe were looking to the Government for certain assistance. Themaximum available under the existing statutory powers of the aircraft and Shipbuilding Industry Act was  30 million, which could be raised to  50 million by affirmative order.    He would seek his Ministerialcolleagues&apos; endorsement of any proposals which he might formulate inthe light of further consideration.    The most recent development hadbeen the letter which he had received that morning from the french minister concerned with aircraft policy, M. le Theule.    The salientpoints were that BAe should become a full partner in AI;   should not get involved in programmes which would be competitive with AIproducts - and in this respect the French would be likely to regard the boeing 757 as competitive with the B 10;  that they would like to see adecision by BA to purchase AI aircraft;  and that decisions would be needed within the next few days.2
In discussion, it was argued that, although it might be possible toput versions of the RB 211 on the Airbus B2/B4 and on the BIO, therewas not much future for RR in Europe because the main potentialcustomers for AI products were already committed to Americanengines and the French had struck an alliance with Americanaeroengine manufacturers for producing engines for these planes.It followed that RR had no option but to turn to the United States forits major market, and Boeing were ready to collaborate on the 757which was a good workhorse of a plane.    To launch the -535successfully it required an order from BA, as EAL had indicated that they were ready immediately to be the second partner. Themain problem was that BAe wanted to collaborate with AI and theFrench were continuing to press for a BIO order from BA as acondition of entry.    On the one hand it was argued that RR had proved itself to be an internationally competitive company and allthe indications were that the -535 engine would be financiallysuccessful.    But BAe-could only be competitive in Europe and was likely to make a substantial loss even on the basis of a medianforecast of BIO sales which was likely to be optimistic.    The firstpriorities should therefore be to secure the future of RR who providedwork for as many people as BAe, and for BA wnich employed as many as the whole aircraft industry, had a much greater turnover and made more profit.    As for BAe, whilst it was likely that the French wouldnot welcome it as a partner in AI, the indications were that theGermans very much wanted BAe.    It should not be assumed thatBAe&apos;s entry to AI would be conditional upon BA&apos;s ordering the BIO.But if DAe&apos;s membership of AI were forestalled on this account, itwould not necessarily mean a rundown in our airframe industry:there would still be the possibility of collaboration with Boeing, eventhough Boeing was so much more efficient that BA   could only do soby making a substantial loss.On the other hand, it was argued that BA&apos;s procurement policy should be based on the wider consideration of where the national interest lay, not necessarily on the commercial assessments oftheir Board.    The French, in particular, would never believe thatwe had no control over BA&apos;s purchasing policy, which in any casewere based on financial forecasts inevitably susceptible to substantial error.    There were fears in the airframe industry thattheir interests were being subordinated to those of RR. previous government policies for the industry did not inspire confidence:the VC 10 had been cancelled in favour of BA&apos;s purchasing the 707,notwithstanding that the VC 10 was a more popular aircraft with the travelling public.    The French and the Germans had been preparedto take a long view in order to maintain an independent Europeanairframe industry, but we had not, and we had pulled out of the airbus project.    It was unlikely that BA*i would succeed in negotiating entry to AI if BA bought the 757.    If so, we should be
left with no airframe industry except for the HS 146.    We should beprepared to tell the French and the Germans that we would ensurethat DA purchased the B 10 on condition that they provided a genuinerole for RR in Europe.In further discussion, it was argued that, if BA were seen to be persuaded to buy the B 10 against their commercial judgment, RRchances of sales of their aero engines in the United States would be prejudiced.    RR&apos;s future relied on the North American marketremaining open to it and the difficulties of achieving this had beenillustrated by the reaction of the protectionist lobby to the recent dealwith Pan American Airways.    There was no alternative future forRR in Europe because the potential purchaser airlines were for themost part committed to American engine manufacturers.    Ch theother hand, there were dangers in putting all the RR eggs into the boeing basket.    The financial prospects for the -535 might be good,but the overall future for the RB 211 project as a whole was moregloomy.    We could not afford to undertake to deliver a BA order forthe B 10 and the other conditions which the Secretary of State for industry had set out in his note for BA. &apos;s entry to AI should also be supported.    Moreover, we should not become involved in a continuingsubsidy of the airframe industry without reasonable prospect ofsuccess.    We should perhaps be facing the prospect of a substantialrun down in its activity so that its skilled engineering manpower couldbe used in more profitable ventures.    On the other hand, it was argued that experience had shown the difficulties of transferringtechnological manpower from one industry to another.    In somecases, skills had been permanently lost.In continued discussion, it was argued that due weight should be givento the balance of payments aspects of collaborative options.    It was by no means clear that BA 1 s involvement with the B 10 would be substantially more advantageous from this point of view than on the757.    It would be disadvantageous to our balance of payments if BAwere forced to operate      an uneconomic plane and there could wellbe severe effects if this strengthened the hand of the protectionistlobby in the Uxiited States.    By far the greatest balance of paymentsbenefit to the United Kingdom would derive from the -535 enginepowering the Boeing 757.    There was no alternative option in anyway so favourable.    As for BA^   there might be a large net loss ifthey co-operated with Boeing, but it had to be remembered that the boeing option involved very substantial aircraft sales.    On this account, the balance of payment gain might well be greater than ifBAe joined AI.    It was suggested on the strength of these considerationsthat BAe should enter partnership with AI only on terms which did not prejudice sales of aero engines to the United States.4
THE PRIME MINISTER then asked the Cabinet to consider whether,by publishing the key documents or by means of a background white paper, the considerations which Ministers would have taken intoaccount in reaching their eventual decisions on aerospace policy should be made public.    Decisions when taken would have followedfrom detailed and thorough examination of all the relevant factors and it would be to the Government&apos;s credit if this were seen to havebeen the case.    It would also be consistent with their stance on more open government.    If the primary material were thought to be too sensitive, an alternative might be to prepare a narrative showinghow the problems were approached, what general factors were takeninto account and how decisions were reached.    This would not satisfy some sections of the Press and the more extreme advocates of open government, but it would be a step towards it which would nevertheless protect commercially confidential material and diplomatic sensitivities.In discussion it was strongly argued that to reveal to any significantextent the factors that had been taken into account in reaching decisions could prejudice the success of the -535 engine; couldseriously upset our relations with our partners, particularly theFrench;  and lead to massive recriminations from the trade unions.The Government could be seriously embarrassed.    Moreover, anyserious account of our commercial diplomacy would be of little value to the Government but of great value to our competitors. the confidential nature of much of the material would inevitably lead toa distorted picture being presented.    The pressures to reveal theGovernment&apos;s decision-making process should therefore in this case be resisted, without prejudice to the general principle of opengovernment.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, saidthat the intention had been to acquaint the Cabinet with the progressof the work of the Ministerial Group on Aircraft Policy (GEN 130),but not at this stage to take decisions on the outstanding issues.This aim had been satisfactorily achieved.    No-one had suggestedthat BAe shouxd be forced into collaboration with Boeing or thatcollaboration with MD would provide an answer to DAtt&apos;s problems in the short term.    For the longer term, it was desirable to keepopen the possibility of collaboration with MD, irrespective of whetherBA6. joined AI.    There had been wide support for the proposal thatRR should develop the RB 211-535 engine and the inevitableimplications for DA&apos;s procurement policy which that implied hadbeen fully recognised.    In addition, there was wide support for BAe&apos;sentering as a full partner of AI provided satisfactory terms could be negotiated.    In order not to prejudice these negotiations thereshould in any case be no immediate announcement of a BA order for
Boeing 757s.    There was still some way to go before the majoroutstanding issues of aerospace policy could be finally resolved.It was essential therefore to avoid premature disclosures of ministerial discussions as this could greatly prejudice the chances of a satisfactory outcome.    Much day to day tactical and politicalhandling remained and the Cabinet agreed that this should be delegated to GEN 130.    As for the proposal to publish in due course an accountof the factors which had been taken into account in reaching decisions in this policy area, a large majority of the Cabinet considered thatthe commercial and political sensitivity of much of the materialprecluded this, either through the publication of key documents oreven by means of a specially prepared account.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and took note thatthe Ministerial Group on Aircraft Policy would be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office3 August 19786
