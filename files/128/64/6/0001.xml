^IRS ^^^^ The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.    It was noted that theHouse might need to sit until Wednesday, 2 August, although this wasnot yet confirmed.fyjHS 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatat the meeting between the Contact Group, consisting of representativesof the five Western members of the Security Council, and the South^bia West African People&apos;s Organisation (SWAPO) in Luanda agreement had been reached on the outstanding points in the Western proposalsNou8 for Namibian independence.    The next step would be a resolution inf&apos;*iiCe. the Security Council instructing the Secretary General to appoint aty) special representative.    We should also have to seek Security CouncilF^8i0Jl approval for a resolution on the future of Walvis Bay, which had been^    &apos; one of the main points of difference with the South Africans. TheSouth African Prime Minister, Mr Vorster, had warned that any resolution which prejudiced the future status of Walvis Bay would notbe acceptable to the South African Government.    On this basis theSouth African Government would object to the resolution proposed bythe Contact Group.    It was however a card we must play in order to fulfil the agreement reached with SWAPO.    In fact, whatever theSouth Africans might 6eek to maintain, it was clear that Walvis Baywas geographically a part of Namibia.    If all went well in the security council we should then need to get a substantial United Nations forceinto Namibia and the question would arise as to what help we should give.    For the infantry contribution we were thinking of turning to finland, Pakistan, Jordan and possibly Nigeria.    The successful outcome of the Luanda meeting was a very important development for southern Africa.    There was a specific British interest in Namibiaas a source of uranium supplies.    More generally, a settlement inNamibia should help to make Angola more co-operative and contribute to stabilising the situation in Zaire.    It could also have a helpfulinfluence on the Rhodesian situation.    There was a risk of a backlashfrom the South Africans, but it ought to be possible to contain this.The next few weeks would be crucial for the success of the enterprise.C* Sov*et^t8    1 THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theywere all conscious of the strong feelings of revulsion which the trial of Soviet dissidents had aroused in Parliament and in the country asa whole.    The question was what response we should make.    We hadalready cancelled the proposed signature of an Anglo-Soviet agreement on sporting arrangements as a reaction against previous Soviet actions.The only possible gesture we could make in the immediate future wasin relation to the proposed visit by a Soviet Minister to the national coal Board.    It seemed inevitable that this would have to be cancelled,although he would prefer to maintain a distinction between trade links with the Soviet Union and our reaction to political developments.1
Apart from this, there was the question what to do aboutMrs Shcharansky, who was at present touring Western countries.He did not think it would be appropriate for the Prime Minister to seeher;  although he himself was reluctant to do so he thought it was probably right that he should.    President Carter had asserted puhliclyon the previous day that Mr Shcharansky had no connection with theCentral Intelligence Agency and we ought to be seen to be giving the americans our support.    Another possibility would be to withdraw from the three working groups established at the Conference on security and Co-operation in Europe in Belgrade, but we should onlydo this in concert with our European partners who might not be persuaded to join us.    In general they were inclined to display less public concernover human rights issues than we did.    On the whole the scopeavailable for action was not very great and he aceepted that there werearguments against making gestures simply for the sake of it.The Cabinet -Took note.2
3. THE PRIME MINISTER said he had made a full Statement inthe House of Commons on 10 July about the outcome of the EuropeanCouncil in Bremen.    The line which he had taken on EuropeanMonetary Co-operation and the conclusions which had emerged were fully consistent with the previous discussion in Cabinet. BothChancellor Schmidt and President Giscard had pushed the Franco-German proposals very hard although President Giscard had finallyadmitted that no-one was being asked to give a commitment at thisstage.    Reactions subsequently to the proposals had been varied andnot only in this country.    Indeed they had come in for some political criticism in Germany and from the President of the Bundesbank.Greater monetary stability had been one of the Governments primeobjectives and if it were not possible to have arrangements which included the dollar, there was a serious case to be considered for a european Zone of stability.    It was not primarily an issue about thedevelopment of the European Economic Communities (e.c.): andshould not therefore be an occasion for re-opening earlier discussion about our position within the e.c..    The timetable agreed at Bremenallowed adequate time for careful consideration by the Cabinet beforethe issues came up for decision at the European Council in December.It would be preferable for them to be considered initially by a small group of Ministers under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of theExchequer, rather than in the Ministerial Committee on EuropeanQuestions.In discussion it was argued that, although the proposals could proceed without all e.c. members participating and could include non-members,they would nonetheless have significant Community implications.Their advocates certainly saw them as strengthening economic integraltion within the e.c. and leading towards Economic and Monetary Union(EMU).    Public controversy was inevitable and it would be important to repudiate the recent speech by Mr. Heath which had seriouslyundermined our negotiating position.    We would come under increasing pressure to reach decisions in December.     While there- wereadvantages in international monetary arrangements like the international monetary Fund, there would be severe disadvantages if sterling wereto be irrevocably tied to the Deutschemark,    There seemed to be no possibility of achieving a parallel transfer of resources within theCommunity on anything like the same time scale.    Moreover, theacceptance of resource transfers within the Community would condemnthe United Kingdom to the role of a regionally supported economy.Thus these monetary proposals really raised the question of the sort of Europe we wanted.    On the other hand it was pointed out that therewas no question of exchange rates being fixed for ever under the scheme or of a country being unable to withdraw from it.    The Cabinet had also to recognise that at least six members of the e.c. were in any event determined to go ahead with a scheme which would operate fromearly next year.    The question was not therefore whether we wishedto see a scheme of this kind but rather whether we wished to influenceit and to participate.    It was arguable that the scheme was not in theFrench interest but President Giscard might be advocating it becauses^Council?Julyt*3
he believed that it would help to contain internal inflationary pressures.The discussion at Bremen about the common agricultural Policy had been of considerable significance and for thefirst time the Heads of Government of France, Germany and Italy had committed themselves to a really radical review of it.    The scope ofthe Community1 s regional policy would also be reopened.    These wereimportant developments although it was too soon to say whether, as aresult, an acceptable package would emerge.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that a major policy decision would in due course be needed.    At this stage however the Cabinet were concerned with procedure rather than substance.He would appoint a small Ministerial group, under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to consider the proposals for european monetary co-operation as they had emerged from the Bremenmeeting and also the line to be taken at the forthcoming Finance Councilon 24 July which would itself only be concerned with determining thelines of the studies to be undertaken by officials.    The group shouldtake into account the paper by the Secretary of State for Energy (CP(78)80),The Cabinet would be kept informed as necessary.The Cabinet -Took note,  with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4
4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Home Secretary(CP(78) 73) to which was attached a copy of a draft White Paper on broadcasting which set out the Governments proposals for thefuture constitution, structure and organisation of broadcasting in response to the recommendations of the Annan Committee (Cmnd 6753),THE HOME SECRETARY said that the proposals in the White paper had been fully considered by a Ministerial Group under the prime minister s chairmanship (GEN 114) and the text attached to his notetook account of comments made on an earlier version which he had circulated to all members of the Cabinet,    The Annan Reportcontained 174 recommendations, many of them technical but none the less important in the longer term.    The Ministerial group discussion had concentrated on the main issues of the fourth channel,for which it was proposed to set up an Open Broadcasting Authority(storage) as recommended by Annan;  local radio, for which it was proposed to leave responsibility with the British broadcasting corporation (BBC) and the Independent Broadcasting Authority, given that most outside opinion, including Parliamentary opinion was opposed to the Annan recommendation for a Local broadcasting authority; and the structure of the BBC where the proposal was tomaintain the unity of the organisation, as recommended by Annan,but to decentralise the responsibility for its three component parts,television, radio and external services, by the creation of separateService Management Boards for each, half of whose members wouldbe appointed by himself and whose chairmen would be members ofthe Board of Governors.    There was a great deal of public interestin the Governments response to the Annan Report, and he believedthat it would bo politically advantageous to publish the White paper before   the summer recess.    He sought the approval of the Cabinetaccordingly.The Cabinet then considered the draft White Paper chapter bychapter, and the following points were made in discus sion:-Chapter 3.   On the fourth channel, it was noted that theAnnan Committee had not been able to suggest any satisfactory method of financing an storage.    The proposals in the draft white Paper remedied this deficiency up to a point, but itwas clear that initial financing by the Government would benecessary and whether the fourth channel could be madeself-financing in the long run would depend very much on how the service developed.Chapter 5.    Paragraph   5. 6 left responsibility for top staffappointments with the BBC Board of Governors.    The case for not giving this responsibility to the new ServiceManagement Boards in respect of the top staff within each service rested on the fact that the Board of Governors wereto retain overall responsibility for the BBC and some seniorstaff were themselves to be members of the Service^ PAPER ON&quot;^CASTING
Management Boards.    In addition, the chairmen of theService Management Boards would themselves be membersof the Board of Governors.    It was recognised, however,that tke Service Management Boards might want a more directsay in the appointment of senior staff within their service, andthat there must therefore be some doubt about the long-termstability of the proposal to leave the responsibility for such appointments with the Board of Governors.Chapter 7.    It was noted that the proposals for a welsh language service on the fourth channel in Wales would involvesubstantial expenditure on a minority interest.    On the otherhand, the Government were fully committed to a welsh language service, and its introduction on the fourth channelwould have the advantage, so far as English-speaking Welshwere concerned, of removing Welsh language programmesfrom the main BBC and ITV services.Chapter 8.    The Attorney General had proposed that paragraph 8.7 should conclude with a more positive view infavour of a complainant being required, as a condition of having his complaint considered by the Broadcasting ComplaintsCommission, to waive his right to institute legal proceedings.It was argued however that the paragraph already went too farin that direction.    The institution of the BroadcastingComplaints Commission would give members of the public aright of impartial investigation, and there was no reason, anymore than in the case of the Parliamentary or National health service ombudsman, why the exercise of this should deny them the right to take legal proceedings if there was a good case for doing so.    Moreover, to deny them this right would presumablyrequire specific legislative provision.    On the other hand itwas argued that if a complainant had an actionable case, heshould resort to the courts at the outset and not seek to buildup that case by a reference to the Broadcasting ComplaintsCommission.    If there were no legal waiver in cases of thiskind, the broadcasting authorities and others concerned would be reluctant to supply evidence to the Commission, andthis would generally impair the Commission&apos;s effectiveness.It was agreed that the paragraph should be recast in such away as to state the arguments on both sides, leaving theconclusion open for discussion as in the final sentence.Chapter 10.   It was generally agreed that the rising trend inviolence fully justified the expression of the governments view, in the fourth sentence of paragraph 10.4, that the onlysafe course was for the broadcasting authorities to assumeundesirable effects from the portrayal of violence unlessconvincing evidence to the contrary emerged.    The suggestion was made that this should be supported by a reference to theresults of recent research, but it was pointed out that these
results pointed in opposite directions.    It was agreedhowever that the Home Secretary should consider whetherthe expression of the Governments view might be somewhatstrengthened.Chapter 11.    It was argued that the issue of concessionarylicences dealt with in paragraph 11.7 was of more importanceat grass roots level than much of the rest of the White Paper.Concessions for old age pensioners in the transport field had proved enormously popular, and there were strong pressuresfor a concessionary rate in the licence fee for televisionwhich Was the principal form of enjoyment for old people.Against this, it was pointed out that a half-price licence forpensioners would cost  30 million, or one-tenth of the licence revenue, which would have to be found either from public expenditure or from an increase in the licence fee. Thelatter might not be generally popular, and since the substantial proportion of pensioners living with families would have to be excluded from the concession, some resentment would be caused even amongst pensioners.    In any case it was doubtfulwhether a concessionary licence fee merited a high socialpriority, in comparison with other forms of support forpensioners.    It was agreed, however, that the issues offurther concessions should be left more open and that thefourth sentence of paragraph 11.7 should therefore be omitted..THE PRIME MIN3TSR, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the text of the White Paper for publication, subjectto the changes agreed in the discussion in respect of paragraphs 8.and 11.7.    The Home Secretary would also consider whether anygreater emphasis might be given to the Governments view on theportrayal of violence in paragraph 10.4.    It was noted that he hoped to publish the White Paper on 25 July.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited the HomeSecretary to proceed accordingly.7
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(78) 75) recording the conclusions of the Sub-Committeeon Pay Negotiations of the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy (EY(P)) on the Government response to the report of theCommittee, under the chairmanship of Lord Edmund-Da vies, on policepay.    They also had before them a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Defence and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland(CP(78) 77) on the likely repercussions on the Army and the UlsterDefence Regiment (UDR) of the new special allowance proposed by theCommittee for the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUBRRsaid that the Edmund-Da viesCommittee had recommended an increase of about 40 per cent in national rates, plus special allowances of  650 a year for theMetropolitan and City of London police in addition to the present LondonWeighting allowance and of  500 a year for the RUC instead of theirpresent cpecial allowance of  183 a year.    EY(P) recommended thatthe Government should honour&apos; its commitment to accept the recommenda-tions as to the amounts of the award.    They also endorsed the prohibitionagainst striking, which some had felt should be written into the agreementwith the police on pay.    The Report had recommended that the increases should be paid in full in September 1978, though the Edmund-DaviesCommittee had envisaged the possibility of phasing. EY(P)recommended that the increases in national rates should be paid in twoequal instalments, on 1 September 1978 and 1 September 1979. Thefirst instalment would subsume any going rate of increase during the nextpay round and the second should be topped up as recommended by theReport by reference to increases in earnings during the next twelvemonths.    EY(P) also recommended that the Edmund-Davies rates should apply in full for pension purposes from 1 September 1978.EY(P) had however not reached agreement on the phasing of the Londonand Northern Ireland allowances.    They had seen three mainpossibilities - to pay both allowances in full from 1 September 1978;to pay the increases in two equal instalments, from September 1978 and1 September 1979;  or to pay more than 50 per cent of the NorthernIreland increase on 1 September 1978, either  365(to match the allowance which the Armed Forces had received since 1 April 1978) orthe full  500.    On updating the Edmund-Davies Committee had recommended that on 1 September 1979 and in subsequent years pay forranks up to superintendent should be updated in accordance with move-ments in the index of average earnings in the preceding twelve months,with a slightly different formula, essentially based on comparability,for ranks above that level.   However the Committee had also recognised that in years to come there would be changes in the police service and in outside pay movements generally and they had recommendedaccordingly that either side of the new negotiating body should be able to propose variations to the updating process.    EY(P) recommended thatthe 1 September 1979 updating should be carried out as the Committeehad proposed.    They also recommended that the updating should applyto all rank6 of the police^ despite the fact that top-ranking police officersreceived salaries comparable to the Top Salaries Review Body group8
for whom no guarantee on updating had been given.    For the longer term some members of EY(P) considered that the Committee&apos;s formulaconstituted part of their recommendation on pay and that theGovernment was committed to accept it.    Others, however, had feltthat the police could not realistically be guaranteed a particular placeon the pay ladder for ever.    The issue was whether the Governmentshould commit themselves to accepting the Edmund-Davies formula for so long as the new negotiating body wanted to use it or whether theGovernment should seek to confine themselves to a general expression of support for the principle of keeping police pay at the 1 right1 levelwithout commitment to a particular formula.    On repercussions EY(P)had noted that there were a number of police forces directly or indirectlylinked to the pay of Home Department police;  they recommended that theEdmund-Davies rates should not be applied automatically to these butthat each claim to follow the rates should be considered on its merit.Finally EY(P) recommended that the Governments decision on theReport should be announced as soon as possible and before publication ofany White Paper about the future of pay policy.In discussion it was agreed that the commitment to accept therecommendations as to amounts should be honoured;  that the increases in national rates should be paid in two equal instalments on 1 September1978 and 1 September 1979;  and that the rates should be applied in fullfor pension purposes from 1 September 1978,    On the proposal that theprohibition against striking should be written into an agreement with thepolice on pay the point was made that prohibition was already enshrinedin statutes and that thic should suffice.In discussion on the phasing of the London and Northern Ireland allowancesit was argued that there was an urgent need to improve the Londonmanpower position and an improvement could be delayed if the newLondon allowance was not paid in full from 1 September 1978,    As forthe Northern Ireland allowance it was pointed out that the RUC had deliberately foregone an increase in April 1978, when the Armed forces had received one, because they had known that the Edmund-DaviesCommittee was dealing with this question.    It would be difficult not togive them as big an increase for the current year as the Armed forces had received.    In fact there was a case for implementing the fullincrease in September 1978.    The Committee had recommended that the link with Northern Ireland pay for Armed Forces should be broken. in doing so they had emphasised the differences between the RUC and the armed Forces, in particular that the RUC officers and their familieswere exposed to attack for 24 hours a day, whereas the Army hadlimited tours of duty in Northern Ireland.    The allowance was notpensionable and was subject to review in the light of changes in thesecurity situation.    Most important, the stress and strain experiencedby RUC men, which lay behind the Edmund-Davies recommendation,already existed and it would be illogical therefore not to give compensa-tion for them immediately.    More generally, a distinction could bedrawn between phasing the national increases and phasing the special allowances since the latter were designed to meet specific existing9
tsituations:   there could be accusations of bad faith if the Governmentwere not to permit implementation of the iricreases in the allownacesin full.    On the other hand, it was argued that there was a strong case for phasing the allowances.    The special treatment given to the police in London was already resented by the police forces elsewhere in britain, some of which, eg Strathclyde, already suffered from manpowershortages.    While the Government could not escape its commitment to implementing the full proposed special allowance for London, thisresentment could be mitigated somewhat if the introduction of it wasphased.    As for the Northern Ireland allowance it would be very difficultto break the link with the Armed Forces which the Committee had proposed.    The arguments advanced by the Committee for the increasedallowances for the RUC applied precisely to the UDR.    UDR men hadpermanent residence in Northern Ireland and they were equally subjectto attack.    RUC men also received overtime payment and free housing,which were not available to the UDR.    In any case the repercussions inthe Army did not stop at the UDR.    The Permanent cadre at presentreceived 100 per cent of regular army rates up to Corporal and95 per cent above.    If the new rate of allowance was extended to the UDRand not to the rest of the regular army there would be a lessening of thedifferentials between the UDR and regular forces, with UDR ranks insome cases being paid more than regular troops.    There would thereforebe strong political pressure for the larger allowance to be extended tothe Armed Forces.    From the pay policy point of view too it would bedesirable for the changes in the allowances to be phased.    They could beseen primarily as designed to rectify anomalies and should therefore betreated in the same way as other cases where the Government had agreedto special rectification of anomalies.    If there was no phasing, therewould be pressure for the rectification of other anomalies to be implemented immediately.    The view was expressed that the arguments for phasing in two equal stages seemed stronger in the case of theLondon allowance than in the case of the Northern Ireland allowance,and a possible way forward on the latter would be to increase the allowance for the RUC to  365 with effect from 1 April 1978 and to 500 with effect from 1 April 1979.    This would avoid as far as possibleundesirable repercussions on the army while affording the RUC fairtreatment.In discussion on updating no objection was made to the proposal thatupdating for 1 September 1979 should be carried out using the Edmund -Davies formula.    It was argued, however, that the years after 1979presented more difficulty.    Assurances on updating had been given inthe case of the firemen, Armed Forces and doctors and dentists only inrespect of the two years in which catching up was to be achieved, and theGovernment had reserved the right to consider further the question ofupdating in the case of those covered by the Top Salaries Review Body.A commitment to accept the recommendations of the Edmund-DaviesReport for the years after 1979 would be the first case of an assurance of this nature.    On the other hand it was pointed out that theGovernment was bound to be questioned on its attitude for the years after1979 and it would be difficult to offer only a vague response. Despite
the risks to future pay policy, it would be better pre sentationally forthe Government to simply say that they accepted the recommendationsof the report - both with regard to the proposed formula and the scope for the negotiating body to change the formula at any time.    It was inany case quite likely that the employers would wish to suggest changesin the formula to the new negotiating body at an early date.In discussion of an announcement of the decision the point was made thatthe fact that an independent report and a forward commitment were involved did not necessarily justify making an oral statement in theHouse.    If an announcement were made in another form the government might be able more easily   to avoid being pressed on its attitude onupdating for the years beyond 1979.    On the other hand the  Report and theGovernment1 s decision on it was likely to be generally welcomed andthere could be presentational advantage in making an oral statement.Moreover if there was no statement in the House mere might well be ademand from the Opposition for a debate, which could concentrate onthe weaknesses in the Report.    As for timing it was noted that Monday,17 July was the earliest possible date for a statement to be made. any delay thereafter would undesirably narrow the gap between the announce-ment and the likely publication date of the White Paper on pay policy.In further discussion it was noted that the Government decision wouldhave implications for local government, and it was desirable that theyshould be consulted at an early stage.    The award would impose extracosts on them of  90 million a year, and questions would be asked ongrant aid and cash limits.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that Cabinetaccepted the report s recommended pay rates, with implementation infull from 1 September 1978 for pension purposes.    They were agreedthat no attempt should be made to seek to write a prohibition against:striking in to an agreement with the police on pay.    They were agreedthat the increases in national rates should be paid in two equal instal-ments on 1 September 1978 and 1 September 1979.    On the phasing ofthe implementation of the proposed new London and RUC allowances,the majority favoured introducing the London allowance in two equalInstalments, th-s first on 1 September 1978 and the second on 1 September1979 and this should be done.    In the light of the special situation inNorthern Ireland, however, the Cabinet agreed that the allowance to theRUC should be increased to  365 as from 1 April 1978 and to  500 asfrom 1 April 1979.    The question of increasing the UDR and regulararmed forces allowances could be considered in the course of the normalreview of their pay next year.    The Cabinet were also agreed that theaward for 1 September 1979 for all ranks should be updated accordingto the formula proposed by the Edmund-Davies Committee.    As toupdating thereafter it would be important to ensure that both of the relevant recommendations in the Report were seen as a whole so thatthe formulae proposed were conditioned by the recommendations that either side in the new negotiating body should be able to proposevariations to the updating process.    The Cabinet were also agreed that
the Edmund-Davies rates should not be applied automatically to british transport and Port of London police or in turn to Ministry of defence and Atomic Energy Authority police.    Each claim to follow theEdmund-Da vies rates should be considered on its merits.    The cabinet were agreed that the Governments decision on the Report should be announced by way of an oral Parliamentary statement to be made bythe Secretary of State for the Home Department on Monday, 17 July.Such a statement should be short, with detail relegated to the official report.    The Report itself should be published as soon as possible.The Cabinet also noted the intention of the Secretary of State for theHome Department to follow up the announcement with a major speech on law and order and the contribution to it made by the government&apos;s decision on police pay.    Other Ministers should also seek to emphasisepublicly the benefits of the Governments decision in speeches over thenext few weeks and the Secretary of State for the Home department should arrange for the preparation of a series of speaking notes fortheir use.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for the Home Department to be guided accordingly.12
^* The Cabinet had before it a note by the Chancellor of the july        Exchequer (CP (78) 76) to which was attached a draft White Paper on6yjo^ Pay Policy, together with a further note by the Chancellor of the^fej^8 Exchequer (CP(78) 7fJ) about the action taken by the Government in recentj^(7gj 2^*^ years to help the low paid,^te^0118&apos; THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Governmentsbiggest electoral asset was its success in the fight against inflation.The latest forecast indicated that the annual rate of inflation would remain at about 8 or 9 per cent until the end of the year. Thereafter,its movement would depend primarily what happened to pay, although there were other factors which would also affect this.    Other thingsbeing equal, if the rate of increases in earnings continued next year at about the present level, the rate of inflation would return to somethingbetween ll\ and 13 per cent by the following spring.    If it could bereduced to 5 per cent, then the rate of inflation would be between 6. 5 and per cent in the spring, and perhaps between 5 and 6. 5 per cent in theautumn of 1979.    If earnings increases were around 7 per cent, therate of inflation could be expected to stay stable until next spring, and to fall to about 7 per cent on an annual rate by the following autumn.Stability, or a fall in the rate of inflation, would be a major prize. to achieve it, the Government should do all it could to reduce the rate of pay increases significantly.    It could not however hope to achieve a7 per cent rate of earnings increases unless it made its own position clear;  was consistent in its treatment of the public sector;  and did allit could in the private sector to secure compliance with its policies.There was therefore no alternative to a further year of structured paypolicy.    He therefore proposed that a norm of 5 per.cent should beestablished for the next pay round, in the expectation that this would lead to an outturn of about 7 per cent.    The trade unions were well aware of the position, and were expecting both a further policy statementfrom the Government and a low norm, although no figure had yet been used in discussion.    The unions could not be expected to endorse thispolicy, but they might be persuaded not to campaign against it. ThePrime Minister&apos;s plans were for the Ministers concerned to explain the general economic background to the new policy to the general council of the Trades Union Congress(TUC) on Tuesday of the following week but without indicating a precise norm.    This would be followedby a similar meeting with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).Thereafter the White Paper would be considered by Cabinet on 20 july and published on the following day.    A debate in the House of commons would follow probably on 27 July.    The draft White Paper was in broadly the same form as that of the previous year.    It restated the twelvemonth rule in a different form.    The TUC would be unable this year topromulgate this formally.    The White Paper set a guideline figure of5 per cent, but left room, as in 1977, for &quot;kitty bargaining&quot; allowingsome groups to receive less, and some more, within this average.It allowed for self-financing productivity deals;  these had been lesswidespread, and less abused, in the current round than the Governmenthad originally feared.    It was more flexible than the previous white paper on the question of hours, but any reduction in the working week
would have to be accommodated within the 5 per cent overall pay limit.    There was a tightly drafted provision for dealing withexceptional cases and anomalies.    This was inevitable followingdecisions for example on the police.    And there was some relaxation for the low paid groups covered by the Wages Councils.A number of drafting changes would be needed to the present version,and he proposed to circulate a further draft to the Cabinet for itsdiscussion the following week.In discussion, it was argued that a further round of pay policy on thelines suggested would be unacceptable to the trades unions. the likelihood was that they would simply ignore the new policy andnegotiate pay settlements well outside the proposed limits. Althoughtrade union leaders had been very helpful to the Government in thepast 4 years, the pressures on them were mounting.    There was a growing feeling that workers in the public sector, especially amongthe better paid, were being well treated at   the expense of those inproductive industry.    It would be better to abandon any attempt at astructured pay policy, and to rely on TUC support for moderation in wage claims next year.    Indeed, the real problem facing the economy was not that of pay, but unemployment.    After tie election, the pressures for re-examination of the Governments economic policy would be irresistible and it would be found that the pay policy proposed would be incompatible with the Government18 strategy.Against this, it was argued that success in beating inflation wascritical to the Governments electoral prospects.    The climate was more favourable than it had been in 1977 to a further round of paypolicy.    Living standards had been rifiug in real terms, helped bythe tax reductions in the last Budget.    However, this trend wouldnot continue, and the Government should not promise a further improvement when the best that could be achieved next year was probably stability in living standards.    Trade union activists mightbe opposed to a fresh round of policy but the rank and file were, sofar as could be judged, in favour.    The alternative of a return to free collective bargaining was only appropriate in a free marketsystem.    But the Governments socialist principles required thatsome members of the community, for example steel workers, shouldbe protected from the full rigour of the market.    It followed that astructured pay policy was also necessary.    If the Government couldnot rely on trade union promises of moderation in pay claims, apolicy such as now proposed was inevitable.    It might be that all itwould achieve would be a reduction in the centre of gravity of futurepay claims, but even this was worth having.    It was also important to ensure, by as many means as possible, that such a policy would beaccepted by the majority of the unions and their members.In discussion of the appropriate level of pay in the following round, itwas argued that a 5 per cent norm was too low.    The TUC was pressing for a reduction in hours as a central feature of its policy for 1978-79.If the cost of a reduction of even one hour in the standard working weekhad to be accommodated within a 5 per cent ceiling, this would leave
only 21 per cent for actual pay increases, and this was totallyunacceptable.    In earlier pay rounds, the Government had deliberatelyerred on the generous side in establishing pay norms, so as to ensurethe acceptability of the policy.    This was preferable to selecting a vigorous figure, but failing to enforce it.    It might therefore be better to set a 6 per cent norm in the new round.    Against this it was argued that the real choice lay between 4 and 5 per cent, and there were strong arguments for 4.    It was important to create a climate in which a5 per cent pay increase was once again seen as a generous settlement.A 6 per cent norm could well mean a cut in the real standard of livinglater in 1979.In further discussion, it was argued that the acceptability of the policy,as well as its success in practice, would depend critically on theprovisions made for exceptions and anomalies.    Ministers hadunderstandably been prepared to enter into massive forward commit-ments in the public sector, as the price of 10 per cent settlementsduring 1978.    But in doing so they had created almost irresistiblepressure for similar treatment in the private sector.    The present draft left too much room for special cases to receive increases ofmore   than 5 per cent.    This posed a real threat to the success ofthe policy.    It also explicitly provided for the re-establishment offair comparisons for the non-industrial Civil Service, and there could be great pressure for similar treatment in the industrial CivilService.    While these represented a catching up on private sectorsettlements, rather than exceptionally generous treatment, it would be important to ensure that they could not be used as a stepping stone onwhich to build higher settlements in the private sector in the next year.The acceptability of the policy would also be improved if there werepreferential treatment for the very low paid.    The present draft onlydealt with those covered by Wages Councils.    The Diamond CommissionRoport showed that the low paid had received no improvement in real terms in their living standards between 1970 and 1977.    A 5 per centnorm threatened an actual reduction in their standard next year. TheCabinet would need to consider this further before approving the present draft.    Other points which would require further consideration included the rather blurred re-statement of the twelve months rule, and theprovision for self-financing productivity deals.    It was also essentialto be seen to seek an extension of dividend controls for a further year,although it might not be possible to secure a Parliamentary majorityfor the necessary legislation.    Steps would be taken to ascertain the likely attitude of the Liberal Party to further limitation of dividends.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that asubstantial majority of the Cabinet were in favour of the publication ofa new &quot;White Paper on Pay Policy on the general lines proposed.De cisions on some of the major issues however, including the figure to be used for future pay increases, would need further considerationby the Cabinet.    Meanwhile, he would, together with the other ministers directly concerned, meet the TUC and the CBI early the following15
week and discuss the Governments position on pay policy, and itsbackground, in general terms.    As to dividend controls the cabinet agreed in principle that they should be extended for a further twelvemonths.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should ascertain the likely reaction of the Liberal Party to new legislation for this purpose.The Cabinet should take a tactical decision at their next meeting aboutwhether or not to proceed with the necessary legislation. ministers should send any detailed drafting suggestions to the Chancellor of theExchequer as soon as possible.    There would be a full discussion ofthe draft White Paper at the Cabinet meeting on 20 July, Thereafter,the Chancellor should make a statement in the House, and the white paper should be published, if possible on Friday 21 July.    The exacttiming would however need to be considered further by the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Lord President of the Council. Therewould be a debate on the White Paper before the House rose for the summer recess.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion, and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office13 July 197816SECRET
