1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week following the christmas recess.    It was noted that the House would return on Monday15 January 1979, and not on 16 January as previously envisaged.^Policy THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Government&apos;s defeatsActions following the debate on pay policy sanctions the previous night hadbeen expected.    After the votes he had announced the governments intention to able a motion of confidence for debate the following day.    He had also told the House that the Government would reviewits policy on sanctions.    There was a good prospect that theGovernment would win the confidence vote, even without the supportof Scottish National Party Members who were known to beanxiously reconsidering their position.    The immediate question was what the Government should say about its sanctions policy inthe debate that afternoon.I^U\MENTARY-^AIRSTHE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that in his view the Government, as a consequence of the previous evening&apos;s votes,should&apos;accept that it could no longer use its discretionary powers in relation to the private sector to support the fight against inflation;  that firms who had been told that discretionary action might be taken against them due to a breach of the pay guidelineswould be informed that this would no longer happen;  that paypolicy clauses in existing Government contracts would not beacted upon;  and that no such pay clauses would be incorporated in future contracts,,    He regretted the course events had takenbecause the removal of sanctions from the private sector wouldbe bound to result in higher settlements there and would increasedissatisfaction in the public sector when the Government, as itwas bound to do, continued to use the weapons still available to itto maintain its basic policy.In discussion there was agreement that the Government should notreact too quickly to the previous evening&apos;s defeat.    In particularwhile it would be necessary to acknowledge that the Governmentwould give effect to the decision of the House as recorded in the amended motion, detailed explanation of the precise implicationscould with advantage be left for later and more consideredexposition.    It was, for example, still an open question whetherthe Government should unilaterally waive the rights it hadthrough pay clauses in contracts voluntarily entered into.In further discussion it was argued that the Government nowneeded to seek alternatives to sanctions in the private sector.This gave heightened importance to the forthcoming discussions with the Trades Union Congress  (TUC).    Fiscal and monetaryweapons were also in reserve.    As to the public sector, it was clear that the moral force of the Governments position had been1
weaker 3d.    The containment of inflation would still require theGovernment to take a firm line over public sector wage settlements but maximum use should be made of the Government&apos; relations with the TUC to seek the understanding and help of theunions in avoiding major confrontations.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould speak in that day&apos;s debate on the lines agreed by the Cabinet.In so doing he would not make specific reference to pay clauses in Government contracts but would leave this and other detailedpoints to be dealt with later by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.As to the future the Cabinet were agreed that they should not abandon the present policy except in so far as modifications were needed to take account of the decision of the House of Commons.No new White Paper should be promised or issued. Theimmediate need was to press forward with the meetings already arranged with the TUC.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime ^jLlnister&apos;summing up of their discussion.tJf-MUNlTY^IRS0Pean*tary^ence:.78) 42nd,&quot;^sions,2. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said theItalian Government had now decided to enter the exchange ratemechanism of the European Monetary System and this had been endorsed by a majority of the Italian Parliament.    No decisionof the Irish Government had yet been announced.    There were indications that, like Italy, they might enter the exchange ratemechanism using the wider margin of 6 per cent.    They mighthowever also declare their intention to maintain parity withsterling.    In the latter event, it would not be necessary to imposeexchange control immediately although it might reduce speculationif we were nevertheless to announce our intention to disallow the currency investment premium for holders of Irish securities.The Cabinet -Took note.2
ruESIAN 3. The Cabinet resumed consideration on the possible form of a^TlONS further inquiry into Rhodesian sanctions.Pfcr THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had discussed this matter with theAtY Leader of the Opposition.    Mrs Thatcher had said that the ShadowCabinet believed that it would not be in die national interest to have any&quot; lQus further inquiry.     But if nevertheless there were to be one, they would( rence: be opposed to its taking the form of a Special Commission of bothr&apos;8) 42nd Houses and having a judge as Chairman.    Moreover, in their view ther^sions, scope of the inquiry should be confined to the Parliamentary aspects -te 4 that is, excluding the actions of officials and the oil companies. they thought that an inquiry, if there had to be one at all, should be under-taken by a Select Committee.    Notwithstanding the Shadow Cabinet1 sopposition to the Governments proposal, the Leader of the opposition had indicated that, if on a free vote the House agreed to the setting upof a Special Commission, she would be prepared to nominate members to it.    Mrs Thatcher had also asked that her reactions to theGovernments proposals should be treated as confidential.    Mr Heath,with whom he had also discussed the question, was similarlyunenthusiastic about a further inquiry and, though he had not specificallysaid so, seemed opposed to any form of inquiry which would examineactions by officials or the oil companies.     He clearly disliked the ideaof Members of Parliament being asked to form judgments on thepolitical actions of their colleagues.     Nevertheless, he had agreedthat if the House voted in favour of the Governments proposal, hewould accept that the papers of his Administration could be madeavailable to an inquiry on the conditions envisaged by the Government.In the light of these discussions the Lord President of the Council andhe had agreed that there was nothing to be gained by seeking to compromise with the Opposition and that the right course of action wastherefore to put to Parliament the proposals which the Cabinet had previously agreed.    He would make a statement to the House thefollowing day announcing the Governments decisions and indicating that tne necessary Resolutions would be brought to Parliament for debate in the New Year on a free vote.    The Cabinet had still to resolve the question of who should authorise the disclosure of docu-ments in the Ctmmission1 s final report.    The choice lay between theChairman of the Commission or the Commission itself.    The draft order of Reference annexed to CP(78) 120 at present includedalternative texts.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he strongly agreed with the Prime Minister&apos;t views on how to proceed.     The ShadowCabinet, in opposing any :orm of further inquiry, was at variance withthe views of some of its sipporters, including the Chairman of the 1922Committee.    He was confident that when the Government explained thereasons which had led it to favour its preferred form of inquiry, itwould command a great deal of support.    There was always aI
possibility of unwelcome amendment, but he was confident that therewould be wide support from the Governments own supporters; the conservatives would be split and the Liberals wouH vote in favour.He thought that the House of Lords would take proper account of theviews expressed in the Commons.In discussion there was strong support for the course of action proposedby the Prime Minister.     The political situation, far from reducing theneed for pushing ahead with the proposals, made it even more desirableto do so.    The Government would be accused of total cynicism if itfailed to move soon.    Although the Cabinet had already decided that theissue should be decided by a free vote, this should not apply to membersof the Administration who should be expected to back the Governmentsline.In further discussion consideration was given to whether the Chairman ofthe Special Commission should determine which of the papers and records received by it should be included or referred to in the report;or whether the power to report such papers and records should lie withthe Commission itself.    It was clear that if non-Pri^y Counsellors werenominated to the Special Commission, there would be strong opposition,including from Mr Heath, to the power of decision lying with theCommission itself.    It was clear too that a great deal would depend onthe choice of Chairman for the Commission.    If, as the government proposed, the Chairman were to be a Lord of Appeal his judgment wouldbe respected.    There was a good deal to be said for making the sameprovision for the selection of documents or extracts to be included in orreferred to in the Commission^ report as that already agreed for the selection of documents to be made available to the Commission itself ieselection by the Chairman &quot;if necessary after consultation with othermembers of the Special Commission&quot;.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that he should make a statement in the House thefollowing day announcing their conclusion that there should be a furtherinquiry by a Special Commission composed of members of each house and established by joint Resolution of both Houses of Parliament. Theterms of the Resolutions would be as previously agreed by the cabinet and as modified in the course of discussion, namely co leave the finalchoice of documents to be made available to and reported by the special commission to rest with the judicial Chairman if necessary afterconsultation with his colleagues.    The Resolutions would be tabledduring the Recess and debated early in the New Year.     The Governmentwould allow its supporters a free vote on them but members of theGovernment would be expected to vote for the Governments proposals.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theLord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office14 December 1978
