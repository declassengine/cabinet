J^MENTARY1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.^Faid 2* THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH secretary reported that information had been received that the Head ofState and Chairman of the Supreme Council of Ghana, Generaln^Qa Achaempong, had resigned.    The situation in Ghana had for sometime been deteriorating.    General Achaempong&apos;s departure might result in his place being taken by a more popular figure, but thiswould be unlikely to result in any change of policy.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thattevi0lls various attempts were being made to bridge the gaps between the*te&amp;ce* parties and there were still some hopes of achieving a dialoguebetween Mr Ian Smith and Mr Nkomo.    It would however be veryP^Bio difficult to achieve an all party meeting by the end of July, though^Ute 3   s* this was not impossible.    The situation inside Rhodesia was unsatisfactory.    Salisbury had an appearance of stability andefforts were being made to go ahead with implementing theconstitutional arrangements under the internal settlement.    In thecountry at large, however, the situation was deteriorating and wecould be faced with a serious breakdown of law and order leading to virtual anarchy.    If this worst case were to happen ourassumption was that most of the white population would slip acrossthe border, probably into South Africa.    Any attempt to conduct arescue operation by flying therrjaut of Rhodesia would present majordifficulties.    In these extreme circumstances, the Patriotic Frontmight hope to conduct a take-over operation rather on the lines ofFrelimo in Mozambique.    It should not however be assumed thatthey would have the direct support of the Cubans for this.President Kaunda of Zambia in particular did not want the Cubansin his country and so long as he and the other Front Line Pre aidantsfelt that we were genuinely working for a negotiated settlement onthe lines they could accept, they would not admit them. Therewere a number of steps we could take in face of a deterioratingsituation before we could say that the point of breakdown had beenreached.    We should, with the support of the Front Line Presidents,go all out for a negotiated settlement on the basis of the Anglo/American proposals, including if possible the early introduction ofa United Nations force.    Despite the Cabinet1 s earlier hesitations he felt strongly that we should contribute to such a force.    The timemight also come when it would be necessary to think again about thepossibility of bringing all the parties to London for a constitutional
conference.    Although there were obvious objections to thiscourse the fact was that all the parties retained some measure ofrespect for constitutional procedures and such a conference might prove to be the one thing which could prevent a final breakdown.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, saidthat our great assets were the close co-operation which we had established with the United States Administration and the extentto which we had succeeded in retaining the support of the FrontLine Presidents.    While we maintained these, the prospects of achieving a negotiated settlement remained.    But the possibility that the deteriorating situation could over the next few months leadto a breakdown of law and order in Rhodesia was a matter for serious concern.    It was desirable that alternative options shouldbe prepared which Ministers could consider if this looked likehappening.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should arrange for officials to make an urgent study, in consultation withthe Ministry of Defence, of what our response might be in this situation.    We could be faced with the need for action during august or September and those Ministers directly involved in ourhandling of the Rhodesia problem should ensure that they wereavailable for consultation during these months if necessary.The Cabinet -2.       Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth. Secretary to proceed accordingly.3. THE PRIME MINISTER said he and the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary would be attending the European council meeting in Bremen,    It seemed likely that the most significantdiscussions would be on the possibilities of greater stability betweenEuropean currencies.    The Finance Ministers had put forwardsome outlines and Chancellor Schmidt had a scheme of his own,though neither was in tangible terms.    The attitude of PresidentGiscard d&apos;Estaing was not entirely clear and he seemed to be at variance with his advisers.    It was important that these discussions did not disturb the money markets and lead to down-ward pressure on sterling either through the belief that the UnitedKingdom might be isolated or through a belief that we were intending to join a scheme but only after a devaluation.    To avoid speculationof either kind, his line would be to say that we had always been infavour of greater stability, that we were willing to examineconstructively the ideas put forward by the Finance Ministers butthat if a durable solution was to be found, certain principles had tobe accepted.    The first was that the pressure for adjustmentshould not come only on weaker countries but that there should be
symmetrical obligations on the stronger countries eg to growfaster.    This was a major condition, although it was not yetclear how it could be enforced.    Secondly, if there was to be amaximum contribution to growth, substantial transfers of resources from the richer to the poorer countries of the Community,such as already took place within regions of the United Kingdom,were essential.    This would not be an easy proposition for theGermans to accept but it was not acceptable to have an arrangement which helped to reduce the pressure on the Deutschemarkvis-a-vis the United States dollar but did nothing.to contribute to continue convergence.    Officials would have to be instructed toexamine all these issues and to report back in the autumn or to thenext European Council in December.In discussion it was pointed out that, so far, the Community had shown little progress towards economic convergence. Theobligations of the Rome Treaty itself were responsible for aperverse transfer of resources.    Even if a transfer of resources from the richer to the poorer member states could be achievedit was not clear that this would be a sound bargain for the UnitedKingdom to enter a European monetary scheme at a fixed sterlingrate.    Even a readiness to examine these ideas might imply a commitment in principle.    On the other hand, it was argued thatwe had no vested interest in preserving the freedom to float inrelation to other European currencies.    Provided the conditions were right, a monetary arrangement could contribute to the chances of higher growth.    Although they did not contain an explicitreference to resource transfers, the conclusions of the FinanceCouncil were otherwise consonant with the conditions we would wishto see satisfied and we should keep the discussions firmly based onthis document, which was the Community position, so as to outflankany less acceptable ideas which might be put forward by chancellor Schmidt and President Giscard.In further discussion it was suggested that we should reconsiderour attitude towards the Community budget.    The provisions foragricultural expenditure were at present open-ended but we should consider whether the Budget Council should give strict guidance tothe Agricultural Council as to the limits within which they could operate.    It was further suggested that the principle of a balance between each member states contributions and receipts should be examined.    It was unreasonable that member states with lower than average gross domestic product should pay more into theCommunity than they got out of it.    An opportunity to reopen thequestion of budgetary contributions would occur in one or two years&apos;time when the budget would exceed existing sources of Communityrevenue.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted that it would be important to avoid an outcomeat Bremen which might lead to attacks on sterling during the nextfew months.    He would have regard to the points which had beenmade and did not intend to go beyond agreeing to further studies ofthe conditions which would have to be satisfied before any agree-ment could be reached.    There would then be a later opportunityto consider whether a satisfactory bargain could be struck. the ministerial Committee on European Questions should give furtherconsideration to the attitude we should take in the Budget Councilparticularly over expenditure on the Common Agricultural Policy.The Cabinet -1.      Took act, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.N0t^a   8 THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE , FISHERIES AND FOOD saidthat he had just had valuable talks with Norwegian Ministers. Infishery matters, Norway and the United Kingdom were the two greatconservation nations.    They had agreed to consult together overconservation in waters around tne meridian line in the North sea and also on enforcement.    He was sending officials to study theNorwegian enforcement system.    The Norwegians now understood the reasons why we had prevented signature of the european economic Community/Norway framework agreement on fisheries.The cabinet.      Took note.4
&quot;9-80 toL,etence*4. The Cabinet had before it three papers on public expenditure:a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP(78) 68), amemorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(78) 69) and thereport of the Public Expenditure Survey Committee, circulated by theChief Secretary as CP(78) 67.     They also had before them amemorandum (CP(78) 70) by the Secretary of State for Education and science and Paymaster General and the Secretary of State for Wales,on financial support for 16-18 year olds in full-time education, and a minute dated 4 July from the Secretary of State for Social Servicesabout expenditure on the National Health Service.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, when theCabinet took its decisions on the 1977 Survey, they had been deliberately cautious in choosing a growth rate of 2 per cent in public expenditure, against the then estimated growth of gross domestic product (GDP) of 3^ per cent.    These assumptions had proved to be alittle optimistic, especially on earnings, productivity, the level ofimports, North Sea oil production and the exchange rate, and thegrowth figure was now likely to be around 3 per cent in the current year.    As colleagues knew the Government had faced some difficultyin financing the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) without raising interest rates unduly, though the corrective action taken inJnne appeared to have been effective.    Nevertheless there were realuncertainties.    The effects of the tax reductions made in the Budgetwere still to work through and there was likely to be some upwardpressure on prices towards the end of the year although inflationwould probably stay at about 8 per cent until then.    Thereafter, the shape of the next pay round would be critical to the success of counter-inflation policy and, through that policy, on our economic prospects.    It was for this reason the Prime Minister had laidgreat public emphasis on the need for a lower outturn in the following year.    Both politically and economically, it was essential to avoid any shock to confidence.    It followed that in both the short and longterm, planned public expenditure should not be allowed to increase bymore than 2 per cent a year.    In the current year, this implied anincrease of 5 per cent in real terms, because shortfall would be much lower than in the previous year.    Pay policy in the current year hadundoubtedly been assisted by the reductions in taxation which had beenmade.    It was desirable for the same reason also to try and keeproom for real cuts in taxation next year.    Unfortunately the PSBRwas likely to be higher next year than this and the prospects for financing it looked tight - a task which would be made harder byfailure to secure the Z\ per cent increase in the National Insurancesurcharge which the Government had sought.    There was therefore,in his judgment, no room for any further increase in public expendi-ture above the already agreed totals for 1979-80 and 1980-81. Hewas not however asking for cuts in these totals.5
THE PRIME MINISTER said it was clear that the Opposition^strategy in the next few months would rest heavily on the containmentof public expenditure and the promise of tax cuts.    This would involveincreases in charges, some of which would necessarily fall upon thosewho would not benefit from tax reductions, and the Governmentsresponse should be to point this out.    However the Cabinet should notunderrate   the electoral attractions of the Oppositions programme.It was essential to ensure success in the fight against inflation, and itwould be difficult enough to hold the inflation rate at 8 per cent. any significant increase in the PSBR would add to the difficulties of doing this.    The Cabinet should weigh these factors in considering theappropriate level of public expenditure for the next four years.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that if the Cabinet agreed with the Chancellor&apos;s conclusion that planned public expenditure shouldbe allowed to grow by only 2 per cent over the period, there was verylittle room for any additional bids especially in the next two years. Inhis own paper he had assumed that the Cabinet would wish to endorseproposals for a new short time working scheme.    This, together withthe inevitable recalculation of the cost of some existing programmes,actually led to a small excess above the published figures in the first two years of the Survey period, and to a small margin thereafter. Itmight be possible to accommodate a few small additional bids as aresult of further   estimating changes before the autumn, but the verylarge bids for education, the Health Service and housing and environmental services could not be absorbed in this way. some further additions might be financed by offsetting savings withinprogrammes, and there might be further reductions in existing programmes which could be made to meet the cost of additional expenditure elsewhere.    It was understandable that colleagues would wish to announce some politically popular new items over the next fewmonths, but public opinion might largely discount these in a pre-election period.    Moreover any real, or apparent   relaxation in thecontrol of public expenditure might precipitate a financial crisis beforethe autumn, which would be much more damaging.    He therefore proposed that Cabinet should endorse the planning totals set out in his paper, leaving him to consider with spending Ministers before theautumn what additional bids, if any, could be afforded witkin the totalsset out in his paper.In discussion, it was first argued that the diagnosis in the Chancellor&apos;s paper was very disturbing.    The Government had done well to survivethe economic crises of the last four years.    But the prospect of continuing low economic growth and high unemployment, despite the arrival of North Sea oil, was unsatisfactory.    The Cabinet should notunderestimate the growing public resentment of high unemployment,particularly among school-leavers and the long term unemployed.Even though improved levels of benefit had taken some of the heartacheof the 1930s out of unemployment, short term measures were not enough to avoid its damaging social consequences.    The public expenditure survey figures implied no significant increase in
employment in labour intensive services like education, health or social services - indeed expenditure on these was seen as growingmore slowly than public expenditure as a whole.    In the private sector, even disregarding the possible employment consequences ofmicro-electronics, the reports of Sector Working Parties indicatedvery little prospective increase in industrial employment. Theemployment consequences of all public expeaditure programmes, andof potential additions, should be fully estimated, so that ministers could choose those options which would do most to increase employ-ment.    Even within present planned levels of expenditure, the marginbetween the cost of maintaining an unemployed man and family, andthe cost of employing him creatively, was narrow.    In the short termit should be possible to redirect public expenditure so as to createmore jobs.    In the longer term, more fundamental changes might be needed.    The Labour Party had always accepted the Keynesian viewthat unemployment was caused primarily by lack of effective demand.It followed that public expenditure should be allowed to increase atleast in line with the increase in GDP.    Indeed this was necessary inany case to meet the growing needs of the public services. Increasedpublic expenditure should take priority over tax reductions, even atthe price of some electoral unpopularity.    Other and more fundamentalalternatives to the present strategy should also be considered. TheCabinet had never properly examined the case for selective import controls and quotas, introduced and negotiated case by case in a waydesigned to minimise retaliation.    Although it might be unwise to announce any major increases in public expenditure in the next fewmonths, all these alternatives should be examined in the new parliament.    Meanwhile, the proposals before the Cabinet left verylittle room for manoeuvre.    One reason for this was the costing ofthe Short Time Working Scheme, which had never been fully approvedby the Cabinet.    The net costs of this appeared very high as comparedwith earlier estimates, and should be re-examined to see whether full account had been taken of offsetting savings.    If it had not, there might be correspondingly more room for manoeuvre.    There was however no need to take final decisions on public expenditure in thenext few weeks.    The Public Expenditure White Paper could bepublished in the normal way at the end of the year, although a preliminary view on the totals would be needed before the rate support Grant negotiations began in the late autumn.    It was in anycase possible that the economic outlook might be a little easier in theautumn.It was also argued that the Governments reputation depended upon its success in achieving economic stability during the last four years in very difficult conditions.    Our fragile economic recovery should notbe put at risk by rash promises made for electoral reasons. any significant increase in public expenditure would be seen as anabandonment of the policies the Government had followed hitherto.While the forecast levels of unemployment were disturbing, there wasonly a limited range of collective instruments available. direct government measures to preserve jobs helped only at the margin.
Increased public expenditure unmatched by tax increases would driveup the PSBR, which would be difficult enough to finance next year inany case.    The effect   on interest rates and confidence would then be damaging.    But if increased public expenditure were matched by increased taxation, this would cancel out the employment effects, whilegenerating fresh wage demands.    There were limits to the use ofKeynesian demand-management techniques in these circumstances.The correct response, even in Keynesian terms, was to concentrate onimproving our industrial performance and on our international tradingenvironment.     There were signs that the industrial strategy wasbeginning to work in some areas, as both sides of industry began towork successfully together with the Government.    Government support for high technology was another way of encouraging economic growthdirectly.    Internationally, there were serious threats to the structure of the traditional trading system particularly if American protectionismgathered strength.    But unilateral United Kingdom action now wculd bevery damaging; and those industries which were already protected bytariff or non-tariff barriers were among our least successful. TheGovernment should therefore concentrate on its efforts to improveinternational trading conditions, both at the European Council inBremen and at the Economic Summit in Bonn later in the month. Itwas also argued that increased public expenditure provided no lastingsolution to the problem of unemployment.   The Scandinavian countries and Austria had tried the experiment of a dash for growth in this way,and had been forced by balance of payments and other constraints toabandon the experiments    The real need was to improve our industrialperformance.    Industrial success could provide the resources forincreased public expenditure, but increased public expenditure did notnecessarily improve our industrial performance.    It followed that theGovernment should take no risks with the PSBR until it was clear thatthe prospects for economic growth were good enough to finance further increases in public expenditure while still leaving room for tax cuts,which might be necessary in any case to reinforce pay policy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed by a majority that the growth of public expenditure overthe period covered by the Survey should be limited to the planning totalssuggested in l?ne 1 of Annex A to the Chief Secretary&apos;s paper CP(78) 69.Within the limited headroom which this left for additional expenditure,the Cabinet wished to give priority to the proposed Short Time WorkingScheme.    The Chief Secretary should re-examine the costs of thisscheme and its treatment in public expenditure statistics and reportnis conclusions perhaps in correspondence, to the members of theCabinet.    He should also discuss- with individual spending Ministers theadditional bids listed in Annex C to nis paper in the light of theCabinet&apos;s general conclusion on the upper limit of permissible expendi-ture.    In doing so he and the Ministers concerned should considerwherever possible the scope for offsetting savings within programmes,and, where appropriate, of reductions in some programmes to helpfinance additional expenditure elsewhere.    The Chief Secretary should bring the results of these discussions before the Cabinet in the autumn.8
Where proposals for additional expenditure vrere already before theCabinet, or Cabinet Committees, these should be treated in thesame way;  accommodated within the same planning totals; andoffsetting savings identified wherever possible.    Decisions on such proposals could not, fairly, be taken in isolation.    Meanwhile theSecretary of State for Education and Science was free to consider withthe Lord President of the Council arrangements for drafting, without commitment and on a contingent basis, legislation on financial support for 16-18 year olds in full time education, in order to save time should the Cabinet decide later to authorise expenditure on thisproposals.    He would consider further how the suggested analysis ofthe employment consequences of the public expenditure programmes and the options under consideration might be prepared and brought before the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir dircussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury and the Secretary ofState for Education and Science to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office6 July !9789
