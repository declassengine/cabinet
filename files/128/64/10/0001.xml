sia,eviou8H 27th1, The Cabinet&apos;s discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.I    ^SIA 2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(78) 90) summarisingtie the main findings of the Bingham Report on breaches of oil sanctions%i ln^am policy by British oil companies.    In this he also raised the question ofty what further action should be taken to ensure that the background to theissue was fully understood and to resolve any discrepancies between theBingham Report and public statements by former Ministers and others.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the publication of the Bingham report had already been considered by a small group of Ministers (GEN 139)on 30 August.    They had agreed that the Report should be published assoon as possible, and that it should be referred to the Director ofPublic Prosecutions (DPP) so that he could decide whether proceedings for breaches of the sanctions orders should be instituted. these decisions had been announced.    Ministers had also agreed that thereshould be an early Parliamentary Debate on the Report, probably inconjunction with the normal November debate on the renewal of the rhodesian Sanctions Order, but they had deferred a decision on whether there should be a further inquiry into these matters and, if -ao, what form it should take.    While many of the Ministers concerned had thought that a further inquiry might become inevitable, they had thoughtit wise to wait and assess public reaction to the publication of the report before taking a final decision.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that since that meeting, there had been a series of conflicting statements by individuals concerned with the events of the past 12 years.    He had therefore secured the Prime Minister&apos;s agreement to bring the matter before the Cabinet.    He did not like the idea of instituting a furtherinquiry, to which in his view there were both civil liberties and foreignpolicy objections.    However, the Bingham Inquiry had been allowedto see certain relevant Cabinet papers, although the report did not say this.    Publication of these papers could in his view serve the same purpose as an inquiry because they put the action of the former LabourAdministration in a creditable light.    If the agreement of the formerMinisters concerned could be obtained, publication would close thechapter.
In discussion, it was explained that the Bingham I enquiry had beengiven access to a wide range of Foreign Office files.    Some of thesefiles had, as was then the normal practice, contained papers andminutes of relevant Cabinet Committees.    Through a misunderstandingthese had not been removed before the files were made available tothe -Inquiry.    Asa result, the Inquiry had full knowledge of theinformation available to Ministers collectively and of their discussionsduring the period 1967-68.    Because these papers had been sent tohim by mistake Mr   Bingham had agreed not to make any directreference to them in his Report:  but it was arguable that either the papers had now to be published or it had to be made clear that the inquiry had had access to them if some of the current allegationswere to be effectively repudiated.    The  Inquiry had apparently not seen any Cabinet papers of the subsequent Conservative Administration,and it was not clear whether these would have been relevant.In further discussion, it was pointed out that there was a strong case for a further inquiry, if only to satisfy Parliamentary and publicopinion.    Against this it was argued that the   key facts would alreadybe known with the publication of the Bingham Report.   However, theGovernment might not be the sole arbiter of whether there wag to be afurther inquiry.    Its hand might be forced by Parliamentary action,as had happened in the case of the Crown Agents.    The House ofCommons might want to seek to establish the extent of Ministerialculpability, if any, irrespective of the possible effect this might have on prosecutions for breaches of the Sanctions Order.    A decision onprosecution should be possible within two or three weeks; Counseladvising the DPP had been instructed to give priority to the questionof possible prejudice and to advise the Attorney General accordinglyas soon as possible.    It might be preferable to defer a final decision about a new inquiry until this opinion was available.    The form of thefurther inquiry would also be relevant to the decision to prosecute.It had in practice never been possible to prosecute in cases which hadbeen investigated under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry Act.    On the otherhand, an inquiry conducted by a Parliamentary Select Committeewould be an unsatisfactory way of establishing the facts.    It would bevery difficult to refuse such a Select Committee access to at least theCabinet papers which the Bingham Inquiry had seen, but to publish the papers or make them available to a Select Committee would representa major breach with precedent which could have very damaging consequences.    Publication would in any case require the agreement ofthe surviving members of the Administration concerned and was not one which the present Cabinet alone could take.2
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet reaffirmed the decision that the Bingham Report should bepublished once the required consents had been obtained. Publicationcould, if necessary, be in duplicated form with a printed version issuedlater.    The Report could be expected to show the actions of the. previousLabour Government in a favourable light, by demonstrating thai it had done all it could to ensure the success of the sanctions policy in a verydifficult situation.    At this stage most members of the Cabinet clearlyfavoured a further inquiry into these matters but a final decision onthis should be reserved for a meeting of the Cabinet to be arranged forthe following week when attention would also need to be given to the related questions of the form of any inquiry, its terms of reference and access by any inquiry to the rtlva&amp;t Cabinet papers of the present andprevious Administrations.    Decisions about the timing of publication and of any related Government statement would be taken in the lightof the Cabinet&apos;s resumed discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.Cabinet office September 19783
:HlsL   CUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 30th Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 7 September 1978 at 10. 30 amNesia!teviou8The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary (CP(78) 89) on Rhodesia.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that bothMr Ian Smith and Mr Joshua Nkomo had been seeking for some timeto get back into direct discussion and secret talks had eventuallytaken place between them on 14 August.    Their meeting had beenarranged with great care because Mr Nkomo was afraid that it might appear that he was ignoring Mr Mugabe and Mr Smith did not want to appear to be abandoning the other participants in the internal settle-ment.    He had received various accounts of the talks and it appeared that while nothing specific had been decided, an understanding hadbeen reached that Mr Smith would accept Mr Nkomo as the Chairmanof a Transitional Council.    This raised the question whether mr Mugabe would be prepared to accept a subordinate role toMr Nkomo in any transitional arrangements, and much would dependon the attitude taken by President Nyerere of Tanzania and PresidentMachel of Mozambique.    If one or both supported any inclination on mr Mugabe18 part not to play second fiddle to Mr Nkomo, this could lead to civil war in Rhodesia on a much more serious scale than thepresent fighting.    There was also a question whether PresidentNyerere saw the course of events in Rhodesia primarily in the context of preparing the way for action against South Africa.    A more immediate complication was the recent crash of the Air RhodesiaViscount aircraft and the subsequent maaeacrc of some of the survivors.This incident would of itself make it difficult for Mr Smith to engage in the near future in any further talks with Mr Nkomo, and if thechange of policy which Mr Smith was talking of introducing as a resultof the massacre included large scale attacks by the Rhodesiansecurity forces into Zambia and Mozambique, the prospects of any&apos;further meetings between him and Mr Nkomo would become even more remote.    Moreover, Mr Smith might be encouraged to embark upon a major military response by the likelihood of South African support which he might expect if Mr P W Botha, the present South AfricanDefence Minister, succeeded the ailing Mr Vorster as Prime Ministerof South Africa.    This already complex situation had now beencomplicated still further by the warning which we had received thatthe Rhodesian National Joint Operations Command (NJOC), which included all the military commanders and the head of the police, were
seriously contemplating a coup, followed by a renunciation of theUnilateral Declaration of Independence (UDI).    It was difficult toknow what weight to put on this possibility.    It was even possiblethat Mr Smith was involved in some way and that he was seeking toestablish whether he could escape from his present difficulties bycalling in the British Government and asking them to resume their responsibilities as the colonial power.    On the other hand, themilitary commanders appeared to be genuinely totally exasperatedwith the internal settlement and might have lost their confidence in mr Smith.    It was, however, clear that the NJOC were not completelyunited and that some, at least, of the members found it difficult toaccept that Mr Mugabe would have to be involved in any settlement and that, under any transitional arrangements, the present Rhodesiansecurity forces would have to be integrated with the guerrillas of thePatriotic Front (PF).    The NJOC had already enquired privatelyabout our likely attitude to a coup, and had been told firmly that theact of calling us in would solve nothing and that their first prioritymust be to put as much pressure as possible on Mr Smith to negotiate a settlement.    It was difficult to foresee whether, despite the line taken with them, the NJOC would try to stage a coup in the near futurebut on balance, particularly in the wake of the Viscount incident, it seemed unlikely that they would take action immediately.    None theless, we had to be ready with our response if a coup occurred. Sucha development would carry very considerable risks for the Government.There would be strong political pressures in Britain for us to goimmediately into Rhodesia and assert our colonial responsibilities.But this could lead to a situation where British troops were fighting the PF and where we were at odds with the rest of the internationalcommunity.    On the other hand, we should not want to lose any opportunity of bringing to an end a horrific conflict which had alreadycost many civilian lives, both black and white.    It would be essential for the Government to keep control of events following a coup and by taking a series of immediate steps to prevent a vacuum arising inwhich the Government ceased to lead public opinion.    If it appeared that a renunciation of UDI was based on acceptance of the broad principles of the Anglo-American Proposals (AAP), we should immediately publish a draft Transitional Constitution and recallParliament.    At the same time we should ask the United Nations (UN)Secretary General to send General Prem Chand to Rhodesia, and weshould ourselves be ready to send to Salisbury a team which would include Lord Carver and, perhaps, a Cabinet Minister.    It would be important to open discussions immediately with the new Rhodesianregime, with the PF leaders and with the Front Line Presidents.We should also seek an emergency meeting of the UN Security Counciland the establishment of a UN force.    There would probably bepressures from those in this country who foresaw a coup being followed by chaos to send Lord Carver as the Resident commissioner and British troops to Rhodesia at once or, at least, in anticipation ofthe decisions which we could be seeking in the UN.    We should resisttaking such a course.    It was on the whole unlikely that law and order2
would break down immediately after a coup, and we should need ashort breathing space to satisfy ourselves    that the new regime wasin fact in control in Rhodesia.    We were in close touch with theUnited States Government on all these developments, and we shouldbe having further talks with their representatives later that week.In discussion it was pointed out that it was unlikely that Mr Smithwas genuinely ready to accept Mr Nkomo as Chairman of the transitional Council and that it was probable that he was trying tosplit Mr Mugabe from Mr Nkomo.    But whatever Mr smith s tacticswere, events were moving fast and it seemed increasingly likely thatthey would reach a point where Britain would be called upon to resumeher responsibilities.    This would face us with serious problems, andthis was why we were not encouraging the NJOC to topple Mr Smith.It was true that a coup would have the great advantage of removingMr Smith and that we might have more leverage with the Front LinePresidents if we resumed authority in Rhodesia.    But it was likely in practice that in dealing with the NJOC we should find ourselvestreating with a group whose position was not so very much different from Mr Smith&apos;s, and the basic problem of negotiating a settlement between all the parties would remain.    Moreover, the kith and kinargument would be put forward again at home, and there would be strong domestic pressure to send British troops to protect a whitepopulation over whom we would in fact have very little real control.If we took such a step we could find ourselves sucked into a militarysituation of Vietnam proportions.    In the meantime the Soviet union would be quick to depict us as the colonial power re-entering at theeleventh hour to deny the PF its just victory and to save the whites.These dangers pointed clearly to taking the line with the NJOC that ifthey removed Mr Smith, they would have to assume his responsibilities and be ready to carry through the negotiation of a settlement and thatif they wished to have outside involvement in this process, they must do it through the UN and not look to the British Government to inter-vene and resume its colonial powers.On the other hand, it was argued that the constitutional position was such that if the NJOC took de facto control in Rhodesia, renouncedUDI unconditionally and accepted the authority of the Crown, theBritish Government would have to resume its responsibilities in rhodesia.    We had always said publicly that we remained thegoverning power legally and we could not resile from that position now.But this would not prevent us involving the UN both politically andmilitarily on the lines proposed in the Foreign and commonwealth secretary&apos;s memorandum.    If a coup occurred, we should need to lettwo or three days pass while we satisfied ourselves that the new regimewas in control and that law and order were being preserved. Weshould use this interval to gain as much support as possible in the UNfor our future course of action and in particular to set in train thecreation of a UN force.    We might be forestalled by the Russians, butwe should still have established with the international community and,
in particular, with the Front Line Presidents that we were notattempting to act simply as a colonial power but were continuing to seek a solution on the basis of the broad principles of the AAP.This would be important because even if we were prevented fromacting through the UN, we should still need to maximise inter-national support.    It should be our aim to avoid acting alone and inparticular not to commit British troops except in the context of aUN force.In further discussion it was suggested that a major difficulty thatmight arise in any negotiation involving the NJOC was that theymight demand that elections should be held before independence, as originally proposed in the AAP, whereas the PF wanted independencebefore elections.    If the NJOC took this line, they might gainconsiderable public support in Britain.    On the other hand, itwould be very difficult to hold elections at an early date becauseso many of those involved had been out of Rhodesia for many yearsand would need time to organise themselves.    At the same time itwas in the interests of most of the parties to any settlement, includingourselves, that the transitional period before independence should beas short as possible.    It was therefore proposed that a referendumshould be held after three months or so to endorse the TransitionalConstitution, an outline Independence Constitution and the date for elections.    In this way the people of Rhodesia as a whole would beable to express a view on the proposed arrangements.    If theywere in favour of them, independence would follow rapidly andelections some months thereafter.   It would be for Parliament todecide whether this was an acceptable basis on which to proceed.In discussion of a possible British contribution to a UN force, therewas general agreement that we would have to be ready to offer toparticipate on a reasonably substantial scale.    The creation of theUN force for the Lebanon had shown that the immediate offer of a contribution by a major power was needed if a force was to beestablished quickly.    If we did this in the case of Rhodesia, it wouldgive the force credibility from the outset and would be welcomed bymost members of the UN.    We did not need to decide now the precisenature of our contribution, though whatever form it took it would behard to find given vhe Army&apos;s existing commitments.In further discussion it was pointed out that a coup might be followed,though not necessarily immediately, by a breakdown of law andorder in which the white population at large was in danger of beingmassacred.    In that event it would be politically impossible for theBritish Government to stand by and do nothing.    It would have toorganise with international co-operation, a humanitarian evacuationfor blacks and whites.    The Ministerial Group on Southern Africa(GEN 12) had already set in hand an exercise to establish what wouldbe practicable in such a situation and would consider the results ofthe study shortly.4
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thesituation in Rhodesia was becoming steadily more grave, though it remained impossible to see how it would finally resolve itself.Against this background we should continue to seek, in the closestco-operation with the United States Government, to bring about a negotiated settlement in accordance with the broad principles ofthe Anglo-American Proposals as they had been elaborated over thelast year.    The Cabinet accordingly endorsed the general approachin paragraph 8 a. -c. of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary1 smemorandum.    They also agreed that if there was a renunciation ofUDI on terms acceptable to ourselves, we should immediately takethe steps outlined in paragraph 8 d.    In particular they agreed inprinciple that we should offer at once to contribute a British elementto a UN force for Rhodesia.    Events were likely to develop rapidly,and the Ministerial Group on Southern Africa should be ready to meeturgently to take action within the broad guidelines agreed by theCabinet.    The Group might need to consider whether there was anyfurther political initiative which we could take before a coup occurred.It would also need to consider further at an appropriate moment thedetails of the transitional arrangements.    In the event of majordevelopments the matter would be brought before the Cabinet again.In the meantime the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary shouldcontinue to keep the Opposition in touch with events.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office8 September 1978
