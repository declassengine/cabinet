^AMENTARY:f,AlRs-fencer.11(?8)4l8tfusions,^41, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week, and that it wouldbe proposed that the House should rise for the ChristmasAdjournment on Friday 15 December and return on Tuesday16 January 1979.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a debate onthe European Monetary System would follow the lemaining stages of the Public Lending Right Bill on Thursday 14 December. Itwould arise on a Motion to take note of a document covering twodraft regulations which were required to provide for the EuropeanMonetary System to be established.    Its scope would not cover all aspects of the European Monetary System, but it would be set inthe context of the meeting of the European Council which had takenplace in Brussels on the previous Tuesday and should therefore bewide enough to fulfil the Governments undertaking to provide afurther opportunity for debate.    If there were demands fordiscussion to range more widely and to cover, for example, the outstanding regulations on agriculture, the position could beconsidered again.The Cabinet -Took note.^MUNITY*AIRSX^i-ies Policy^ousJ^nce:J*)41st* ^sions,X32. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Fisheries question had been discussed only briefly at the end of the European Councilon 4-5 December and no new conclusions had been reached.Concern had been expressed that the continuing failure to reach agreement on the Common Fisheries Policy was holding upagreements with third countries.    He had made clear that while we wished to be reasonable the eventual solution must be acceptable to Parliament.    The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and food and the Secretary of State for Scotland were meeting CommissionerGundelach in Brussels and it was hoped to secure some furthermovement.*etary SystemSI8) 41st&quot;jons,X 4THE PRIME MINISTER reporting briefly on the European Councilheld on 4-5 December said we had successfully achieved our objectives as regards the European Monetary System (EMS).There had been no disturbance in the foreign exchange marketsfollowing the announcement that the United Kingdom would not beparticipating in the exchange rate mechanism on 1 January. TheIrish and Italian Governments had either misled themselves intobelieving or had been led to believe that more Community aid was available to them as an inducement to join the EMS than proved infact to be the casa-    It was not yet clear whether or not they would decide to participate.1
In discussion it was suggested that President Giscard had played a surprising role during the Council.      While the French had seemed to want Italy and Ireland to participate, he had brusquelyrejected their demands for resource transfers and refused toagree to any increase in the Regional Development Fund. Thisprobably reflected his domestic political difficulties and perhapssome disenchantment with the firm position which the germans had maintained over the way EMS should operate.    In contrastPresident Giscard had gone out of his way to describe our attitude as constructive    We should continue to work closely with the French in the further technical work on EMS.The Cabinet -Took note.2
3. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that it would be?AlRjLS announced at 2. 30 pm that afternoon that he would meetPresident Carter, President Giscard and Chancellor Schmidt on^^oupe 5 and 6 January 1979 in Guadeloupe.    The discussions would bepersonal and informal.    They would cover political and securitymatters and international developments of special interest to their mutual relations.    There would be no formal agenda and it was not proposed to issue a joint communique following the meeting.The Cabinet -Took note.3
^actions:&apos;reVi0U8:M(?8) 40thsions,ute 540 The Cabinet resumed consideration on the possible form ofa further inquiry into Rhodesian sanctions.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had agreed on23 November 1978 (CM(78) 40th Conclusions, Minute 5) that only twoforms of further inquiry met the Cabinet&apos;s criteria:   a special commission established by Resolution of both Houses;   and a RoyalCommission validated in Parliamentary terms by prior votes in bothHouses.    Of these, Cabinet had decided that a Special commission was to be preferred, but only if the necessary Resolutions could be passed in both Houses without amendment.    The Lord President ofthe Council had been invited to seek the views of the liason committee and of the Opposition to establish whether the necessarysupport would be forthcoming,,THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had consulted the Chairman and the Vice Chairman of the Liaison Committeeboth of whom thought that the Special Commission proposal would command support in the Parliamentary Labour Party.     There had alsobeen a favourable response from some individual labour Members hehad connulted on a personal basis.    The Liberals tro had reactedfavourably to the suggestion.    But the Conservatives had been lessforthcoming.     They had expressed doubts about the need for a furtherinquiry and had suggested that it might be sensible to hold a furthervote on the principle of an inquiry before final decisions were taken on its form.    He had of course reminded them that the Governmenthad promised to take into account what had been said during the debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech on 7 and 8 November when some prominentConservative Members bad been among those pressing for a furtherinquiry.    He had also suggested that a vote without a specific proposalbefore the House on the form of inquiry proposed would lead toconfusion.     The Conservative Shadow Cabinet had met on the previous evening to consider the matter but had not returned a definite answer to his proposals.    Instead the Leader of the Opposition wanted todiscuss the matter with the Prime Minister that afternoon.    If she were to say that the Opposition could not support a further inquiry,he suggested that the prime Minister might indicate that theGovernment hrd an undischarged obligation to the House and thatthey intended to put their proposals for a Special Commission to theHouse for decision.    On the basis of his soundings, he was convincedthat the proposals would command wide support,.    Their basis hadalready been decided by Cabinet, except for the nomination of theCommission^ membership.    This might prove difficult if theConservative Opposition refused or were unable to make nominations.In the last resort the Government might be faced with having to nominate the whole membership.
In discussion, there was strong support for the Lord President of theCouncil&apos;s suggestion that, even if the Conservative Opposition were notprepared to give the assurances which had been sought, theGovernment should nevertheless put before Parliament their proposalsfor a further inquiry by a Special Commission established by.esolution of both Houses and on the brsis which the Cabinet had previously decided.    In doing so the Government would have to make clear their essential requirements, especially in regard to cabinet papers;   and that they would not proceed with the proposals if either house amended them in substance.   It was unlikely that the conservatives would press for more extensive production of cabinet documents, given that a Conservative Administration had been in office during part of the period when sanctions had been broken. Thegreatest danger might arise if the Conservatives decided to abstainbecause some Government supporters might try and force throughunacceptable amendments to the Resolution.    If this happened andthe Government refused to go beyond what the Cabinet had decidedthere could be embarrassing accusations that they were refusing to disclose relevant information.In further discussion, it was suggested that the Conservatives werein genuine difficulty in nominating members of the Commission atthe present time.     They might well prefer only Privy Counsellorsto be involved, although the Cabinet had already decided that membership should not be restricted in this way.    Moreover, manyof their Members would find it distasteful to sit in judgment onfellow Members and ex-colleagues, particularly if they had servedunder them.     The Conservatives&apos; reluctance to put forwardnominations might however be overcome if the House voted in favourof the Government&apos;s proposal.    Similarly the attitude of government supporters would be likely to be strongly influenced by the composition of the Commission.Finally, consideration was given to whether Government supportersshould be allowed a free vote on the issue.    There was wide support for proceeding in this way        though it was recognised that a free vote would make it even more necessary for the Government toindicate from the outset that they were not prepared to countenancethe release of Cabinet papers except on the proposed basis.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that a clear decision had now to be taken, evenwithout the support of the Conservative Opposition.    There wererisks in this course, but if the Government could not carry their proposal, they would have discharged their obligations toParliament.    He would tell the Leader of the Opposition that theGovernment intended to recommend a further inquiry conducted by aSpecial Commission established by Resolution of both Houses andon the basis of the criteria which the Cabinet had previously agreed.5
It would be the Governments intention to put the necessaryResolutions to Parliament after the Recess and they would allow their supporters a free vote.    It would also have to be made clear thatthe basis on which Cabinet papers would be produced was notnegotiable even if the Resolutions were amended.    If Mrs Thatcherwould not nominate members for the Commission at this stage hewould press her at least to agree to accept the decision of the Houseif it voted in favour of the proposal, and to nominate members later.He would also say that if a General Election intervened, it would beup to the new Administration to re-establish the Commission with asmuch continuity of membership as possible.    He would announce theCabinet1 e decision the following week after consulting Sir HaroldWilson and Mr Heath about the release of Cabinet documents.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and the conclusions reached.6
&quot;4Y5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(78) 125), a memorandum by the Secretary ofnous State for Employment (CP(78) 126) and a memorandum by thefencer Secretary of State for Prices and Concumer Protection (CP(78) 127).^?8) 39thfusions, THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that about half ae ^ million people had been covered by settlements in the present payround so far.     Only 2 per cent of these had settled outside theguidelines.    This was a smaller proportion than at this time last year.The only significant breachec hid been by Ford and probably by theBritish Oxygen Company (b.).    More settlements were beingdeferred than last year,    A group of major public service settlementswas due at the New Year,     These would set the pattern for theremainder of the present round.    It was clear that the unions concerned were concerting their action, and it was important thatthe Government should do so as well.    He had arranged for the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Committee on pay negotiations (EY(P)) to take stock of the position on these negotiations in the following week.    It had been difficult to convince public opinionof the success of the policy so far, but a recent Financial Timessurvey showed that many firms had revised downwards theirexpectations of the level of pay settlements.    It also showed that the threat of sanctions had been a major factor in stiffening the resolveof the private sector.    It was important that all Ministers shouldlend public support to the pay policy at every possible opportunity.EY(P) had taken stock of the situation which had developed since theTrades Union Congress (TUC) rejected the proposed agreement withthe Government.   They had considered whether the Government couldadopt unilaterally any parts of the abortive strategy.    They concluded that no immediate steps need be taken to strengthen the price commission or stiffen the prices policy.    On sanctions, they considered that the full range should remain available, and thai thenon-inflationary impact of a pay settlement on prices should not prevent the imposition of sanctions.    They considered it would be wrong to publish the names of companies against whom action wastaken unless their consent was obtained.    As for the extension ofthe principle of comparability into eg the local authority area the Sub-Committee had identified certain conditions on which this might be acceptable.    In their view the Government should not offercomparability, nor rule it out.    If a proposal was made, supportedby both sides, they should be prepared to examine it on its merits.A smaller group of Ministers had also considered the possibility ofestablishing new machinery to subsume the existing Pay Review bodies and the Civil Service Pay Research Unit (PRU), so that any public sector group wishing to claim comparability could have its caseexamined impartially by an expert independent body.    If the Cabinetwished the idea could be further pursued by EY(P) with a view to areport to Cabinet in the New Year.    More generally, the ministers directly concerned had maintained close relationships with the TUC.
It was clear that a majority of the General Council did not want aconfrontation in the near future because of the electoral situation andthat there was a genuine desire on the TUC side to mend bridges.The General Council had asked the Economic Committee to arrange a meeting with the Economic Ministers.    It was possible that such ameeting would take place early in the New Year.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion followed the main headings of theChancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paper.Stance       There was wide agreement with the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s viewthat the Government should maintain its present pay policy unmodified.It commanded broad support among the public, among Labour Partysupporters and among trade unionists.    Paradoxically, its maincritics were trade union leaders and Labour MPs.    The need for thepolicy was still very clear.    Without it, there was a serious risk of double figure inflation once more.    The exact outturn would dependon the underlying increase in productivity, but it would be wrong togive currency to any forecast of the eventual outturr because thiswould rapidly become self-validating.    While it was encouragingthat there had been so few breaches of the policy so far, the small number of settlements was worrying.    Many of those who had alreadysettled might seek to reopen if the policy weakened.    It was in anycase necessary to place pay policy in a wider context.    The 5 per centfigure was part of a wide range of inter-related economic objectives and should be seen and presented in that light.    It was desirable to reopen the dialogue with the TUC across the whole range of these policies.    Some flexibility might however be needed in handlingindividual difficult cases if the policy was not to collapse.In further discussion, it was argued that the Cabinet needed a sense ofthe tactical situation within which individual negotiations were takingplace.    There was a real threat of serious industrial action in thewater industry which would require the declaration of a State ofEmergency and might possibly lead to the recall of Parliament duringthe Recess.    There were also problems with the oil tanker driverswhich might need similar action.    It was very important that all ministers concerned should keep in very close toucn with each other,and with the negotiators, to avoid any danger cf crossed wires. Forthat reason, although it had been suggested informally that the PrimeMinister might meet members of the TUC Public Services Committee,it would be wiser not to follow this up at the present time. some members of that Committee were looking for a fire service-typesolution to the local authority manual workers problem.    But these workers constituted too big a group to be linked automatically toaverage industrial earnings:  the sheer size of the group would itselfreact on average industrial earnings and drive the spiral upwards.Since the strategy of the unions concerned appeared to be to put8
pressure on the Government through a threat to the water industry,it would be useful to settle that dispute quickly.    In this connection it was suggested that there might be a formula which would allow anearly settlement with the workers in the water industry, provided the &quot;overhang&quot; of earlier years could be removed and the possibilitymerited further examination.    Similarly, it might be helpful toestablish a formal link between the pay of National Health Serviceancillaries and that of local authority manual workers, since thistoo might postpone the threat of industrial action in the national health Service while a settlement was sought for the local authority manual workers.    However, the Government should be careful notto undermine the negotiating position of the local authorities themselves.There was no great support for pay policy among these negotiators.If Government interfered too directly, they might be tempted to blamethe Government for the breakdown of negotiations and place theresponsibility for reaching a settlement on Ministers.There was general support for the proposition that the Governmentshould not proceed independently on particular parts of the draft agreement with the TUC.    Some further action on prices mighthowever form part of a later settlement with the TUC if it proved possible to reopen the dialogue.    There was however no questionof unilateral action by the Government to restrain prices,particularly in the public sector, unless the TUC was prepared tooffer something on pay which at present they were unable to deliver.Ctetionary There was also broad support for continuing the present policy on11 discretionary action against the companies who broke the payguidelines.    The purpose of the sanctions policy was to create amoral climate in which the main penalty on such a company was lossof reputation.    It seemed likely that it was this which hurt the Fordmanagement much more than the direct financial consequences ofthe Government&apos;s action.    To call this a sanctions policy was amisnomer:  the policy involved the Government in using its ownundoubted discretionary powers to determine the avocation of public funds, and the terms on which Government financial support would bemade available.    The French and American Governments operatedvery similar policies.    However, the Confederation of BritishIndustry&apos;s (CBI) main objection to the policy lay precisely in this:the American Government used its powers to support a much wider range of Government policies than counter-inflation alone,    and the cbi feared a similar extension in this country.    The present policy was necessary, to demonstrate the Governments even-handednessbetween the public and private sectors.    It would be unfair to act onthe public sector alone.    On the other hand the policy was difficult9
to apply uniformly between different private companies because ofdiffering circumstances, and the Government18 actions were open tomisrepresentation and abuse.    Part of the difficulty stemmed fromthe absence of a Government majority..    When the situationpermitted it would be sensible to re-examine all of the optionsincluding that of operating the policy on a statutory basis. there might be some advantage in saying this publicly though not duringthe day&apos;s debate.    Meanwhile, the Cabinet&apos;s endorsement of thepolicy remained subject to the outcome of that debate.It was argued that there was great public and Labour Party concern about the problem of the low paid, which would increase as the factsbecame more widely known.    The small concession on low pay madeby the Government in the White Paper &quot;Winning the Battle against inflation&quot; would have very little real impact, particularly if measuredafter tax.    Ar unforced concession by the Government at this stage would widen support for the pay policy and demonstrate its fairness.Failure to do so would allow negotiators to masquerade as championsof the low-paid.    The concession proposed by the Secretary of Statefor Employment in his memorandum (CP(78) 126) would benefit5^ million people now earning between  14. 50 and  60 a week; itwould be equitable as between men and women who would be covered in almost equal numbers;  it would fall fairly between the public andthe private sectors;   in the public sector it would benefit inparticular groups Huch as nurses who commanded wide public support;but the effect on the totr.1 wages bill would be small, around 0.1 percent, even if it were fully taken up.    It would have no knock-oneffect, did not narrow money differentials and would affect percentagedifferentials only very slightly.    It was wrong to suggest that paypolicy had compressed differentials generally;  this was only true atthe top of the income range.    Such compression as had taken placein recent years reflected a wide range of differing factors, includingthe relative shortage at some periods of unskilled and semi-skilled workers and their improved negotiating position.    Pay policy playedonly a small part in this.    Earlier rounds of pay policy had howeverincluded a special element to benefit the low paid.    It had only beenpossible to make a very small concession in the present round. TheGovernment would gain great credit for putting forward such aproposition at this stage, and the TUC would find it hard to challengethe proposal.    If it were made immediately, the proposal mightease the climate in the local authority negotiations.    Against this,it was argued that there had been no support from the TUC for such proposals in the past.    The emphasis in all current negotiations wasupon the re-establishment of differentials.    Some negotiators hadalready indicated that any concession on the low paid would have to beextended throughout the pay range.    The Government would weakenits own pay policy and gain nothing in return by making a unilateralconcession at this stage.    Moreover it would undermine the position10
of the local authority negotiators, who had just put forward an offerwith the Governments support.    It would be disruptive to introduce a new element into the negotiations at this stage.    Even if the policy were modified in this sense, the private sector would not necessarily be able to take advantage of the change.    This would introduce afurther distinction between the public and private sectors. Therewas no need for an immediate decision.    The proposal should therefore stand over until a later stage, when the Cabinet could takestock of the course of the local authority negotiations.^Parability        There was general agreement that the Government should make no fresh cert move on comparability at this stage.    There were gravedangers in extending the principle of comparability still further.As applied at present, it put the Civil Service into an especiallyprivileged position which was greatly resented, in some quarters.Against this it was argued that there was a case for extendingcomparability across other parts of the public sector, providedcomparisons were made with precise outside analogues, and notto past pay relativities, and provided that the comparisons took account of the amount of work done as well as of its nature. Itmight, moreover, be sensible to consider the amalgamation of theexisting independent pay review bodies, and of the Civil service pay Research Unit, into a new organisation which would ensureuniformity of treatment and provide a single point to which compara-bility claims could be referred without the need to establish newad hoc review bodies.    Proposals of this kind had already been made,and officials of all the Departments concerned should now examine themcarefully, and the Ministers concerned should meet to consider these possibilities early in the New Year.er It was noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the otherft th^0116 negotiating Ministers would welcome early talks with the TUC oncee TUC the Economic Committee was prepared to meet them.It was noted that the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection had continued his discussions with the CBI on these clauses, but that there were no fresh developments requiringdecision by Cabinet.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said the cabinet had agreed that it could not relax in the battle against inflation. Theabsence of agreement with the TUC made this harder, but providedno excuse for evading the issue.    It was important that theGovernment should tell the truth about the consequences of excessive
pay settlements, and should not conceal the facts.     It should do everything possible to keep public opinion in support of the policy.In particular all Ministers, and not just those immediately concerned,should make pay policy a regular theme in speeches and public statements.    The Cabinet were not prepared to change their policy,for example, over prices, when the TUC had nothing to offer on pay.When the debate on sanctions was out o2 the way efforts should bemade to clarify the nature and intentions of sanctions policy.    It wasnot intended primarily to penalise companies which breached paypolicy but as an indication of public disfavour and a warning to others.It would in any case be wrong to hold back on pay in the public sector,and to use the proceeds of taxation, some of which came from the low paid, to finance companies which supported inflationary settlements.If the Government were to operate an effective pay policy in the public sector they must show their attitude to private sector settlements veryclearly.    The Government might at a later stage indicate that theywould consider placing the sanctions policy on a statutory basis once a parliamentary majority was available to them.    On low pay, therewas no need for an immediate decision.    The proposals put forward by the Secretary of State for Employment should be kept in reserve,without prejudice, in case a situation developed in which they could be deployed usefully.    The Secretary of State for the Environment, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, should consider whethera settlement could be reached in the water industry within pay policywhich took account of the result of past settlements.    The Chancellorof the Exchequer should arrange for officials from all the Departmentsconcerned to consider urgently the possibility of establishing some new public sector compirability machinery, and for these proposals to be considered by FY(P) with a view to a report early in the New Year.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet office November 197812
