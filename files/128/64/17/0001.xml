The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the^ House of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it was important to ensure a goodattendance of Government supporters for the debate on the SecondReading of the Public Lending Rights Bill.    This would be the firstBill of the new Parliamentary Session and an important government measure:  the closure, if needed, must not be left at risk.    The Billshould have general support in the Parliamentary Labour Party, but some concern had been expressed about the position of relatives ofauthors who were dead;  this aspect should be dealt math by theGovernment spokesmen in the debate.The Cabinet -Took note.Kj^g 2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY,reporting on the situation in Iran, said that we had learned that the shah had decided that the present Prime Minister must go and intendedto replace him by Mr Entezam, an elderly politician with good*viQlj credentials who had been dismissed by the Shah in the past owing to adisagreement over oil policy.    The Shah hoped that Mr Entezam wouldu 1&apos; 31stbe able to form a coalition Government possibly including the NationaliHio&quot;*ot Front, whose terms of reference would be to hold elections as soon as&apos; possible, to press on with the anti-corrupt!on campaign and to takewhatever measures were necessary to save the country.     If theNational Front refused to co-operate it would be clear that they aimedto bring the monarchy to an end.    The Shah was under strong pressure from the military to take over the Government, but he believed thatthis would provide no solution to his country1 e problems.    In all his consultations with us, the Shah had never varied in his view that thepolicy of liberalisation and early elections was the right way forward.His decision to put the military into the oil fields had been taken underpressure of events.    There were signs that some of the workers were ready to go back and if they did it might be possible, with the backingof the military, to get the oil flowing again.    Our economic commit-ments in Iran, including defence contracts, were immense.    It waspossible that under a military regime our commercial interests mightnot suffer too severely, but we should come under strong pressure todissociate ourselves from such a regime, particularly over the supplyof military equipment.    It was very difficult to see far ahead. the shah could fall tomorrow.    From the point of view of our interests itwas difficult to see a better alternative to the Shah.    But if he survivedhe was likely to have to operate in very different circumstances in thefuture and more as a constitutional monarch.    There were some
encouraging signs in that the middle ground in the political scene wasbeginning to feel that the swing against the Shah&apos;s regime had gone too far and were alarmed at the extremism of the opposition.    His view was that, on balance, the Shah had a chance of surviving.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that a vital concern for us was the future of oil supplies.    He had learned that the oil companies were introducing a rationing scheme of their own and he had told British Petroleum that he would wish to be consulted in advance ofany decisions to reduce supplies to the United Kingdom.    He did not want to be dog-in-the-manger about this, but there were important implications for us.    For example, the question arose whether the oil companies intended to give South Africa her pro rata share of supplies.The oil industry emergency committee had been activated and in his view it was arguable that the British National Oil Corporation should be inthe chair.    The important thing was that decisions on distributionshould not be left to the oil companies.    In a situation of shortage the spot oil prices would go up and we could not afford to run the risk of oil companies diverting supplies from the United Kingdom because theywere offered better prices elsewhere.    He was concerned about thepossible inclusion of the National Front in the new Government:  if theywere to join he hoped there would be no risk of compromises beingmade which might result in pressures on us similar to those which weexperienced at the time of Abadan.THE PRIME MINISTER said that if the Shah were to be overthrown hewould almost certainly be replaced by a regime which would be far lessattractive.    For example, a military Government would not pursue thesame liberalising policy as the Shah was trying to do.    The foreign and Commonwealth Secretary had been right to make this point publicly.On the other hand we need not give the impression that the Shah&apos;sregime could be regarded as democratic in our terms:  nor would it doeither the Shah or Her Majesty&apos;s Government any good if we becamelabelled as his sponsor.    The Foreign and Commonwealth secretary had avoided these dangers.    The Secretary of State for Energy had raised the question of oil and it was clearly necessary to keep a closewatch on what tae oil companies were doing.    At present our own oil stocks were high, amounting he understood to some 90 days&apos; consump-tion.     Ministers would wish to consider all the implications of possible developments in Iran and a committee of officials had been setup under Cabinet Office chairmanship to produce a report on this by theend of the following week.    This would be considered in the first placeby the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy.    As regardsproposals for the military industrial complex there was no need for animmediate decision, and the Secretary of State for Industry should delayfurther action pending discussion in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy.2
The Cabinet -Took note.pJ$0ty 3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of StatepVlcg for the Home Department (CP(78) 116) to which was attached a note on proposals for an inquiry into the prison service.    They also had beforethem notes ietting out a revised text of the draft statement at appendix A to CP(78) 116 and a note about the pay of prison officers.anfoilTHE HOME SECRETARY said that the background to the presenttroubles within the prison service were set out in the note attached to cp(78) 116.    There were long-term problems stemming from shortageof resources, poor conditions, chronic overcrowding, and the changingcharacter of the prison population.    The latest review of prison officers&apos; pay and conditions of service had taken place 20 years ago.More recent problems had arisen from increasing militancy on the partof staff:  in a number of establishments prison officers had preventedother staff from working and had excluded legitimate visitors, andeven more seriously they had refused to escort prisoners to court orto admit prisoners from the courts on remand.    Action of this kind,disrupting the work of the courts and the police, did not have thebacking of the Prison Officers&apos; Association (POA) but the POA now had little control over its members.    The problems  so far, thoughserious, were still localised and on   a relatively small scale; butthere was a real likelihood that trouble would escalate in the next fewdays unless the Government took action.    He believed the announcementof an inquiry would prevent that escalation from taking place, butcontingency plans were being made.    The draft statement which was before the Cabinet did not include the terms of reference of the inquirywhich would need discussion with the staff associations;  but it didindicate the ground that the inquiry would be expected to cover andspecifically included pay.    He recognised that, in their discussion onthe previous evening, his colleagues in the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Strategy Sub-Committee on Pay Negotiations (EY(P)) had considered that an inquiry covering pay would be damaging to paypolicy, but without such a reference there could be no hope that the inquiry would achieve its purpose.    The aim would be to link pay withother matters in such a way that any increases would be in the context of a wider reform and reorganisation of the work of prison officers.The inquiry would need also to cover the position of administrative staff who were members of general Civil Service grades:  this would need to be made clear to them if they were to continue to give their support in the event of industrial action by the prison officers. the inquiry would take some time to complete - the Edmund-Davies Reporton police had taken eight months - and the results might not be
available until some time after the prison officers1 annual settlementdate on 1 April 1979.    The officers would then expect any increases tobe backdated to that date and he would need to deal with this aspect inreply to questions following the announcement of the inquiry.    He soughtcolleagues&apos; approval to announce an inquiry on the lines he proposed.In discussion it was argued that in addition to setting up an inquiry theGovernment needed to act rapidly to restore discipline and reassertestablished authority within the prison service.    Some of the action taken by prison officers appeared to be in breach of the law and this inparticular had to be dealt with firmly and immediately.    Due warning should be given, but there should then be no hesitation in takingdisciplinary action wherever appropriate.    Such action would havepublic support and would be fully justified once the inquiry had beenestablished.It was generally recognised that the announcement would need to include a reference to pay, but it was argued that the terms proposed placedtoo much emphasis on this aspect.    The references to the White Paper(Cmnd 7293), and in particular to paragraphs 15 and     on the provisions for exceptional treatment, would be especially damaging.    There was nobasis on which the prison officers could properly be considered as aspecial case in those terms:  if they were it would be hard to denysimilar treatment to other Civil Service groups.    Even if thesereferences were omitted, the inquiry would be seen as further evidencethat the Government were ready to yield to pressure from its ownemployees whilst urging a tough line in local government and the private sector.    It would also be widely repercussive in the public servicebecause of the links between prison officers&apos; and Civil Service paygenerally;  and because of the inclusion within the POA of nurses in thespecial hospitals and their links with the National Health Service nurseswho were already pressing for treatment as a special case.    The pay ofprison officers did not on the face of it compare at all badly with that ofother groups, including the police who would demand further increasesif the case were conceded.    In their evidence to the inquiry theDepartments concerned should ensure that the position was made clear and the comparisons were explained.    There could be no question atthis stage of giving any forward commitment on implementation of therecommendations on pay, partly on general grounds of pay policy butalso because they would need to be considered in the context of therecommendations as a whole.    There could similarly be no promiseon retrospection.    The aim should be, if possible, to have the inquirycompleted in time for the results to be available before the main CivilService settlement for 1 April 1979 had been reached so that its application to prison officers and the recommendations of the inquirycould be considered simultaneously, preferably within the Whitleymachinery.    The Chairman of the inquiry should therefore be asked tocomplete the report within about five months.    The difficulties of keeping to that timetable might be reduced if the membership were keptsmall.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Home Secretary should announce later that day the setting up of an inquiry into the prison services in the UnitedKingdom, giving a brief description of its scope and including a reference to pay as one of a number of matters to be investigated.There should be no commitment on implementation or retrospection andno reference to the White Paper.    The announcement would make clearthat a report would be expected urgently;  that disruptive action couldnot be allowed;  and that with the establishment of the inquiry all staff would be expected to work normally and to present their case to the inquiry in due course.    The Home Secretary should revise his draft statement on these lineB and agree it with the Secretary of State forScotland, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, the Lord privy seal and the Secretary of State for Prices and Consumer Protection.The terms of reference of the inquiry should be considered by EY(P)before they were announced, and in considering its composition theHome Secretary and the Secretaries of State for Scotland and for northern Ireland should take account of the need for it to reach rapidconclusions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited the HomeSecretary to be guided accordingly.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP(78) 106) suggesting themes which might portray and inform the Government&apos;s objectives and policies and dealing also withhow the presentation of these themes might be better co-ordinated.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had a heavy agenda tocomplete and that there was insufficient time for a proper discussionof the paper which he had circulated.    In any case there was no urgencyfor such a discussion.    It might be better to defer consideration of thepaper until the Cabinet could consider it in the context of work on theLabour Party&apos;s next Manifesto, possibly at a weekend meeting at chequers.The Cabinet -Took note.
Actionslte 4 and&apos;0Mu 34th5. In further consideration of the handling of the Bingham report and the forthcoming Parliamentary debates on The Queen&apos;s Speech,the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Prime Minister(CP(78) 91) on the possibility of a further inquiry and a note by thePrime Minister (CP(78) 94) to which was attached a note by the attorney General containing his conclusions on a preliminary reportfrom the Director of Public Prosecutions.    The Cabinet also had beforethem a minute of 19 October 1978 from the Secretary of State for Energyto the Prime Minister.THE PRIME MINISTER said that following the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on28 September decisions had now to be taken on how the debate on rhodesia should be handled and whether the Government would wish torecommend to the House any form of further inquiry following theBingham Report.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL recalled that it had been hoped that the Rhodesian situation and the issues raised by the BinghamReport could be debated by the House of Commons within the debate onThe Queen&apos;s Speech and without the need for a separate and specificMotion on either subject.    Two days had been allocated for this debatewith the Motion for the renewal of the Rhodesia Sanctions Order beingtaken in a short separate debate at the end of the second day. TheOpposition had however now indicated that it would be their intention tomove an amendment to the normal Motion on The queen s Speech whichwould be criticial of the Government and possibly of the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.    There would therefore need to be a vote onthat amendment as well as a vote on the renewal of the Sanctions Order.The two -day debate would begin on Tuesday 7 November and under the procedures of the House the opening speaker for the Government wouldbe immediately followed by an Opposition speaker (Mr Pym) movingtheir amendment.    This would then be debated for the remainder ofTuesday and on Wednesday with the vote on the amendment taking place at 10. 00 pm.    There would then be up to one-and-a-half hours for debate on the Sanctions Order followed, if necessary, by a vote on that Order.He suggested that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should open for the Government before the Opposition moved the amendment Motionand that he should also wind up at the end of the second day, if thePrime Minister did not wish to speak himself.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary could speak twice in this way, because on thesecond occasion he would be speaking against the Opposition^ amend -ment.    The Attorney General&apos;s speech on the implications of theBingham Report and the various possibilities for a further inquirycould be slotted in early on the second day.    It would also be possible on the second day for the Minister of State, Foreign and commonwealth office  (Mr Rowlands), to speak on the Rhodesian situation.
In discussion consideration was first given to whether the Governmentshould give a clear lead on a further inquiry during the debate orwhether the House should be told that the Government would considerthe matter further in the light of the debate.    There was wide support for the view that it would be desirable to avoid a commitment to afurther inquiry before the views of Parliament had been tested in debate, but it was argued that no final decision on this should be taken before the discussion within the Parliamentary Labour Party (PLP) duethat evening.    On substance it was argued that a further inquiry wouldnot reveal any significant new facts.    It would mainly sit in politicaljudgment of previous Governments.     This was a point which theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary should make strongly to the PLPthat evening and, as necessary, in the debate in the House.    He shouldalso emphasise the thorough way in which the Bingham Report hadalready explored the facts of the situation.    While no commitment to anew inquiry should be given to the PLP it should be made clear that theGovernment had not decided against such an inquiry but would reservejudgment until the Parliamentary debate had been concluded.In further discussion of the form of any inquiry which might be instituted it was argued that the Government might not in the event need to come to a positive conclusion.    It could for example leaveMr English, Chairman of the General Sub-Committee of theExpenditure Committee, to pursue his idea of an investigation by theExpenditure Committee.In yet further discussion it was suggested that a serious situation could arise if the Order renewing Rhodesian sanctions were rejected by theHouse of Lords.    If this happened, however, sanctions could be renewed under the United Nations Act - a procedure which would not require an Affirmative Resolution and could not be rejected by a negative one.    The resulting arrangements would not be so comprehensive-sive a&amp; those in the Sanctions Order proper but would still giveextensive coverage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet noted the revised arrangements for the debate.    They were agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary should open forthe Government.    His speech should emphasise that any new inquiry would not be discussing new facts but would inevitably be sitting in political judgment on previous Administrations.    On the second day the attorney General should speak on the specific issues associated with afurther inquiry.    He should not lean too heavily against an inquiry eventhough it would be his duty to point to the pros and cons of each of the forms which an inquiry might take.    He himself did not plan to speakunless later developments required this.    The Foreign and commonwealth Secretary or the Minister of State, Foreicn and commonwealth Office (Mr Rowlands) would wind up for the Government,but a
decision on this could be taken at a later stage.   No other ministers should take part in the debate except, as occasion might require, theMinister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office (Mr Rowlands).The Cabinet agreed that no commitment to an inquiry should be made during the course of the debate.    They would reach decisions on thismatter in the light of Parliament1 s views as expressed in thediscussion with the PLP that evening and in the debates in parliament in the following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited the lord president of the Council, the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary and the Attorney General tobe guided accordingly.8
6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(78) 114) on the European Monetary System (EMS).v. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the issues beforek  Us the Cabinet were complex ones on which the experts were not agreed.F^7a?Ce: But there was a 8rowing feeling that unless there was a substantial^clu shift in the rigid German position in the coming weeks it would be a^ute8l0n8&apos; mistake for Britain to join the EMS.    Exchange rates had to reflecte ^ differences in rates of inflation, growth of money supplies and in economic performance.    Intervention by the authorities was only effective in smoothing out fluctuations caused by the irrationality ofthe market.    The resources of central banks were insignificant in comparison with the huge world overhang of freely-floating funds. Itwas impossible to have either a single European currency, or a fixedexchange rate system, without similarity in economic performancewhich did not prevail.    When the President of the Commission had made his new proposals for Economic and Monetary Union (EMU)virtually every major figure in Europe disagreed with him includingChancellor Schmidt.    It was only the inadequacy of United Statesmeasures to prevent the slide in the dollar which had 1ed to the proposalat the Copenhagen European Council for a European zone of monetarystability and a pooling of reserves.    This proposal was made withoutany significant consultation with central banks or Ministries of Finance.At the June Finance Council he had secured support for criteria for a successful scheme.    It must be durable;  be supported by adequatecredit facilities;  include all Community member states;  involve asymmetry of obligations as between strong and weak currencies;favour growth;  allow for changes in currency relationships; notdamage the dollar or world currency relationships;  and involve a transfer of resources from the rich to poor countries.    Only on thelast point had there been some German reservation.    These criteriawere not met by the existing joint European float (the so-called snake).The experience with the snake had been that it was not durable;countries which were not tied closely to Germany by trading and otherrelationships had to withdraw at an early stage and even those whichwere naturally a part of a deutschmark zone had frequently to realigntheir parties.     One of the reasons for this was that holders of balancesregarded the deutschmark but not other snake currencies as a naturalcurrency of refuge from the dollar.    The other countries in the snakehad to use their reserves in order to help to keep the deutschmarkwithin its margins;  the Germans themselves had to undertake amassive intervention of 10 billion deutschmarks between July and the october realignment.    This had led to doubts in German bankingcircles about the merits of staying in the snake, and a fortiori of extending Germany&apos;6 role.    The chances that Germany would agree tomake the changes in the EMS that we should like to see were thereforesmall;  indeed at the October Finance Council they indicated they would wish to halve the 25 billion European Units of Account credit backing
for the scheme.    At the November Finance Council he proposed tocontinue to press, in concert where possible with the French, Irish and italians, for a scheme which would be in line with our needs. these efforts however were unlikely to be met with success.    There was a chance that Italy would not join if we did not.    The Irish would however probably be induced to join by offers of resource transfers,and this would give rise to major difficulties, including those ofexchange control.    French policy was being determined solely by president Giscard who was keen to join in spite of the advice from theBank of France and his Minister of Finance.    If we were the onlycountry not to join, sterling might come under pressure;  in view ofthis in the coming weeks we should have to give careful considerationto the handling of our domestic economic policy and to negotiationswithin the Community.In discussion it was suggested that the Chancellor of the exchequer had correctly identified the formidable problems involved in an EMS.The proposals as they were emerging would do nothing to deal effectively with the threat to international currency stability and might indeed further undermine the dollar.    They would on.&apos;y work if theywere deflationary.    The EMS would not help create the stability andgrowth of the 1950s and 1960s which had depended on the dominance ofUnited States, with its stable currency and deficit on capital account.The present turbulent conditions were not right for a sustainablesystem;  in practice, when faced with downward pressure, we shouldhave to use large amounts of reserves to maintain a parity higher than was justified.    The motive behind the Giscard-Schmidt proposalsseemed to be to increase Franco-German dominance in Europe. TheEMS was indeed less workable than full EMU.    A scheme whichcollapsed could do great damage to Europe, and attitudes to theCommunity, especially in this country.    The argument that we shouldhave greater influence from within an EMS than from outside was unlikely to be true since our economy was likely to remain relativelyweak.    Any commitment at the European Council should be adreferendum to the Cabinet and to Parliament.    For a country to give up its freedom to fix its exchange rate would seriously undermine theGovernments ability to respond to economic events.On the other hand, it was argued that the real choice was between beingisolated in the present collapsing world monetary system, which had adeflationary/inflationary bias, and was leading the world economy intocrisis and slump, and the admittedly imperfect EMS which was a move in the direction of reducing monetary instability.    The EMS wouldprovide orderly means of making parity changes whereas changes inparities at present were much larger than could be explained byrational factors.    Italy, Ireland and France had worse inflation than ourselves but nonetheless they appeared to think that they might havea better chance within the EMS.    If the EMS should proceed without us
and endure, dollar holders would diversify into EMS currencies, whichwas likely to mean that the United States would negotiate with the EMScountries and we should lose our influence.    The character of the EMSwould be different if our influence was being exerted from within.Moreover our power to influence the Common Agricultural Policy andthe Community budget would be much reduced.The situation which would arise if the Irish Republic entered without us and the link between the Irish pound and sterling was broken would bevery serious for banking and trade contracts and for everyday cashtransactions;  40 per cent of the currency circulating in NorthernIreland was Irish.    The policing of exchange controls would be extremely difficult.    The break could also damage the GovernmentsNorthern Ireland policy and add weight to proposals for the permanenttotal integration of Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom.    If it wasdecided to stay out, it would be desirable to try to persuade the Irish to stay out too.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be unwise to take any decision until we knew whether or not we were likely *o be isolated.The Prime Minister&apos;s forthcoming meeting with Signor Andreotti wouldbe crucial.    It was by no means clear that a final decision would betaken at the European Council in December, and in this event there might be opportunities to put the EMS discussion into a wider context.It was important, both for the effect on the market and our stance inEurope, that our decision was seen to be taken on the basis of a soberassessment and with a sound justification of the policies we intended to pursue.    We should continue to negotiate and try to make the scheme asviable as possible.    If our doubts about the scheme proved to have beenunfounded, it was important that we should have left the door open to beable to join at a later stage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had noted the Chancellor of the Exchequers view that unlessthe German position could be shifted in the coming weeks he could notadvise his colleagues that Britain should join the EMS.    It waspremature however for the Cabinet to reach a decision at the present stage.    There was no objection in principle to a European zone of monetary stability provided our criteria were met and provided it wasnot to the detriment of the world monetary system.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer should continue to negotiate within the frameworkpreviously agreed.    The Cabinet would resume their discussionprobably after the meeting of the Finance Council on 20 November and before the European Council meeting on 4 December.    They would thenneed to consider not only whether or not to join the EMS at the outsetbut the handling of the situation if we decided not to join and the optionfor joining later.    In the meantime no impression should be given thatthe Government was likely to take an early decision since this couldaffect our negotiating position.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer who
was to give oral evidence to the Expenditure Committee on the following day would do so in a neutral way:  the extent to which ParliamentaryCommittees were seeking to involve themselves in future policy decisions of the Government was disturbing and he would considerwhether it was necessary to give guidance to Ministers who might becalled to appear before them.    He would arrange for furtherconsideration to be given to the special problems which would be created if the Irish Republic and the United Kingdom took differentdecisions on the EMS.    The Lord President of the Council would give further consideration to the question of a debate in Parliament whichmight most appropriately take place between 20 November and4 December.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited the lord president of the Council and the Chancellor of theExchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office2 November 1978
