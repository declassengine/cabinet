Ut. MINISTERS^TING WITH^SIDENT KAUNDAeast1. THE PRIME MINISTER said he had received a message from President Kaunda of Zambia on 19 September expressinggrave concern about recent developments in relation to southern africa and suggesting that he would need very shortly to take aserious decision on the direction of his own future policy. the message ended with an invitation to the Prime Minister to meetPresident Kaunda in Zambia on 22 September.    The Prime ministers aid that in view of the emotional terms in which the message wascouched and the obvious gravity of the decision which PresidentKaunda believed he would have to face, which might have majorconsequences for us, he had thought it right to telephonePresident Kaunda and accept the proposal for a meeting.    But hehad thought it prudent that this should not take place in southern africa where he might find difficulty in avoiding proposals for meetings with other African leaders.    He had therefore suggestedKano in Nigeria, as a suitable location.    President Kaunda had agreed and the Nigerian Government had readily accepted theproposal.    He would be leaving for Nigeria with the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary on the morning of 22 September after ameeting at London Airport with Prime Minister Begin of Isreal.It was evident that President Kaunda was in an emotional state,and his main objective would be to prevent him taking some drastic action which would not be in Zambia1 s interests and would damageUnited Kingdom/ Zambian relations.    He would be in a position tooffer him some additional loan aid but other very difficult questionscould arise, for example if President Kaunda asked for military assistance if attacked.    He would bring back any major issue for decision by the Cabinet but he hoped his colleagues would allow himsome discretion in what was bound to be a very difficult discussion.The Cabine t -Took note, with approval, of the statement bythe Prime Minister.2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Cabinet would have seen the published reports of the camp David talks and the texts of the agreements reached. Oneof the most crucial problems encountered in these talks was thefuture of the Israeli settlements.    This was a very delicateproblem for Prime Minister Begin of Israel and the proposal towithdraw the settlements from Sinai was dependent on a vote inthe Knesset.    Hopefully the Knesset would agree, but Mr, Beginwas now also arguing that his undertaking to establish no newsettlements on the West Bank was limited to the three month periodof further negotiations, and there did indeed seem to be someambiguity about the understanding that had been reached on this.
As regards the rest of the agreement the demilitarisation packagewas a sensible one, as was the acceptance of a United Nations insteadof an Israeli force in Gaza.    The agreement had cleared the way for negotiation of a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel.    This wouldbe a considerable achievement which would reduce the danger of a major war in the Middle East.    While therefore we should prefer a comprehensive settlement, we should support a separate treaty between Israel and Egypt if President Sadat concluded that this wasthe only option open to him.    It would however split the Arab world and would probably make President Sadat of Egypt vulnerable tosubversion within Egypt.    Nevertheless, President Sadat could rely on support in his own country where there was a general feeling that egypt had been required to pay too high a price for maintaining Arabsolidarity.    In Israel, there was also strong support for the bilateral agreement.    But it would be necessary to keep up pressure on the Israelies to show greater flexibility on the problem of settlements andon the future of the West Bank.    It was at least encouraging that theidea had been accepted that the existing settlements on the West Bankshould not be maintained as separate Israeli security enclaves but should become part of the wider arrangements for the territory.Another key problem was the attitude of King Hussein of Jordan.Although it was too much to hope at thib stage that he could be broughtopenly to support the idea of bilateral negotiations between Egypt and israel, we could at least hope that he would not publicly condemnthem and would maintain contact with Egypt with a view possibly tojoining in later.    His problem was that if he were to join he wouldbe fully committed and there would be no possibility of going back.He would therefore wish to be confident that the negotiations would succeed.    Our assessment was that Israel had shown enoughflexibility to justify some move by King Hussein and we were sayingthis to him privately.    He would probably accept that Israel had shown some flexibility, but maintain that this did not yet go far enoughto justify any movement on his part.    The position of President Asadof Syria showed slight signs of improvement in that it now looked as though he would be prepared to meet the United States Secretary ofState, Mr Vance.    In general there was no doubt that our interestlay in supporting the United States despite the difficulties which the camp David agreements might lead to in the Arab world.    It had beeninteresting to note that in the discussion in the Community of the camp David agreements the French had shown a greater degree of support for the United States position than previously.    In sum itcould be said that the Sadat initiative was now back on course, whereasa few months ago it had looked like collapsing.THE PRIME MINISTER said he agreed with this assessment. Hehad thought earlier in the year that there was a possibility of a breakdown and even of the outbreak of hostilities in the Middle East.This danger had now been averted as a result of the Camp David talks.He had noted that there were several points in the agreement which we2
had previously discussed separately with Prime Minister Begin and president Sadat but which they had rejected at the time. Theserepresented distinct advances.    But there might be trouble over thePalestinians who, under the Camp David agreement, could not look toan independent state but would have to maintain a link with Jordan.On the question of settlements, the recent American dismay atPrime Minister Begin1 s statements could have been due tomisunderstanding of the position which was far from clear as set outin the documents on the Camp David talks.    So far as we were concerned we should support the view that no new settlements shouldbe established during the period of negotiations and that the questionof the future of the settlements should be resolved in the negotiationsthemselves.    The Camp David agreement represented a major successfor President Carter.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.BlA3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said^tevi that the South African Government&apos;s latest move on Namibia was a^efer   8 serious development.    After painstaking negotiations over the past^(7^nCe: months, it had looked as though we were on the point of securing^clu an aSreec* settlement.    Now instead of accepting the United Nations^^te^0118 Secretary General&apos;s report, the South Africans had said they intendedto go ahead with their own plans for organising elections in Namibia.These were likely to take place in November.    Although the SouthAfrican Government had claimed that they would be free elections onthe basis of one man one vote, and had offered to invite people from outside to supervise them, it would be very difficult to convince world opinion that the proposed elections were satisfactory as a test ofopinion.    A major objection was that Namibians who had been fightingfor independence outside the territory would probably be unable totake part.    Not many people were involved and 85 per cent of thevoters in the territory had already registered.    But whatever the merits of the arrangements made by the South African Government,it would be widely believed that the elections had been rigged. SouthAfrican troops would be much in evidence in the territory while theelection was taking place and the record of repression by the south africans was an appalling one.    Whatever the outcome it could beexpected that the liberation struggle by the South West AfricanPeople&apos;8 Organisation would continue.    The United Nations had notbeen faultless in their handling of the South African Government: forexample there had been no discussion with the South Africans about the size of the United Nations force.    But the South Africans had
deliberately taken a decision to flout United Nations opinion, knowingwhat the consequences might be.    He had been involved in discussionwith the South African Foreign Minister during the course of theprevious weekend and in a final effort had mooted the possibility of a personal visit to South Africa.    It had become clear that there wasno point in this.    Internal politics relating to the succession toMr Vorster as Prime Minister had played a major part in theSouth African decision.    There had always been some opposition tothe Namibian package in the South African Cabinet, led by the defence minister, who was one of the principal contenders for the succession.It might be possible to resolve this problem in time, though certainly not before the election of the new South African Prime Minister,which was due to take place on 28 September.    We were extremely unlikely however to have this time.    The West had already had tobring considerable pressure on President Neto of Angola and theother front Line Presidents to get them to go along with the packageand there was little chance of securing their support for further delay.    A meeting of the Security Council was due to take place on25 September.   He proposed that we should take the line that weendorsed the United Nations Secretary General&apos;s proposals and thatwe should go along with a provision that if they had not been put intoeffect by the South African Government within 28 days the united nations would have to take further action with a view to securing their implementation.    The minimum such action would probablybe a threat to       peace resolution against South Africa, which weshould try to ensure was related to Namibia alone rather than to south Africa generally.    Such a resolution, unlike one directed atSouth Africa generally, could be withdrawn when Namibia achievedindependence.    There would however be a call for sanctions againstSouth Africa, probably confined to oil in the first place.    The UnitedStates position was uncertain but if they were prepared to veto oilsanctions we should join them.    If however they did not veto weshould not do so alone.    We should leave the Americans to take the lead and decide how to play their hand.    While the Administrationmight be inclined to go along with oil sanctions there would be somestrong domestic pressures on them to exercise a veto.    It had to berecognised that an oil embargo would not in practice have a serious effect on South Afiica, at least for some considerable time, since theSouth Africans had sufficient oil stocks to meet their own requirements for two years and to enable them to supply Rhodesia.In discussion it was argued that if sanctions were proposed in the face of South African rejection of the United Nations proposals, weshould on no account exercise a veto.    Nor should we urge the americans to do so in face of this flagrant disregard by the south africans of United Nations views.    We had been moving towards a situation of this kind for a long time and we could not afford to appearto be condoning action by a right wing South African Government which4
flouted the views of the international community.    Indeed it was timeto review the basis on which the Government&apos;s policy of avoiding aconfrontation had rested.    We had believed that sanctions would notbe effective:  but was this right?    We had argued that we neededSouth African help over Rhodesia and Namibia:  but this had not beenforthcoming and would be even less so in the future.    We had argued that we could not afford damage to our economic interests in SouthAfrica:  but there was now a greater risk of damage to our widerinternational position.    Failure to support a call by the united nations for sanctions against South Africa would have a disaterous efect on our position in Africa and the rest of the third world, andwould be severely criticised in the Labour Party.    Indeed from thepolitical point of view it was arguable that we should take the lead onthe matter.On the other hand it was argued that such action would be gravelydamaging to our economic interests in terms both of our dependence on South Africa as a source of supply for important materials and because of the effect on our export trade, with implications for employment.    The Cabinet should in any case not embark on thiscourse, which would be bound to be ineffective, without full and careful consideration of all the relevant factors.    Despite the way in which the South Africans had treated the United Nations we wouldnot be justified in taking drastic action which would damage our ownprospects of securing South African support when we might need itin defence of our interests.    For example, if we had to carry out aprotected evacuation operation in Rhodesia it was hardly likely thatwe would be able to do it without South African co-operation. Weshould try to influence our partners to support us in resistingpressures for oil sanctions which would not hurt the South Africansand would not affect the situation in Namibia.    It was accepted thatour policy should be kept under review since the balance of advantagemight change but that the outcome of any reassessment could not bereached in time for a decision to be taken before the Security council meeting on 25 September.    The Americans were however likely to turn to us for an expression of views.    In the circumstances therewas advantage in leaving them to take the lead and to make up theirown minds.    All that was needed immediately was a decision whether we should work for a resolution supporting the United Nationsproposals which might be combined with a threat on the lines indicated by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.    If in due course a decision on sanctions was needed we should not veto if the americans did not.    But if we had to accept sanctions we should notenforce them until we saw what other industrialised countries, inparticular the United States, were doing to give effect to them.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that as inthe past we faced a situation where a decision either way would havedamaging effects on our interests.    If we were to veto a sanctionsresolution our relations with African and other third world countries would suffer, while if we supported sanctions our economic interestsin South Africa, which were of major importance to us, would suffer.This was a subject which had frequently been discussed in theMini sterial Group on Southern Africa and he would arrange for the relevant papers to be circulated for the information of those members of the Cabinet who were not members of that Group. TheForeign and Commonwealth Secretary had warned them that the choicemight have to be made soon.    In the end political considerationsmight have to override economic ones, but the Cabinet needed more time and there was grave danger in rushing in to a decision. TheSouth Africans had flouted the United Nations1 wishes on a flimsypretext but the United Nations had not behaved well in their handling of the South African Government.    The Foreign and commonwealth secretary should not take the lead in this matter but should work fora solution which left more time for both the Americans and south africans to reflect on their position.    We should support a resolution in the Security Council endorsing the United Nations proposals and,if necessary, could go along with a provision which set a deadline of28 days within which the South African Government should comply.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to be guided accordingly.3. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinetto arrange for appropriate GEN 12 papers oneconomic links with South Africa to be circulated for the information of the Cabinet.4.

DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NO40CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 4Thursday 21 September 1978 at 10. 30 amItjj -----PtC^S^&quot; *^he Cabinet had before it a memorandum by the Prime Minister^    N^ (CP(78) 91) setting out the considerations which should govern thei\y^ Cabinet&apos;s decision on the question of a further inquiry into Rhodesiansanctions following the Bingham Report, and the form such an inquirymight take.THE PRIME MINISTER said that in his paper he had attempted to setout the alternatives which the Cabinet should consider.    A fresh inquiry would reveal few further facts, but would be directed to the part played by those who had been concerned in successive Administrations in thesequestions.    Press speculation had concentrated on the question whetherthe Government, and in particular the previous Prime Minister, hadknown that oil from British companies was reaching Rhodesia.    But thiswas not the real issue.    The question was whether successive governments had pursued these matters properly.    This was a matterof political and moral judgment, not solely one of fact.    He was opposedto an inquiry, and would prefer to leave these matters to the judgment of history.    But Parliament might nevertheless insist on a further inquiry.If so, what form should this take?    These were essentially matters ofpolitical judgment, not suited to a Tribunal composed of judges orlawyers.    Nor were they appropriate to a Select Committee whichwould tend to divide on Party lines.    Without access to the papers of previous Administrations, such an inquiry would not be able to reach a considered judgment but there were serious objections to making suchpapers available to either a Tribunal or a Select Committee. Onesolution would be to make them available to members of the inquiry onPrivy Counsellor terms, but to avoid their publication.    An inquirymight therefore take the form of a Committee of Privy Counsellorsunder the chairmanship of someone like Lord Justice Scarman but withits other members drawn from political life.    It would of course benecessary, in choosing former Ministers, to avoid anyone who had beenin office at the relevant time but he suggested to the Cabinet two nameson the Labour side who might be suitable.    There was no need for the
Cabinet to reach a final conclusion that day.    His own forthcoming meeting with President Kaunda of Zambia would be sufficient justification for a delay.    But an early decision was needed before thereturn of Parliament, when the Opposition would seek every opportunityto exploit the situation.In discussion it was argued that it would not be possible to avoid afurther inquiry.    The House of Commons would require one, as it hadin the case of the Fay Report upon the Crown Agents.    Even if theofficial Opposition decided to support the Government in rejecting afurther inquiry, sufficient backbenchers on both sides might rebel to force the issue.    The Government would then be defeated in the mosthumiliating circumstances.    It would be better to offer an inquirystraightaway than to have one extorted.    There was considerable pressure in the media and within the Party for more knowledge. Itwould be healthier if the full story were investigated.    United Statesexperience had shown that in the end this was the best course. TheGovernment would not come out badly from such an inquiry.    It wouldbe possible to demonstrate that the decisions taken in 1967 and 1968 hadbeen in the best interests of the British economy and of a peaceful settlement.    It was important to demonstrate the size and complexity of the issues which had been involved in these decisions.    This might prove a useful background to any further Government action which might prove necessary on sanctions in the near future.    An inquiry would stop the present stream of innuendo, which damaged the Government ratherthan the Opposition.    To refuse one would be presented as a cover-upoperation.    Against this, it was argued that such an inquiry would comeat a particularly bad time.    It would last for many months and lead to a constant stream of so-called new revelations.    The witnesses would include former members of the Government, who had no interest incontaining the damage this would bring.    The more the composition and procedure of such an inquiry were considered, the stronger seemed thearguments against it.    For example, it would be asked why theGovernment had decided not to prosecute oil companies for breach of sanctions at that time.    Those Ministers who had been involved then,including the Attorney General at the time, might be asked to give evidence on these points.In further discussion there was wide support for the view that a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons would be an unsatisfactory form of inquiry.    It would be difficult for the Government to control.    It wouldbe unable to compel the attendance of former Ministers now in the Houseof Lords without the consent of that House.    It would be free to pursuelines of inquiry which would tend to inhibit prosecution for sanction-breaking, unless witnesses were allowed to refuse to answer questionswhich would incriminate them.    A Royal Commission on the lines suggested in the Prime Minister&apos;s paper, or a special Commission suchas that which had investigated the Dardanelles Campaign in 1917, might
be more appropriate.    An inquiry comprising Privy Counsellors mightnot necessarily carry the necessary authority or conviction. Thosechosen would have to be men of great integrity and standing. MostPrivy Counsellors on the Labour side had been Ministers at the relevant time and those who had not been Ministers were either old or would carry insufficient conviction.    If the Privy Counsellors were drawn from the two majority Parties, the whole affair might seem toocosy.    If membership were expanded to include some of the minorityParties who had no experience of office, the inquiry might become too large and unmanageable, and too like a Select Committee.    Indeed if itwere thought essential to broaden the Parliamentary base of the inquiry,it might be necessary to reconsider the suggestion of an independent chairman drawn from the Judiciary.    Alternatively, the membershipcould be even further extended to include distinguished figures outsidepolitics, perhaps from the Churches.In continued discussion it was pointed out that a further inquiry of thekind suggested by the Prime Minister would not necessarily role outprosecution of those against whom the Bingham inquiry had raised a prima facie case.    The problem would however arise if the inquirywished to question such people or indeed if other people felt they mightbe liable to incriminate themselves.    The Attorney General would therefore need to keep in close touch with the Chairman, so that if theproceedings began to pose a threat to future prosecution, he couldreconsider the question of immunity.    But it should not be necessaryto promise immunity from prosecution for all witnesses at thebeginning of the inquiry.The question of access to Cabinet documents was much more difficult.The volume of such documents was very large - 62 papers for the period1967-68 alone.    Disclosure to the inquiry would not necessarily meanpublication.    It would be harder to prevent a Select Committee from publishing Cabinet documents than it would be to retain control if the inquiry were carried out by a Commission or Tribunal.    However, theproduction of Cabinet documents would represent a major constitutional change.    It was also argued that the present Cabinet had no authority toprovide the papers of an earlier Administration, whether Labour orConservative.    It might be necessary to obtain the consent of formerPrime Ministers, or even of all living former members of the Cabinetconcerned.    It was not clear that the question of oil sanctions was sufficiently unique, or different from other major Government policy decisions (eg Suez or Northern Ireland) to justify this departure fromprecedent.    It would change the whole nature of Cabinet Government.Yet if Cabinet papers were not to be produced it seemed impossible tohave an inquiry.
In further discussion it was argued that early consultation would be needed with the official Opposition, and possibly with the minorityParties, before a decision was taken.    Before a final decision wastaken questions of terms of reference, composition and access todocuments needed to be examined more closely.    There was a case fordeferring a decision, while the implications of all these difficulties were allowed to sink in.    However the Government was under great pressure from the media, and from within the Parliamentary LabourParty.    It was desirable to defuse these anxieties.    Continuing silencecould be damaging, particularly since there had been no attempt as yet to defend the action taken by the Labour Government in 1967 and 1968.It was important to take and announce a decision if possible before theParty Conference.    Thereafter, a full meeting of the parliamentary labour Party once the House resumed would be very useful.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had reached no firm conclusion either on the need for an inquiryor on the form one should take.    They would resume their discussion the following week.    He would consider further the points which hadbeen made in discussion, including the nature of an inquiry if one were held, the extent of prior consultation which would be needed with theother political Parties, the question of the disclosure of cabinet documents (including the authorisation which might be needed fromformer Prime Ministers) and the line which might be taken inParliament if it were decided not to have a fresh inquiry.    It should bemade clear to the Press that the Cabinet had not reached a decision, andthat the matter would be further considered after his visit to president Kaunda.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office22 September 1978
