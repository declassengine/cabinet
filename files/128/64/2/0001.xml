^RLIAMENTARY1. Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.ro*ElGN)previous^erence::M(78)218t:0nclU8ions,2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatat the   meeting in Brussels on 14 June to discuss support for Zairethere was considerable unanimity on the need to attach firmconditions.    The provision of financial aid was made contingent on progress in introducing political and economic reforms. TheInternational Monetary Fund were in process of getting control overthe running of the main financial institutions.    There was little doubtthat the message had been put across firmly to President Mobututhat if he wanted support he would have to co-operate.    Whether hewould comply was another matter.    The Americans and French now appeared to have dropped the idea of a Pan-African force. Asregards Cuban intervention, as a result of the publicity about their activities in relation to the incursion into Shaba it seemed likely that over the next few months the Cubans would do all they could toavoid any further cross-border incidents.    They were concerned about the effect which reports of their involvement with the Katanganrebels in Angola was having on their non-aligned status. questions were already being raised by non-aligned countries about the suitability of Havana as the location for the non-aligned conferencedue to be held there next year.    By action taken so far, we had probably succeeded in buying time in Zaire.     Steady pressure on president Mobutu should ensure that the financial aid now offeredwould be used more constructively than had been the case in the past.But there could be no great confidence that further incuraiona intoShaba would not take place in the future.The Cabinet -Took note.Cabinet Office15 June 1978
