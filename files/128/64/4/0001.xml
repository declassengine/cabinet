A^A^sIENTARY    l&apos; The Cabinet were informed of toe business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.Bill THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the PrimeMinister, the Lord President of the Council and he had seenefer   8 Mr Pardoe, the Liberal Party spokesman, the previous day about^7^TiCe: Government1 s proposal for a 2.\ per cent surcharge on employers1Wi      tn National In 3urance contributions to make good the losses created by^ute *ons* Opposition amendments to the Finance Bill.    While Mr Pardoehimself had been prepared to accept a compromise of a Z\ per centsurcharge this year and \\ per cent next, he had failed to sell this to his Liberal Party colleagues.    There had therefore been no alternative for the Government but to accept \\ per cent for thisyear.    This would leave the Government with a shortfall of 140 million in making up the losses incurred on the Finance Bill,but the Liberals, with possibly two exceptions, would now supportthe Government and the vote could be carried.    He would wait tosee how the markets reacted before deciding whether and how to recoup the  140 million and would inform the Cabinet next week ifhe had proposals to bring forward.    He would however avoid any increase on prices.    Meanwhile, there was no immediate dangerof the gilt-edged market failing to meet the Government&apos;s borrowingrequirements.The Cabinet -1. Took note.Policy THE PRIME MINISTER said that his recent visit to the United states had provided a useful opportunity for him to meet leading figures in the American aircraft industry, to hear their views on theprospects of the various projects in which the United Kingdom might take part and on the issues involved, and to form his own impressions.Further discussions would now take place in the Ministerial group on Aircraft Policy (GEN 130).    He would have preferred decisions on the HS-146 and on whether British Airways should order the boeing 737 to be taken in the context of a longer term plan for theindustry, but the need for early decisions on the former wouldprobably not allow this.    The longer term issues would need to bediscussed with President Giscard d&apos;Estaing and Chancellor Schmidt,who were very vitally concerned about the future of the aircraft industry in Europe and who would like a partnership with theUnited Kingdom.    The interests of British Airways, BritishAerospace and Rolls-Royce were irreconcilable and whatever\
conclusions were reached, there was bound to be criticism fromthose who would be disappointed by them.    The Cabinet would havean opportunity to consider recommendations from GEN 130, and hewould make arrangements for interested Ministers who were not members of GEN 130 to be kept in touch as appropriate.vioUsenCe.The Cabinet -2. Took note.^Vl V\T^^^ 2. The Cabinet1 s discussion and the conclusions reached arek&amp;Qj^m recorded separately.^AHlS 3* THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat so far he did not know who had been responsible for the recent^esia massacre at Umtali.    Mr Mugabe had issued a specific denial ofresponsibility and the way in which the killing had been carried outJi no* resemb*e the normal action of the guerilla fighters. The^ereilc Zimbabwe African Nationalist Liberation Army had normallyC    B) 17 maintained good relations with the missionaries.    The possibilityu^Uaiojj that the Selous Scouts had been responsible could not be ruled out,^te 2   8* although   he did not think it likely.    There was also a hard headedgroup of Whites who might conceivably have been in some wayassociated for their own ends.    It seemed more probable that those responsible were guerilla fighters who were out of control.Whoever they were had evidently gone to ground in the country andhad not fled across the border.    We might never discover the fulltruth.    But it was in any case not possible to place responsibililityon Mr Mugabe as many people in the House of Commons had wantedhim to do.    The security situation in Rhodesia was deterioratingand there were many areas where the writ of the Salisbury regimedid not run.    This was especially apparent in the Trust Landswhere the security forces maintained no permanent presence. Ifthings got worse the only way in which Patriotic Front support for asettlement approximating to the Anglo-American plan could beobtained would be by making concessions to them over control ofthe police.    This was one of the main points in the plan with which
the Patriotic Front disagreed, although they had previouslyaccepted that the existing police force could be maintained. their other demand was that the elections should be rigged so as toensure that they gained control.    Failure to make progress soon,however, might mean that the Patriotic Front would expand their demands to a point where they refused to accept the existing CivilService, which would have a serious effect on future stability.The alternative possibility of splitting the Front, with Mi Nkomoparticipating in the Salisbury regime, supported by Zambia, andMr Mugabe left out, supported by Mozambique, would produce avery dangerous situation for Zimbabwe.    Our task must be to try to get Mr Nkomo and some part of the Zimbabwe African NationalUnion, possibly without Mr Mugabe, but also without the hostility of president Machel of Mozambique, to join the Salisbury Four. Therewas a basic common interest between Mr Nkomo and Mr Smith whoboth, for different reasons, wanted a settlement, and we should do our best to build on this.    The worsening of the internal situationbrought with it some hopeful possibilities, in that people who hadbeen unwilling to talk to one another for a long time were now moreready to consider doing so.    There were various signs that this process was beginning.    It was difficult to see any other course which would be more likely to produce results than the one we werefollowing.    We had the solid support of the United states administration and there was no disposition among our Europeanpartners to criticise our policy.    The main problem was in theHouse of Commons and in the Press where the Government1 scritics were continually urging us to back the internal settlement.It would be quite wrong to do this, though it would be equally wrong to condemn it.    But it was extraordinary that the Smith regimehad failed to make at the start the changes, such as the reform ofthe Land Tenure Act, which would have helped to make the internalsettlement stick.In discussion it was pointed out that although the recent massacreat Umtali had involved Whites, similar atrocities had beenperpetrated by the Rhodesian security forces inside Rhodesia andin Mozambique.    In the Salisbury Parliament there had beencriticism of Whites by the Black Members.    Many of the Whiteshad now come to recognise that they were not in a position to hold the country.    There was growing support among the leadership ofthe Rhodesian forces for acceptance of the integration of the forcesprovided under the Anglo-American proposals and a willingness toaccept Lord Carver1 s role in a transitional administration. the longer a settlement was delayed the greater was the danger of divisions emerging on tribal lines, and there were already signs oflinks developing between Bishop Muzorewa and Mr Mugabe, whowere both Shonas.    It was urged strongly that we should not appearto be willing to arrange or connive at rigging elections on the lines3
desired by the Patriotic Front.    If Mr Mugabe and Mr Nkomo werenot content to accept free elections we should in no circumstances be associated with any settlement which involved a departure fromthis principle.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet deplored the indiscriminate killings which had taken placein Rhodesia, whether they were of Blacks or Whites, and whoeverwas responsible.    These incidents should not, however, divert us from our efforts to achieve a settlement and the Cabinet generallysupported the course which the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary was pursuing.    We should do our best to ensure an honourablesettlement with fair elections.    But we had to recognise that none of the parties were free of duplicity and there might come a timewhen we should have to say so openly.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.4
af*ica21stncluc^ute4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign andpj   . commonwealth   ealth Secretary (CP(78) 66) on policy towards Africa.^e*er US They also had before them a minute of 28 June 1978 from the Minister^(78)1*&apos;^: G* ^tate *or Overseas Development to the Prime Minister on aid toConn . Africa,fusions.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theWest still had the ability to exercise a very considerable influence on events in Africa and, contrary to the impression often given inthe Press, the tide of developments was not moving wholly in favourof the Soviet Union.    There were, for example, indications thatAngola wanted to lessen its dependence on Cuban military assistance and to become more non-aligned.    The recent meeting betweenPresident Neto and President Eanes of Portugal was an encouragingsign, and the United States1 Government were attempting to establishrelations with Angola.    France had decided to cease supportingguerilla movements opposed to the Angolan Government, and if asolution to the problem of Namibia was reached, this wouldinterrupt South African supplies to these movements. these developments would help to stabilise the situation inside Angolaand to make it easier for her to begin to distance herself from theSoviet Union and Cuba.    Somalia was another case where theRussians had suffered a setback.    Soviet policy in Africa remained,however, a source of anxiety.    They now had in the Cuban militarypresence a revolutionary intervention force which could tip thebalance of power in local conflicts.    On the other hand, the western powers were co-ordinating their policies towards Africa to agreater extent than ever before.    This was particularly true ofpolicy on South Africa, which presented special difficulties for theUnited Kingdom.    His memorandum drew attention to the extent towhich we were economically dependent on South Africa. TheGovernment had decided to take steps to reduce our economic links with South Africa, but this was bound to be a protracted process.An important factor in pursuing our policy of disengagement wasthat it was likely, in his view, that South Africa would preserveits internal stability for several years to come and might remain,in economic terms, a more assured trading partner than some ofour export markets in Black Africa, such as Nigeria, which mightbe overtaken by the chaos which was the real threat to Africa. even so our political position in the world at large remained verydifficult so long as we were seen to be so economically dependent on south Africa.    Both the United States and France were now followingtougher policies towards South Africa.    France, for example, had decided to cut off arms supplies to South Africa in the face of criticism from the francophone countries which were an importantexport market for her, and she no longer acted as South Africa&apos;sfriend at the United Nations and elsewhere.    We were concerting5
our policy towards South Africa with the United States, France,Germany and Canada, and our approach was to do no more and no less than they did.    This reduced somewhat the exposed nature ofour position in relation to South Africa, but there was no doubt thatwe would continue to come under international pressure to modifyit still further.    Nonetheless, despite the problem of our links with south Africa and the millstone of Rhodesia, our standing in Africawas generally good, and we should continue to pursue our present policy.    We should, where possible, use our aid to Africa flexiblyin the light of political circumstances and we should increase our military and technical assistance.In discussion it was pointed out that an examination of events in africa over the last 25 years suggested that the Labour Party had adopted an inconsistent attitude to liberation movements. TheParty generally supported such movements in their early days andthen, again, when they eventually came to power.    But in the intervening period when they were fighting for independence andmost needed help the party  s support was often reduced or withdrawn.This frequently happened because of our econo.the interests, butthis was a short-sighted response which encouraged the liberationmovements to look to the Soviet Union for assistance.    Even though they might eventually throw off Russian involvement in their affairs,it meant that we had lost an opportunity to influence them at a criticalstage in their struggle for power.    We should recognise now thedirection in which events were moving in South Africa.    It waswelcome that American and French policies were now becoming more liberal and more closely aligned with our own attitudestowards South Africa, but this should encourage us to move stillfurther and faster, despite the difficulties of decreasing oue independence on South Africa.    On the other hand, it was argued thatwhile there was no doubt that it was right to reduce our economiclinks with South Africa, this was bound to be a gradual and long-drawn out process if we were not to do ourselves very serious economic harm.    For example, to stop all direct trading with south Africa would lead to the immediate loss of 75, 000 jobs in thiscountry.    The Secretary of State for Industry would shortly becirculating a report to the Ministerial Group on Southern Africa(GEN 12) on confidential talks which officials had held with firmsabout their links with South Africa.    These had shown that whilemany Western countries relied on supplies of minerals from SouthAfrica, we were more dependent on them than any other country.There were certain South African raw materials the loss of whichwould be crippling to British industry.    We were examiningalternative sources of supply, but even if these could be developedat all, they would become available only very slowly. Moreover,although our European partners were co-ordinating their policies6
with ours, France and Germany still had very substantial tradinglinks with South Africa, and although the Community had adopted the Code of Conduct, only we had taken practical steps to enforceit.    So far none of our partners had put it into effect and weshould consider taking this up with them.In further discussion it was suggested that one reason why african governments were ready to turn to the Soviet bloc for help was that many of their leaders had been educated by teachers from communist countries.    Many British teachers had left their posts in Africanuniversities and secondary schools in the 1950s and 1960s and hadbeen replaced by East Germans and Poles who had taught thegeneration of Africans now rising to influential positions in their countries.    We had begun to recover the lost ground in a small way through our aid programmes, but our effort was still very limitedcompared with that of France and there was much more that wecould do in English-speaking Africa.In subsequent discussion there was general agreement that although we should not overestimate our ability to influpnce events, weshould be ready to consider giving aid to countries which might not normally qualify for assistance where it was in British interests tosee their political and economic structures preserved.    The threat to such countries might not have its origin in poverty as such but,for example, in their administrative shortcomings or in tribaldisputes.    It was in such circumstances that the Soviet Union andCuba were able to establish their influence.    Our present strategywas already flexible and did not preclude the use of aid in supportof our general political interests in Africa.    It would, however, bea major new departure if aid in future were to be conditional on political and economic reform, as in the case of Zaire.    It was important that we continued to implement our strategy on the present case-by-case basis.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that our present policy towards Africa should bemaintained, and, subject to the points made in discussion, endorsed the proposals in paragraph 10 of CP(78) 66.    There could well beoccasions when it would be in British interests to use aid to seek toreduce the risks of political instability and to sustain the politicaland economic structures of African countries, though this did not mean that we would always be successful.    Such opportunitiesshould be considered case-by-case as they arose.    The Governmenthad already embarked on a course of reducing our economicdependence on South Africa.    But the consultations with firms hadunderlined the importance of these links for the economy and had emphasised the difficulty of finding alternative sources of supply of 
key raw materials.    The process of disengagement would thereforebe slow.    It was also a very sensitive subject, both politically and economically, and it was important that the fact that discussions were going on with firms should remain confidential.    GEN 12 would shortly consider the outcome of the talks, and their conclusionswould be reported to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.^Y OFFER TOTECHNICALcal staff5. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said thatthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy Sub-Committee on pay Negotiations (EY(P)) had at their meeting the previous daydecided by a majority that the local authority employers should beallowed to proceed with a pay offer for administrative professionaltechnical and clerical staff which they had already notified to thetrades unions.    He had opposed the decision and had brought thematter to Cabinet because he considered that an important point ofprinciple was involved.    The employers had costed their offer at10 per cent, but the costing was deficient in two important respects.Firstly it made no allowance for drift.    The employers had sought to justify this on the grounds that drift could not be calculatedprecisely.    He would not press his objections to this argument,since he had earlier agreed that drift could be totally discounted inthis case if that were the price of achieving a settlement which wasotherwise at or within 10 per cent.    He noted, however, that thesame employers had been able to calculate drift precisely in thecase of their manual workers, where the figure was negative andhad been used to bring the total apparent cost of the settlement downto 10 per cent.    Secondly, one of the features of the offer was anincrease in holiday entitlement for certain lower paid employees,effective from 1 April 1979, and costed at 0.02 per cent.    In his view, the appropriate figure would have been 0.26 per cent,representing the gross cost in a full year.    The employers had saidthat this could be reduced to 0. 08 per cent in a full year by achievingincreased productivity, but there were no means whereby thesupposed productivity improvements could be monitored. TheGovernment had insisted in a number of other cases, notably that ofthe textile workers, that the costing of settlements should take full account of the costs of increased holiday entitlements, and it wouldbe inequitable not to do the same for the local authority white collarworkers.    However, even if it were accepted that only the net costof the improvement, as estimated by the employers, need be taken8
into account, the appropriate figure would still be the full-yearcost of 0.08 per cent, rather than the figure of 0. 02 per cent whichthe employers had used on the basis that the improvement would only come into effect in the last quart er of their pay year, which began on 1 July 1978.    The employers1 approach meant that theircosting of their total offer at 10 per cent contained an element of end-loading, under which the benefit of the extra leave entitlementwould continue into future years without its cost being properlytaken into account.    He was in no doubt that the offer as it stoodwas in breach of the pay guidelines, and EY(P) the previous day had agreed with this view.    The percentage involved might be small, but the Government had persuaded private sector employers to renegotiate settlements worth 10.2 and 10. 3 per cent, underthreat of sanctions.    The success of pay policy, in the currentround and in any future rounds, largely depended on theGovernment&apos;s being able to show that the policy was being appliedfairly as between groups.    The Government1 s authority would be undermined if it were seen to be changing the rules, for the benefitof this one group, by allowing the increase in holiday entitlement to be virtually ignored in the costing of the pay offer.    There wouldalso be immediate repercussions in the pay negotiations for thoseNational Health Service groups which had still to settle in thecurrent round.    He recommended that the Government should treat the local authorities in the same way as it had treated a numberof private sector employers, by informing them that their offer was outside the pay guidelines, and inviting them to renegotiate.If they refused, the Government should apply sanctions which in thelocal authorities1 case could take the form of a suitable abatementof the increase in rate support grant proposed for the autumn.In discussion it was strongly argued that the Government ought notto oppose the employers&apos; offer.    The excess over 10 per cent wasregrettable.    However, both the employers and the main unioninvolved - the National and Local Government Officers&apos; Association(NALGO) - supported the 10 per cent limit, and the employersbelieved that their offer was consistent with it.    The offer wouldbe presented in public by them as containing the increased holidayentitlement within a total cost of 10 per cent.    If the Governmentasked the employers to withdraw their offer at this stage, it wouldbecome public knowledge that the Government regarded the offeras breaching the guidelines.    The employers would undoubtedlyrefuse to withdraw their offer, and the threat of sanctions would set off a major confrontation with them, as well as causingdifficulties for the present moderate leadership of NALGO. Inpublicity terms, this course could be more damaging to theGovernment&apos;s pay policy than the alternative course of allowing theoffer to go ahead.9
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the difficulties which the offer might cause forpay policy.    However, they had noted, too, that the offer wouldbe presented by the employers as containing the increased holidayentitlement within a total cost of 10 per cent, and thus as beingwithin the Government&apos;s guidelines.    The Cabinet considered that,on balance, the Government&apos;s best course was to take no steps toprevent the local authority employers from proceeding with their offer.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office29 June 197810
IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOCABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(78) 24th Conclusions Minute 2Thursday 29 June 1978 at 10. 30 am the LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, since theCabinet&apos;s decision on top salaries at their last meeting he had beendeeply impressed by the consequences which could follow and had therefore sought, and received, the Prime Minister&apos;s permission toraise the matter again.    There were already signs that large increases in top salaries would provoke a strongly adverse reaction from a wide spectrum of opinion in the Parliamentary Labour Party.Members would be expected to support a decision on which they hadnot been consulted and to which many of them would object strongly.These reactions would be complicated by the Government&apos;s failure to implement the earlier Top Salaries Review Body (TSRB)recommendations on Members of Parliaments pay, on which a newmotion would be needed in the House before the end of July. TheGovernment also had to seek, over the next four weeks, theconstructive acquiescience of the trade union movement to the nextphase of pay policy.    Large salary increases at the top of the public sector would make this much more difficult.    The Government&apos;swhole position, electorally and with the trade union movement,depended on its success in dealing with inflation.    It would be follyto forfeit the support of a number of key unions in this way. Hewould himself find great difficulty in defending the increases in public, and were this not a pre-election period, would be unable todo so.    In his view, the Cabinet should reconsider its earlier decision.    It should authorise the early publication of the reportof the TSRB.    It should announce at the same time pay increases of 10 per cent for all those covered by the report, and say that theGovernment would consider later the remainder of the recommenda-tions, taking into account the progress of talks on future pay policy.This would distinguish the top salary groups from those like thepolice, fire services, armed forces and doctors and dentists to whomspecial treatment had been given.    It would mean treating them inthe same way as other groups, like those covered by the wages councils, who had not received more than 10 per cent despite the1
unfairness this had caused.    There would no doubt be difficulties with some of the groups covered by the Report but the Governmentwould be entitled to say that the general community interest had totake precedence over their claims.In discussion it was pointed out that there had been relatively littlePress or public reaction to the first indications of the contents ofthe TSRB Report.    Against this it was argued that this could wellbe because no-one seriously expected the Government to implement the very large increases which the Report was believed torecommend.    Announcement of the Cabinet1 s previous decision,particularly at the present time, could therefore cause great surpriseand shock.    Those covered by the TSRB, and particularly the nationalised industry board members (NIBMs) had no doubt a good case for an increase.    But so had many other groups, like forexample the British Leyland toolmakers, whose claims had been rejected.    Three rounds of pay policy had caused injustices all roundand it would take time to eliminate these.    Any attempt to deal with one group in isolation would be misunderstood.    Moreover while theproposed increases, net of tax, were no doubt much smaller thanthe gross figures would imply it would be the gross figures whichwould attract attention and be used in argument against an extensionof pay policy.    The fact that these increases were designed to correct anomalies and would be phased over several years would be lost sight of in the general argument.    Nor could the trade union leaders easily accept, especially in public, such large increases.Their support for any kind of renewed pay policy was essential. Itwas therefore expedient to defer or modify the proposed announcementof the Cabinet&apos;s decision, even at the risk of some injustice.Publication of the report, followed by a month&apos;s delay in announcinga decision, would allow time to assess the reactions of the various parties concerned.    The Government&apos;s decision could then be presented in the context of a White Paper or announcement about thenext phase of pay policy.    If any general rules could be developed and agreed for dealing with anomalies in the next round, they couldbe applied to the top salary groups.    A delay would also allow timefor consideration of the Edmund Davies Report on the police,expected shortly.    This report would also pose problems of catchingup and of phasing.    The TSRB issue had previously been presented to Cabinet as one of complete acceptance or rejection of the TSRBrecommendations.    Given a month&apos;s delay, it might prove possibleto work an acceptable compromise which would be fair as betweenthe different groups involved and would be less likely to attractserious public or trade union criticism.    Meanwhile, the risk of legal action should be accepted for a brief period.2
On the other hand, it was argued that adverse reactions would comeonly from small and predictable sections of Party opinion. Therehad been no preliminary signals from within the Party of a majorreaction.    The majority would see the TSRB proposals as thesolution of the formidable accumulation of previous problems. Thewhole area of pay differentials was now a shambles at all levels.This was widely recognised, not least on the factory floor whererank and file opinion was unlikely to be outraged at the thou ght of higher pay for managers.    Moreover the National economic development Council 6 (&quot;NEDC 6&quot;) trade union leaders had been warned of the receipt of the TSRB Report and had not pressed thematter.    Mr Basnett, General Secretary of the General and municipal Workers Union, had said only that it would be intolerableto pay large increases at once:  he seemed to think that the likelyTSRB recommendations would be acceptable if phased over a period.Discussions with the unions about a possible Phase 4 had reached no agreement on any provision for handling anomalies in the nextround.    This therefore provided no solution to the problem of top salaries.    Among these and leaving aside the increases already agreed for this year, the Chairmen of the largest nationalised industries had received only 4 per cent increase in pay since 1972,involving a very serious fall in real living standards.    Many of them would have been better off had they refused promotion to the board.This led to inefficiency and demoralisation where performancecounted most.    There were similar problems among the judges,where it was increasingly difficult to persuade barristers to acceptappointments to the Bench.    It would be a mistake to discriminatefor or against any of these groups, including the Civil Service,whose representatives had expressed their concern strongly toDepartmental Ministers.    The Cabinet should not attempt further to adjust the TSRB recommendations, which they had consideredindividually and in detail at their last meeting.    The question nowwas whether they should stand by the decisions they had already taken.    The Cabinet had an obligation to decide these matters itself and should not give any impression of indecision or of leaving it to others to make up their minds for them.    Protracted public discussion wz s unlikely to make a decision any easier.    The cabinet should take its decision and then concentrate on presenting thatdecision fairly and seeking support for it in the Parliamentary party and the trade union movement.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the question of future pay policy,with a number of other issues, was covered in a document being prepared for the Liaison Committee to be discussed the following week.    That document would then be considered by the general council of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) and by the national executive Committee of the Labour Party on 26 July.    It should meet with a large degree of support.   Following the Liaison3
Committee discussion, he proposed to ask the General Council tomeet some of the Cabinet Ministers concerned with pay within thenext 10 days or so.    At that meeting the Chancellor of the exchequer would explain the Government&apos;s thinking on the economy generally and on the next phase of pay policy in particular.    He would alsoarrange to see the Confederation of British Industry (CBI). in parallel with this, there would be discussions in Cabinet, leading up to the issue of a White Paper in the third or fourth week of july and to a vote in the House of Commons.    An announcement on top salaries needed to be seen in this context.    The Cabinet had beenequally divided on the issue at their present meeting and in thesecircumstances they should adhere to their earlier decision. Forthe Government to avoid a decision now would be a sign of weaknessand of unwillingness to accept responsibility.    The Report of theTSRB would be published on 30 June, but no announcement of theGovernment1 s conclusions would be made at that stage.    He would himself arrange to meet the Parliamentary Labour Party on Tuesday4 July, when he would announce that the Government accepted therecommendations of the TSRB on the conditions approved by theCabinet previously.    These included an immediate 10 per cent increase from 1 January 1978 for all the groups concerned,subsuming the increases which had already been given to the NIBMsduring the present year.    The rates recommended by the TSRBwould become the basis for pensions from 1 April 1978.    They wouldbe implemented in full by two further instalments on 1 April 1979and 1 April 1980.    There was however no commitment to updatethese increases further in the light of inflation between now and1980 and this issue was reserved for further consideration at theappropriate time.    He would present these decisions fairly to theParliamentary Labour Party and seek to convince the Party thatthey were necessary and justified.    Parliament would be informed by means of a Written Answer the same day.    The Lord Chancellor,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for defence and the Lord Privy Seal should arrange to see the four groups for whom they were responsible at the same time.    He would himselfinform Lord Boyle of the publication of the Report and of the postponement of a Government announcement, and on the day of theannouncement he would inform him of its contents.    Meanwhile, theCabinet should once more maintain complete secrecy about thedecisions which had been taken until the day of the announcement.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and of thedecisions taken.Cabinet Office4 July 1978
