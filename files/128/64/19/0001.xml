^^MENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.^roPean THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the GovernmentW    ry had undertaken to publish a Green Paper before Parliament debated^ the European Monetary System (EMS).    It would be difficult to add. anything significant to the evidence he had already given to the^f^0Us Expenditure Committee in advance of the Finance Council on Monday,C^6110^ 20 November.    He would hope therefore to circulate a draft GreenC0*   &apos; 3?th Paper to Cabinet on 21 November for consideration on 23 Novemberc conclusions, with the debate taking place in the following week.    Hitherto thegeneral expectation had been that the Government would wait until after the debate before reaching their decision, but it had beenargued that a passage in the Prime Ministers speech at the Guildhallon 13 November could imply the opposite.    He did not himself sharethat interpretation and in any case felt that it was essential to havethe debate first.Strong support was expressed for this view.    Tactically theGovernment should appear to negotiate constructively until the lastpossible moment, whatever their final decision:  and in any event itwould be wrong for the Cabinet to reach its decision in advance ofthe Prime Minister&apos;s meetings with Signor Andreotti on 22 November,with President Giscard on 24 November and with the Taoiseach on27 November.    There would also be a need for a meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party.    Furthermore there were somespecific points which the Cabinet wished to discuss further: inparticular the option for joining the EMS at a later date and the need to be able to participate fully in any wider negotiations about the relationship of the EMS to the dollar and the international monetary system generally.    It was argued that the Cabinet should not reachits decision until after the European Council on 4-5 December: andthis would be acceptable provided no commitment whatever wasentered into at that meeting.    On the other hand it was pointed outthat this was not a practicable course.    Not only was it not thepractice to conduct European Council business on an ad referendumbasis but it had been specifically agreed at the meeting of theEuropean Council in Bremen that Governments should be in a positionto reach decisions at the meeting- on 4-5 December.    The PrimeMinister would therefore need to know where he stood before that meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer should circulate the draft Green paper to the Cabinet on 21 November.    This would be considered at their meeting on 23 November with a view to publication the following day.
At their meeting on 23 November the Cabinet would not take its decision about participation in the EMS.    There would be a meetingof the Parliamentary Labour Party on 28 November and this wouldbe followed by the debate on either 29 or 30 November.    He wouldgive further thought to when the Cabinet would take its decisionthough this would probably have to be on 30 November since it wouldhave to be taken before the meeting of the European Council on -5 December.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the&amp;j negotiations with the Trades Union Congress (TUC) reported to the^ 0Us Cabinet at the previous meeting had led to an agreement between theCj^^ce: TUC Economic Committee and the Ministers concerned about the3***k text Q* a Joint statement, to which would be attached advice by the8ionst TUC to their negotiators.    The General Council of the TUC hade ^ however been split and had therefore rejected the agreement. Hehad arranged for its text to be published, and had himself explained to the House of Commons the circumstances surrounding thisbreakdown of negotiations.    It had been a great disappointment andit had done no good to the image of the TUC.    In the new situation itwas very important that Ministers should stick to the existingguidelines in those areas of the public sector for which they were responsible.    It might be possible to build on parts of the abortivejoint statement, for example the passage on an extension of comparability in the public sector, if this would help in particularnegotiations.    Otherwise, it was essential that all public sectornegotiatione be conducted within the framework of the White Paper&quot;Winning the Battle Against Inflation&quot;.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said tfiatthe Government had received much credit in the country for its firmstand on pay.    It was important not to let the present setback create the impression that the policy approved by the Cabinet in the summerhad been abandoned.    It had not and the failure to achieve a joint statement with the TUC was no reason to reopen settled policy. Atthe same time the TUC was in some disarray with signs of frictiondeveloping between those members who had been involved in thediscussions with Ministers and the rest.    The TUC would need anddeserved help.    Nothing should be said or done by Government whichimplied that the TUC were being shut out of the Government&apos;scounsels or which appeared to seek to exploit the tuc&apos;s internal
difficulties.    On the contrary every effort should be made to reassure the TUC that the Government still valued, and wished to maintain,the informal working relationship which had served well in the past.He would consider further the suggestion which had been made for astocktaking discussion in Cabinet on these issues when the dust hadsettled.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.3
-ION 3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatF4lRSwritten to the Prime Minister some weeks ago suggesting that hein view of the lack of progress over Rhodesia Sir Roy Welensky hadNil.sisshould involve himself directly in attempts to find a settlement. TheUes*a same point has been made by the Opposition spokesman on Foreign. Affairs, Mr Pym, in the House of Commons,    To these suggestions^fe^0118 Prime Minister had replied that he would certainly be prepared to^(TjT^61 consider this at the appropriate time.   His personal intervention wouldl^h     35th however, in effect, be the last card we had to play.    It would therefore8*0ns&apos; need careful preparation and there were obvious dangers in playing itprematurely.    The Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary said that pressure for the Prime Minister1 s intervention was likely to bemaintained and, in his view, it was virtually inevitable at the rightmoment, but it was important to try to avoid the Prime Minister beinginvolved in a failure.    On the other hand, we must avoid criticism onthe ground that we were being insufficiently active and for this reason it might be necessary to play this card even if, given the intransigenceof the parties, it failed to produce a solution, so that we should beseen to have gone as far as we could in our efforts.    But we must be careful not to do anything which would give the Americans anopportunity of withdrawing from the problem and leaving us to dealwith it on our own.    There were already some.signs that they wouldnot be averse to this.    The timing of an/initiative   . of this kind wouldbe affected by the decision which Mr   Smith&apos;s government were due totake today on whether or not to postpone the elections, due to be held before the end of the year, until next spring.    The South african government were concerned about the possibility of postponement andhad summoned Mr Smith and his colleagues to Pretoria, presumablyto discuss it.    They wanted early elections in order to establish the credibility of the regime but were also anxious to see an all-party conference take place.    The South Africans were the only people who could bring pressure to bear on Mr Smith and it was possible that theymight accept postponement only on condition that he and his colleaguesattended a conference.    From our point of view postponement mighthave some advantages if it resulted in an easing of tension and improved the prospects for a conference.    These were not promising.Mr Smith was in a strong position having accepted, but Mr Nkomo had so far refused and was looking ahead to a military victory.    If itwere possible to arrange a conference there was a case for holding itin much greater privacy than the 1976 conference in Geneva.The Cabinet -1.       Took note.4
THE PRIME MINISTER said that during his State Visit President Eanesof Portugal had told him that he wanted to be able to look to the UnitedKingdom for help on a broad range of problems and to consult privatelywith him from time to time.    He particularly wanted our help in improving Portuguese agriculture by the provision of fertilisers and machinery, and with advice on the organisation of the nationalised industries.    The President had admitted privately that he had madea mistake in failing to consult Mr Soares before appointing the firstgovernment after the latter1 s departure from office, although he hadremedied this in the appointment of the present government.    He had explained that his aim was to do all he could to keep the Army out of politics and was very keen on Portugal&apos;s entry into the european community, although this was going to cause the country some majordifficulties.    The Prime Minister said he had the impression that president Eanes was sincere in his devotion to democratic principles.Portugal was not only our oldest ally but also a struggling newdemocracy with some serious problems to face and he had told thePresident that we would give him all the support we could.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.5
4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Chancellor(CP(78) 119) covering a draft report by the Ministerial Group onthe possible form of a further inquiry into Rhodesian sanctions(GEN 151).THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the Ministerial Group established,following the previous week&apos;s discussion in Cabinet, had held two meetings.    It had unanimously rejected the alternatives of a tribunal of Inquiry under the 1921 Act, or of a Select Committee of the normaltype.   It felt that these solutions would make it impossible tomaintain the constraints on which the Cabinet had agreed over the availability of Cabinet documents or on the protection of witnesses.This left two alternatives, a Special Commission, or a RoyalCommission established under the prerogative.    The Group had notyet been able to reach a conclusion about these.    It had proceededon the assumption that a Special Commission could be establishedby a Resolution of both Houses of Parliament.    Subsequent discussionwith the Clerks of both Houses had however revealed that there were serious difficulties in this course, although the Attorney Generalbelieved that it might still be possible to proceed in this way.     If it proved that proceeding by Resolution could not give the desiredresults, then the only way to create a Special Commission would beby a specific Act of Parliament.     The Group had not yet had time toconsider the contents of the Bill which would be required. further thought also needed to be given to proceeding by way of a RoyalC ommi s sion.The Cabinet -Agreed to resume their discussion of this question in thefollowing week.6
UNCIALT^T Forli Y ARJ ^ FULL-* ^UCATIONL^ces:r8) lethClusions. v. . ns&apos;t:&apos;8) 36thlusions,t*35. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Education and Science and Paymaster General(CP(78) 118) proposing a provision in the forthcoming education bill to enable mandatory grants to be paid in respect of 16-18 yearolds staying on in schools or in further education colleges and seeking approval to undertake consultations on the introduction of apilot programme from September 1979 which would reflect the main features of a full national scheme.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that a decision was required on whether the Education Bill, which was to be considered by theLegislation Committee in the following week for early introduction in the House of Commons, should include an enabling provisionfor a mandatory scheme of grants for 16-18 year olds in full-timeeducation.    She did not seek to reopen the decision, taken by theCabinet on 26 October, that there would be no specific provision in this year&apos;s Public Expenditure White Paper for such a scheme,but the Government had stated publicly that they would be ready to commit themselves to a scheme in due course,  subject to timing and cost, and in her view this commitment in principle would appearworthless unless an enabling provision were ircluded in the forth-coming BilJ.    She proposed that this provision should be used inthe first instance to introduce, from September 1979, a pilotprogramme of mandatory grants in selected volunteer localeducation authority (LEA) areas.    The areas would be selectedaccording to three criteria:   high youth unemployment; their inclusion, entirely or mainly in Special Development Areas (SDAs);and a low participation rate in 16+ education.     The pilot programme would be monitored for its effect on the participation rates,particularly of children of manual workers.    Its estimated cost would be  10 million in 1979-80 and  15 million (full year) in1980-81.    The cost in each year would be met within existingpublic expenditure allocations - from the Manpower services commission programme in the first, subject to discussion with theCommission which the Secretary of State for Employment had agreedto undertake, and from the education programme in the second ifthe higher education participation rate remained stable. Afterthe first two years, the Government would have to decide whether to roll the pilot programme forward, abandon it or introduce anational scheme.    The enabling legislation would ensure that theGovernment retained full control over the coverage, character and duration of the pilot programme, and that no national scheme could be introduced unless approved by affirmative resolution.But she believed that it should be made clear from the outset thatthe Government were committed to a more comprehensive scheme;otherwise they would present an unconvincing posture.    The argu-ments for a comprehensive scheme remained compelling. Therewas a marked disparity in participation rates in 16+ educationbetween children of manual workers and those from the professional
and administrative classes;   and our rates were among the lowestin Western Europe.    More than half of the children in the topquartile of ability left school at 16, and recent research had shownthat approximately half would stay on if they received financial support.    The full development of the Youth OpportunitiesProgramme and the financial incentives offered by it would also provide a strong case for the introduction of support for young people remaining in full-time education.    It was estimated thatof the additional children who would be induced to stay on by theprovision of financial support, half would go to further educationcolleges which provided a wide range of vocational and professionaltraining;  and the current trend was for greater numbers to attendthese colleges.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that even if it was accepted that it was a desirable objective to encourage young people to stay on in school or further education, a weekly grantof  7. 50 would not have more than a marginal effect in securingthis.    It was the prospect of employment which attracted young people from school;  and jobs were being offered in central london at about  45 a week and elsewhere at about  25 to  30 a week.80 per cent of the expenditure on mandatory grants would go to the parents of children who would remain in full-time education in any event.    As the Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General herself recognised, the proposed legislation would be primarily intended to lead to a full national scheme. the pressures to achieve this would be enormous and would extend alsoto increasing the amount of the weekly grant.    Since 3 or 4 LEAswere already adopting a system of grants on the lines proposed bythe Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster general, and these could be monitored, there appeared to be no need for legislation in order to promote a pilot programme. Theestimated costs of the pilot programme were very uncertain, sincethe expenditure would be demand-led.    A national scheme, on theother hand, had been estimated to cost  140 million per annum, whenfully introduced;   and this would constitute a large pre-emption of resources available for other priorities.    He considered therefore that it was quite wrong, and nullified the whole purpose of drawing up priorities, to approve the Secretary of State&apos;s proposals in isolation from other claims on public expenditure.    Moreover, theGovernment would lose credibility if, at a time when the economy was finely balanced and the prospect had been held out of fiscaland monetary measures to restrain inflation, they introducedlegislation with major public expenditure  consquences.    In his viewtherefore no action should be taken other than to monitor the LEAflchemea which wero already in operation or likely to be introduced,,8
In discussion the point was made that the Cabinet had been put in anunnecessarily difficult position by the publicity which had been putabout on the issue of mandatory grants and     the Cabinet&apos;consideration of it that morning.     This could only be harmful tothe Governments interests since, if mandatory grants were intro-duced, the Government as a whole would receive no credit for it.Against this, it was suggested that the Press had misrepresentedand exaggerated what had been said in previous Ministerial state-ments and that this may have been an unfortunate consequence ofthe original decision to approve the principle of a scheme of mandatory grants without any assurance that the necessary resources would be available, since the announcement had led various pressuregroups to campaign vigorously for implementation.On the merits of a scheme of mandatory grants, it was argued thatthere was no evidence to suggest that financial support would encourage any significant number of 16-18 year olds to stay on infull-time education.    The participation rates were tending to fall,and at the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on 11 May it had been suggestedthat the trouble lay, more fundamentally, in an alienation amongstyoung people from school education which also, for a time, souredtheir attitude to full-time education of any kind.    A deeper analysiswas required of the cultural and other factors affecting motivation.It was true that a system of means-tested financial support wouldease the burdens for poorer parents whose children stayed on infull-time education, but this was not a high priority for new public expenditure.     On the other hand, it was strongly argued that theobjections to mandatory grants had been overstated.    There wasmassive evidence of the under-achievement of children of working class parents and while this was governed by a number of factors,one was the tendency to leave school early.    It was wrong thatthere should be virtually no support for those staying on, whilehigher education students, who were predominantly of middle-classbackground, received a very generous degree of support.    It wasalso suggested that the estimated costs of a national scheme of mandatory grants had been greatly exaggerated.    It was unlikelythat the grants would have more than a marginal effect on partici-pation rates, but the marginal effect was important particularly inrelation to the choices presented by the Youth OpportunitiesProgramme which by September 1979 might be experiencingdifficulties in meeting the guarantee of a place for all those eligible.The attractions of the     -employment market, especially at thepresent time, had also been overstated.In discussion of the proposal for a pilot programme, it was argued that the selection of LEAs for this would present great practicaldifficulties.    In Wales, for example, most of the LEAs wouldqualify under the suggested criteria, and the exclusion of any ofthem would cause considerable resentment.    It was suggested,therefore, that it would be preferable for the Government not to
introduce a pilot programme but to include an enabling provisionfor mandatory grants in the Education Bill on the basis of a firm commitment to introduce a national scheme on a date which would either be specified or left for future decision.    Against this,however, it was argued that there would be difficulty in specifyinga date sufficiently early to command credibility when no provisionhad been made in the Publication Expenditure White Paper, andthat not to specify a date would be useless.    It was also argued,more generally, that there was a good case for a pilot programme,provided that it was properly monitored and comparisons made with similar areas excluded from it.    In any event, a pilot scheme would be seen as an earnest of the Governments intention to move towards a more comprehensive scheme when resources wereavailable.    The difficulties of selecting areas for inclusion in the pilot programme, within the limits of expenditure proposed,should not prove too great an the basis of the coverage outlined in paragraph 8 of CP(78) 118, which would also enable inner citiesto be included and so maximise the impact on youth unemployment,particularly amongst young blacks.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discus iron,, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in CP(78) 118, and, in particular,the proposal for an enabling provision in the forthcoming education bill.     They agreed that a pilot programme should be introducedfrom September 1979, subject to the limits of expenditureproposed, but the Secretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General should submit to the Home and Social AffairsCommittee in due course detailed criteria to be adopted, and theLEAs to be selected, for the programme and also her proposalsfor monitoring it.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Education and Science and paymaster General to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office16 November 197810
