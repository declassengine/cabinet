cABjire 1* THE prime MINISTER said that contrary to expectation ittysu would be necessary for the Cabinet to meet on Wednesday of the**5S following week.    This would be to consider the collaborative optionsfor the aircraft industry on the basis of a report from the ministerial Group and also papers on the related questions ofpetroleum revenue tax and its application to the British NationalOil Corporation and of the United Kingdom/United States DoubleTaxation Agreement.    The next meeting thereafter would be on7 September unless there were unforeseen developments in themeantime.    Ministers should take every opportunity during august to secure favourable publicity for the Governments activities.The Cabinet -Took note.;^A^MENTARY   2&apos; THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that inaddition to the business already announced a Motion relating to scottish Rating and Valuation Orders would be taken on 31 July.Every effort should be made to retain the support of the OppositionFront Bench for the Governments position on Rhodesia both in the debate and during the Recess.There was a good prospect of securing a Second Reading for theDividend Bill.    Divisions were to be expected on the remaining stages of the Bill but the only amendments likely to be selectedrelated to the duration of its provisions.    The tactical question forconsideration was whether to maintain the Governments preference for a year&apos;s duration or to accept the Liberal preference for aterminal date of 31 December 1978 in\return for their support in securing the passage of the Bill.In discussion r.t was pointed out that amendments by the officialOpposition were not expected though the risk of backbenchamendments could not be excluded.    Although a compromise with the liberals would be preferable to the loss of the Bill there now seemedto be good prospects of carrying the Bill in its present form and itwould be worth making the attempt to do so.    The acceptance ofLiberal amendments might entail further debate at the Report stage.It would be politically preferable to face the risk of defeat afterSecond Reading than to compromise with the Liberals at theCommittee stage.
On the other hand it was pointed out that the proceedings on the bill would be likely to become more protracted and contentious if Liberalsupport were not secured.    The Government1 s voting strength wouldbe likely to wane with the passage of time and this might tempt theOpposition to try to force a tactical defeat on the Government. Itwould be particularly damaging to lose the Bill after Second Reading.The Government could accept a terminal date of 31 December. a compromise with the Liberals would avoid the risk of a defeat on second Reading in the House of Lords though it seemed unlikely thatthe Lords would in the event challenge the House of Commons in thisway.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it wouldbe premature to accept a compromise with the Liberals at this stage.Much would depend on developments in the Parliamentary situationand he would review the tactics to be adopted with the ministers primarily concerned later in the day.    Preparations should in any event be made for the completion of the remaining stages of the Billon 31 July.    The Parliamentary Labour Party should be warned inwriting of a three line whip even though this might be highlyunpopular and might subsequently be modified.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion.Z
Supply3. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that theEuropean Economic Community Commission had exercised their power under the Euratom Treaty to object to a bilateral safeguardsagreement relating to the supply of uranium which had been negotiated between the United Kingdom and Australia.    Plans hadbeen made for the signature of the agreement that day by himself and the Australian Deputy Prime Minister.    The australian government had issued a public complaint about the Commission&apos;transaction, and he was in touch with Foreign and Commonwealth OfficeMinisters about a statement of the Government1 s position.    His own view was that he should proceed to sign the agreement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief oiscussion, said thatthe full details were not before the Cabinet and there was no foreign and Commonwealth Office Minister present.    They could not thereforeagree to immediate signature of the agreement.    The problem should if necessary be considered urgently by the Ministerial Committee on european Questions.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3
ON 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lords?0jg UI^TY President of the Council (CP(78) 85) on alternative proposals for a&quot;^TION Resolution of the House on debates on Community legislation.:f^0Us THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the^ha\CQ: Government1 s undertaking to hold debates recommended by the scrutiny Committee on Community legislative proposals before^te^0118&apos; Ministers gave approval to them in the Council of Ministers hadbeen given in various forms, in some instances without qualification.It had last been stated in his written answer of 4 August 1976 in a qualified form which provided for a Minister to give approval inadvance of a debate on the understanding that he would subsequentlygive an explanation to the House.    In a debate in November 1977 aResolution in unqualified terms had been proposed on a privateMember1 s motion but had not been pressed to a vote because he had promised a further debate in the present Session.    He had notundertaken to bring forward a Government Resolution though therewas some expectation that he would do so.    Three forms ofResolution had been considered.    The first would go beyond theundertaking of 4 August 1976 by requiring Ministers who agreed to community legislation in advance of a debate to seek the subsequentapproval of Parliament.    The second would express the presentundertaking in the form of a Resolution.    The third would simplyinvite the House to approve the present undertaking or its observance.In recent discussions with his colleagues there had been littlesupport for the first option, but considerable support for the second,provided that it could be carried unamended, though reservationshad been expressed on the ground that it would set a precedent for parliamentary encroachment on the responsibilities of Ministers.This might be avoided by the third option, though this too would bevulnerable to amendment.    He had accordingly taken soundings ofParliamentary opinion on a Resolution simply embodying the presentundertaking.    These had revealed that backbenchers would be likelyto press unwelcome amendments to it.    The Scrutiny Committeeappeared not to be in favour of such a Resolution at this stage, though they had not considered the precise form it might take.    In thesecircumstanced, and bearing in mind his promise to hold a debatethis Session, he proposed to consult the Scrutiny Committee on theterms of a Resolution embodying the Government1 s undertaking, and,if they agreed, to arrange a debate in the following week.    His ownpreference was for a stronger form of Resolution, but this could beconsidered at a later stage.In discussion, it was argued that the Government should not movehastily to propose a Resolution in deference to pressure from a minority of backbenchers.    Even if the Scrutiny Committee endorsed the Resolution, the debate would invite a damaging clash on community issues at this late stage in the Session, which many
Government supporters were concerned to avoid.    The Governmenthad fully observed its present undertaking, and the House shouldbe satisfied with this.    Full weight should be given to the attorney general&apos;s concern at the implications of a Resolution for the widerrelationship between Parliament and Ministers, who would be liableto find themselves held in contempt of the House if they failed tocomply with it.    The Government would be justified in deferring adecision until account could be taken of the Report of the ProcedureCommittee which was expected shortly.    This might well be relevant to the role of the Scrutiny Committee, which was of someconstitutional significance and ought not to be given formal recognition in a Resolution at this stage.    The balance betweenParliament1 s right to express views on Community legislation, andthe responsibility of Ministers for negotiation should not lightly bealter ed.On the other hand it was argued that the present qualifiedundertaking was not fully satisfactory to Parliament.    A Resolutionwould give formal recognition to the right of Parliament to considerCommunity legislation before it was approved.    Such a procedure was in no way at variance with our Treaty obligations and would bein accordance with the Prime Minister&apos;s letter to the general secretary of the Labour Party which had included the aim of improving Parliamentary control of Community legislation.Membership of the Community had greatly extended the legislative powers of Ministers, and there was continuing concern within theLabour Party and elsewhere that the relationship between ministers and Parliament on Community legislation had not been satisfactorilydefined.    Even the forms of motions for debate were oftenunsatisfactory.    The proposed Resolution was in conformity with present practice and many members of the Parliamentary party would be critical of the Government if it failed to fulfil its promise of a debate.In further discussion there was wide support for the view that animmediate debate would in any event be divisive and inadvisable.There had be^n insufficient opportunity for consulting Parliamentaryopinion and there was no agreement either on the principle or on theterms of a Resolution.    The relationship between Parliament and ministers should be considered as a general constitutional issue inthe light of the Report of the&apos;Procedure Committee and should notbe dictated by considerations relating solely to Communitylegislation, still less by minority opinion on this issue in the House.It would be difficult to hold further consultations in Parliament untilthe Cabinet had been able to reach firm conclusions.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet agreed that there should not be a debate on this matter before the end of the Session.    When the forthcoming ProcedureCommittee report had been received the Attorney General would, inthe light of its implications, endeavour to draft a Resolution whichwould embody the Government1 s undertaking of 4 August 1976 but which would not unduly impede the ability of Ministers to negotiatein the Council of Ministers.    The Cabinet would consider this draft in due course and would then decide on whether a Resolution was desirable and, if so, in what form.    It would thereafter be necessaryto consult the Parliamentary Labour Party and possibly the ScrutinyCommittee.    Meanwhile, the Lord President of the Council should explain as necessary to the House and the Parliamentary Party thereasons for not proceeding with a debate this Session;  and should offer the Parliamentary Party a full discussion in the autumn. ThePrime Minister would see those backbenchers most critical of theGovernment on this matter at an early opportunity.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Lord President of the Counciland the Attorney General to be guided accordingly.6
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Industry (CP(78) 82) reporting discussion in the ministerial committee on Economic and Industrial Policy (El) about a winterfuel scheme for 1978-79 and a note by the Chief Secretary, Treasury(CP(78) 81) on the current state of the Contingency Reserve for1978-79.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that a special scheme to help people in low income groups to meet their electricitybills had operated for the last two winters.    It had applied torecipients of supplementary benefit (SB) and family income supplement (FIS).    Last winter&apos;s scheme had provided a flat ratepayment of  5 in addition to a 25 per cent discount on electricitybills of over  20.    El had considered whether such a scheme should operate during the winter of 1978-79; if so, whether last year&apos;scheme should be extended.    Although the Committee hadacknowledged that the schemes that had operated so far had beenrough and ready and that in the longer term something moresophisticated was needed, it would not be possible to make radical changes for the coming winter.    Despite the limitations of thearrangements proposed El accepted there was continued need for help to be given to low income consumers and a majority favouredimproving the coverage of last year&apos;s scheme by extending the25 per cent discount element - but not the  5 cash payment - to the recipients of rent and rate rebates.    The cost would be about 45 million.    To repeat last year&apos;s scheme unchanged would cost 30 million.    The Chief Secretary, Treasury, had reserved hisposition about finding these sums from a Contingency Reserve whichwas already substantially depleted.    A further problem waslegislative cover.    So far winter fuel schemes had rested upon thegeneral powers of the Appropriation Act, but this was appropriateonly for temporary schemes of limited duration.     The attorney general had advised that to rely on the cover of this Act a third time would risk considerable criticism and had advocated the passage of primary legislation.    El were unanimously agreed that it would bedesirable to introduce a short Bill for this purpose early in the next session of Parliament and that the Governments intention to legislate should be made clear when the scheme was announced.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he accepted that the long-term problem needed to be examined separately, buthe had received representations from a very large number of peopleabout the way in which many of the less well off were being driven to destitution by the size of their fuel bills.    Old people in particularwere being forced to go to bed early or to resort to public librariesin order to save fuel in the winter.    Low income groups spent twice the proportion of their income on fuel as did other people and40 per cent of their fuel bills were for electricity.    He had therefore7FUEL83F FOR
put to El the proposal to continue last year1 s scheme with itslimited extention to those in the rent and rebate category. if legislation of the form that had been envisaged by El were introducedthere was likely to be very little opposition.    He understood however that the Attorney General thought that it might just be possible to getby without primary legislation for a third time.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he was not opposing the merits of the scheme although he had some misgivings about theproposals.    His main reservation was that in its discussion on public expenditure Cabinet had agreed that no new bids should be accepteduntil the public expenditure position as a whole was reviewed in theautumn.    He had therefore had no option but to reserve his positionwhen the proposal was considered in El.    Only  191 million remained in the Contingency Reserve for 1978-79 and of the total cost of thewinter fuel proposal  33 million would fall in the current year. Thiswas no more than an estimate because of the uncertainty surroundingthe assumptions on which the calculation was based.    Moreover, therecent announcement about changes in the cost of off-peak electricitymight significantly affect the calculation.THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that a relevant factorwas that the November uprating of social security benefits was likelyto fail to match the increases now expected in earnings and prices.The pension rate which was tied to the earnings index might not be far out but it would be more difficult to defend the short-termbenefit rates which were tied to the prices index where the discrepancy could be more significant.    In cash terms the shortfallon pensions would be about 9p a week for a single pensioner and 14pfor a married couple, but the corresponding figures for the short-term benefit would be about 27p a week for a single person and 43pfor a married couple.    When the new rates became known inSeptember, pressure on the Government would be intense. the renewal and extension of the winter fuel scheme would help theGovernment to answer the inevitable criticism.In discussion, there was strong support for the proposal to extend the winter fuel scheme as El had proposed.   It was questionedhowever whether it would be possible to avoid all recipients ofsupplementary benefit automatically getting  5, as many students and young people had been able to claim it.    This had been a source of considerable criticism of the previous scheme.    On the otherhand, the scheme was not doing much to help those in private rented accommodation, many of whom did not claim rent rebate.    It was argued however that the automatic  5 payment was intended to helppeople in rented accommodation who paid the landlord for theirelectricity, but the  20 limit was intended to limit the extent of8
payments to those - like childless young adults - whose need wasnot great.    And because some people had opted for rent rebateinstead of supplementary benefit, the scheme should be extended toinclude them.    Difficulties inevitably would arise from having threedifferent schemes in three successive years.    This would probablyincrease the problem of the take up.    Even in its modified form,the scheme would be full of anomalies.    As for legislation, it was argued that there were substantial advantages in avoiding new legislation if at all possible.    If a Bill were drafted in general terms, it might commit the Government to perpetuating a schemewhich, in the light of the longer term review, would not bedesirable;  but if it were more specific, the scheme would bevulnerable to amendment.    On the other hand, legislation would help to secure the co-operation of local authorities, which would be essential to the extended scheme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the Cabinet discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that there should be another fuelscheme in the coming winter and accepted that the cost should bemet from the Contingency Reserve.    They also endorsed theproposal to extend the coverage of last year&apos;s scheme to includerecipients of rent and rate rebates on the lines recommended by El.The Secretary of State for Energy should announce this to parliament before the Recess, clearing the text with members of the Cabinetbeforehand, but he should not commit the Government to legislate for the scheme for the coming winter.    In the meantime the workalready in hand on a possible longer term scheme should continue.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theSecretary of State for Energy to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 July 19789
