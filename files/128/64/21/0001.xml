^NTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE PARLIAMENTARY SECRETARY, TREASURY said that theofficial Opposition had chosen &quot;The Unjust and Arbitrary Use of sanctions on Industry&quot; as the subject for the Supply Day Debate on7 December.    The Debate would take place on a Motion for the adjournment of the House.    The Opposition^ use of a technicalMotion, and his own conversations with the Conservative Chief Whip,Mr Humphrey Atkins, suggested that they were not seeking a majorParliamentary confrontation, but there was a risk that some government supporters might for this reason be tempted to vote withthe Opposition or to abstain.    While not unduly dramatising thesituation the Whips would ensure that the serious consequences of adefeat were made clear to the Members concerned, and it v/ould be helpful if other Ministers took a similar line in their contacts with members.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that adefeat on this issue would have very serious consequences: it was nota matter on which a defeat on a technical Motion could be recovered bya subsequent vote of confidence.    Furthermore the minority partiescould not be relied upon for support.    The Parliamentary Secretary,Treasury, should proceed as he had indicated, without overplayingthe potential seriousness of the situation; if necessary a meeting ofthe Parliamentary Labour Party could be held early in the following week and the Cabinet would have an opportunity to review the situationagain on the following Thursday.The Cabinet -Took note.1
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat following the recent meeting in Moscow of the leaders of the warsaw Pact countries, there were indications that the differences of view which had existed for seme years between Romania and theother members of the Pact had deepened.    In particular there appeared to have been a deliberate attempt to isolate Romania on policy towards the Middle East because President Ceausescu had failed to condemn the Camp David negotiations.    The fundamentalissue seemed to be the question of how much supranational control the Warsaw Pact should exercise over its individual members. TheRomanians had always had strong views on the importance of their national sovereignty, and it was possible that they were now ready toput even greater emphasis on their independence.    It was difficult to assess the significance of this development, though the picture might become clearer as a result of a public speech which President Ceausescuwas due to make that day.    How the Soviet Union would respond was uncertain:  there were signs that they were reviewing their world-wideposition generally and their policy towards the Federal Republic ofGermany in particular.    He was keeping the situation under closewatch and would be discussing it at the Council of Ministers and inthe margins of the meeting of the North Atlantic Council the following week.    It was possible that the Russians might take steps againstRomania which would require co-ordinated responses both by theCommunity and by the Alliance.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthroughout November we had succeeded in holding off a security council resolution calling for comprehensive sanctions against SouthAfrica over Namibia, but it was possible that the issue would come up again at short notice the following week and that very quick decisions would be needed.    It remained in our interests to avoid a Chapter VIIdetermination against South Africa and to give the South african government a chance to fulfil their undertaking to hold elections inNamibia under United Nations auspices.    We would therefore go onplaying for time.    But it was important that we did not becomeisolated.    We were in close touch with our allies, and he would behaving further discussions in the margins of the North Atlantic council meeting the following week.    Our approach was very much in line withthat of the French, but the American position was not clear. in considering whether we should veto a resolution, we should notunderestimate the extent to which we would be made a scapegoat byBlack Africa.    There would be wide political repercussions, andmany African countries, including Nigeria, would be likely to take action against British interests.2
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thequestion of independence for Belize was once again being discussed in the United Nations.    Earlier in the year the continuing failure tomove towards independence had started to become a divisive politicalfactor in Belize, and he had therefore persuaded both the BelizeGovernment and the Opposition to agree formally that they would work in co-operation with each other on the issue.    In Septemberhe had had four days of negotiations with the Guatemalans and had put to them a number of proposals on the basis of which Belize mightproceed to independence.    These did not include a cession of territory but offered the Guatemalans a British contribution to a major road project in Guatemala, free port facilities in Belize city and guaranteed access to the port, permanent seaward access toGuatemala&apos;s Caribbean coast and, finally, a security treaty. after two months the Guatemalans had still not replied to our offer, but itwas reported that they would be giving their response later that day.It was not likely to be favourable, though there remained a chance that we would be able to move into detailed negotiations.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee was considering proposals for the grant of independence to St Lucia.    Both the Government of St Lucia and the opposition were in favour of the principle of independence, but the opposition were arguing that the people of St Lucia should first be consulteddirectly in an election.    It was not, however, expected that theOpposition would resort to violence if independence was grantedwithout an election, but even so, the possibility of having a Royal Navyship close at hand as a precautionary measure at the time was being examined.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Ministerand Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
n^NTTY 3. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOODsaid that he had been in touch with Commissioner Gundelach followingL. * the recent meeting of the Council of Ministers (Fisheries).V 0Ti Mr Gundelach thought it had been right for us to respond to the^6tles Presidents request for a paper setting out our requirements force^ preferential access, although Herr Ertl&apos;s decision to end the Councilv. abruptly had not permitted proper discussion.    While there had beenJL  * a strong reaction against our proposals in the Council, the Danish^ft?06&apos; an(* *riflk Ministers had been more sympathetic in private conversation,t^&apos; ^Oth The situation was therefore not as difficult as some reports suggested.^tg810118&apos; Commissioner Gundelach was willing to have an early meeting with use ^ and to announce such a meeting to show that negotiations had not broken down.    We should aim for a resumption of the Fisheries Council ifpossible on 11 December.In discussion it was suggested that the publication of our proposals had now made more difficult the task of persuading the industry toaccept a settlement.    We were bound to have to move substantiallyfrom the position set out in our document if we were to have any hopeof reaching agreement and this would be represented, as a defeat forthe Government.    The Commission might be ready to move some way towards our position but it did not seem likely that their proposals would be ones which the industry would accept.    In thesecircumstances, it would be very difficult to get a settlement throughthe House of Commons.    The Opposition Parties had always taken avery strong line on fisheries and, unless the Conservative Party feltthat it would be better to have a settlement out of the way, they were unlikely to help the Government.    The failure to settle the fisheriesissue was having wider repercussions on our relations within theCommunity.On the other hand it was argued that substantial progress had beenmade especially on conservation, our share of quotas and of subsequent growth in stocks.    There had also been useful discussions at official level with the French on access within 12 miles. Theindustry needed to know where it stood and, if we negotiated toughlyand put a settlement to them as the best which could be obtained,there were leaders in the industry who might be willing at least to acquiesce.    Some restructuring of the fishing industry was inevitable and there would be need for both Community and national funds toassist this process.    If the Government recommended the settlementthis might change the position in the House.In further discussion it was argued that an early meeting withCommissioner Gundelach was highly desirable.    If this could be made public and reported by President Jenkins to the European Council itwould help to avoid the subject being discussed during the EuropeanCouncil.    The Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the
Secretary of State for Scotland should take part in this meeting aswell as the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary if the latter&apos;scommitments with the European Council allowed.    The Commissionalready had compromise proposals prepared but it would be essentialto have a detailed discussion to ensure that these were not putforward on a basis which would be unacceptable to us.    A further meeting of the Fisheries Council before the end of the year was desirable provided there was reasonable prospect of it being a success.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thereshould be an early meeting between Ministers andCommissioner Gundelach with a view to reconvening the FisheriesCouncil if possible on 11 December.    The outcome of the discussions with Commissioner Gundelach should be considered by the Cabinet at its next meeting.    We should approach the next stages in a constructive manner with a view to reaching an early agreement.In due course however, the Cabinet would have to decide whether to conclude an agreement and then try to secure acceptance inParliament or whether the negotiations would have to be broken offbecause terms which the Government could recommend to the Housecould not be obtained.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.5
4. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the Chancellor%?*&quot;Y of ^e Exchequer (CP(78) 122 and 123) about the negotiations on the* European Monetary System (EMS) and the line proposed to be taken at the European Council on 5 December, and about relations betweenL   s the pound sterling and the Irish pound.    They also had before them awjft. Ce: memorandum by the Prime Minister (CP(78) 124) recording hisSl0l*s, and the Taoiseach;  an earlier memorandum by the Chancellor of the*0th discussions with the Prime Minister of Italy, the President of FranceL cExchequer (CP(78) 114) describing in detail the negotiations preceding the European Council;  and a minute dated 28 November from theSecretary of State for Energy to the Prime Minister, reporting aresolution passed by a joint meeting of the Home Policy and international Committees of the Labour Party National ExecutiveCommittee (NEC).THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that since theCabinet&apos;s last meeting, there had been an intensive series of bilateral discussions with other European countries.    The French had now accepted that we were unlikely to join the exchange rate mechanismpart of EMS, and saw no serious political consequerces.    They were anxious however to modify the German position on intervention in thedirection we had favoured, and were worried at the prospect of beingthe only non-Snake country to join the new exchange rate system.The German Chancellor was apparently still trying to overcome the resistance of the independent Bundesbank on this issue, but with little prospect of success.    The Irish Government had still not decidedfinally whether to join.    They had agreed that, if Ireland joined andthe United Kingdom did not, then it would be necessary to imposeexchange controls on both sides of the frontier, and they were willingto co-operate with the British authorities about this.    He thereforesought the Cabinet&apos;s agreement that if necessary such controls shouldbe imposed.    The Italian position was also undecided; it was in our interests to persuade them to remain outside with us if possible. Itwas essential that we should continue to support the Irish and italian governments in their demands up to the last moment.    He was anxiousto minimise the risk to sterling if we were the only country outsidethe system.    Jo far, sterling had reacted well to the events of thelast few weeks.    There had been a good reception at home andabroad for the emerging British Government position, and in particular for the distinction which it now drew between the EMS as a whole andthe exchange rate mechanism within it.    There was no new evidence to suggest that it was in our interest to join the exchange ratemechanism.    In his view it was essential, however, that we should play a full part in the development of the wider EMS, so that we couldinfluence such matters as convergence between the Europeaneconomies, the relationship between Europe and the dollar and thenew Community credit mechanisms.    There should therefore be no 6
question of vetoing these arrangements, provided that our conditions were met and we were permitted to play our full part.    Despite the critical motion passed by two committees of the NEC, the reaction of the Parliamentary Labour Party had been generally favourable tothe line he proposed to take.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the decisionrepresented a watershed in our relationships with the european economic Community.    It would be a mistake for us to enter theEMS in any form.    We would do better to use our influence in theCommunity to delay its implementation, and to seek agreement firston the necessary budgetary reforms, and in the search for symmetry.It was unlikely in practice that the conditions we had laid down at thetime of the Bremen Council could be achieved.    For example, to match the generous treatment which the Irish were seeking from theGerman Government, we should need resource transfers of at least 10 billion.    The proposed &quot;half-way house&quot; meant the creation ofan unstable two-tier Community.    The deflationary impact of anEMS was so serious that it called for a reappraisal of our wholeindustrial policy.    If however the EMS was set up, and the door was left open for us to join the exchange rate mechanism at a later stage,it was important to ensure that this did not create an automaticcommitment to our eventual entry.    If it did, we should inexorablybe sucked in, thus achieving federalism by default.    The longer termissues of our relations with the European Economic Community inthe future might best be examined by the Cabinet in the course of aChequers weekend meeting in the new year.In discussion, there was general agreement that our conditions hadnot been met, and wide support for the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;approach.    The main choice for the Cabinet was whether to veto theestablishment of suitable Community arrangements, or to agree tothem on condition that we were allowed to play our part, while notjoining the exchange rate mechanism itself.    The operations of thatmechanism were matters which could be largely left to central banks.Anything beyond that, including arrangements for short and medium term credits, were matters for Governments, and should thereforebe under the supervision of the Council of Finance Ministers.    If not,they would have to take the form of a separate non-Communityagreement, in which case we should lose our chance to influenceevents.    The best course for us was a &quot;half-way house&quot; proposal andthis approach had commanded a good reception at home and in Europe.There was still very little information available about the non-exchange mechanism part of the EMS, because negotiations were still at an early stage.    The position of the European Currency Unit(ECU), the credit mechaniim, the proposed Monetary Fund, and related matters, were all for later discussion.    It was important7
that the United Kingdom should be able to join in.    These arrangements would amount to a new Bretton Woods agreements    A veto on theestablishment of the scheme would create great fury, and isolate theUnited Kingdom.    We should therefore permit the establishment ofthe new arrangements, and seek to maintain an &quot;open door&quot; whichwould allow us to accede to the exchange rate mechanism at a later stage.    It was quite possible that, in the event of a speculative attackon sterling at some future point, we should want to use the Communitycredit arrangements as an alternative to the International monetary fund.    Although sterling was presently strong, the effect of theintroduction of EMS on the pound and on an already fragile dollarmight be very serious.    It would be a mistake to deprive ourselvesof the right to influence events.    A limited number of immediatedecisions, for example, about short term credit arrangements, mightbe taken at the European Council next week, but they would be dependant upon legislation to be passed in France and Germany, andwould need to be debated in Parliament.In further discussion, it was suggested that the introduction ofexchange controls between the United Kingdom and the Republic ofIreland would be psychologically and politically damaging and shouldbe avoided if possible.    If it were inevitable, it would be important to minimise the impact on the people affected, particularly thoseliving along the borders.    The practical problems were very serious,although these would flow mainly from the decision to separate thetwo currencies, rather than from the imposition of exchange controls.However, the separation of the currencies would make it attractive inthe short term for funds to flow from London to Dublin on a very large scale.    This was largely the result of the dollar premium. Actionon the premium might remove the need for more extensive exchange control.    But if this was insufficient, it would not be safe to rely onIrish exchange controls alone.    The Irish authorities had no experienceof such arrangements and there were bound to be serious loopholes.In continued discussion, it was argued that it would be wrong to forceany necessary European instruments through the House of commons in a hurry before Christmas at a time when the Party might still be divided in its attitude to the EMS.    However, the regulations inquestion were likely to be only permissive, and raised no seriousissues of policy for the United Kingdom as such.    Provided it was clear that the House had an opportunity to debate fully any decisions which directly affected the United Kingdom and had proper explanatorymemoranda in good time, this should be sufficient.    It was a mistake to be too influenced by the views expressed by the NEC, which wasunrepresentative, and the members of whose committees on thissubject were relatively inexperienced.    The proper channel for communication between the NEC and the Cabinet was through theGeneral Secretary of the Party.8
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the suggested negotiating line set out in paragraph 5of the Chancellor of the Exchequers paper (CP(78) 122).    He and theChancellor of the Exchequer would avoid going beyond this, and ifthere were any unexpected developments at the Council he wouldreserve his position and consult the Cabinet again before modifying the United Kingdom stance.    In the remaining days before theEuropean Council it would be essential to avoid any impression thatthe Cabinet had taken a final view, in order not to prejudice our negotiating position.    The Cabinet agreed that, if the United Kingdomdid not accede to the exchange rate mechanism, but the Irish Republicdid, it might be necessary to impose exchange control on transactionsbetween the two countries.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer should discuss urgently with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland andthe Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster the extent and timing ofthese controls.    The Lord President of the Council should arrangefor a debate in the House of Commons on those Community instrumentwhich might be needed to give effect to the decisions to the EuropeanCouncil.    This should take place before the Finance Council meetingon 18 December.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office30 November 19789
