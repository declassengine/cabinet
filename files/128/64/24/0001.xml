*eign1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he and the Foreign and^AIRS Commonwealth Secretary had received valuable reports fromMr Cledwyn Hughes during his mission to Southern Africa and he hade*ia now had an opportunity of talking to Mr Hughes on his return.    It was clear that his tour had enabled Mr Hughes to rebuild old friendships in,tviou8 the area and this had greatly assisted him in his task.    Mr Hughes hadij^rence: reported that nearly everyone to whom he had spoken was prepared to.^&apos;8) 40th agree to attend an all-party conference if the Prime Minister were tofusions, call one; but that in his view such a conference would have no prospect^ute 2 of success in the present circumstances.    The Patriotic Front would notsit down with Mr Smith unless he would hand over power to them ordepart from the scene.    Mr Smith said he would attend and that hewould st^p down after the elections on 20 April.    Mr Smith seemedconfident that if he could carry on until then, he would be able to form agovernment of national unity, and he clearly believed that after theelections the United States Administration would be unable to resist pressure from Congress to lift sanctions as a result of the Case/JavitsAmendment.Mr Hughes considered that the South African Government had the powerto put pressure on Mr Smith and had suggested that, as a means of getting them to do so, there might be advantage in inviting him toattend a meeting between President Carter of the United States,Prime Minister Bctha of South Africa and the Prime Minister himself.This was not an attractive prospect, but he would be prepared toconsider it if it looked like providing a real chance of getting Mr Smithto move.    He proposed to stay on an extra day in Guadeloupe, afterChancellor Schmidt of the Federal Republic of Germany and president Giscard of France had left, with a view to having a longprivate talk with President Carter about the whole situation and what should be the next steps.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECR.ETARY said that he had recently talked with Chief Chirau, who had made it clear that he wasconscious of the dangerous situation in the Tribal Trust Lands.Chief Chirau was tryiug desperately to get involved in talks withMr Mugabe and aMr Nkomo, and this in itself was an indication that theinternal settlement was beginning to crack.    The problem was how tosecure the departure of Mr Smith.     We should certainly make all theuse we could of South African Government pressure, but this would depend on what happened over Namibia.    There was a reasonable chance that by the time of the Guadeloupe meeting the South african government would have accepted the proposal for a second electionunder United Nations auspices and, if so, a meeting betweenPrime Minister Botha and President Carter might be possible.Mr Botha wanted such a meeting and was more interested thanMr Vorster had been in improving relations with the West.    But if thesituation over Namibia went badly there would be much less prospect of
being able to act in co-operation with the South African government over Rhodesia.    The South Africans1 confidence in Mr Smith had beenshattered by his sudden announcement of his intention to set up agovernment of national unity after the elections, of which he had given them no warning at their meeting with him a few days earlier.The Cabinet -Took note.Wrial 2. the secretary of state for energy said that the latestoil Rsinformation was that the offers made by the major oil companies hadbeen rejected by the union negotiators.    Industrial action had already begun in British Petroleum, Esso, Shell and Texaco.    Shop stewards inall those companies had called for a strike from 3 January.    If we wereto be in a position to introduce the Services contingency plan in time tomeet this situation we should need to give immediate warning to the160 instructors to be ready to start training on 26 December and to themain body of Servicemen, amounting to 15, 000 including command and administration, to be ready to start training on 30 December. a proclamation of a State of Emergency would have to be made on29 December and oil tankers requisitioned from the companies on thefollowing day.    At that point regulations would be introduced restrictingconsumption to essential services amounting to about 7j per cent of normal deliveries;  and the list could be increased to allow for about30 per cent of deliveries by 6 January when the deployment of Service-men would be completed.    Parliament would have to be recalled inorder to extend the emergency regulations by Affirmative Resolution not later than 5 January.    If the Services contingency plan was to be implemented he saw no alternative to declaring a State of Emergency,because of the need to requisition the oil companies&apos; vehicles and to exempt the Services from certain regulations applying to Heavy goods vehicles drivers.    This scenario would ensure that by the timeParliament was recalled at least the initial deliveries by Servicemenwould be taking place, even though the full deployment had not beenreached.    But it took two-and-a-half weeks at least from the time ofthe initial warning to the Servicemen until the full implementation of theServices contingency plan and the warning could hardly fail to becomepublicly known very quickly, with the possibility of adverse reactionsfrom the unions.    It would be much better therefore if we could avoid the use of Servicemen and, with this in view, he and the Secretary ofState for Employment had therefore suggested to Mr Evans andMr Ashwell of the Transport and General Workers Union (TGWU) on18 December the possibility that in the event of a strike the unions mightthemselves accept responsibility for emergency supplies.    The union representatives had agreed to consider this and he had given Mr Evanson the morning of 19 December a note of what would be involved if the
unions were prepared, as an alternative to the use of Servicemen, toundertake to effect deliveries for essential services as defined by theGovernment.     He had told Mr Evans that in any case there would need to be an Order under the 1976 Energy Act promulgating the list of essential services.     Mr Evans had told him that he was working to getthe strike deferred and both he and Mr Ashwell had agreed to put theirweight behind the idea of essential services being supplied by the unionsrather than by Servicemen.     He expected to get an answer fromMr Evans later that day on the basis of the description of the scheme andthe list of essential services which he had given him.    If the unions wereprepared to run an emergency scheme we could avoid the need to declarean emergency or to recall Parliament.    He hoped therefore that theTGWU would agree that this was the best course to follow. Therewould certainly be difficulties about it and we would have to havealternative arrangements so that, if it were to fail, we could fall backon the Services contingency plan.     But he would prefer to delayinitiating any action to implement this plan on a day-to-day basis untilthe unions&apos; decision was known.     He would report to his colleagues onthe outcome of his meeting with Mr Evans later in the day.In discussion it was reported that although there were some differences between the offers made by the individual companies the general basiswas to increase the basic rate to  80, subject to agreement on specificproductivity proposals.     These offers involved total increase s of 12-13 percent but the companies maintained that the excess over 5 per cent wouldbe funded by the productivity proposals.     So far however there were no signs that the unions were prepared to accept anything other than a basic rate increase of 13 per cent, with productivity additions over and above that.     We did not know what the companies&apos; attitude would be as a resultof the abandonment of sanctions.     We certainly could not advise them tosettle outside the guidelines, but it would be a different matter if theywere to come to us with an increased offer based on their owncommercial judgment.     We might have to consider turning a blind eyeto a figure above the guidelines since we were not in a position toimpose sanctions, but so far we had no standard on which to judge whatlevel might be tolerable.     There would be advantage in playing for timeand it was encouraging that Mr Evans was evidently working in thisdirection.    Although the shop stewards&apos; attitude had been militant sofar, they had in the end acted reasonably last year a-id it was not at allcertain now that given time they would go to the extent of an all-outstrike.In further discussion it was pointed out that if the Services plan was putinto operation early in January it would be essential that warning shouldbe given both to the instructors and to the main body at the latest by21 December.     Thereafter the Servicemen would disperse on leaveuntil 2 January and it would be virtually impossible to contact them witha view to putting them on notice while they were away.    If therefore the
initial warning haJ to be delayed until after the New Year the contingencyplan could not be in full operation until 19 January.     This would mean aweek or more with no petrol and no service deliveries at a time when parliament would have to be recalled in order to approve the emergency regulations.     If Servicemen were to be brought in an EmergencyProclamation would be needed.     Without such a Proclamation variouslegal problems would arise in connection with the operation of the oil companies&apos;vehicles by the Services and the oi] companies would probably in aay case be unwilling to allow them to be used except on the basis of a statutory requisitioning Order.     Nevertheless the Services operation would be a difficult one and while they would certainly do their best themaximum they would be able to supply would be 25-30 per cent of normaldeliveries, if all went well.     From every point of view however it wouldbe preferable to a&quot;oid having to introduce Servicemen if there were any possibility of an alternative way of meeting the requirements of essential services.     The idea that the unions might undertake to supply essential services was therefore attractive and there would be advantage in fullyexploring the possibilities.     But we could not yet be certain whether, ifthe unions were prepared in principle to take this on, thay would acceptthe Government1 s list of essential services.     Moreover, there were some serious risks involved.     We would have to be sure that the union leaders would be capable of enforcing on a country-wide basis any arrangement they made, since otherwise essential services would be veryvulnerable to action by local militants who were not prepared to acceptwhat their leaders had agreed.     We must not get into a situation where,if an arrangement with the unions were to break down, we had made no alternative plan to fall back on the use of Servicemen.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the action which had so far been taken with the TGWUand invited the Secretary of State for Energy and the Secretary of Statefor Employment to continue their discussions with Mr Evans. their first aim should be to persuade the TGWU to postpone the threatenedstrike.    In doing so they should make it clear, in a non-provocativemanner, that the Governments prime concern was to protect thecommunity by at least keeping essential services going.     The Govern-ment would prefer to achieve this by voluntary agreement with the union and did not want to use troops if this could be avoided.     It would however be failing in its duty if it did not take all the necessaiy precautionary stepsagainst a failure to agree on effective voluntary arrangements or againstthe breakdown of any such arrangements at a later stage. TheGovernments position would be indefensible if it relied on voluntary arrangements alone and it subsequently emerged that essential services,eg hospitals, in any part of the country were unable to obtain the suppliesthey needed.    It should be made clear to Mr Evans that the timetable forthe deployment of troops in the event of a strike starting on 3 Januaryrequired those concerned to be given notice of possible recall before theydeparted for their Christmas leave, ie at the latest on Thursday21 December.    The Government would have no option but to give this
warning on that day unless they were absolutely sure before then that thestrike had been postponed.     Equally, the Government might, depending on events, need to take powers under the Energy Act 1976 at an early stage.     Whether the Government proceeded thereafter through the subsequent stages of proclaiming a State of Emergency, recallingParliament and beginning the training and deployment of troops would depend on whether the TGWU were able to give the Government copper-bottomed guarantees that their organisation at all levels - national,regional and local - would be able and willing to implement the voluntary arrangements in a satisfactory and continuing manner. Inaddition to the further approach to the TGWU on the lines described theCabinet also authorised confidential discussions at regional level betweenthe representatives of the military, police and transport authorities andof the oil companies.     The question of issuing an initial warning to themilitary instructors should be considered further on the following day.Given that no further meeting of the Cabinet was likely to be possible before the Mew Year the Cabinet was prepared to delegate full authority inthese matters to himself, aided by the Ministerial Sub-Committee on pay negotiations suitably augmented by the addition of the relevantDepartmental Ministers.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.-IC3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary,Treasury, a draft of Part 1 of the Public Expenditure White Paper,CI^DlTURE        together with a minute dated 11 December from the Chief Secretary,L Treasury, to the Prime Minister, covering the remaining parts.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the White Paperf0Us embodied the decisions taken by the Cabinet in October.    In the last&apos;a?Ce: White Paper, the economic projections had been deleted at the Cabinet&apos;s^ request because they Jooked too much like a Government forecast. This^sion8, year, he had included three alternative projections of different ways inwhich the economy might develop.     There was thus no danger that these would be regarded as forecasts.    He had also added a new table,showing the cost of different kinds of tax relief.     He proposed to publish the White Paper in the middle of January.     The Expenditure Committeewould then require about four weeks to consider the White Paper, after which in the normal course a debate would take place.     The Governmenthad never succeeded in carrying a vote in favour of past White Papers.The timing of the debate therefore required careful consideration.5
In discussion a number of drafting changes were made.a. The chart on page iv.  should be deleted.     On the samepage, the reference to social security should be amended so asto cover child benefits, pensions, etc, and avo?d the impression that the whole of this programme was devoted to supplementary benefit.b. Paragraph 14 should be reordered so as to start with the reference to the underlying rate of growth in public expenditureof 2^-3 per cent.c. Paragraph 21. A reference should be added to the recent increase in oil prices and the likely effects on the United Statesand world economies.d. Paragraphs 30-31.     This section on prices and earningsshould include references to the co-operation of the trade unionsduring the first two stages of incomes policy, and to the substantial increase in real earnings between 1977 and 1978.e. The unemployment assumption used for the purposes of thesocial security programme, set out in paragraph 10 on page2.12. 4 of Part 2, should be amended to a consistent projection of1. 315 million unemployed throughout the period. Consequentialamendments might be needed elsewhere in the text.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet approved the publication of the White Paper with the draftingchanges agreed.     The Chief Secretary, Treasury, had discretion tomake any final adjustments to the figures which might be necessary.The White Paper should be published as soon as possible after the Houseresumed in the middle of January.     The timing of the debate could beconsidered later in the light of the Parliamentary situation.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited the chief secretary, Treasury, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office19 December 19786
