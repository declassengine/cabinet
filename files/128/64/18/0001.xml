Uj^^^MENTARy   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Secretary of State for social services was about to circulate to his colleagues a speaking note onincreases in retirement pensions and child benefit.    The Governmenthad an impressive record on these matters and it would be a suitablesubject for Ministerial speeches and statements over the weekend.Such speeches would be a useful preparation for the debate on the pensioners&apos; Payments Bill which would take place on Monday13 November.The Cabinet -Took note.CY 2. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that, as heevjQ^ had informed the Cabinet two weeks earlier, discussions with the 8 Trades Union Congress (TUC) had been continuing since the Labour^?81 Party Confer ence.    They had intensified over the last few days,Scljig?^1 culminating in a series of very long and very tough meetings. Thete  0ri8&apos; Government had not conceded any ground over the 5 per cent payguideline.    The TUC had not weakened in their adherence to theprinciple of free collective bargaining.    But the TUC accepted theneed to moderate the rate of increase of the Retail Price Index (RPI).He now hoped it would be possible to agree a statement on pay policy with the TUC in the next few days.    This would include the guidancewhich the TUC would give to negotiators, placing new emphasis on theimportance of keeping prices down.    It would also record agreement about a new series of meetings with the TUC about the developmentof the economy and in particular about price movements and theeffect of pay settlements on them.    The Government for its part would concede that the price consequences of pay settlements above5 per cent would be one consideration to be taken into account in deciding whether to impose sanctions.    This would import anadditional element of flexibility into pay policy.    The ministers concerned, in consultation with the TUC and with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) were now looking at new ways of strengthening the Price Commission in support of this policy, and of increasing theintervals between price increases.    They were also considering withthe TUC the scope for some new agreement on the low paid and onthe extension of the principle of comparability in the public services.This last would help in particular with the important negotiations inthe public sector over the next few weeks.    The TUC were examininga fresh draft of this statement and it was hoped to have a further meeting with them the next day.    If this went well, the statement1
might be endorsed by the General Council of the TUC on 21 november and published thereafter.    Both sides had been determined to secure an agreement if at all possible.    If obtained, it would mean that the tuc was moving into a position of helpful neutrality over pay policy,as in the previous round.    This approach carried risks for theGovernment, and it would be represented by their opponents as asell-out to the trade unions.    It was therefore important that theGovernment should reaffirm their fundamental position on theimportance of controlling inflation.    But agreement on these lines would bring advantages to both sides, and help to maintain good relations with the TUC despite their formal opposition to any kindof structured pay policy.In discussion, there was general welcome for the efforts which hadbeen put into securing a fresh agreement with the TUC.    It was argued that such an agreement would help to maintain confidence in sterling in a difficult period.    It should be presented as part of an overall strategy directed to the control of inflation.    Other measuresmight be needed to reinforce it.    The extension of the principle of comparability in the public services, while useful in the short term,might lead to serious problems later.    There was a case forre-examining the whole question of comparability in the public sectorin due course.    In the present situation, there was a risk that itwould be used to exploit excessive wage increases gained by particular groups of key workers.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet welcomed the progress which had been made in discussions with the TUC.    There would be an opportunity for a fuller discussion at their meeting the following week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.2
^^1UM 3* THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER informed theHati^^^ Cabinet that the Bank of England would announce that morning anincrease in the Minimum Lending Rate (MLR) from 10 per cent to^ . 12^ per cent.    This move had been made necessary by recent^ 0Us developments in the market, in which the MLR had becomeZy^^QQ: increasingly out of line with other rates at home and abroad. BankC0jlcj &apos; ^lst lending had been expanding rather faster than was desirable. HeJ^^UsiQns, would be announcing that afternoon the &quot;roll-over&quot; of the monetarye ^ targets.    The new range would be calculated from a somewhat lowerbase, and therefore represented a slight tightening of monetary policy.The result of the MLR increase would be that market rates would riseby between $ per cent and 1 per cent.    It was unlikely that there wouldbe any immediate impact on building societies, who were in any eventexpected to increase their rates in January.    This firm action onthe monetary front would reinforce the Government1 s determination to maintain the pay policy along the lines already discussed.The Cabinet -Took note.4. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat discussions in the Secuiity Council about Namibia had been going%on for nearly two weeks.    The Africans had initially circulated aa draft resolution calling for immediate comprehensive sanctions against South Africa but in negotiations with the Five WesternJ6fef0Us membsrs of the Security Council had been prevailed upon to modify^7o?Ce: this.    Their latest text provided for sanctions in the event of failure by South Africa to comply with the Security Council resolution on8*0lls, elections.    We would try to secure amendments to this which wouldmake it possible for us to accept it and he still hoped that we wouldbe able to avoid casting a veto.    At present, however , we could notbe certain of this and the important thing was to ensure that if wehad to veto we should not do so alone.    It was proving difficult to pindown all the rest of the Five.    Although so far the line taken in washington was firm enough, the United States Mission in New Yorkwere unpredictable.    There were also signs that the French mightbe prepared to go along with a resolution containing a greater degreeof commitment to sanctions than we could accept.    The Five werebeing criticised for the agreement they had reached with the SouthAfrican Government and there was a feeling among the Africans thatwe ought to have taken a tougher line.    In his view, the agreement reached was a good deal better than it might have been. Althoughcontradictory statements had been made in South Africa, his ownimpression was that the South African Government intended to stickto their undertaking to hold elections under United Nations auspices
and to play down the elections which were to take place in December.Unfortunately the Administrator General was not fully under controland was taking a somewhat independent line with the aim of building up the December elections, to which he had invited a number offoreign observers, including some Labour Members of Parliament.If we had to exercise a veto the Africans would certainly protestloudly, if only for the public record.    But it was hard to tell whetherthey were expecting us to veto sanctions or whether they would begenuinely surprised if we did.    Some of the more sensible african countries, such as Zambia, recognised the importance of trying tomaintain South African co-operation over Rhodesia.    But there wasa change of atmosphere in South Africa itself as a result of the resignation of Dr Mulder (Minister of Plural Relations andDevelopment) and the Prime Minister&apos;s warning about possible press censorship and, as we had seen before, the situation could deterioratevery rapidly.    It was difficult to forecast how things would develop,but our aim was to act in concert with the Five and the United KingdomAmbassador to the United Nations had clear instructions that heshould not, without prior reference back to London, cast a veto in isolation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatthe Cabinet agreed that the Foreign and Commonwealth secretary should continue his efforts to secure amendments to the resolution which would make it unnecessary for us to cast a veto.    We should certainly not wish to veto alone and we should continue to concertour action with others of the Five, particularly the Americans. Inan extreme case however we could not allow a resolution to go through which might, for example, commit us to cut off all our trade with south Africa and support a blockade.    If we were faced with such aresolution we would expect our partners in the Five to vote with usagainst it.    But if there was any doubt about this we might in the worst case have to act alone and possibly at short notice.    In this case the Cabinet must leave it to the Foreign and commonwealth secretary to undertake the maximum possible consultation in thecircumstances, but they would have to recognise that he might have very little time to do this before a vote was taken.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion and invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaryto be guided accordingly.4
^ THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that bypt hi8 current actions in arresting Mr Hoveyda, who had been Prime^jviou8 Minister for 13 years, and the former Chief of Police, the ShahfhCnCe: appeared to be trying to erase his past.    But he also seemed to be^     37th prepared at last to clamp down on corruption by the Royal Family,\^   u8ions, which showed that he had learned a major lesson from recent events.e ^ December seemed likely to be a difficult month during the period ofMuharram.    If the Shah got through this on the basis of the presentmilitary government, there was a possibility that he might be able tomove to civilian government thereafter, and he was still maintaining that he intended to hold elections in June 1979.    But the future prospects were doubtful.    Whatever his faults it was still in our interests that the Shah should remain in power.    A military government without him would be no improvement and a government under the anti-British Ayatollah Khomeini would be far worse.a THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^6vj conditions in Zambia were becoming very difficult.    Food was getting&quot;^0U8 scarce and many other goods were in short supply.    There had been-^g.nce: a number of cases of Whites being beaten up and representations had&quot;\lu ?^*h been made to the Zambian High Commissioner in London.    This hadkij^ ^ons, led to some helpful newspaper editorials, but, as a sign of the way in which events were moving, it was significant that President Kaundawas clearly anxious not to publicise the aid which he was receivingfrom us.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thathostilities between Tanzania and Uganda resulted from a long standingborder dispute.    This had been the subject of arbitration by theOrganisation for African Unity, after which both sides had agreed tokeep their forces away from the border.    Tanzania had stuck to thisagreement but Uganda had broken it and had thus gained militaryadvantage.    The Tanzanian Government were saying that they would continue to fight, but the level of efficiency of their forces was nothigh.    President Nyerere had asked us for some arms and his requestcould be met largely by the speeding up of delivery of existing orders.It was encouraging that in his time of need he had turned to twoCommonwealth countries, the United Kingdom and Canada, for help and we should do what we could to respond.    The Ugandan forces had some fairly sophisticated equipment and the most probable outcome wasthat President Amin would choose his moment to withdraw with someflamboyant gesture.    We were discussing with British oil companiesmeasures which could be taken to reduce the supply of oil reachingUganda through Kenya, and the companies were able to use the Iraniansituation as justification for this action.
THE PRIME MINISTER said that he hoped the Cabinet would agreeto modest supplies of military equipment going to Tanzania in response to President Nyerere1 s request, although they would no doubt welcomeany sign that recipients of our assistance were prepared to reduce their continuing public criticism of us.The Cabinet -2. Took note.5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of two memoranda byJtoNS the Prime Minister (CP(78) 91 and CP(78) 94) about the question of a* further inquiry following the Bingham Report into Rhodesian sanctions.er Inquiry They also had before them a minute dated 19 October, from theteyj Secretary of State for Energy to the Prime Minister advocating that^0Us such an inquiry should be carried out by a Parliamentary Selectet*ce: Committee.\tfe8l0n8, THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet had agreed to take stock of the position following the debate in the House of Commons earlier in the week.    The parallel debate in the House of Lords would takeplace later that day, and the Cabinet could not therefore take final decisions at this stage.    It would nevertheless be useful for theCabinet to consider whether there should be a further inquiry, and if so what form it should take;  what its terms of reference might be;its composition;  and the question of its access to Cabinet papers, evenif for the moment its conclusions had to be provisional.In discussion, there was wide agreement that some form of furtherinquiry was now inevitable following the debate in the House ofCommons.    The debate had failed to close the incident.    There weremajor discrepancies between the speeches of some of the formerMinisters who had been most concerned.    Further inconsistencies mightbe revealed by the debate in the House of Lords.    Nearly all those members who I*ad spoken favoured a further inquiry.    This includedall who had spoken from the Labour benches, and in particularSir Harold Wilson.    The views expressed in a private meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party had similarly supported a fresh inquiry.A few Opposition speakers had argued against an inquiry, and theOpposition front bench had avoided taking up a firm position. Someof the immediate passions aroused by the Bingham Report had dieddown.    It was possible that, once the difficulties inherent in a furtherinquiry were displayed to the House, it would reject a further inquiryon a free vote.    But this seemed unlikely, and the Government couldnot control the situation.    It would not be possible to take a final view on the question without considering the form such an inquiry might take.
but the general view in the Cabinet was that an inquiry of some sortwould be almost inevitable.It was also argued that the House of Commons would expect anyinquiry to be carried out by a Select Committee.    There was a strong case for meeting the wishes of the House.    The accountability of theexecutive to Parliament was an important constitutional principle.The events to be reviewed by the inquiry had taken place underGovernments of both Parties.    The issues were essentially politicaland were best understood by Parliamentarians.    A Select Committeewas the best means of commanding the support of the House for theresults of the inquiry.    Against this, it was argued that a SelectCommittee would be an opportunity for further unjustified vindictiveattacks on the character of former Ministers.    A similar use had beenmade of Congressional committees during the McCarthy era in theUnited States.    The mounting irresponsibility of Select committees in recent months was an additional factor to be taken into account. a select Committee might be overtaken by a General Election, and its composition might therefore need to change during the course of itsinquiry.    This problem might be eased if a joint committee of bothHouses were established.    This would also help in securing the attendance of former Ministers who were members of the House ofLords.    But the report of a Select Committee would eventually be debated in the House of Commons.    There was a real danger that theOpposition would close ranks in defence of its own former leaders,whereas the Parliamentary Labour Party would remain divided andits former leaders might be pilloried as a result.In further discussion it was suggested that the alternative of a tribunal established under the 1921 Tribunals of Inquiry (Evidence) Actwas to be avoided if at all possible.    The proceedings would be very long and expensive;  those of the Tribunal into the Crown Agents affairwere expected to last for up to two years and to cost  3 million. Theadvantage of the 1921 Act procedure lay in avoiding the need for fresh legislation, and in the clear code of conduct laid down for suchtribunals by the Royal Commission under Lord Salmon.An alternative considered in further discussion was the creation of aSpecial Commission by a fresh Act of Parliament.    While such legislation might be controversial, and could involve repeating the debate just ended, it would emphasise the unique character of the inquiry and help to avoid the creation of a damaging precedent.Such commissions had been established in the past, starting in 1888.The most recent example was that created by an Act of 1916 to investigate the Dardanelles campaign.    Legislation was needed togive such inquiries the powers of the High Court to compel theproduction of evidence.7
It was further argued that it was important to give any inquiry theright terms of reference.    Once these were agreed, many of theother problems would fall into place.    The Prime Minister had suggested, in paragraph 4 of CP(78) 91, a possible formula whichcovered most of the ground.    The Secretary of State for Energy inhis minute of 22 September had proposed a rather broader version.Since the inquiry would in effect deal with the way the Governmenthad worked, it was important that it should be able to consider whohad said what to whom.    It must cover both official advice to ministers and the information provided by the oil companies.Although the conduct of the oil companies was a matter presentlybeing considered by the Director of Public Prosecutions, it seemed likely that a further inquiry might prejudice those prosecutions;this was a price that must be paid.    However, the main focus ofinterest now lay in the political actions of Ministers and their immediate advisers.    Clear ground rules for the inquiry would be needed;  but these need not all be set out in the terms of reference,or embodied in legislation.    It might be sufficient for the Governmentto indicate the way in which the inquiry might work in time for theHouse of Commons to consider the matter.On the question of composition, it was aigued that the confidentialityof Cabinet documents would be best preserved if the members of the inquiry were all Privy Counsellors.    If necessary, further PrivyCounsellors could be created for the purpose.    If the inquiry was to command the confidence of the House and in particular of theParliamentary Labour Party, it was important to include among its members some backbenchers of undoubted integrity and independencewhose credentials would be acceptable to those who were pressing for an inquiry.    Against this it was argued that to create additionalPrivy Counsellors implied the creation of two classes of Member ofParliament:  those who could be trusted and those who could not.The membership of the inquiry should be drawn from both Houses.Although it would be difficult to spare a leading judge for the purpose,it might be best if the Chairman of the inquiry came from the judiciary and was already a member of the House of Lords. while some members of the House of Commons might object to theintrusion of a non-political figure, proper leadership from theGovernment benches should ensure acceptance of such an appointment.It would certainly help to secure general public confidence in the inquiry.    However, if individual members were to be named in special legislation, there was a danger that the House of commons would seek to amend the list.    Advance consultation both within theParliamentary Labour Party and with the official Opposition wastherefore essential.In discussion of the question of access to Cabinet papers, it wassuggested that it would be helpful to explain the relevant considerations to the House of Commons before a final decision was taken.    If it
were decided to make such documents available, the procedure would be that the Prime Minister would submit the matter toThe Queen for her approval.    He would make it clear that he had secured the advance approval of Sir Harold Wilson and Mr Heath,since the papers in question were those of their Administrations.It would also be desirable to consult the present Leader of theOpposition.In favour of the release of the documents, it was argued that the conflict of evidence given by different former Ministers made thisinevitable.    A full inquiry could not be made without access to the relevant documents.    Direct quotation from certain papers might be needed in order to exonerate individuals whose conduct was in question.Former Ministers would not necessarily come out badly from such an inquiry.    Some papers, of Cabinet Committees rather than of fullCabinet, had already been handed over to the Bingham Inquiry bymi stalee.    In any case, not all Cabinet documents should be automatically secret.    Some were genuinely secret, such as those on military preparations.    These must clearly be safeguarded.Others were papers whose publication at the time would merely bea temporary inconvenience.    They need no longer be covered byautomatic secrecy.    The assumption at the inquiry should be that all relevant Cabinet papers should be made available unless theGovernment was prepared to say that it was in the national interestthey should not be published.    Alternatively, defined classes of paperscould be withheld.    Since witnesses would be cross-examined on thebasis of such papers, it was important that the inquiry should be free to quote passages from them in their report in support of their conclusions.Against this, it was argued that the publication of any cabinet documents would create a dangerous precedent.    For example, itwould be quite wrong for any Select Committee to be given access tothe Cabinet papers about the decision to abolish the StormontGovernment in Northern Ireland, if only because to do so might placelives at risk.    The secrecy of Cabinet papers was an inherent partof Cabinet Government.    If it were abandoned, other and lessdesirable forms of secrecy would take its place.    Another problem was the sheer bulk of documents to be considered.    There had been at least 25 committees concerned with Rhodesian sanctions in theperiod between 1965 and 1970;  hundreds of papers were involved.The present clamour for the publication of Cabinet papers would soondie down and extreme claims should be resisted.9
In further discussion of this point, it was urged that some preliminary sifting of the papers would in any case be needed. the inquiry could not be expected to master the complete documentation.It might properly be left to the Chairman to examine the papers and decide which ones were relevant to the inquiry.    If former Ministers,having examined the papers to which they were entitled to have access,wished to refer to other documents, the Chairman would no doubtpermit this.    Some evidence might have to be heard in camera, butthis was not unprecedented.    Certain parts of the final report and ofthe supporting evidence might need to be edited.    This would help toavoid any repercussions for the current political situation. Thepresent Government would have to retain the final right to refuse toproduce documents.    Members of the present Cabinet who had beenMinisters in previous Administrations might have to be prepared togive evidence and they too might well feel the need for access to the relevant documents even when they had not seen them at the time.In general, the inquiry would have to proceed on a basis of trust andin particular Parliament and the public would have to trust the inquiry not to suppress vital evidence.    At the same time theGovernment should take whatever steps were open to it in the processof establishing an inquiry to retain as much control over thepublication of Government documents as circumstances permitted.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet could not take final decisions until the completion of theHouse of Lords debate.    The best course might well be to establish a special commission by Act of Parliament though other arrangements could not yet be ruled out.    The terms of reference of an inquirymight be based upon those set out in paragraph 4 of his paper cp(78) 91, although the modifications suggested by the Secretary ofState for Energy should be carefully considered.    Once establishedany inquiry would of course have control over its own procedures.It wo :ld therefore be very important to indicate before it was established the basis on which the Government could co-operateparticularly in regard to the provision of, and possible subsequentquotation from, Cabinet documents.    It would also be necessary tosettle in advance questions such as whether witnesses could be legallyrepresented and have the right of cross-examination.    The LordChancellor should take the chair of a small group of the ministers most directly concerned to consider these matters further and make recommendations to the Cabinet at its next meeting.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the LordChancellor to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office9 November 1978
