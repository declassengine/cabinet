CABINET 66 (50)/contents minute no. subject      Sir Stafford Cripps2     Yugoslavia        ...      ......Economic Assistance.3     Leasehold Reform4     Rent Restriction Acts   ......
1. The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinefs-last meetingthe Government had lost, by the resignation of Sir Stafford Crippson grounds of ill-health, the services of one of its leading members.He knew that all his colleagues would share his deep regret atSir Stafford&apos;s resignation and the ill-health which had occasioned it.They would hope that, after a year&apos;s respite from the burdens of public life, Sir Stafford Cripps would be fully restored to health and able to resume his invaluable work for the Labour movement.! The Cabinet warmly endorsed the Prime Minister^ statement and asked him to arrange that a message to this effect should be conveyed to Sir Stafford Cripps on their behalf.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (50) 234)analysing the causes of the current economic distress in yugoslavia and seeking authority to extend to Yugoslavia further credits notexceeding  5 million for the purchase of consumer goods and sterlingfood-stuffs.The Foreign Secretary said that this was a first-aid operationdesigned to prevent the collapse of the existing political regime in yugoslavia. The political and strategic advantages of keeping thatregime in being were certainly worth the expenditure which he proposed. And the offer of these additional credits would give us the opportunity to tender the further economic advice and expertassistance which was necessary if the Yugoslavian economy was to be stabilised. It would be a mistake to try to make it a condition of theloan that Marshal Tito should accept our advice, for that would be inconsistent with our policy of seeking to preserve his independence.But the grant of the credits should add weight to our representations,e.g., in such matters as the repatriation of Greek children; and itshould also improve our prospects of obtaining increased supplies ofsoftwood from Yugoslavia.The Foreign Secretary said that, subject to the cabinet&apos;s approval, he intended to discuss his proposals with the United StatesGovernment; but he would hot delay the offer of the credits until the americans were ready to make a corresponding offer.The President of the Board of Trade said that the recent droughtin Yugoslavia had accelerated the economic collapse with which thecountry had in any event been threatened by reason of the extrava-gance of her investment programme. We should take this opportunityof advising a general curtailment of these development plans, though there were some particular projects, e.g., for the production of aluminium and zinc, which it would be in our interests to forward.Timber exports had been developed to a point at which Yugoslaviahad become one of our principal European sources of supply; butdeliveries under existing contracts were now falling short by reasonof the general disorganisation of the industry. The President proposedthat a special timber mission should be sent from this country to yugoslavia in advance of the general economic mission which theForeign Secretary had in mind. If we could supply about 100 miles of light rails, we might be able to double the export of Yugoslaviantimber within a year or sO.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, stressed the importance of sending a strong economic mission to Yugoslavia with a view to securing a substantial reduction in her investment programme. Unlessher economy could be brought into balance by this means, there couldbe no assurance that the credits which we were proposing to advance would be of any benefit either to Yugoslavia or to ourselves. he asked that the Treasury should be consulted in the choice of theeconomic representatives who were to be sent to Belgrade for thispurpose.-1 b 2
In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) Apart from general) economic advice, the Yugoslavs were alsoin urgent need of technical assistance. Many of their difficulties were due to their lack of experienced administrative and executive staff,and we should do our utmost to supply this need. Thus, the timbermission which the President of the Board of Trade was anxious tosend should include men with special experience of timber felling.(b) Care would have to be taken in offering economic advice tothe Yugoslav Government. It should be remembered that the riftbetween Belgrade and Moscow had been due to economic, rather thanpolitical, differences: it had been caused largely by the attempts ofthe Soviet Government to reduce Yugoslavia^ programme of indus-trial development. The Yugoslavs were, however, conscious of theirshortage of skilled administrative and technical staff; and general economic advice was more likely to be accepted by them if it wereconveyed indirectly through technical missions of this kind.(c) Though most of Yugoslavia^ food requirements must comefrom dollar sources, the United Kingdom could provide supplies ofherring, salted white fish, potato mash, &amp;c; and every effort shouldbe made to persuade the Yugoslavs to accept these supplies.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the grant to Yugoslavia of further credits, notexceeding  5 million, for the purchase of consumer goods and sterling food-stuffs.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the President of theBoard of Trade to proceed with the detailed arrangementsset out in paragraph 12 of CP. (50) 234.   .(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the President of the Board of Trade toconsider, in the light of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion, how theeconomic and technical missions which it was proposed tosend to Yugoslavia could best be organised.leasehold reform.(previous reference:CM. (50) 65thConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandumby the Lord President and the Lord Chancellor (CP. (50) 232) on thequestion whether temporary legislation should be introduced to relievecurrent cases of hardship in the tenancy of residential premises andshops. The Cabinet had also before them a memorandum by the attorney-General (CP. (50) 238), prepared in the light of the cabinets discussion on the previous day, suggesting the heads of temporarylegislation restricted to the continuation of long building-leases.The Attorney-General said that the trend of the Cabinet&apos;s discus-sion on the previous day had been in favour of a temporary measureof strictly limited scope, because of the difficult questions of policy andlaw which would arise if temporary legislation covered a wide field.He therefore proposed that temporary protection should be confined to long building-leases. The type of case to which most attention hadbeen drawn was that of the tenant who was paying a ground rentunder a long lease which was on the point of expiry and regarded thehouse as being in effect his own since he or his predecessors built orpaid for it. It was difficult to get reliable information on the extentof the problem and these cases might be less numerous than wassometimes suggested. Moreover, a Bill limited in the manner whichhe suggested would not cover many of the cases of hardship arisingout of tenancy agreements, and there might be political difficulties in securing its acceptance because attention would be drawn to the largenumber of cases of hardship which it did not cover. ! He still believed,however, that it would be unwise to try to cover a wider field in temporary legislation; but he suggested that no time should be lost in framing permanent legislation giving a right to a renewal of expiringleases on equitable terms and to leasehold enfranchisement.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Attorney-General&apos;s proposals would safeguard theposition of occupiers who held building-leases which were on thepoint of expiry in areas such as South Wales and Lanarkshire. Itwould also cover the case where the head lease had fallen in and,under a recent legal decision, the sub-tenant had no protection underthe Rent Acts. It would not deal with various other Rent Actsanomalies, such as the unprotected position of the occupiers of partsof large houses, but these anomalies could be dealt with satisfactorilyonly by amendment of the Rent Acts.(b) The Attorney-General&apos;s proposal would mean that the exten-sion of tenancy would in many cases benefit an intermediate landlordwrho was paying the ground rent and exacting a rack rent from the occupier. To protect the occupier in these cases, it would be necessaryto provide that the ground lessee could not contract out of the twoyears&apos; extension of the lease without the consent of the occupier.(c) There was serious objection on grounds of equity to theproposal that an occupying tenant holding direct from the groundlandlord should continue during the temporary period to pay theground rent without increase. Cases would be quoted in which areversion had recently been bought on the assumption that possessionwould be obtained. Unless a higher rent, possibly based on rateable value, was payable during the temporary period there would beallegations of expropriation. Moreover, the failure to require the lessee to pay any additional sum for occupation after the terminationof his lease would not predispose him towards paying a fair sum fora renewal of the lease on a permanent basis or for enfranchisement.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that, in view of the limited class of case covered by the Bill and the short period duringwhich it was to operate, a decision not to increase the rent could bejustified. Moreover, it was proposed in the Attorney-GeneraFsmemorandum that, where the ground lessee was not the occupier, the rent for the temporary period should be such as might be agreed between the parties or in default settled by the county court, on thebasis that it did not exceed the profit made by the intermediate lessee.(d) The Cabinet considered whether a ground landlord shouldbe entitled to gain possession during the temporary period if, in theopinion of the county court, failure to give possession inflicted greaterhardship on him than on the occupier. The general view was that,if part of the grounds for possession set out in the Rent Acts were adopted in these cases, the Government would be strongly pressed toadopt all the grounds there set out; and it was therefore agreed thatno rights to possession should be conferred on the ground landlord.In a temporary measure it seemed reasonable to say that during thetwo years&apos; period there could be no forfeiture in respect of breach ofthe covenant to maintain the premises in a state of repair.(e) The temporary Bill should apply to Crown property ingeneral, but hot to the property of the two Duchies. Doubt was expressed whether a Government Department should be able to secure,possession on a Ministers certificate of need, or whether, if any suchsystem of certification were adopted, it should in a temporary measurebe extended to new towns or blitzed areas. These matters could,however, be discussed further when the Bill had been drafted.(/) Temporary protection in respect of shops should be given onthe lines outlined in paragraph 32 of CP. (50) 232. There would be pressure to extend this protection to offices, and a provision coveringoffices should be drafted for consideration at a later stage.(g) The Bill should be expressed as lasting for two years andshould not contain provision for further extension.The general view of the Cabinet was that a Bill on the general lines outlined in CP. (50) 238 went as far as it was practicable to goin temporary legislation on leases. It would present great political difficulties, because of the narrowness of the field which it covered,but it could be argued in its defence that the practical alternatives in
the present Parliamentary situation were a-limited&apos;Bill of this kind or no temporary legislation at jail- Every endeavour should be made tokeep the temporary Bill as short and simple as possible. And allpossible speed should be made in the framing of permanent legislation on the subject of leasehold reform.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the drafting of temporary legislation on building-leases on the lines set outin CP. (50) 238, as modified in the course of the cabinets discussion, and to arrange for work to proceed forthwith onthe formulation of long-term proposals for leasehold reform.Rent Restriction 4. In the course of the discussion recorded in the precedingActs. Minute attention was drawn to the extent to which hardships arising in connection with tenancies were due to the operation of the RentActs as interpreted by the Courts. A Departmental committee had some time ago reviewed the operation or the Rent Acts, and had recommended that they should be overhauled and brought up-to-date.During the passage of temporary legislation on ground leases, theGovernment would be pressed to declare their intentions about the modification of the Rent Acts, and it would probably be necessaryto say that interdepartmental discussions were in progress with a viewto the introduction of comprehensive amending legislation. before a statement of this kind was made, however, the Cabinet would wishto be informed of the main issues which arose out of the currentworking of the Rent Acts.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Health and the Secretary of State forScotland to submit memoranda on the points at which the rent Acts stood in need of amendment.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20th October, 1950.
