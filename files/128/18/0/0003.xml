Parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theBusmess in the House of Commons in the following week.House of The Secretary of State for Scotland said that in the ScottishCommons. Grand Committee on 11th July there was to be a discussion of theScottish fishing industry in a Supply debate on the Scottish Estimates,v He would be expected to give them some further details of the subsidywhich was to be granted to trawler-owners. This subsidy would, how-ever, be available to the English as well as the Scottish sections ofthe industry, and there might be resentment among English Membersif further information about it were given in the first instance to theScottish Grand Committee. The Cabinet invited the Secretary ofState to consult the Lord President on this point, after he had hadan opportunity of discussing it further with the Minister of Agricultureand the Chief Whip.Business in the In the House of Lords the Governments opposition to theHouse of Liberties of the Subject Bill, introduced by Viscount Samuel, wasLords. being exploited as evidence that the Labour Party were no longerchampions of individual liberty. The Lord Chancellor said that thismisrepresentation was likely to gain still further publicity if, in theCommittee Stage, the Government brought forward amendmentsdesigned to make the particular clauses of the Bill more reasonable and practical. He therefore proposed, after consultation with theLord Privy Seal, to refrain from proposing Government amend-ments and to confine himself to criticism of particular clauses,advising the House to reject them in turn but not necessarily pressinghis opposition to a division.The Cabinet took note, with approval, of the procedure whichthe Government spokesmen proposed to follow in dealing with this bill. If it passed the Lords before the end of the Session, the Govern-ment would not be prepared to give any facilities for its discussion by the House of Commons.Korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 42ndConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee had that morning considered the current situation in Korea. In view ofthe risks to which we were exposed elsewhere in the Far East andSouth-East Asia, it was not proposed that further United kingdom forces should be sent to Korea. It was being suggested to the UnitedStates Government that immediate steps should be taken to initiatean Anglo-American review of the strategic situation in the Far Eastand South-East Asia; and the possibilities of enlisting military assis-tance from Australia and Pakistan were to be urgently explored. Itwas specially important at the present time that preoccupation withKorea should not divert attention from other danger-spots in these areas; and also that we should not allow the situation in the Eastgenerally to blind us to the risks to which we were exposed in Europe.In the Parliamentary debate on the previous day the House ofCommons had given a valuable demonstration of support for theaction taken by the United Kingdom Government in response to theresolution of the Security Council. It was gratifying that there hadbeen no disposition to ventilate legal doubts about the validity of theaction taken by the United States and Commonwealth governments in resisting this act of aggression against South Korea.In the Security Council there was every disposition to avoidfettering the discretion of the United States Commander in themilitary operations in Korea. Some difficulty was, however, beingencountered in devising appropriate procedures for enabling theSecurity Council to keep in touch with the development of the situa-tion and to appear to be exercising some measure of control over theforces which were operating in the name of, if not formally on behalfof, the United Nations.39032The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.b 2
industrial disputes.Strike ofSmithfieidDrivers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 42ndConclusions,Minute 7.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (50) 158) recommending, on behalf of the emergencies committee, that from 10th July Service labour should be used toobtain meat and general provisions from cold stores, and when neces-sary from ships, in the London docks, but that Servicemen so employed in the dock area should handle only essential food-stuffs.The Home Secretary explained that a substantial meat rationwas being distributed in London in the present week, but that thiswould almost exhaust the supplies of meat in the cold stores outsidethe dock area and it would therefore be necessary from 10th July on-wards to use Servicemen to convey meat from cold stores in the dock area. If, as was expected, the dockers refused to deliver meat to coldstores in the dock area where troops were operating, the Servicemenwould have to begin about 12th or 13th July to take meat from theships in the docks. This would probably provoke a dockers&apos; strike:Mr. R. J. Mellish, M.P., who could speak with authority on the atti-tude of the dockers, had confirmed the view which he had expressedin a supplementary Question on 4th July that, if Servicemen began to work in the dock area, the dockers would feel obliged to come out on strike, although many of the men had no wish to stop work.In present circumstances, however, the Emergencies Committee saw no alternative but to use Service labour to bring essential food-stuffsout of the dock area.The Minister of Labour said that there was no present indication that the Smithfield drivers would agree to terms which could bringthe strike to an early end, though they were holding a further meeting that morning. Meanwhile, there were indications that trouble wasbeing fomented elsewhere. An unofficial meeting of shop-stewards inthe road-haulage industry had on the previous evening demanded that air outstanding claims in the industry should be settled within twenty-one days, although in fact there were no such claims outstanding; andthere was some danger that the Smithfield dispute might be extendedin this fashion to other branches of the road-haulage industry andpossibly to passenger transport in London. Some long-term difficulties about the meal times of tug-boatmen had also come to a head: theemployers had wished to stop incipient trouble by threatening to dis-miss any tug-boatmen who refused to observe the long-standingpractice about the taking of meal times and, subject to official views,they were anxious at least to issue a warning that further endeavours to observe fixed meal times, regardless of the state of work, were likelyto lead to dismissal.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While it might be unavoidable that Servicemen should besent to work in the London dock area on 10th July, the repercussionswould probably be serious and all alternative courses ought, therefore,to be thoroughly explored in the short time available. It was, in a sense, playing into the hands of Communist agitators to placethousands of dockers, who had no Communist sympathies and were reluctant to come out on strike, in a position in which they felt obliged to stop work. Moreover, the general position over the wholetransport service was not sufficiently satisfactory to justify ministers in ignoring the danger of widespread stoppages: several groups oftransport workers had grievances which could be exploited. A situa-tion might arise in which there was more work to be done than theServices could cope with, and an appeal for civilian Volunteers might lead to a widespread transport strike. \j(b) Before the war it had been common, in unofficial transportstrikes against the advice of the union, to ask the union concerned toissue permits authorising loyal members of the union to undertake work which the strikers should have performed. The authority ofthe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union over its membersappeared to be weaker than before the war, but it still seemed desir-able to explore with the Union the extent to which resort might be
had to this course. If it were adopted, van-men employed by theCo-operative Societies and the larger retailers could collect meat andother food-stuffs from the cold stores outside and within the dock area. While this might place a strain on the cohesion of the Union,it was unreasonable that the Government should assume the wholeresponsibility for breaking an unofficial strike which was largelydirected against the principal officers of the Union.(c) Stocks of meat in the London cold stores were low at presentbecause imports fell off in the summer and home-killings were not yetrunning at a high figure. Those responsible for the Smithfield stop-page had doubtless timed the strike to take advantage of this situa-tion. It was, therefore, desirable that the handling of meat in theLondon area should be reconsidered with a view to securing, as faras possible, that meat stocks in the cold stores were kept at a sufficiently high level to ensure that at no time of the year could theLondon meat ration be put in sudden jeopardy by a lightningstoppage.id) Was it right that a substantial meat ration should be givenin the present week, when the effect would be to deplete the supplies in the cold stores and possibly, by giving a false sense of security, to deprive the Government of the backing of public irritation againstthe strikers? In reply, it was pointed out that the size of this week&apos;sration had already been announced, and that it was desirable, inorder to secure a regular flow of meat supplies, to issue meat to thepublic as it became available.(e) It was desirable to examine on a long-term basis the circum-stances in which Servicemen were employed in connection with indus-trial stoppages. The extent to which troops had been used in recentstrikes was seriously interfering with Service training. Servicemenshould only be employed for the purpose of maintaining supplies and services essential to the life of the community, and it was perhapsarguable whether the maintenance of London&apos;s meat supplies came within that definition. As against this, it was pointed out that theGovernment had assumed responsiblity for providing food for thepeople.(/) There were signs of a concerted effort by subversive forces to cause as much industrial dislocation as possible at the present time,and it was inexpedient that any unnecessary risks should be taken ofwidening the area of dispute. The employers of the tug-boatmenshould therefore be told that on general grounds it was preferable that they should not issue any warning notice this week.(g) In view of the possible repercussions in present circumstancesof taking criminal proceedings against the instigators of the Smithfieldstrike, it would be useful if the Meat Transport Organisation were asked to consider whether the employers could not in suitable casestake civil proceedings for damages in respect of breach of contract.(h) The Distribution and Marketing Committee were examining the future of Smithfield meat market, in the light of the recurrentlabour trouble there. Their investigation would, however, be con-cerned with the long-term problem, and could not influence thepresent situation. The Minister of Food had made a useful state-ment, in answer to a written Question on 5th July, to the effect thatthe dispersal of the Smithfield market was under consideration.(*) Recent figures showed that the trade unions were makingsubstantial use of the National Arbitration Tribunal. The questionwhether further machinery was necessary or desirable in order toprevent unofficial stoppages was under discussion between the Minis-ter of Defence and the Minister of Labour.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Labour to explore with the transport and General Workers&apos; Union the extent to which thesupply of essential food-stuffs in London could bemaintained by the issue to members of the Unionof permits authorising them to undertake work which
was not being performed because of the unofficial stop-page at Smithfield, and to report the result of his enquiries to the Emergencies Committee.(2) Agreed that, if sufficient supplies of meat and other foodscould not be assured by the method contemplated inConclusion (1) above, the Emergencies Committee shouldbe authorised to employ Servicemen in the London dock area from 10th July for handling essential food-stuffs.(3) Invited the Minister of Food to suggest to the Meat transport organisation that they should consider the question of taking civil proceedings for damages against the ring-leaders of the unofficial stoppage at Smithfield.(4) Invited the Minister of Food to explore the measures whichmight be taken to ensure that several weeks&apos; stock of meatis kept in London cold stores throughout the year, and toreport the result of his investigation to the emergencies committee.(5) Invited the Minister of Labour to advise the employers ofthe tug-boatmen that, on general grounds and subject toany special considerations known to the employers, itwould be preferable not to issue a warning notice whichmight precipitate a stoppage in present circumstances.Cabinet Office, S.WA,6th July, 1950.
