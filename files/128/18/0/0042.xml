1. The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had askedwhen a further statement would be made in the House of Commonsabout the military situation in Korea.It was agreed that a statement confined to the military aspectsof the Korean situation might be made by the Minister of Defence on 7th December.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 294) outlining a number of possible lines of approach to the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers and inviting the Cabinefs views on these beforeinstructions were given to the officials who were to begin discussions in Paris on 7th December With representatives of the united Statesand French Governments 6n the terms of the reply to be sent to theSoviet proposal.The Foreign Secretary said that, although many of the issuescanvassed in his memorandum would be discussed in the current talks between the Prime Minister and President Truman, he was anxiousto avoid postponing the meeting of officials which was to consider what reply Should be sent to the soviet proposal. The existing inter-natlohal tension might be m^fieal&amp;d ifthe Government appeared tobe abandoning their attempt to find means of entering into Four-Power discussions on world problems: the Soviet Government mightinterpret any postponement of the Paris discussions as indicating a radical change of policy in consequence of developments in Korea.He therefore considered that the discussions in Paris should begin as planned, even though they might not be concluded untiltheoutcomeof the Washington talks was known.There was jgenerai agreement with this view. Although the chances of reaching a satisfactory settlement with the &quot;Soviet Govern-ment were,slight, public opinion in this country would not stand firmlyand unitedly behind the Government unless it were felt that all reasonable steps had been taken to settle the many outstanding points of disagreement with Russia.At the same time, the Cabinet felt reluctant to discuss in detail the merits of the Various alternative courses summarised in para^gfaph 7 of &quot;CP. (5G) 294, since many of the main issues were underdiscussion in Washington and the outcome of these talks would greatlyinfluence the Coufse wMch the Cabinet eventually decided to take.Moreover,  dine of the alternative courses raised very important questions of policy, and the course of the talks in Washington mightbe prejudiced if some of these questions were raised in the Parisdiscussions and the United States representatives reported to- Washington their deductions about the current views of the UnitedKingdom Government, for example on such questions as the controlof atomic energy or the unification of Germany on a basis of continued demilitarisation. The Cabinet further agreed that theywould in any event reject the suggestion (Course F in paragraph 7of CP. (50) 294) that the Soviet Government should be called upon toput forward more constructive proposals, since the democraciesshould preserve the initiative at the next stage in the consideration ofthe Soviet proposal. The compilation of a select list of subjects onwhich the democracies should require satisfaction from the Russians(Course E) was less open to objection than some of the other coursesproposed.The Foreign Secretary suggested that the general views of theCabinet at the present juncture could best be met if he instructed hisofficials to attend the Paris discussions with a view to drafting a replyto the Soviet note of 3rd November on lines which would seek tobroaden the agenda of any meeting of the Council of foreign ministers so as to cover, not only German problems, but all the main(previous references:CM. (50) 72ndConclusions,Minute 2, and cm. (50) 81stConclusions,Minute 2.)Germany.soviet proposal for meeting of council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 78thConclusions,Minute 2.)
points of tension between the democracies and Russia. The aimwould be to ensure that, if any Four-Power talks were held, theywould be based on an agenda permitting a general discussion ofthe main problems affecting East and West. He would instruct the officials to try to avoid concluding the Paris discussions until theresults of the Washington talks were known. The discussions mightwell result in alternative draft replies to the Soviet proposal, with an indication of the main differences between the attitude of the UnitedStates, France and the United Kingdom towards the Soviet proposal.His officials would seek to obtain agreement to a draft reply whichimplied that a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers would beheld. They would be careful about the publicity given to their activities and would make it clear that their purpose was to draft a reply to the Soviet Government and not to take decisions on mattersof policy.The Cabinet-Approved the lines of the instructions (as summarised above)which the Foreign Secretary proposed to give to hisrepresentatives in the forthcoming discussions in Parisregarding the terms of the reply to be returned to the soviet proposal for a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,6th December, 1950.
