1. The Prime Minister, on the Cabinefs behalf, extended a welcome to Mr. Hugh Gaitskell&apos; on his first attendance at Cabinetsince the announcement of his appointment as-Chancellor of theExchequer;- . - ^v.^ -    r.-- f.2. The Foreign Secretary said that, in a speech made at theInternational Socialist Conference in Paris, Mr. Morgan Phillips, theSecretary of the Labour Party, was reported to have said that neitherthe British Government nor the Labour Party had made up its mindabout the problem of German rearmament. This report had causedalarm in official circles in Paris and in Washington. The foreign secretary said that he would see Mr. Morgan Phillips as soon as he returned to London, and ascertain whether he had been correctlyreported as purporting to speak on behalf of the United KingdomGovernment. Meanwhile, he was telling the Press that he had nothingfurther to say on this subject beyond what was included in the officialcommunique published at the end of the New York meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council. The negotiations about Germany&apos;s part inthe defence of Western Europe were now at a, very delicate stage; andhe hoped that Ministers would be careful to consult him before making any reference to this question in public speeches over the next fewweeks.The Foreign Secretary said that he was disturbed at the deterioration-tion in the political and economic situation in Palestine. The currentdifficulties of the Israeli Government were largely due to the fact thatthey had encouraged the immigration of larger numbers than the economy of the country could absorb, and that many of these recentimmigrants were people from Eastern Europe who were a less satisfactory type of settler. These difficulties would be enhanced bythe return to Palestine of Jews resident in the neighbouring arab states; and there were indications that the Iraq Government intendeddeliberately to embarrass the Israeli Government by carrying out as rapidly as possible the transfer of their Jewish population to Palestine.Meanwhile, the flow of United States assistance to Palestine wasdecreasing partly because the wealthier members of American Jewrywere out of sympathy with the political objectives of the present israeli government and partly because the Zionist movement had lost its influence in trade union circles in the United States. Moreover, Israeliopposition to the proposals for the internationalisation of Jerusalemhad proved a convenient platform for anti-Jewish propaganda in theUnited States.These troubled conditions in Palestine, added to the insecurity ofthe Egyptian Government, gave cause for anxiety about the stability of the political situation in the Middle East generally.The recent meeting in Prague between M. Molotov and theForeign Ministers of Russia&apos;s satellite States in Eastern Europe had resulted in the publication of new Communist proposals for a settle-ment of the German problem.The Foreign Secretary said that these proposals, with their call for international agreement to prevent the re-militarisation ofGermany, were probably aimed at influencing the French Govern-ment in their attitude towards the United States plan for Germany&apos;sparticipation in the defence of Western Europe. At the same time itwas probably true that the Russians were apprehensive about theconsequences of rearming Germany. And they also appeared to begenuinely anxious that a meeting of the five great Powers should beheld to discuss European problems though it was not clear whetherthey would use such a meeting for the purpose of obstructing the plans of the North Atlantic Treaty Powers or whether they were now prepared to face a realistic settlement of outstanding differences. &apos;The Foreign Secretary also attached some importance to thefailure of the political coup which the Russians had tried to stage un austria.   There seemed no doubt that the Soviet Government were-2 b 2&apos;   -
Japan: peace treaty.(previous reference:CM. (50) 45thConclusions,Minute 6.)nervous about the safety of their lines of communication in eastern europe and also of the position of Soviet citizens in the satellitecountries. There were indications that they might shortly take further steps to consolidate their influence in those countries.The Foreign Secretary said that further efforts must now be madeto persuade the United States Government to come to grips with theproblem of negotiating a peace settlement for Japan. He had instructed His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington to take thismatter up with the United States Government.In discussion it was asked whether there was any reason to fear that the United States Government might wish to use a rearmed japan in resisting Communist encroachments in the Far East. Any suchpolicy would give rise to serious political difficulties. The australian government, for example, might well regard it in much the samelight as the French Government regarded the current american proposals for German participation in the defence of Western Europe.The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Foreign Secretary.United Nations 3. The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations saidSecretary- that, as he understood it, the United Kingdom representative on theGeneral. Security Council (Sir Gladwyn Jebb) was under instructions to abstain(Previous       from voting on any proposal to make a fresh appointment to the reference:      office of Secretary-General of the United Nations. It was conceivableCM. (50) 65th   that the Russians might put forward the name of some person who on conclusions,    merits would be a suitable candidate for this appointment; and in that minute l.)      event an unfortunate impression might be created if Sir Gladwyn Jebbabstained from voting, especially if the candidate was a person ofdistinction from one of the other Commonwealth countries.   he recognised that it would not be possible to leave it entirely toSir Gladwyn Jebb&apos;s discretion to decide whether or not he should vote in favour of any particular candidate; but could it not be arranged that, if some fresh name were proposed, he should secure a shortadjournment for the purpose of obtaining instructions from theGovernment?The Foreign Secretary said that he could not consider thisquestion solely on the basis of the merits of any candidate proposedby the Soviet Government: he must also consider whether it would be wise to support any candidate, however suitable, who was put forward as a tactical manoeuvre by the Russians. He had not, however,excluded the possibility of supporting a candidate nominated by theRussians; and, for his part, he would welcome an adjournment whichwould give him an opportunity of considering the matter and sendingfresh instructions to his representative. He would therefore impress on Sir Gladwyn Jebb the importance of doing his utmost to secure an adjournment for this purpose; but he could not modify the instruc-tion by which, if an adjournment could not be secured, Sir GladwynJebb was to -abstain from voting on any proposal other than that forthe temporary extension of Mr. Trygve Lie&apos;s appointment.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The King&apos;sSpeech onthe Opening ofParliament(previous reference:CM (50) 64thConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 237) covering a revised draft of The King&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The objectives of the United Nations in Korea should be described, in the second paragraph of the Speech, as &quot; achieving a free, democratic and united Korea.&quot;(b) Government supporters were likely to be disconcerted by the reference, in the tenth paragraph of the draft, to the effects of
increased defence expenditure on the Governments social policy. Itwas agreed that this paragraph should be redrafted so as to make itclear that, despite the rearmament programme, the Government would continue to give the same high priority to housing and would maintainthe essentials of their social policy. It could then continue to theeffect that Ministers would do their utmost to ensure that rearmamentshould interfere as little as possible with the maintenance of stablecosts and prices and the continuance of the export drive.(c) The objects of the Economic Planning and Full employment bill should be described, in the opening words of the eleventhparagraph of the Speech, as to defend full employment, to ensure thatthe resources of the community are used to the best advantage and toavoid inflation.(d) Should the description of the Leasehold Reform Bill include a reference to offices as well as shops? In their discussion on20th October the Cabinet had contemplated that provisions regardingoffices might be left to be moved into the Bill by way of amendment.The point was now made, however, that the Government should secure for themselves the political credit of giving the same protection to offices as to shops; and it was suggested that the inclusion of these provisions in the Bill need not delay its introduction for anysubstantial time. It was agreed that the Bill should be described inThe King&apos;s Speech as including proposals for the renewal of tenanciesof shops and offices.The Cabinet-Subject to the amendments noted above, and to their decision on the British Sugar Corporation (see Minute below), approved the draft annexed to CP. (50) 237 forThe King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 236) analysing recent developments in the Councilof Europe and seeking authority for the line of policy which he proposed to follow at the forthcoming meeting of the Committee ofMinisters. *The Cabinets discussion turned mainly on the followingpoints:  (a) It was recommended in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper that theUnited Kingdom delegation to the Assembly should not in futureinclude any Ministers, and the suggestion was made that it might include a non-political element. There was general agreement thatit would be unsuitable to include, in a delegation to what was essentially an Assembly of Parliamentarians, persons who were not members of either House of Parliament. On the question whetherMinisters should in future be included in the delegation, the cabinet were impressed by the arguments that Ministers had in the past found themselves embarrassed by the course of the discussions in theAssembly and that the Government would be more free to ignoredecisions taken by the Assembly if Ministers had not formed part ofthe United Kingdom delegation. If our policy was to be based onthe argument that the Assembly was not an intergovernmental body,it would be more logical to refrain from including Ministers in our delegation. On the other hand the point was made that, if ministers were present at meetings of the Assembly, they could give guidance to the back-bench supporters of the Government in the UnitedKingdom delegation, who might otherwise be led into support of proposals which would be embarrassing to the Government. Asagainst this it was argued that it should be possible to choose for inclusion in the delegation competent back-bench supporters of theGovernment who could be trusted to use their discretion, and could
seek guidance on matters of Government policy through the ForeignOffice officials who would be&apos; in attendance on the delegation.tb) It was proposed in cp. (50) 236 that, in order to find it a useful&apos;field of work, the Assembly should not be discouraged fromConcerning itself with such matters as European refugees, social security, full&apos;employment and the cultural work which had been undertaken by the Brussels &quot;Treaty Powers. &quot; If was suggested in discussion that scientific co-operation was another&apos; matter which mightbe added&apos;to this list. Some anxiety was, however, expressed aboutthe risk of duplication with the work of existing international agencies. Thus, full employment was already the concern of theEconomic and Social Council of the United Nations; and scientificco-operation was a matter for the - United Nations Educational,Scientific and Cultural Organisation. Care should be taken to avoid the&apos; overlapping which might arise if the Council Of Europe establishedspecial machinery for handling, in relation to European countries,questions which were already being pursued by the specialised agencies of the United Nations.(c) At the forthcoming meeting of the Committee of Ministers itwould be suggested that those of the Assembly&apos;s recommendations which affected the constitution of the Council of: Europe should bereferred for examination to a conference of Ambassadors. in cp. (50) 236 the Foreign Secretary proposed that, as an alternative,he should urge that these questions be referred to a committee of experts. In discussion it was suggested that in any such review ofthe constitution of* the Council those who favoured federalism inEurope would take the opportunity of pressing their point of view.Would it not be preferable, therefore, to argue that it would be premature to undertake any such review of the Council&apos;s constitutionuntil there had been longer practical experience of its working?(d) At the last meeting of the Assembly the suggestion had beenmade that national Parliaments should review the work of theAssembly; and the Leader of the Conservative Opposition, in expressing sympathy with this suggestion, had indicated that he wouldbe ready to agree that such debates should be held in the House ofCommons on Supply Days. There was general agreement in theCabinet that the House of Commons might devote a day to a debate on the work of the Assembly; and it was agreed that efforts shouldbe made to arrange, through the usual channels, that this should takeplace on a Supply Day. -&apos;-t-Sm.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (50) 236 at a later meeting.British Sugar 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofCorporation.    Food (CP. (50) 231) proposing the transfer of the British sugar corporation to public ownership.The Minister of Food said that the British Sugar corporation should be reorganised before 31st March, 1952, although admittedlythe present arrangements could be renewed from year to year byannual Addresses. It was wrong that private shareholders should beable to secure substantial profits under Treasury guarantee in an industry which depended largely on Exchequer assistance. TheChairman of the Corporation was anxious that the change to fullpublic ownership should be made, as he found the present structure of the corporation a hindrance to the expansion of its work. The new organisation would mark the first stage in securing effective publiccontrol of the sugar-refining industry.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Food already possessed detailed powers ofcontrol over the British Sugar Corporation by virtue of the Act of
1942. If the present British Sugar Corporation were replaced by apublic corporation of the usual kind, the Minister^ powers would be substantially less. The exact powers which the Minister of food would require had not yet been worked out in detail; but it was clear that, in addition to any general power to give directions to theCorporation, he would need power to give specific directions on aconsiderable number of detailed issues. It would be difficult to getpersons of the necessary standing to serve if the Corporation were subject to too meticulous a control. If detailed control were con-sidered to be necessary, the device of setting up a commission, fully* answerable to the Minister, might be considered as an alternative toa public corporation.(b) An essential feature of any reorganisation of the industry wasa revision of the Refining Agreement of 1937, which limited theamount of sugar refining which the British Sugar Corporation could undertake in the off-season. Ministers wished to have firm legal advice on the question whether the Agreement would lapse auto-matically if the British Sugar Corporation were abolished, and whetherthe refiners who benefited by the Agreement would be justified in asking for compensation for the cancellation of the Agreement.Opposition to any legislation was likely to be concentrated mainly onthe provisions relating to the Refining Agreement, rather than on those relating to the constitution and powers of any public corporationset up in place of the British Sugar Corporation.Some Ministers considered that, in view of the ample powers which the Minister of Food already possessed over the British sugar corporation, it was undesirable to introduce legislation ^of the kind proposed and that no legislative action should be taken until such time as the sugar-refining industry as a whole could be brought under public ownership. The general view was, however, that, subject tofurther elucidation of the legal position regarding the Refining Agree-ment, there was advantage in proceeding with legislation to place theBritish Sugar Corporation on a basis of public ownership, and to give it powers which would enable it to compete more effectively with theprivate refiners.The Cabinet-(I) Invited the Minister of Food to report furthef\on the circum-stances in which the Refining Agreement could be broughtto an end and on the question whether compensation would have to be paid to the private refiners if the Agree-ment were terminated, by legislation or otherwise.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (50) 231 on thefollowing day in the light of the report to be made by theMinister of Food in pursuance of Conclusion (1) above.Cabinet Office, S.WA,23rd October, 1950.
