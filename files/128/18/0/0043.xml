FsrKament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The debate on Coal, on 12th December, was to be taken on an opposition motion, and might have to be treated as an issue ofconfidence.The Opposition had accepted, with some reluctance, thesuggestion that there should be no further debate on Defence until after Christmas.It was still hoped that Parliament might be adjourned on15th December. The Prime Minister would, however, wish to makea statement in the House of Commons on his return from Washington,and the Opposition had asked that there should be an interval of48 hours before this was debated. If, therefore, the Prime Ministersreturn was delayed, it might become necessary for Parliament to meet in the week beginning 18th December.The Cabinet were informed that difficulty might arise over theAdministration of Justice (Pensions) Bill. Two Judges who were tohave retired at the end of the year were anxious to benefit by theprovisions of the Bill; and it had been suggested that, if the Bill couldnot be passed before Parliament rose for the Christmas Recess, itshould be so amended as to apply to any person who had held office asa Judge at the date of its introduction. In discussion it was suggestedthat, although such an amendment was unlikely to provoke opposition in the House of Lords, it might well prove unacceptable to Govern-ment supporters in the House of Commons, who had no great likingfor the Bill. In these circumstances the better course would be to try to accelerate the proceedings on the Bill so that it could be passed into law in its present form before the Christmas Recess.leasehold reform.(previous reference:CM. (50) 77thConclusions,Minute 7.)2. The Minister of Health said that it now seemed likely that the leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Bill would not pass into law before the end of February. Meanwhile, eviction orders con-tinued to be made by the courts against tenants who would have beenprotected by the provisions of the Bill. Could the courts be asked totake account of the changes which were shortly to be made in thelaw? Alternatively, would it be proper for him to exercise hisrequisitioning powers in circumstances in which such action wouldhave the effect of frustrating decisions given by the courts?The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Health to discuss with the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General whether any steps could properly be taken to prevent tenants from losing theadvantages of the Leasehold Property (Temporary Pro-visions) Bill during the period while the isill was underconsideration in Parliament.Armed 3.

Hehad therefore come to the conclusion that in any future war civilservants in the Forces should not receive the balance of their civil39842-2 b 2
pay, but that the system of War Service Grants should be improvedon the lines recommended in Appendix I of CP. (50) 274.Discussion showed that opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthis question.In favour of the Chancellor^ proposal it was argued that, if thissystem were continued for civil servants, it would have to be applied in future to all persons employed in the public service, including thevery large numbers employed in the National Health Service and inthe socialised industries. In the past this practice had, in fact, been based largely on a discrimination between salaried staff and wage-earners, which a Labour Government would find it difficult to defend.And, even if the practice were now extended so as to cover all personsemployed, in whatever capacity, by a public authority, it would stillinvolve an unjustifiable discrimination between, for example, a steel-worker and a worker in the textile industries. Moreover, why should this form of compensation be limited to those who joined the armed forces? Was similar compensation to be made available in a futurewar to persons directed to undertake some form of civil employmentless remunerative than their normal occupation?On the other side it was argued that in this, as in other matters,the Government should follow the lead of the best employers in private industry and commerce; and many of the larger firms had followed the practice of making up the civil pay of employees whojoined the Forces in time of war. (As against this it was argued that many of the firms which had followed this practice were firms whichenjoyed a monopoly position and were able to pass on the cost to theconsumer or the taxpayer.) The Cabinet were informed that the three service Departments were strongly opposed to the change proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer.. They considered that it wouldgive rise to discontent in the Forces, and would lead to greateradministrative difficulty than the existing system. It would also tendto prejudice recruitment to the Territorial Army and other auxiliary services. It would probably not be less costly than the existing system. Finally, there was the objection that the alternative of relying on the War Service Grants Scheme involved a.personal means test,the administration of which was certain to give rise to Parliamentarydifficulties.The Cabinet were also informed that the new scheme proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer was likely to prove unpopular with the police.The further suggestion was made that, in view of the substantial increases in Service pay, it might well be found in future that a much smaller proportion of people would suffer financial loss throughjoining the Forces in time of war.The Minister of Defence said that he would be glad of an oppor-tunity to submit a memorandum on this subject before a final conclusion was reached.The Cabinet-Adjourned their consideration of the proposal put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in CP. (50) 274.Production ofGroundnutsin East Africa.(previous reference:CM. (50) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them,a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Minister of Food(CP. (50) 289) on the future of the East African groundnut scheme.The Minister of Food said that the Overseas Food corporation had now made a careful review of the long-term future of this scheme,and their report was reproduced in Annex I of CP. (50) 289. TheCorporation had reached the conclusion that the large-scale produc-tion of groundnuts could not be carried on in East Africa on a
commercial basis, and that there was no hope of obtaining any signifi-cant supply of oil-seeds from this scheme. There was no escape fromthe conclusion that the project, as originally envisaged by the Govern-ment, had proved a costly failure. That being so, he had at first been disposed to recommend that the whole project should be abandoned.But a large investment had been made in the scheme, valuable capitalassets had been created in East Africa, and useful practical experience in tropical agriculture had been gained. These assets could not belightly cast aside; and he had therefore discussed with the Secretaryof State for the Colonies means of turning them to good account.As a result they now submitted the plan, outlined in the memo-randum, for carrying through a limited experiment in agricultural development over a period of seven years.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was satisfiedthat, for the reasons given in paragraphs 21-24 of CP. (50) 289, thewiser course was to use the agricultural assets of the scheme for thepurpose of making a contribution to the further development of tanganyika and providing experience in tropical agriculture whichwould be of value to the whole Colonial Empire. He was seriouslyalarmed at the indications that world population was expanding faster than world food production; and he believed that the UnitedKingdom, as a great Colonial Power, had a special obligation topromote the expansion of food production. From this point of view he thought it would be disastrous if the scheme were entirelyabandoned. He recognised, however, that on this conception theresponsibility for the scheme must be transferred from the Ministryof Food to his Department. He had considered whether it shouldbe taken over by the Colonial Development Corporation; but hehad decided against that course partly because he thought itunreasonable to expect that the new scheme should pay its way, andpartly because the Colonial Development Corporation had enoughto do with the fifty projects for which it was already responsible. he therefore proposed that the new scheme should continue to be administered by the Overseas Food Corporation, strengthened bythe addition to its board of representatives of the Government of tanganyika and the Colonial Development Corporation; but thatthe net cost of the scheme should be carried on the Colonial OfficeVote. If the Cabinet should be disposed to favour the abandonment of the scheme, he asked that the Governor of Tanganyika should begiven an opportunity to express his views before a final decision wastaken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the original scheme had clearly failed, and the Government must expect political criti-criticism on that account. The volume of that criticism would not be substantially lessened by an announcement that the government intended to go forward with a limited scheme on the lines recom-mended in CP. (50) 289; and he therefore hoped that the cabinet would consider that scheme on its merits. From his point of view it had the great disadvantage that it contained no assurance that substantial further losses would not be incurred. Indeed, the proposal that the new scheme should not be entrusted to the Colonial Develop-ment Corporation was due largely to the fact that it was not expectedto pay its way. There was nothing in the memorandum to indicate the scale of the further financial risks involved. Yet, in spite of this financial uncertainty, the Cabinet were asked to give a guarantee thatthis limited scheme would be continued for at least seven years. Apartfrom the financial liability, there was also the question whether it was right to devote to East Africa all the technical resources which thisscheme involved. Resources of the same kind were urgently requiredfor agricultural development in South-East Asia, under the&apos; ColomboPlan: and it was for consideration whether some of those resources should not be diverted to South-East Asia.
In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general agreement that a final judgment on thepossibilities of food production in East Africa could only be basedon the results of practical experience of cultivation Over a substantialperiod. The proposal for a seven-year period for the experiment was probably justified. As conditions varied in different parts of tanganyika, it was also desirable that cultivation should be continued on an experimental basis in several different parts of the territory. Onthe other hand, it did not follow that the experiment need be on so large a scale as was proposed in CP. (50) 289. It was the large scale of the proposed operations that made the financial risks so large.(b) In determining the scale of the continuing experiment, the overseas Food Corporation had been concerned only with economic considerations. Another possible method of approach was to assess the amount of social capital which had been created under the original scheme in the form of harbours, railways, hospitals, &amp;c, which wouldhave an independent value for the social development of the territory;and to consider what amount of agricultural development would berequired in order to warrant the,maintenance of that social equipment.(c) It was also proposed in CP. (50) 289 that responsibility forthe Queensland scheme should now be transferred to the QueenslandGovernment. . This scheme had been more successful than thegroundnut scheme; and some Ministers were on that accountreluctant to agree that it should at this stage be handed over to theQueensland Government. They recognised that it would be inappropriate-priate for the Colonial Office to retain responsibility for the adminis-tration of a project located in Australia; but they thought it preferable that the United Kingdom Government should retain some interest inthe scheme, possibly through the Commonwealth Relations Office.The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister of Queenslandwould shortly be visiting this country; and it was agreed that therewould be advantages in holding preliminary discussions with him,while he was in London, about the future of the Queensland scheme.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theSecretary Of State for the Colonies and the Minister ofFood the financial implications of the proposals in cp. (50) 289 regarding the future of the East Africangroundnut scheme; and agreed that the Chairman of the overseas Food Corporation and the Governor of tanganyika should be brought into these consultations.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Minister of Food to hold preliminary discussions with the Prime Minister of Queensland regarding thefuture administration of the Queensland scheme.(3) Agreed to resume their consideration of the proposals in cp. (50) 289 in the light of the discussions to be conductedunder Conclusions (1) and (2) above.Food.Meat Supplies.(previous reference:CM. (50) 79thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. At their meeting on 30th November the Cabinet had authorised the Minister of Food to buy 20,000 tons of meat from theUnited States.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the price which wasbeing asked for this meat was nearly  300 a tori; and he and theMinister of Food were agreed that it should not be&apos; bought at thisexhorbitant price.   Apart from all other considerations, such a
purchase would weaken our bargaining position in the current meatnegotiations with the Argentine Government. The latest indicationswere that those negotiations were not making satisfactory progress.The Cabinet Endorsed the views expressed by the Chancellor of theExchequer.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Town and Country Planning (CP. (50) 262) seeking, on behalf ofthe Committee on Distribution and Marketing, the Cabinefs approval in principle of a scheme to set up a number of public wholesaleauctions for fruit and vegetables on an experimental basis under apublic company to be financed by the Exchequer.The Minister of Town and Country Planning said that his committee did not suggest that the proposed auctions should beestablished forthwith, but merely asked for authority to discuss theproposal with the interests concerned so that more detailed planscould be formulated. The experimental auction centres would beestablished in a number of areas presenting different features, so that adequate experience could be obtained, but there would be a preference for areas where the existing arrangements for the whole-sale distribution of fruit and vegetables were unsatisfactory. Theauctions might prove to be a valuable means of reducing the retail price of fruit and vegetables, but there v/ere various uncertainelements which would have to be explored in the course of the detailed investigation now proposed. The Committee had favoured the setting up of a public company to organise the auction centresbecause they felt that a public corporation would be rather anunwieldy instrument, especially in the experimental stages of thescheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, as these auctioncentres would be competing with the existing wholesale trade, theCabinet must be satisfied that they had a reasonable chance of payingtheir way; and their financial prospects had not yet been subjected to close scrutiny. He hoped, therefore, that the financial aspectswould be closely examined during the next stage of the investigation.The question whether it would be right to set up a public company to organise the auction centres also required further scrutiny, in thelight of past experience in the running of public companies financed by the Exchequer. .In discussion there was general&apos;agreement that the proposal fora number of experimental wholesale auction centres for fruit and vegetables merited further examination in detail, even though this might involve some public disclosure of what the Government hadin mind. Dissatisfaction with the marketing and distribution ofvegetables was of long standing, and the establishment of wholesaleauctions appeared to offer the most promising prospect of improving the present arrangements.The Cabinet-Authorised the Committee on Distribution and Marketing toarrange for preliminary discussions, with the principalinterests concerned, about the establishment on an expefi-mental basis of a number of public wholesale auction centres for fruit and vegetables.
. 7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (50) 296 and 302) on measures, further to thoseapproved by the Cabinet on 4th December, to meet the shortage ofcoal in the winter months and in the next coal year.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was anxious thatthe Departments concerned should investigate the extent to whichopencast production could be increased by starting work on some ofthe sites where agricultural and amenity objections, though serious,were not of overriding importance.The Minister of Town and Country Planning and the Ministerof Agriculture said that they were prepared to co-operate on the lines proposed in CP. (50) 296, though there were a number of sites to theworking of which they would be unable to agree.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Town and Country Planning and theMinister of Agriculture to co-operate with the Ministerof Fuel and Power, as proposed in CP. (50) 296 and inparagraph 5 of CP. (50) 302, in increasing the output ofopencast coal.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, although in his memo-randum he had suggested that the Economic Commission for europe should be warned that coal exports from the United Kingdom in 1951were not likely to exceed 7 million tons, further discussion with theMinisters concerned led him to recommend that at this stage theGovernment should not go beyond giving a general warning to theCommission that the restrictions on exports were likely to extend beyond the spring of next year.In discussion there was general agreement that, as Ministers hadnot yet had an opportunity of considering the estimated output ofcoal in 1951, it would be premature to give the Economic Commissionan exact estimate of coal exports in that year.The point was also made that, if shortage of coal seemed likelyto result in widespread unemployment and distress in importing countries, there would be pressure for further restriction of consump-tion in this country, for example, in regard to shop-lighting. Whileit was true that it had never been suggested that countries producingscarce raw materials should observe the same standard of austerityin their use as might be necessary in importing countries, and while there were considerable restrictions on the use of coal, notably byhouseholders, in this country, it was, nevertheless, true that, in regardto other scarce materials, the United Kingdom Government were using the argument that producing countries should impose restric-tiont on internal use to make more available for export, and the sameargument might be used against us in regard to coal. The general view was, however, that further consideration of restrictions on shop-lighting should be deferred for the time being.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the Economic Commission for Europe shouldbe warned in general terms that the reduction in theamount of coal available for export from the UnitedKingdom was likely to extend into the next coal year.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had had urgentrepresentations from the National Coal Board and responsiblemembers of the National Union of Mineworkers that the board should be allowed to take the initiative in suggesting a scheme ofsupplementary pensions for miners. Communist elements in theUnion were likely to propose a new miners&apos; charter containing manyextravagant claims, and it was important to avoid any suggestion thatsupplementary pensions had been granted in response to Communistpressure. The National Coal Board were confident that, if they were
211CM. 813 (50)given authority to negotiate a supplementary pensions scheme, subjectto subsequent approval by the Minister, a reasonable scheme could be worked out at a cost of about Is. per ton of coal.In discussion attention was drawn to the substantial addition tothe cost of industrial production which would ftrtftfw from any generaladoption of schemes of supplementary pensions. The repercussionswere potentially so serious that the Cabinet had agreed that the whole subject should be investigated by a departmental committee, and anygeneral investigation of this kind would be seriously prejudiced if inthe meantime a scheme had been introduced for miners. Apart fromthe cost of these schemes and the effect on home and export prices,the rising average age of the population pointed to the need to investigate afresh the general age of retirement, and any suchre-examination would be prejudiced if a pensions scheme for minershad been approved with an early retirement age. No one could besure how far a scheme of supplementary pensions would succeed inchecking the decrease in the labour*force of the mining industry. Itwas unlikely to be a serious factor in stimulating recruitment, and theprospect of a pension was not likely to influence the younger miners in deciding whether or not to remain in the industry. The value ofthe scheme would rest mainly in its effect in preventing the olderminers from leaving the industry. Such foreign experience as was available suggested that schemes of supplementary pensions for miners did not have much effect in slowing down the tendency for miners to seek more attractive employment elsewhere.In favour of the introduction of such a scheme, it was argued thatthe miners&apos; leaders believed that it would help to retain men in the pits, and those Ministers who had experience in the industry were ofthe same opinion. A higher output of coal was not likely to besecured without some form of increased remuneration for miners, anda scheme of supplementary pensions might stave off demaftds for higher wages. The standing of the miner in the industrial community had fallen during the last thirty or forty years; and a pensions scheme,particularly if the amounts paid were related to past earnings, would improve the status of the miner in his own opinion and in the eyes of other workers.Some Ministers thought it would be important to restrict any concession to the mining industry, and suggested that the TradesUnion Congress should be asked to assist in inducing other tradeunions not to press their demands for supplementary pensions.Doubt was, however, expressed whether it would be possible to holdback the other unions for long. In the gas and electricity industries asubstantial percentage of existing workers were already covered byschemes dating from before nationalisation, and the unions concerned would press strongly for the removal of the stand-still on the extensionof existing schemes. The same would be true of transport workers,and the steps taken by the Government to prevent ah extension ofschemes in the railways had already, on more than one occasion, comenear to provoking a strike. The view Was, however, expressed that,even if there was a considerable extension of supplementary pension schemes in other industries, this would not in itself detract from thevalue of a scheme for miners.Concern was expressed about the lack of any detailed informa-tion about the scheme which might be adopted for the miningindustry. The National Union of Mineworkers were likely to askfor relatively large pensions payable at the age of fifty-five, and theNational Coal Board had not worked out a scheme in detail. Therewas a risk that, in the absence of clear guidance from Ministers, theNational Coal Board would be driven to concede a scheme which wasexpensive and led, by example, to the introduction of expensiveschemes in other industries. On the other hand, it would be disastrousif the Board put forward a scheme which was regarded by the minersas inadequate and did nothing to keep men in the industry whileimposing a heavy financial burden on the National Coal Board andon the national economy. There was general agreement that any scheme should be contributory in character, and that the pensions-2 C
should, if possible, be related to earnings. There should, from the outset, be a clear understanding that contributions would not bereturned if a miner left the nnning industry, and that there could beno question of enabling miners to transfer to other industries whichhad pension schemes and to take their accrued benefits with them.There was general agreement that, before a final &quot;decision wastaken on the introduction of a scheme of supplementary pensions for miners, the position should be discussed with the Trades UnionCongress, primarily to ascertain whether it would be practicable to concede a scheme for the mining industry and at the same time main-tain, for a time, the standstill imposed by the Government on theintroduction of similar schemes in other nationalised industries.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, with the Ministerof Fuel and Power, the Minister of National insurance and a Minister with experience in the mining industry, todiscuss with representatives of the General Council of theTrades Union Congress, in the light of the cabinets discussion, the question of introducing a supplementary pensions scheme for miners.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the attorney-General (CP. (50) 300) on the legal issues arising from theaction taken by the Durham County Council with a view to securing that all persons employed by them belonged to a trade union or a professional association.The Minister of Health said that, in agreement with the Ministerof Education, he was proposing to meet representatives of the CountyCouncil with a view to bringing the present difficulties to an end.The Minister of Labour said that in view of the action whichwas being taken by the Minister of Health he would not, for,the timebeing, notify the County Council in accordance with his usual practicethat they were in danger of contravening Order No. 1305.The Cabinet -Took note of CP. (50) 300 and of the statements made bythe Ministers of Health and Labour.9. The Attorney-General drew attention to the strike ofelectricians employed by British Overseas Airways Corporation,which had arisen through the refusal of electricians to work alongsidetwo electricians who were not members of the Electrical TradesUnion. Although this strike was receiving a certain measure of recognition from the union concerned, it was clearly in contravention of Order 1,305 and he wished to know,whether there were anyconsiderations which the Cabinet would wish him to bear in mindin deciding whether to prosecute the principal members of the StrikeCommittee. He understood that there was some prospect that thedispute might be settled by 11th December, but he was concerned about the situation which would arise if the strike continued after that time.The Minister of Civil Aviation said that the British overseas airways Corporation were proposing, if the dispute was not settled by 11th December, to take civil proceedings for damages against the strikers.In discussion the view was expressed that there would be some concern in trade union circles if a dispute arising out of a refusal ofDurhamCountyCouncil.Conditions ofEmployment.(previous reference:CM.

It was also felt to be undesirable that bothcriminal and civil proceedings should be instituted at the same time,and this aspect of the matter might be discussed further with theChairman of British Overseas Airways Corporation.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Attorney-General to take note of the views whichhad been expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.Duple Motor The attention of the Cabinet was drawn to a strike of employeesBodies, of Duple Motor Bodies, Ltd., which appeared to contraveneLimited.
