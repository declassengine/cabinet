Queen Mary&apos;sCarpet.(previous reference:CM. (50) 42ndConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Prime Minister said that he had received from QueenMary a message expressing her appreciation of the letter which themembers of the Cabinet had sent to her on the occasion of the pur-chase of the carpet which she had presented for sale in North Americain furtherance of the export drive.Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.Request forSecret session on Defence.(previous reference:CM. (48) 68thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that he proposed to announce that day in his Statement on Business that Parliament would be adjourned forthe Summer Recess on 28th July and would re-assemble on17th October. It would probably take two weeks to complete the outstanding business of the current Session, and the new Session was likely to be opened on 31st October.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the current situationin Korea, the Leader of the Conservative Opposition had renewed his request that the House of Commons should be enabled to discuss in secret session the state of the country&apos;s preparedness for war. TheCabinet agreed that it would be impossible to resist Mr. ChurchilFsdemand that the House of Commons should discuss the international situation before it dispersed for the Summer Recess. There was,however, some division of opinion on the question whether this debate should be held in secret session. On the one hand it was pointed outthat, while there were strong general objections to the holding ofsecret sessions in time of peace, the present situation was exceptional.In assessing its risks Parliament would wish to take into account, notonly our own state of preparedness, but also that of our Allies in western Europe; and it would be specially difficult to discuss thoseaspects of the position in public debate. Moreover, there was reasonto believe that some members of the Opposition were anxious to putforward, for consideration by the Government, specific suggestions which they would not feel able to mention in a public debate. some ministers also thought that the holding of a secret session might havea salutary effect on the Soviet Government as indicating that theUnited Kingdom Government were contemplating further measuresto improve their preparedness for war.On the other side, it was recognised that the general atmosphere of a debate in secret session was bound to become widely known, bothin this country and abroad. There was some risk that, if a secret session were held, the United States Congress, when asked forappropriations for military aid under the North Atlantic Pact, mightpress for information about the conclusions reached in that debate.Finally, the Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary was strongly of the opinion that any Parliamentary discussion of thesituation should be held in public. He was specially influenced bythe consideration that any criticism of the state of preparedness ofour Allies in Western Europe might undermine the position of thenew French Government. He also considered that the public in thiscountry would feel entitled to know what criticisms were beingexpressed in Parliament.It was the general conclusion of the Cabinet that the balance ofthe arguments lay against conceding this request for a debate in secret session.The Prime Minister undertook to see the Leader of the Con-servative Opposition, and to explain to him that the Governmentwere unable to agree that the House of Commons should debate thecurrent international situation in secret session. He would offer togive to Mr. Churchill, in confidence, the fullest information about thelatest developments in the international situation and about the state39049-2 b 2
of Allied preparedness; but hej doubted whether Mr. Churchill wouldbe willing to accept this as a satisfactory alternative to a secret debate.Finally, he would inform Mr. Churchill that the Government wereprepared to give facilities for a public debate on this question, prefer-ably on the Appropriation Bill in the week beginning 24th July, andthat they would endeavour on that occasion to give the House thefullest information which could be. provided consistently with theinterests of national security.Supplementary        3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presi-pensions in      dent (CP. (50) 167) proposing that there should be an enquiry intoSocialised       the general subject of supplementary pensions schemes and that, in industries.       a forthcoming discussion with representatives of the Trades UnionCongress, the Government should indicate their intention to have an enquiry but should oppose meanwhile any extension of supplementary pensions schemes for manual workers in the socialised industries.The Lord President outlined the extent to which supplementary pensions schemes were already available in the socialised industries and indicated the repercussions of any extension of these schemes to workers not already covered by them. If all workers in the socialised industries came under the most favourable pensions schemes, theadditional burden on the boards would be of the order of  27 million a year and a similar amount would have to be contributed by theworkers. This would undoubtedly provoke claims for similar schemes in industries under private ownership; and a substantial rise in costs would be inevitable. The Policy Committee of the Labour Party had recently suggested that there should be an enquiry into supplementary pensions schemes, and it would probably be useful to appoint a departmental Committee on this subject. The members would haveto be persons of high standing who could take a broad view of the issues involved, and the terms of reference would require carefulconsideration.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Government Actuary had calculated in 1944 that the per-centage of the population over sixty years of age would rise from16 per cent, in 1944 to 31 per cent, in 1975. While subsequent develop-ments might have affected the precise figures, it remained broadlytrue that the proportion of old people in the population would risesharply. Governments would be under great pressure to do too much for the old and not enough for the young. Even with the presentpension arrangements for old people, it would probably be necessaryto make a substantial postponement of the age of retirement, asSweden had already done, if an intolerable burden was not to belaid upon the rest of the community.(b) Some time in the next few years a statutory review would haveto be held of the working of the National Insurance Scheme duringthe period to March, 1954; and the suggestion was made that this might be linked with the proposed enquiry into schemes of supple-mentary pensions. It was, however, the general view of ministers that this would be undesirable since the statutory review would cover a wider field, including benefit paid in respect of unemployment orsickness. The Committee enquiring into supplementary pensions would, however, consider these pensions in relation to!the provisionfor old age made under the National Insurance Act, an^ would haveto consider proposals affecting the national scheme. Thus, it might be suggested that, in place of compulsory schemes of supplementary pensions for industries as a whole, individuals should be enabled tocontribute to a supplementary State scheme with a view to securinghigher benefits on retirement. Under such a system a man wouldbe able to transfer from one firm to another, or from one industry toanother, without sacrifice of pension rights.
(c) It seemed doubtful whether the proposed Committee shouldbe specially directed to investigate the management and soundness ofexisting schemes. Many of these schemes were actuarially unsoundbecause of the increased expectation of life, and this would no doubt be brought out in the course of the enquiry. In relation to existing schemes the enquiry should be directed primarily to plans for their co-ordination or amalgamation.; (d) Would it be desirable to investigate the extent to whichsupplementary pensions schemes might be confined to the under-manned industries, with the object of enabling these industries tonoil attract and retain labour? It was pointed out that it would not be practicable to withdraw supplementary pensions schemes fromindustries and services (e.g., local government services) in which theywere already in force, and to that extent supplementary pensionscould not be confined to under-manned industries. Moreover, itwould be difficult to prevent the spread of supplementary pensions schemes, once granted, from large under-manned industries, such ascoalmining, to other industries. The proposed Committee could,however, examine the extent to which additional pension provisioncould be used to increase the labour force in under-manned industries and to build up a higher sense of discipline in them.(e) In the socialised industries the extent to which supplementary pensions schemes existed varied from industry to industry and pres-sure for the extension of these schemes also varied. A high propor-tion of the manual workers in the gas and electricity industriesenjoyed supplementary pensions schemes. In the railway service, theSociety of Locomotive Engineers appeared to regard the extension ofsupplementary pensions schemes as more important than wage increases, and they had been the occasion for disputes leading to anumber of week-end stoppages, which adversely affected the finances of the Railway Executive and caused bad industrial relations. At thei Trades Union Congress in September 1949, objection had been takento Government intervention in this field, which was regarded as amatter akin to wages negotiations. In fact, however, the ministers responsible for socialised industries could not avoid expressing a view,since pensions schemes required their approval. In the interests ofgood relations between the boards and their workers (certainly in theBritish Transport Commission) it should be made clear that it wasthe Government and not the boards which, as a matter of generalpolicy, were opposed in present circumstances to the extension ofexisting schemes and to the admission of new entrants to those schemes.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Departmental Committee of experienced per-sons should be set up to enquire into supplementary pensions schemes generally; and invited the lord president, in consultation with the other Ministers con-cerned, to submit to the Prime Minister proposals regarding the composition and terms of reference of sucha Committee.(2) Agreed that, in the forthcoming discussions with representa-tives of the Trades Union Congress on supplementary pensions schemes, the Lord President should inform theserepresentatives privately of the Governments intentionto set up a Departmental Committee on this subject.(3) Agreed that the responsible Ministers should inform the boards of socialised industries and the Trades UnionCongress that, in present circumstances and pending con-sideration of the recommendations of the proposed committee of enquiry, the Government were of theopinion that there should be no extension in the socialised industries of present arrangements for supple-mentary pensions for manual workers.39049-2 b 3
InvoluntaryAbsenteeismin coal mining industry.(previous reference:CM. (49) 40thConclusions,Minute 3.)coal mining industry.Production.(previous reference :CM. (50) 36thConclusions,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP.&apos; (50) 163),submitted by the Minister of Fuel and Power in responsp to their request of 15th June, on the short-term measures which might betaken to increase coal production by accelerating the technicaldevelopments which were taking place in the industry.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, as the Cabinet would see from his memorandum, the National Coal Board had already undertaken a large programme of long-term and short-term projects4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP. (50) 161) covering the report of a Committee whichhad investigated the causes of the increase in involuntary absenteeismin the coalmining industry, and a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (50) 162) oh the action which he proposed totake on the Cbmmittee&apos;s recommendations-The Minister of Fuel and Power said that involuntary absentee-ism in the mining industry on account of sickness was no higher thanin other industries. As regards absenteeism due to injury, the injuryrate in the mining industry was much higher than in other industries,but it had also risen considerably since the introduction of theNational Insurance Scheme in 1948. A small proportion of the menwere absent for reasons which could not be justified or stayed awaylonger than was strictly necessary, and he was in full agreement withthe recommendations made by the Committee to deal with this small minority.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Under the old scheme of workmen&apos;s compensation, injuredminers had often to return to work before they had fully recoveredbecause they could not afford to stay away longer. It was in thenational interest that men should receive the better medical treatment which they were now able to obtain, and should not return to their work until they were fully fit for it. . .(b) The Ministry of National Insurance and the Ministry ofHealth were already making arrangements to reduce lax certification.It should, however, be recognised that it was not easy for a regionalmedical officer or a sick visitor to force a man back to work whoseemed to have recovered but claimed that he needed another week at home before he was able to perform a full day&apos;s work.(c) The high rates of benefit during absence due to injuries, setout in Table VI of the report attached to CP. (50) 161, doubtlessexplained the reluctance of some men to return to work. The bestremedy for this was to develop more generally a sense of responsibilitytowards work, especially in socialised industries which were expectedto set ah example in these matters.(d) The report of the Committee would no doubt have been use-ful to research workers who were studying questions of industrialmorale; but, if it were made available in this way, it might have theresult of focussing undue attention on the mining industry. Minersshould not be singled out simply because more detailed information was available about the coalmining industry.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 162, designed to reducethe present level Of involuntary absenteeism in the coal-mining industry.(2) Agreed that the report attached to CP. (50) 161 should notbe published but should be made available to DivisionalCoal Boards and to the National and Divisional CoalConsultative Councils.
for increasing output and reducing costs.&apos; The results of these measures were already beginning to show themselves in a steady increase in total output and in output per man-shift. Evidence ofthis increase was to be found in the table in paragraph 26 of his memo-randum. As regards additional measures which might still be taken,he drew special attention to paragraphs 27 and 30 of CP. (50) 163.in the first of these paragraphs he had briefly described the efforts which the National Coal Board and the National Union of Mine-workers were making to secure the wider adoption of a new systemof piece-work which was already followed in some collieries. he believed that this would make a great contribution towards increased output; and, although miners were slow in accepting reforms of thiskind, he hoped that the Board and the Union might be successful in securing a wide extension of this system. In paragraph 30 of his memorandum he had pointed out that the best hope of obtaining afurther increase in output by technical measures lay in increasingthe volume of capital investment in the industry, and had askedwhether he would be justified in discussing with the National coal board what further investment could be undertaken which gave goodpromise of producing results within the next two years.In discussion general satisfaction was expressed at the progress made by the National Coal Board in promoting technical develop-ment &quot;within the industry. The following particular points were raised:  (a) Attention was drawn to the need for special caution in pur-suing projects for the closing of uneconomic pits. Some successfulexamples of this were quoted in paragraph 23 of CP. (50) 163. Ingeneral, however, miners were very reluctant to move from the places of work to which they had become accustomed; and any precipitateclosing of uneconomic pits, on the assumption that the miners couldbe transferred even to adjacent areas, might well lead to a net lossof man-power.The Cabinet were assured that the National Coal Board would continue to exercise great care in proposing such transfers, and wouldnot embark upon any without the fullest consultation with theNational Union of Mineworkers.(b) In some parts of the country local opinion was being unneces-sarily disturbed by prospecting for opencast mining. Prospectingshould not be undertaken unless there was a reasonable hope, notonly that coal would be found, but that there would be no socialobjections to working it. It was therefore hardly sufficient that theother interested Departments (the Ministries of Town and country planning, Agriculture and Health and the corresponding Depart-ments in Scotland) should be consulted before opencast operations were begun: it was desirable that they should be consulted beforeprospecting was undertaken.(c) With reference to paragraph 30 of the memorandum, theChancellor of the Exchequer said that, as the Cabinet had alreadyfixed a definite ceiling for the capital investment programme for 1950and 1951, he could hold out no hope that any additional investment in the coalmining industry could be authorised unless a corresponding reduction were made in some other sector of the programme.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of CP. (50) 163.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange that other interested Departments should in future be consulted before any boring was undertaken in prospecting forfurther sites for opencast coal working.Labour The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of relations.       Labour-(CP. (50) 169) on the general state of labour relations in the coalmining industry.
The Minister of Labour said that the general conclusion which emerged from his review was that, since the industry had been takeninto public ownership, strikes had been more frequent but shorter induration. This seemed to be due either to a lack of responsibilityamong the workers or to a general lack of understanding of the localmachinery and organisation of the industry. The figures given inAppendix A of his memorandum showed, however, that the position was improving. He was also glad to be able to report that the con-ciliation machinery in the industry was working smoothly andquickly, and that awards at arbitration won ready acceptance.In discussion it was pointed out that statistical comparisons with pre-war years were apt to be misleading; for since 1942 more comprehensive statistics had been available. This suggested that theimprovement was even better than was implied by the figures givenin Appendix A to CP. (50) 169. The Cabinet were also informedthat the improvement had continued during the first part of 1950,for which no figures were given in this Appendix. Thus, in the years before the war coalmining had accounted for nearly two-thirds ofthe total number of days lost in industry through disputes; but thecorresponding figure for the first part of 1950 was only one-fifth.It was agreed that further improvement on the position shown in cp. (50) 169 must be sought mainly by encouraging the assumption of greater responsibility at the individual collieries, both by themanagement and by the local representatives of the workers.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of CP. (50) 169.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the Minister of State(CP. (50) 160) covering the report of a working party of Common-wealth High Commissioners and officials which had met in london in May, in pursuance of the decision reached at the commonwealth meeting on Foreign Affairs in Colombo, with a view to reconcilingany substantial differences of opinion between commonwealth governments on the form and substance of a peace settlement for japan.The Minister of State said that other Commonwealth Govern-ments had now had time to consider this report but no commentshad yet been received from any of them. From the United Kingdompoint of view it was desirable that, notwithstanding recent develop-ments in Korea, the report of the meetings of officials should, withcertain amendments, be communicated to the United States Govern-ment. The main amendments proposed were: (i) the omission of paragraphs 28-34, the communication of which to the United states authorities might embarrass us in subsequent discussion of thequestion of &quot; most-favoured-nation&quot; treatment for Japan; and(ii) the omission of Annex B, which listed a number of outstandingproblems on which there was to be a further exchange of viewsbetween Commonwealth Governments.In addition, the other Commonwealth Governments would wishto consider whether any changes should be made in those sections ofthe report in which views were specifically attributed to particular&quot;Commonwealth Governments.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth relations endorsed these proposals; and discussion showed that theycommanded the general support of the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the report of the Commonwealth working partyannexed to CP. (50) 160.Japan.Peace Treaty.(previous reference:CM. (47) 92ndConclusions,Minute 3.)
(2) Agreed in principle that, subject to the amendments notedabove and to the views of other Commonwealth Govern-ments, the report should be communicated to the UnitedStates Government.(3) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations to arrange for the views ofother Commonwealth Governments to be obtained bythe despatch of a communication on the lines indicatedin paragraph 6 of CP. (50) 160.industrial disputes.Strike ofSmithfieldDrivers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 44thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Home Secretary reported that the great majority of the meat transport drivers who had been on strike had resumed work onthe previous day. Some difficulty had arisen when men who on join-ing the strike had left their lorries at places some distance away from london were told that they would be expected to pay their own faresto the places where the lorries had been left. It had now beenarranged, however, that the men would be given railway warrants forthis purpose and that the question whether the cost should thereafter be deducted from their wages should l)e settled in negotiation throughthe Joint Industrial Council.The troops employed in maintaining essential services in Londonwere now returning to military duty.Some part of London&apos;s meat ration for the week would besupplied in carcase meat and the balance would be made up in canned corned meat.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th July, 1950.
