Index of retail Prices.Korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 80thConclusions.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (50) 288) drawing attention to current criticisms of the interim Index of Retail Prices, which had been introduced in 1947on the recommendations of an Advisory Committee, and proposing that the Advisory Committee should be convened again and askedto consider whether the present index should be revised and, if so,on what principles the revision should be based.i The Minister of Labour said that a Parliamentary Question aboutthe accuracy of the cost of living index had been put down for answer on the following day, and a Motion on the subject was tobe moved by a Private Member on 8th December. All he sought atthis stage was authority to say that the Advisory Committee wouldbe asked to consider whether the present index should be revised.The Cabinet agreed that this question should be examined inthe manner proposed. Some of the criticisms of the present indexwere, however, ill-founded; and nothing should be said at this stage to imply that it was unreliable. It should be realised that revisionof the index would raise a number of difficult questions.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals made in paragraphs 11 and 12 of cp. (50) 288.2. The Foreign Secretary said that the military situation in korea gave cause for grave anxiety, and the Prime Minister might beasked to take important decisions immediately upon bis arrival in washington. The Chiefs of Staff were considering, with representa-tives of the Foreign Office, what advice should be sent to him. Atelegram would have to be despatched later in the day: its terms would be settled by the Lord President, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Defence. -On the political aspects of the Korean situation, there werepromises of a greater harmony of view between commonwealth governments. The Canadian Government were now showing lessanxiety to conform with United States policy, and had suggestedinformally to the Prime Minister of India that he might make a publicappeal for a cease-fire with a view to a negotiated settlement withthe Chinese. Two messages had been received from the PrimeMinister of India, which showed that he was determined to avoid any precipitate action but was anxious to do anything he could topromote a settlement.The Cabinet were informed that the Lord President was to beasked that afternoon, by Private Notice Question, whether he had any statement to make on a speech which the Minister of defence had made in Durham on the previous day. The Minister had stated,in the course of this speech, that it would appear at the moment thatGeneral MacArthur had gone beyond what were understood to bethe United Nations&apos; objectives at the outset of the Korean campaign and that as a result United Nations forces had proceeded to a pointnear the Manchurian border where there was a large force of chinese troops. This might be interpreted in the House of Commons as implying that General MacArthur had gone beyond the directivesgiven to him on behalf of the United Nations. In discussions it waspointed out that the proposal that the United Nations forces shouldadvance beyond the 38th Parallel had been approved by the Cabinet,and indeed, by the United Nations Assembly; and the Foreign Secre-tary had stated in the foreign affairs debate in the House of commons on 29th November, that General MacArthur had not in fact exceeded the directives given to him on behalf of the United Nations. TheMinister of Defence said that he had been concerned to make thepoint that the recent operations in Korea had gone beyond the objectives which the United Nations had in view at the outset of the
campaign. He had been careful to avoid any criticism of general macarthur. The Lord President said that he would settle, in consul-tation with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence, theterms of the reply which he should give to this Private notice question.In this connection the Cabinet agreed that, while the PrimeMinisters talks with President Truman were in progress, ministers should so far as possible avoid making any references in public speeches to the matters which would come under review in thosetalks. This applied, not only to the conduct of the operations in korea, but also to the question of international measures for dealingwith the problems arising from current shortages of raw materials.The Lord President undertook to convey the Cabinefs views on thispoint to all members of the Government.3.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda CP. (50) 285: by the Minister of Fuel and Power, recommending that the National Coal Board, which had already bought825,000 tons of American coal, should be authorised toincrease their purchases to .1,200,000 tons and to investigatewhether 1 million tons of Polish cOal could also be imported;and further recommending that coal exports from thiscountry should be cut by 1 million tons.CP. (50) 287: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering areport by the Overseas Negotiations Committee on themanner in which a cut in coal exports totalling 1 million tonsshould be imposed as between different countries.CP. (50) 290: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering areport by the Overseas Negotiations Committee on themanner in which the proposal to buy 1 million tons of coal&quot; from Poland might be handled.CP. (50) 299: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, covering amemorandum by the Chairman of the Official Coal Com-mittee on the difficulties of shipping the coal which hadbeen bought in the United States.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the first results of the appeal for Saturday working in the coal mines had been promising:but, while many miners would probably work on 9th and 16thDecember, numbers Would fall off on 23rd and 30th December, andthe total amount of additional coal to be got by this means wasproblematical. He therefore felt obliged to propose the importationof further coal from the United States, and from Poland.The Minister of Transport said that there were difficulties aboutshipping the American coal to this country. Not more than 100,000tons could be brought here in January. More could be imported in subsequent months if it were decided, as recommended in CP. (50)299, to divert ships which were to carry prefabricated houses toAustralia, cement to New Zealand and fertilisers to China and Japan,and if the United States Government would offer to release for thispurpose some of the Liberty ships which they had laid up at the endof the war.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would not object tothe increased import of United States coal if shipping difficulties couldbe overcome, nor to the initiation of discussions on the prospects ofobtaining Polish coal.In discussion the following points were made:  - (a) There should be a clearer picture of the shipping position before further purchases of American coal were made.
. (h) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations would wish to be given a few days in which to intimate to the Governmentsof Australia and New Zealand that the export of prefabricated houses to Australia and of cement to New Zealand was being postponed. Itwould also be desirable to verify that the interruption of the flow ofprefabricated houses from the factory to the ship would not rendertheir price prohibitive by reason of storage costs. As little publicityas possible should be given to the postponement of these exports toAustralia and New Zealand.(c) Before any shipping diversions were effected which reduced the imports of coarse grains to this country, Ministers would wish toexamine the position further. Stocks of coarse grains were very low and any failure to import supplies to the amounts already agreedupon would have serious repercussions on the feeding of livestockand poultry.(d) While the shipping companies were co-operating to the best of their ability, the Minister of Transport should examine the adequacy of his powers under the Supplies and Services Acts to divertor requisition shipping for the purposes of meeting the present emergency conditions.(e) The United States Government had already taken out of reserve a number of Liberty ships, and it would be some time before any more of them could be made ready for service. Even so, theknowledge that more of them would be available at a later date would help to moderate the rise in freight rates which the present pressure on shipping space was causing.(/) The preliminary discussions about the availability of Polishcoal should be conducted on a confidential basis. Since it was believedthat the Poles had about 1 million tons of coal available for export to this country without interference with the claims of their other foreign customers, and since the shipping of Polish coal to this countrypresented no serious difficulties, the negotiations could be carried toa conclusion, provided that the Poles were prepared to sell for sterling.If, however, they asked for concessions such as the supply of merchantshipping, which raised serious difficulties in other respects, the matter should be brought back to Ministers for further consideration.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power, as soon as hewas satisfied about the availability of shipping, mightauthorise the National Coal Board to increase their purchases of American coal to 1 - 2 million tons.(2) Authorised the Minister of Transport, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations, totake the steps outlined in paragraph 3 of the memorandum annexed to CP. (50) 299 to make shipping immediately available for the transport of American coal to thiscountry.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange for discussions to be opened regarding the amount of Polishcoal which could be imported into this country; and agreed that 1 million tons could be bought if the PolishGovernment were prepared to sell unconditionally forsterling.The Cabinet then considered the proposal that a further cut of1 million tons should be made in coal exports, to be allocated betweenforeign customers in the manner outlined in CP. (50) 287.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, if the output of coalin the remaining months of the coal year exceeded present expecta-tions, any available coal would be used to make good the further cutsin exports which were now proposed.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Swedes hadthreatened to cut iron ore supplies when first informed of the previous
Coal. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the MinisterPriority of Fuel and Power (CP. (50) 286) seeking authority to instruct the for Power       National Coal Board that, in any week in which total coal supplies fellStations.        short of the amount needed to meet inland programmes, electricitypower stations should be given their full requirements even where this meant that industry would receive less than its requirements.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that previous experience had shown that cuts in the supply of coal to electricity power stationshad worse effects on industrial production than cuts in coal suppliedsupplied direct to industry. He would take steps to ensure that theBritish Electricity Authority did not take undue advantage of thispriority. The Authority had agreed to suspend for the present actiondesigned to promote sales of electricity, on the understanding that asimilar restraint was observed by the Gas Boards.The President of the Board of Trade said that he felt obliged toaccept the Ministers proposals. He was anxious, however, to be assured that either the Ministry of Fuel and Power or the national coal Board possessed full records of the stocks of coal held week-by-week by power stations, gas works and the larger industrial users,so as to ensure that, if the position became more difficult and stocksdwindled, the available supplies could be directed where they were most needed. The Minister of Fuel and Power undertook to satisfyhimself that this information was available.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was the general view that all advertising of gas and elec-tricity should be suspended for the time being.(b) Since the shortage of electricity was likely to last for a con-siderable time, all devices likely to promote a more economical use ofcut, and they might renew this threat when faced with the present proposals. There was some risk that Italy would threaten to reducesulphur supplies. Strong objection to what was now proposed might also be expected from the Irish Republic.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that,having regard to understandings which had been reached with them,he was anxious that the Irish Republican Government should receiveearly notice of the further cuts proposed so that they could get intonegotiation with other suppliers.There was general agreement that negotiations should be initiatedfor the slowing down of deliveries to all countries and for the absolutecuts for the whole of 1951 in respect of certain countries proposedin paragraph 6 of the report annexed to CP. (50) 287; and that, as there proposed, protection should be given to the National Coal Boardagainst any action for damages for breach of contract in the case ofGermany. The position would have to be reviewed if coal importing countries threatened retaliatory action which was likely adversely to affect this country&apos;s economy.It was also agreed that these proposals to reduce coal exports,and also the possibility of importing coal from Poland, should be notified to the Economic Commission for Europe. Such notificationwould be in accordance with the general line which we had taken inthe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation in recom-. mending international discussion of impending shortages of rawmaterials.The Cabinet-(4) Approved the proposals for a further cut of 1 million tonsin coal exports, on the lines outlined in paragraph 6 ofthe report annexed to CP. (50) 287.
Coal.Manpower.(previous reference:CM. (50) 75thConclusions,Minute 3.)Service withForces.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (50) 297) outlining a number of measures whichhe wished to take in order to stimulate recruitment and preventwastage in the coalmining industry.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was gravely con-cerned about the long-term difficulties of the National Coal Board.If present trends continued, the Ministry of Labour contemplated that by the end of 1951 the total labour force might have declined to665,000 men. By 1953 numbers might be down to a figure which theNational Coal Board had not expected to reach until 1965. Thisyear&apos;s production of coal would be 204 million tons and, on presenttrends, the total production next year would not exceed 200 million tons, whereas at least 210 million tons would be required. There wereobjections to all the steps which he proposed but, in his view, these objections were over-ridden by the need to avoid a continuing fuelshortage which would cripple British industry and the rearmament programme.The Minister said that it was essential to discourage recruitment of miners for the Armed Forces and to bring back to the pits as many as possible of the miners who had recently joined the Forces or been called up. Total figures were not available for the country as awhole, but in the Yorkshire coal field alone 952 miners had left the mines for the Services in 1950.The Minister of Defence pointed out that, apart from serious repercussions on the Services, the efficacy of the measures proposedby the Minister of Fuel and Power was much impaired by the absenceof any power to retain in the mining industry men who were released from the Services to return to mining. The absence of any directionof labour or freezing of employment made the present proposals quite different from the schemes which had been operated successfully inthe first and second world wars.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Services Ihould not foster recruitment for the Forces in mining areas, and the recruiting authorities should urge miners whovolunteered for the Forces to stay in the pits. Such measures wouldnot prevent a miner from joining the Forces if he were determined todo so, but no encouragement would be given to him.(b) Difficulty was felt about the proposal that volunteers whohad joined the Forces this year should be urged to return to the pits.Unless special steps were taken, there would be no certainty that areleased man would in fact return to coalmining. Bad feeling mightbe created in units if it were felt that in the ordinary way substantial sums had to be paid to purchase release, whereas ex-miners werebeing encouraged to go without payment. At the same time thelabour force in the mines could not be built up without some dis-crimination in favour of miners, and it might be possible by publicityelectricity should be encouraged. In particular, thermostatic control should be incorporated as widely as possible in all new electricalappliances.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to give priority to the supply of coal for electricity power stations, on thebasis outlined in paragraph 6 of CP. (50) 286, on theunderstanding that the British Electricity Authority wouldnot build up stocks beyond their reasonable requirements.(2) Invited tha. Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange that alladvertising of gas and electricity should be suspended forthe time being.
in niining villages to encourage the parents of ex-miners, who had recently volunteered for the forces, to ask for their release. any scheme of release could not, however, be justified unless there was some certainty that the individual released would in fact return tothe pits. The scheme might provide for conditional release from theServices for so long as the individual worked in the pits. proposals on these lines might be open to the objection that they appeared toreTintroduce an element of direction of labour, and their feasibilityand implications would have to be examined further before theCabinet could take a final decision on them.(c) Considerable objection was seen to any proposal that minerswho were reservists and had been called up, should be sent back tothe pits. Many of them would now be on active service; and, if theywere withdrawn, further reservists from other walks of life wouldhave to be called up to take their place. It was not at present con-templated that any further reservists should be recalled to the colours;but, if any further recall were contemplated, the question could beconsidered whether miners should be excluded. If exclusion of minerswas approved as a long-term measure, it would be necessary toconsider whether miners who were reservists should continue toreceive reserve pay.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange that publicity in mining areas designed to recruit miners for the forces should cease and that miners who volunteered for theForces should be urged to remain in their presentemployment.(2) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange for theOfficial Coal Committee, in consultation with the Ministryof Defence, to consider further whether it was practicable to devise an effective scheme by which miners who had recently volunteered for service in the Forces could, if theywere willing, return to the pits.(3) Agreed that no action should be taken to secure the returnto the pits of reservists now serving with the Forces.Recruitment. There was general agreement that there should be an increasedpublicity campaign in the coal-fields, designed to stimulate recruit-ment and to prevent wastage.Italian Labour. In regard to the employment of Italian labour, The Minister ofHealth said that he thought that the recruitment of Italians would be unpopular with miners generally and might lead to a reduction in output.There was general agreement that the Minister of Fuel and power, without committing the Government, should sound theExecutive of the National Union of Mine workers about the employ-ment of Italian workers.The Cabinet  *(4) Authorised the increased publicity campaign in the coal-fieldsproposed in paragraph 13(&amp;) of CP. (50) 297.(5) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to sound the Execu-tive of the National Union of Mineworkers on the employ-ment of Italian workers in the mines.(6) Agreed to postpone until a later meeting the question ofsupplementary pensions and the other outstanding issues raised in CP. (50) 297.Cabinet Office, S.WA,4th December, 1950.
