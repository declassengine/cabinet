integration 2.  The Cabinet had before them a report (CP. (50) 149) by theof French and   Committee of Ministers which the Prime Minister had appointed, inGerman Coal   pursuance of their decision of 22nd June, to examine the issues and Steel        arising from the report (CP. (50) 128) already made by a workingindustries.       party of officials on the French Foreign Minister^ proposals for(Previous        integrating the coal and steel industries of Western Europe.   the reference:      Committee of Ministers recommended that any international author-C.M. (50) 39th ity established to control these industries should comprise threeConclusions.    elements, viz., (i) an inter-Governmental Council of Ministers; (ii) anMinute 1.)      independent Executive Council, responsible to the ministerial council and consisting of &quot; industrial statesmen&quot; rather thantechnicians; and (iii) an Advisory Council of Government representa-tives, workers and employers from member countries. After givingtheir reasons for preferring this type of authority, the Committee wenton to express their views on a number of the issues raised in thereport of the official working party.The Cabinet also had before them memoranda (CP. (50) 154 and153) by the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations on the strategic and Commonwealth impli-cations of the French Governments proposals.The Cabinet first discussed the report of the Committee of Minis-ters. The main points raised in their discussion were as follows:  (a) Doubts were expressed about the suggestion, made in para-graph 11 of the report, that the proposed Executive Council shouldhave power to veto plans for further investment in the coal and steel industries of the member countries, subject only to the general lines ofpolicy laid down by the Ministerial Council. It was agreed that, inthe first instance at any rate, general control over investment shouldbe exercised by the Council of Ministers, and that the proposed powerto veto should be reserved to them.ib) It was also suggested that, in any proposals which might eventually be submitted on behalf of the United Kingdom Govern-ment, greater prominence should be given to the problem of expand-ing Europe&apos;s production of coal and steel, and to the financial measures necessary to enable this expansion to be carried out with-out inflation. The French authors of this proposal had viewed itlargely in terms of Europe&apos;s consumption of coal and steel: theUnited Kingdom Government should seek to set it in a wider perspec-tive, as enabling Europe to meet the vast potential demand for coal and steel in under-developed countries throughout the world. unless these points were stressed, there was a risk that the scheme would be presented as a producers&apos; cartel designed primarily to regulate pro-duction under conditions of falling demand.(c) Some concern was expressed at the statement in paragraph 15of the report that, if an international authority were established, theUnited Kingdom industries would have to abandon their existing practice of fixing an export price higher than the home price. TheCabinet were, however, informed that the conditions in which theUnited Kingdom industries were able to command higher prices39001-2 b 2Queen Mary&apos;s 1. jhe Prime Minister said that members of the Cabinet wouldCarpet. have been glad to learn that the carpet which Queen Mary had worked in gros point needlework and had given to the Government forsale in North America in furtherance of the export drive had beenbought for $100,000 by a Canadian women&apos;s organisation and, after further exhibition in Canada, was to become the property of theCanadian people.The Cabinet agreed to place on record their deep appreciation ofQueen Mary&apos;s gift in a letter signed by all members of the Cabinet.
i!112overseas than in the home market were likely to disappear before, the,proposed international authority came into being.(d) Attention was drawn to the statement in paragraph 11 of thereport that it would be a function of the intematipnal authority toensure that production was undertaken, in those countries whichcould produce most efficiently. It was the view, of the Cabinet thatthe criterion of efficient production should not be allowed to over-ride strategic considerations.(e) In paragraph 7 of the report it was suggested that the mem-bers of the Executive Council should have international status.Doubts were expressed about the expediency of conferring any kindof diplomatic immunity on these persons.The Cabinet (1) Approved, in principle, subject to the points noted in para-graphs (a) and (ft) above, the scheme outlined in CP: (50)149 for an international authority responsible for inte-grating the coal and: steel industries of Western Europe;and invited the Chancellor, of-the Exchequer to arrangefor officials of. the Departments concerned to elaborateiri,greater detail a scheme On those lines, taking into account/&apos;the further points noted in paragraphs (c)-(e) above.The; Cabinet next considered at what stage proposals on these-lines should be communicated to the French Government. They were informed that the Foreign Secretary Was anxious that any communi-catiori to the French Government should be made to the french foreign Minister through the British Embassy in Paris and wished atthis stage to confine himself to a statement of the broad principles which had been endorsed ity the, recent Parliamentary- debates. Inview of. the division of opinion on this subject within the FrenchCabinet, it was undesirable that the Chancellor qf the exchequer should be drawn into discussing it with other French Ministers during his forthcoming visit to Paris. There was general agreement with theForeign Seeretajry&apos;s views oh these points^ The. further suggestion was, however, made that the United Kingdom,Government might bewell-advised to defer putting forward any proposals until their views were invited. On this there was some division of opinion. On theone hand it was recognised that, if the present proposals of theFrench Government failed to command general agreement in theinternational conference now proceeding, there would be some dis-positiori to blame the United Kingdom Government for the break-down if they had put forward alternative proposals from outside theconference. On the other hand, the United Kingdom Governmentwere already being criticised for adopting a purely negative attitudetowards this plan, and from that point ot view it was desirable thatthey should seize any opportunity that offered of putting forwardsome constructive proposals of their own. After discussion it was recognised that it was impossible to determine at present when theappropriate moment might come for putting to other governments proposals on the lines indicated in CP. (50) 149.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Committee of Ministers which had submitted thisreport (CP. (50) 149) to continue to keep in tbuch withthe progress of the international discussions in. Paris, andto watch for a favourable opportunity for putting forwardah alternative scheme oh the lines indicated in their report.(3) Invited the same Committee of Ministers to take into con-sideiation the memoranda (CP. (50) 154 and 153) submittedby the Minister of Defence and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations on the strategic and Common-wealth implications of the proposal for integrating thecoal and steel industries of Western Europe.
Korea. .(previous reference:CM-(50) 41stConclusions,-&apos;-Minute 3.) !parliamentary debate.-&apos;&quot;&apos;- ;iEconomicAction.3. The Cabinet had a general discussion on the line to be takenin the forthcoming debate in the House Of Commons on the situationin Korea. The main points raised were as follows: -(a) The Cabinet were informed that the Conservative opposition were anxious that the debate should take place on a Motion; and, asit was to be held on a Supply day, it would be open to them to tablea Motion of their own. The Cabinet thought it preferable that the debate should be held on a Government Motion; and, after dis-cussion, they approved the terms of a Motion to be tabled in the names of the Prime Minister and five other members of the Cabinet,jjj (b) What line should the Prime Minister take, in opening the debate, in relation to the criticism that the action taken by theGovernments of the United States and the United Kingdom in sup-port of the South Koreans was not in accordance with the letter ofthe United Nations Charter?Under Article 27 of the Charter decisions of the Security Councilon matters other than procedural matters required the affirmativevotes of seven members, including the concurring votes of thepermanent members of the Council; and it was argued that the council&apos;s resolution of 27th June was not valid since the representa-tive of the Soviet Uinon, a permanent member, had not been present on that occasion. On the other hand, the Council had on previous occasions taken decisions despite the abstention of a permanentmember; the Soviet Government had at least acquiesced in that pro-cedure; and it was arguable that the written constitution of theCouncil was in process of modification by practice. It was relevant to this argument that forty members of the United Nations had subsequently declared their support of the resolution passed by theSecurity Council. Moreover, it was provided under Article 51 that nothing in the Charter impaired the inherent right of individual orcollective self-defence against an armed attack on a member of theUnited Nations; and, although South Korea was not such a member,the action taken on her behalf was clearly in accordance with theprinciple embodied in this Article of the Charter.The Cabinefs conclusion was that the Prime Minister, while heshould not ignore the constitutional points which were being made,should argue that the action which the Western Powers were taking inSouth Korea was fully in accordance with the spirit of the united nations Charter and was in fact the first significant demonstration of the principle ,of collective security against aggression. He would proceed to develop the argument that it was the duty of peace-lovingnations to make the machinery of the United Nations work effectively,despite legal quibbles, and not to allow it to be frustrated by theabstentions Of a single member; and that for this purpose they were entitled to take advantage of procedures which, though they might appear to conflict with the strict letter of the Charter, had beenaccepted as reasonable by member States.(c) The Government would be asked in the debate whether they proposed to send further forces, particularly land forces, to Korea.The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff were not disposed to recommend the despatch of any land forces to Korea. Thepoint was also made that the United States action in coveringFormosa had freed for other operations the Chinese Communistforces which had been about to attack it, and this increased the potential threat to Hong Kong. No formal request for reinforcementshad been received from the United States Government; and in all thecircumstances the Government spokesmen in the debate would bewell-advised to discount any expectation that the United kingdom could make further forces available for operations in Korea.The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (CP. (50) 155) regarding the economic action which might betaken in support of the military operations in Korea. The only prac-tical action open to British authorities was to prevent the shipment ofgoods from Hong Kong to North Korea. It Was, however, desirable39001-2 b 3
that, in order to strengthen the hands of the Hong Kong Government,the export of goods from the United Kingdom to North Korea shouldalso be prohibited. 1    i &apos; - 1The United States Government had also enquired whether pres-sure could be brought to bear on the Shell oil company to suspendtheir deliveries of oil to Communist China. This, however, would have involved a reversal of United Kingdom policy towards China; and theUnited States Government had been informed that Shell&apos;s current oil supplies to China were of negligible importance and that the com-pahy would be asked to refrain from increasing them. J..The Cabinet- r   ;(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to make an order prohibiting exports from the United Kingdom to Northv&apos;:;&apos;&apos; Korea. i)(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to ask theGovernment of Hong Kong to take such measures as were necessary to prevent the shipment of goods from HongKong to North Korea. ^      ^(3) Took note with approval of the reply returned to the enquiryreceived from the United States Government about thesupply of British oil to Communist China.The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the Minister ofState (CP. (50) 157) recommending that the United Kingdom Govern-ment should immediately impose the same control over strategic exports to China and North Korea as was already imposed overexports to the Soviet Union and her satellites in Europe, and should arrange for the Governments of Hong Kong and Singapore to impose the same control over exports from those territories.In discussion it was pointed out that, as was admitted in para-graph 6 of CP. (50) 157, the imposition of these controls would not secure any immediate practical results: the justification for the pro-posal lay in the political and psychological disadvantage of declin-ing to Co-operate with the United States Government on this subject in present circumstances. Ministers felt that this disadvantage mustbe balanced against that of appearing to offer ah affront at the present justice to Communist China. The action taken by the United Statesduring the past ten days in the Pacific area had increased the potentialthreat to Hong Kong; and this was not a mordent at which the UnitedKingdom Government should, for no practical advantage, make a gesture which might alienate the Communist Government of China.The Cabinefs conclusion was that, while these powers should bebrought into immediate operation in respect of strategic exports to north Korea, they should not for the present be used in respect ofsuch exports to China.The Cabinet (4) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to take immediate steps to prevent the export of strategic goods from the United Kingdom to North Korea:(5) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to arrange thatthe Governments of Hong Kong and Singapore shouldtake general powers to control the export of strategic goods from those territories to any destination, and shouldmake immediate use of those powers to prevent the exportof strategic goods to North Korea. &apos;J(6) Agreed to defer for the time being action to prevent the* export of strategic goods to China, whether;! from theUnited Kingdom or from Hong Kong and Singapore.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of State(CP. (50) 156) on the present position in respect of Formosa.The Minister of State said that the full implications of the newUnited States policy towards Formosa were being studied, and an appreciation would shortly be submitted to the Cabinet of its effects
on our relations with China and our policy in the Far East. Mean-while, if it became necessary to answer questions on this subject, itwas recommended, that these should be handled on the lines indicatedin paragraph 7 of his memorandum.In discussion it was pointed out that, if the forthcoming debate inthe House of Commons took place on the basis of the Motion whichthe Cabinet had approved, references to Formosa would presumablybe out of order. It was unlikely, therefore; that the government spokesmen would be called upon to deal with this matter on that occasion; and, in general, it was preferable that Ministers should forthe present avoid being drawn into any discussion of these questions.The Cabinet-(7) Took note of CP. (50) 156; and agreed that Ministers should for the present endeavour to avoid making any statement on the subject of Formosa.4; The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 148) recommending that; in the forthcoming debate on 7th July in the House of Commons on the report of theKitchen Committee, the Government should make it clear that theywere not prepared to give increased Exchequer assistance to theCommittee&apos;s operations and should suggest&apos;that the-Committee beasked to call in outside experts to advise them on the efficiency of their organisation.The Lord President said that the present relations between theKitchen Comittee and the Government were not altogether satis-factory since the Committee from time to time undertook onerousfinancial responsibilities without consulting the Treasury but expected the Treasury to meet their losses. The expert enquiry which he pro^posed should cover, not only the general running of the RefreshmentDepartment, but also the methods of keeping the accounts.In discussion the following points were made: t-\ (a) In 1.949 the Refreshment Department was-involved in a lossof more than  45,000 on a turnover of just under:  92,000. The loss&apos;was made up of free services and payments by the Ministry of Worksvalued at  24;000, a grant-in-aid of  13,000 from the House ofCommons Vote and a deficit of: about  8,000 which the KitchenCommittee expected the Exchequer to meet.(b) It would be useful if such figures as were available for thepresent year could be obtained in time for the forthcoming debate.The continuous attendance of Members at Westminster should have enabled the Kitchen Committee to operate the Refreshment Depart-ment more profitably.(c) It would be unfortunate if it proved to be necessary to increasethe cost of meals in order to meet the deficit, since prices were alreadyhigh and the food was not altogether satisfactory. Many members were not in a position to pay higher prices.(d) At some stage it would be desirable to vary the present arrangements under which the Refreshment Department staff were paid for the whole 52 weeks of the year, since there was no.reason why members of the staff who were able to secure employment, duringrecesses should in effect receive double pay during that period.(e) The Travel Association had suggested that selected/touristsshould, be allowed during recesses to make use of rooms in the houses of Parliament and to have meals there. This suggestion was underconsideration by the Lord Great Chamberlain. A similar suggestion had been made in connection with the arrangements for the Festivalof Britain.
The Cabinet-Agreed that, in the debate on 7th July on the Report of theKitchen Committee, the Government spokesmen should indicate that the Exchequer could not undertake an indefinite liability to meet the losses on the operation of theRefreshment Department, and that the Committee would bewell-advised to call in outside experts to advise them on themore efficient running of the Department and on itsaccounting arrangements.Soap Rationing. 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 137) proposing that the rationing of soap should bebrought to an end on 10th September.The Minister of Food said that consumer surveys showed that thepresent soap ration was not being taken up fully in soft-water dis-tricts, while in hard-water districts there was an unsatisfied demandfor more soap. This state of affairs could not be met by a general increase in the ration. The soap manufacturers and distributors con-sidered that, taking into account the widespread use of soap substi-tutes, there were sufficient supplies to allow soap to be de-rationed.In discussion it was stated that increased requirements of fatsfor soap-making should not seriously affect the import programme;that increased production of soap would increase the supply ofglycerine, which was below industrial needs; and that there was noreason to believe that the soap manufacturers, under continued pres-sure from the Ministry of Food, would relax their efforts to increasethe export of soap.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal in CP. (50) 137 that soap rationingshould be brought to an end on 10th September.scottish affairs.(previous reference:G.M. (50) 33rdConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for Scotland (CP. (50) 150) summarising a discussion which he had had with a deputation from the Scottish national assembly on 17th June, and setting out the terms of the reply whichhe proposed to give to a Parliamentary Question about this meeting.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that no encouragement should be given to the desire of the Scottish National Assembly to send a deputation to the Prime Minister.(2) Took note of the reply which the Secretary of State forScotland proposed to give to a Question about his recent meeting with a deputation from the Assembly.industrial disputes.Strike ofSmithfieldDrivers.(previous reference :CM. (50) 41stConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Home Secretary said that on the previous day Service-men had started to move cargoes of meat from the cold stores (otherthan those in the docks) and that satisfactory progress was beingmade. The meat porters at the cold stores had come out on strike and Servicemen were doing their work. The maintenance men at the cold stores had, however, continued at work and it appeared to be unnecessary to retain naval technicians who were standing by to take their place. The drivers and warehousemen employed by about twelvewholesale provision merchants in the Smithfield area who distributedbutter, eggs and bacon had come out on strike because Servicemenwere being used to bring meat into Smithfield and arrangements hadbeen made for Service vehicles and 200 additional Servicemen to do their work. It would be necessary in the following week to useServicemen to draw supplies from the docks cold stores and later in
the week it would be necessary to unload meat supplies from ships in the docks. These later developments might lead to an extension ofthe strike to the docks.In discussion it was explained that the Distribution and Market-ing Committee proposed, in the light of the recurrent difficulties atSmithfield, to re-examine the proposal that Smithfield should beI retained permanently as the London wholesale meat market. It was agreed that the Committee should seek expert opinion, including that of the military transport authorities, on the transport aspects of alternative proposals.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Home Secretary&apos;s statement and agreed thatit was not necessary to retain the naval technicians whowere standing by in case the maintenance men in the coldstores came out on strike.(2) Took note that the Distribution and Marketing Committeewould examine the question of the retention of Smithfieldmeat market on a long-term basis.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th July, 1950.
