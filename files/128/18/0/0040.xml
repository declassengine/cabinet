Korea. At a Press Conference earlier in the day President Truman had(Previous        stated, in reply to a question, that the use of the atom bomb in KoreaReference:      was under consideration, and that the choice of the use of weaponsCM. (50) 79th   would rest with the United Nations commander in the field. He had conclusions;    subsequently issued a correction making it clear that, under united minute 3.)       States law, the use of the atom bomb could be authorised only by thePresident and that no such authorisation had been given. In spite ofthis correction, however, the statement had caused great alarm in theHouse of Commons. iThe Prime Minister said that urgent action was necessary in orderto allay public anxiety. Moreover, the military situation in the far east had deteriorated seriously and the consequences of a possible warwith China had to be faced. He therefore thought it desirable,especially as President Truman had now himself made an importantpronouncement as Head of the United States Government, that thereshould be direct consultation between the President and himself; andhe proposed to suggest to the President that he should go immediately to Washington for personal consultations with him.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was politically important that the Prime Minister shouldbe able to announce his intention of going to Washington when he spoke in the foreign affairs debate later that night. A message should, therefore.be sent to President Truman forthwith so that the PrimeMinister might be able to say in his announcement that the president had accepted his proposal for personal consultations. If, however,the Presidents reply had not been received in time, the Prime minister should nevertheless announce to the House of Commons that he had made this proposal.(b) The impression should not be given that the only purpose ofthe visit was to discuss the use of the atom bomb. That question would, however, be discussed and the responsibility for deciding onthe use of the atom bomb would have to be defined. A decision ofthis importance could not be left to the commander in the field oreven to the United States Government alone. All nations which had contributed to the United Nations force in Korea should be consulted and there should be unanimity among them before a decision wastaken to use the bomb.(c) The Prime Minister would wish to discuss with the president the general situation in the Far Bast and its effect on defensive preparations in other parts of the world. The Americans should be pressed to establish the supreme command in Europe without further delay, whatever the attitude of the French Government proved to beon the question of Germany&apos;s participation in the defence of western europe. There was also urgent need for an exchange of views onraw materials. American action in this matter was seriously handi-capping the efforts of other countries, including the United Kingdom.The Prime Minister should be provided with briefs covering all these subjects before he left for Washington.(d) The Foreign Secretary would at once send a telegram to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington outlining the general objects of the Prime Minister^ visit and this telegram should be repeated by the Commonwealth Relations Office for the personal information of commonwealth Prime Ministers.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the Prime Ministers proposal to visit President( j Truman and invited him to include an announcement tothat effect in &quot;his speech in the House of Commons that night.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington of the Prime Ministers pro-posal and of the object of his visit.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to repeat the Foreign Secretary&apos;s telegram to Common-wealth Prime Ministers for their personal information.Cabinet Office, SWA,1st December, 1950.
