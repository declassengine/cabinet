Korea. l.  The representative of the Soviet Government on the Security(Previous Council had announced his intention to resume his seat on the reference: Council when his turn came to preside on 1st August, and he had.(50)50th given notice of his intention to bring forward resolutions on China&apos;conclusions, representation on the Council and on the Korean situation. the minute 3.) Minister of State said that the United States Government had beenProceedings in anxious that a resolution of their own on the Korean situation shouldSecurity be&apos; tabled before the Soviet representative took his seat, presumablyCouncil. as a procedural move to ensure that their resolution would be dis-cussed before those which were to be moved by the Soviet represen-tative. They had been dissuaded from putting forward a resolutionestablishing a Security Council Commission, members of whichmight be sent as observers to countries threatened with aggression.They had then suggested an alternative form of resolution whichcondemned the North Koreans for their continued defiance of theUnited Nations and called on all States, not only to use their influence to prevail upon the North Koreans to cease this defiance, but alsoto avoid any action which might have the effect of extending the areaof conflict. This was open to the objection that, while its first two parts added nothing to the resolutions which the Security council had already passed on this subject, its third part could be exploitedto the disadvantage of the United States Government. But, althoughthe Americans had shown Us the resolution in draft, they had not allowed us sufficient time in which to make effective criticism of it;and although we had counselled delay, they had in fact tabled theresolution late on the previous evening with a view, no doubt, to its being discussed in advance of the resolutions which the Soviet repre-sentative was proposing to bring forward.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement.China. 2.   The Prime Minister suggested that the Cabinet should reviewRepresentation their policy towards the representation of China on the Securityon the Security Council. It was clear that we must reject any suggestion of a bargainCouncil. by which a representative of the Communist Government of China(Previous       would be admitted to the Security Council in return for a settlementReference:      of the Korean situation. It was also clear that, as we were unwillingCM. (50) 24th  to agree that a Korean settlement should be made conditional uponConclusions,    a change in China&apos;s representation on the Council, it would be minute 5.)       improper for us to take the line that the latter question could not bediscussed until after a settlement of the Korean question had beenreached.  Our real difficulty was to decide what line we should npwtake if the question of China&apos;s representation on the Council was raised on its merits, irrespective of the Korean situation. -The Cabinet were reminded that it had hitherto been our policy to try to avoid taking a definite line on this question, in any. of the agencies of the United Nations, until it was clear that a majority would vote in favour of a change in China&apos;s representation. Thebasis of this policy was that we should avoid giving unnecessaryoffence to United States opinion by registering an ineffective volte infavour of the representation of the Communist Government of China.In favour of maintaining that policy it was argued that, if we took a more positive line at this stage, we might give offence to some sections of United States opinion. Further, as in other matters (forexample, the despatch of troops to Korea and the denial of british oil and strategic exports to China) we had accepted positive sacrificesin order to align our policy with that of the United States Govern-ment over Korea, would it not be unrealistic to risk alienating UnitedStates opinion for the sake of making a further gesture towards theChinese Communists? Our recognition of the Chinese communist government had after all produced no fruitful results so far: we hadnot even succeeded in securing an exchange of diplomatic representatives.
Council ofEurope -Cosvcnnss OSHuman Rights.(previous reference:CM. (49) 62ndConclusions,Minute 5.)3.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda-(i) by the Minister of State (CP. (50) 179) proposing that theForeign Secretary should be given discretion, subject tothe fulfilment of certain conditions, to accept at the Com-mittee of Ministers of the Council of Europe the draftConvention on Human Rights;(ii) by the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (50) 189) in-dicating objections, from the point of view of colonial governments, to a right of petition by individuals and groups to the proposed European Court of human rights. IIThe Minister of State explained that at their first meeting in 1949the Consultative Assembly of the Council of Europe had consideredsome rather unsatisfactory proposals for a Human Rights convention and had invited the Committee of Ministers to arrange for a draftConvention to be drawn up. The interested Departments of theUnited Kingdom Government had been consulted in the preparationof the draft Convention annexed to CP. (50) 179; and he understoodthat, in the main, the present draft met their views. The objections raised by the Colonial Secretary to the proposal that individuals andOn the other side it was pointed out that the United StatesGovernment had indicated that they would regard,themselves asbound by a majority vote in favour of a change of Chinese repre-sentation on the Security Council; and, that being so, it was surelyour duty to express our view by a positive vote if the question was raised on its merits. By our act of recognition, we had accepted thefact that the Communist Government were the effective Governmentof China; and we could not logically defend the continuance on theSecurity Council of a representative of the Chinese Nationalists.Moreover, there was a grave risk that on this issue a cleavage ofopinion would arise between the Asiatics and the rest of the world;and it was vitally important for us that we should not appear tobe opposing the united view of the Asiatic peoples. Finally, our policy towards China had been founded on the principle that weshould at all costs avoid action which would force the chinese communists into the arms of Moscow.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it seemed to be the preponderant view in the Cabinet that we shouldnot be parties to any bargain in the Security Council by which asettlement of the Korean situation would be made conditional upona change in China&apos;s representation in the Council; that we shouldnot allow ourselves to be put in a position in which we appearedto be obstructing the admission of Communist China to the Council;and that we should seek to avoid the weak position of appearing to wait to see how others would vote before we ourselves expressedany positive view. If the question was raised on its merits at theSecurity Council, the United Kingdom representative should ask foran adjournment and seek instructions from the Government on themanner in which he should cast his vote. The nature of the instruc-tions to be given to him by the Foreign Secretary would doubtlessturn to some extent on the circumstances in which the question was raised. The Foreign Secretary would, however, find it useful to havethe Cabinefs views for his guidance in determining what instructions should be given when the time came.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to convey to the Foreign Secre-tary the substance of the views expressed in the cabinets discussion.
groups should be empowered to appeal to a European Court of human Rights could be met by making it clear that the UnitedKingdom Government did not propose to adopt the optional clause(Article 46) in regard to the Court.; The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a Government com-mitted to the policy of a planned economy could not ratify thisConvention on Human. Rights. He drew attention to various articles in the draft Convention, e.g., on powers of entry into private pre-mises, which were inconsistent with the powers of economic control which, were essential to the operation of a planned economy. TheConvention had originally been conceived as a statement of therights which western civilisation preserved for the individual, in eon^-trast to the absence of such rights in Communist-dominated countries;but, if the Convention were adopted in its present form, this country could be pilloried for infractions of its provisions which would be unavoidable in the course of economic planning. The draft Conven-tion would be acceptable only to those who believed in a free economy and a minimum amount of State intervention in economic affairs.In further discussion Ministers agreed that, if individuals had aright to take alleged infractions of the Convention from the courts ofthis country to a European Court of Human Rights, the effect on thejudicial system of this country might be very serious. It was intoler-able that the code of common law and statute law which had been built up in this country over many years should be made subject to review by an International Court administering no defined system oflaw. Under the other draft Convention on Human Rights which wasunder discussion by the United Nations the right of petition againstbreaches of the Convention was confined to States.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Foreign secretary should urge the Committee of Ministers to refrain from submittingthis draft Convention for consideration by the Consultative Assembly.It was recognised that in their report to the Assembly the Committeeof Ministers would have to explain the grounds on which the draft was being held back, and there might be a public debate on the reportin the Assembly. Some Ministers considered that, as the convention was designed mainly to mark the difference of outlook betweendemocratic and Communist States, the Committee of ministers might be urged to recommend the adoption of a declaration ratherthan a Convention; but it was pointed out that the United nations had already adopted a declaration on this subject and that both theUnited Nations and the Council of Europe had now gone beyond thispoint to consideration of the terms of a Convention. There was an undesirable duplication of work between the United Nations, whichhad been considering this subject for some years, and the Council ofEurope; but, while something might be made&apos;of the point that theCouncil of Europe was merely duplicating the work of the united nations, the argument could not be pressed too far since there hadbeen previous occasions on which we could have advanced it and hadnot done so. The main line of argument must therefore be that governments needed more time to consider the repercussions of thedraft Convention on their domestic law, and reference could no doubt be made to current economic developments in Europe which wouldhave to be borne in mind in a re-examination of the draft. It wouldbe useful if the Lord Chancellor could see Sir David Maxwell Fvfeand explain to him some of the legal difficulties which the draft Con-vention presented.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should endeavour to secure. that the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europeremitted the draft Convention on Human Rights forfurther examination by Governments, and refrained fromsubmitting it for consideration at this year&apos;s session ofthe Consultative Assembly.
(2) Invited the Minister of State to submit a memorandum ex-plaining how it came about that a draft Convention whichwas not in accord with the Governments economic policy-should have reached such an advanced stage of prepara-tion before it was submitted for consideration by ministers.defence expenditure.Offer of UnitedStatesAssistance.(previous reference:CM. (50) 50thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (50) 181) regarding the additional effort whichmight be made by the United Kingdom to increase the defence pre-?aredness of the North Atlantic Powers, in response to Presidentruman&apos;s recent appeal and his offer of financial assistance.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the United StatesGovernment had asked the Governments of all the other north atlantic Powers to provide them, before 5th August, with particulars of the nature and extent of the increased effort which they were will-ing and able to undertake in increasing their armed forces and their military production, and of the further military production pro-grammes which they could initiate with American financial assistance.The Cabinet had already authorised additional defence expenditureof  100 million, of which about  30 million would be incurred in1950-51 and  70 million in 1951-52; and they had also approved inprinciple a civil defence programme of  137 million over the next four years. In addition, further expenditure was likely to be incurred in improving the pay and increasing the size of the armed forces during this period, and for this he proposed to allow a further 100 million, of which  10 million might fall in 1950-51 and  30million in each of the three following years. These decisions and proposals would produce the following totals of defence expenditure over the four financial years from 1950 to 1954:  820900840  million850The Supply Departments had been asked what additional expendi-ture upon armaments would be physically possible during these fouryears. Their programmes, which were set out in the Annexesto CP. (50) 181, were estimated to involve over the four years thefollowing additional expenditure:    million4 175 293 342This would bring the total of defence expenditure in each of the fouryears to the following figures:-  million824 1,075 1,133 1,192In addition it was estimated that li million tons of merchant shippingcould be provided over the period.Programmes of this magnitude could not be undertaken withoutsubstantial financial aid from the United States. He therefore pro-posed that, in answering the second part of the enquiry by the UnitedStates Government, we should take the following line. We should state that by decisions already taken or likely to be taken in the nearfuture we were committed to a defence expenditure of about  820million in 1950-51 and  900 million in 1951-52. We considered thaton general economic grounds an annual expenditure of  950 million on defence was the most we could afford in 1951-52 and in the follow-ing two years. If, therefore, we were to undertake the additional programme indicated above, we must ask for United States assistanceto cover the difference between an expenditure of  2,850 million overthe three vears and the total programme of  3,400 million, i.e., weshould ask for United States aid to the extent of  550 million. We
should seek to secure that this assistance was given in the form of free dollars which we could either hold or use to make purchases inany part of the world. We should make it clear that our offer was dependent on approval by Parliament. Our additional production programmes should be designed to meet the needs of other north atlantic. Powers, as well as those of our own forces, and we should propose that, in recognition of United States aid, transfers of equip-rnent should be made without payment between the North AtlanticPowers.In conclusion, the Chancellor stressed the fact that these pro-posals would commit the Government, subject to parliamentary approval, to a net expenditure on defence at the rate of  950 million a year over the next three years. Ministers should recognise thatthe resources required for this additional production could not beprovided without some reduction in Government expenditure, some additional taxation or some reduction in capital investment, or a combination of all three.The Minister of Defence said that these calculations were basedon the assumption that the cost of current defence policy would re-main constant throughout the period at  780 million a year. In factthere was bound to be some increase in this figure, by reason both of increased production costs and also of unexpected new commitments,such as the cost of active operations in Korea. Further, he was doubt-ful whether a total of  100 million over the four years would cover the whole cost of improving the pay and increasing the size of the armed forces. Proposals under these heads which he was hoping toput before his colleagues in the following week would, he feared,involve a larger expenditure than that. In these circumstances, he believed that the rate of defence expenditure to which the Govern-ment were committed, or would soon be committed, would exceed the figures put. forward in CP. (50) 181. The Chancellor of theExchequer said, in reply, that we could explain to the United states authorities that the cost of our requirements might prove in the eventto be greater than was stated in these figures and that, in particular,we were not yet able to make a firm estimate of the additional cost of improving the pay and increasing the size of our armed forces.Nevertheless, an annual expenditure of  950 million was the most thatwe ourselves could afford over this period. If, therefore, the actual costof our requirements proved to be greater than had been assumed inthese calculations, it followed that there must be either an increasein the amount of United States financial aid or a decrease in the addi-tional production programme now put forward.The Minister of Health said that he felt grave misgivings aboutthe implications of the proposals put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer. Our foreign policy had hitherto been based on theview that the best method of defence against Russian imperialism wasto improve the social and economic conditions of the countriesthreatened by Communist encroachment. The United States Govern-ment seemed now to be abandoning this social and political defence in favour of a military defence. He believed that this change of policy was misjudged, and that we should be ill-advised to follow it. TheUnited Kingdom could perhaps support the burden of this additional expenditure on defence without fatal damage to its economic and social structure. He doubted, however, whether the same was true of France and some of the other countries of Western Europe. If,as a result of this further military effort, their economic and socialstandards were still further reduced, their ability to resist the domesticthreat of communism would be seriously prejudiced.If the Cabinet now endorsed the proposal in paragraph 10 of CP.(50) 181 that the Government should commit themselves to defence expenditure at an annual rate of  950 million over the next three years,he foresaw very great difficulties for the Ministers responsible for social services.   They would be forced to accept reductions in the
Governments civil programmes; their only freedom would be todecide which of those programmes should suffer first or most. if some increase in defence expenditure was inevitable, would it notbe better to take the line that there could be no reduction in our existing level of expenditure on social services and capital investment,and to allocate to defence the increase in the national income whichwas expected to accrue from increased industrial productivity?In reply it was pointed out that, if the whole of the incrementfrom increased productivity were allocated to defence, this wouldinvolve a much larger defence expenditure than that proposed in CP.(50) 181. In fact, however, the product of future increases in industrial productivity had already been taken into account in the social andeconomic programmes to which the Government were committed.Those programmes assumed an increasing rate of expenditure; and what was contemplated in paragraph 10 of CP. (50) 181 was, not thatthe total of those programmes should be reduced below its existing level, but that some part of the planned expansion might have to be cut back.On the general question of the level of expenditure proposed in cp. (50) 181, some Ministers felt that the greater danger was thatthese proposals might appear, to the United States Government andto public opinion on both sides of the Atlantic, to take insufficientaccount of the dangers of the present international situation. Sincethe end of the war much had been done, by way of disposals ofammunition and surplus stores, which Ministers would never havecountenanced if they had known that we should be faced so soon witha prospect of becoming involved in war. The fact was that our forces were insufficiently equipped to meet the dangers with which we nowwere faced. It was abundantly clear that we must spend substantially more on defence if we were to play our full part under the north atlantic Treaty. Public opinion had come to recognise this veryclearly during recent weeks; and there Would be widespread support for a firm policy of accelerating, our defence preparations.In further discussion the point was made that at an annual figureof  950 million our defence expenditure would compare favourably,on the basis of a percentage of national income, with that which was tobe undertaken by the United States. Our proposals ought therefore to be accepted by the United States Government as an adequate con-tribution to the common effort. The total cost of the additional effort which we proposed to make, over the four-year period, was  1,100million; and the amount of the financial aid which we were proposing to ask the United States to provide was only 50 per cent, of this. Itwas, however, estimated that this would cover the dollar cost of theadditional dollar imports required and would also provide compensa-tion for the loss of exports which the programme might entail. Itshould therefore protect us from any consequent deterioration in our balance of payments.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 181.; and authorised theChancellor of the Exchequer to arrange, in consultationwith the Minister of State, for a communication to bemade to the United States Government;! on the lines indicated in that memorandum in reply to1 their request for information about the increased military effort whichthe United Kingdom Government were prepared to under-take and the further military production programmes which they could initiate with United States financialassistance.(2) Instructed the Commonwealth Relations Office to arrange forother Commonwealth Governments to be informed of theenquiry received from the United States Government andthe nature of the reply which was being returned toit.

(49) 6lst been impossible to meet the full claims of the responsible Ministers in conclusions, respect of water and sewerage development and in respect of newMinute 2.) building for manufacturing industry, including the food industries.! The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the claims of theMinister of Health in respect of sewerage and of the Minister of food in respect of the food industries had been fully considered by theProduction Committee. It would be impossible to consider any increase in either case without reopening the capital investment pro-gramme as a whole, and other Ministers would bring forward strong arguments against any curtailing of the investment for which theywere responsible. He suggested that it might be practicable for theMinister of Health to make some reallocation as between rural and large urban sewerage schemes.The Minister of Health said that a refusal to sanction a desirablesewerage scheme had immediate adverse repercussions on localauthorities and on the public in the areas affected. He had, therefore,thought it desirable on political grounds to bring his difficulties beforethe Cabinet. Since large urban schemes were required in connectionwith new housing, it would not in his view be practicable to switchinvestment from the towns to enable rural schemes to be started.The Minister of Food said that he was disturbed about the inadequacy of the facilities for slaughtering the larger number ofhome-fed cattle which would be coming forward in the autumn. Thefood-manufacturing industries also required a good deal of newaccommodation, in order to carry out their work in a proper manner.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would not be practicable to increase capital investment in sewerage or in the foodindustries without restricting investment on other services for whicha better claim could probably be made. The increased expenditureon defence made it impracticable to contemplate any increase in thetotal programme of capital investment.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer in paragraph 9 of CP.
