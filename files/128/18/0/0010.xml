Dublin. I.   The Home Secretary said that the next meeting of the Inter-Meeting of Parliamentary Union was to be held in Dublin. Officials were tointerparlia- address the members of the all-Party delegation from the Westminsterr,ientary Parliament on some of the matters which would be raised at thisUnion. meeting; and it had been suggested that these officials might advise the members of the delegation on the line to be taken if the issue of partition were raised. He himself felt that this was not a matter on which officials could properly advise the members of thisdelegation.The Cabinet endorsed the Home Secretary&apos;s view and invited him to arrange for the leader of the delegation (Major J. Milner, M.P.)to give suitable advice on this subject to the members of the delegation.Defence 2.   The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the KoreanExpenditure. situation and the possible developments which might follow from it.Active the Minister of Defence and the Chiefs of Staff had reviewed the stateDefence.        of preparedness of the Armed Forces; and the Defence Committee(Previous        had considered their recommendations in the light of PresidentReference:      Truman&apos;s recent Message to Congress.  The proposals put forwardCM. (49) 72nd by the Minister of Defence were that a further  30 million should conclusions,    be spent in the current financial year in meeting immediate deficienciesMinute l.)      and that this should be a first instalment in an accelerated programme which would call for an expenditure in 1951-52 of  980 million,including  30 million for increases in Service pay.   The DefenceCommittee had not been prepared at this stage to settle finally theDefence Estimates for 1951-52.   They had, however, agreed torecommend the Cabinet to authorise at once an additional expendi-ture of  100 million, of which something like  30 million might haveto be spent in the current financial year and met by a supplementary estimate in February 1951; and they recommended that an announce-ment to this effect should be made in the course of the Defence debate in the House of Commons on 26th July.  When the time came toconsider the Defence Estimates for next year in detail, ministers should consider what further expenditure would be required to enablethis country to play its full part under the North Atlantic Pact.In the course of the debate something would have to be said about the measures proposed for remedying the man-power deficien-cies of the Forces. The most pressing needs were for air-crews andtradesmen; and it might prove possible to meet these by offeringfinancial inducements to these special classes which would not involve any increase in the basic rates of Service pay. Alternatively, ifrecruitment to the regular Forces could not be sufficiently improved by these and other means, it might become necessary to considerextending the period of national service. This would, however, giverise to political, as well as administrative, difficulties; and theMinister of Defence had therefore appointed a special working partyto consider urgently the man-power problems now confronting theServices and the possible ways of remedying them.The Cabinet first discussed the necessity for a substantial increasein the current rate of defence expenditure. There was general support for the proposal that the expenditure of an additional  100 million should at once be authorised to meet immediate deficiencies and thus to put the Forces in a better position to face any emergency that might develop in the near future. Some misgivings were, however, expressed about the effects of raising defence expenditure in 1951-52 and. thefollowing years to a level of  980 million a year. Defence expendi-ture at that level would, it was suggested, absorb all the benefits ofthe estimated increase in industrial productivity, and would force the Government to choose between a lower standard of living orlonger dependence on United States aid. It was important that thesocial and economic implications of this accelerated programme should be fully considered, and that every effort should be made to
ensure that the additional munitions production was so arranged as&apos;       to conform, so far as practicable, with the Governments economicplans.In reply, it was pointed out that these major questions could be reserved for discussion when Ministers considered the defence estimates for 1951-52. They were not pre-judged by the present proposal to spend an additional  100 million on meeting immediatedeficiencies. Although much of the equipment urgently required forthis purpose would have to be manufactured, if it was to be ready in time, by firms already handling this class of work, care would betaken to place as many of the orders as was practicable in areas wherethere was already some unemployment and to avoid unnecessarydislocation of civil production, particularly for export. The PrimeMinister undertook to include some reference to this point in his speech in the forthcoming debate.In further discussion it was pointed out that the immediate increase in the Navy programme would have a beneficial social effect in deferring the unemployment which was beginning to develop inthe ship-building and ship-repairing industries. And, in the longer term, if a substantially increased programme Of munitions production was undertaken, the orders should be carefully spread and factories in development areas should be reopened or built in the interests bothof industrial dispersal and of social policy. These points were already under discussion between the Central Economic Planning Staff andthe Admiralty and Ministry of Supply.Service Pay. On the question of Service pay, the Cabinet recognised that(Previous       something would have to be said in the forthcoming debate to indicateReference:      that the Government would take effective steps to remedy the man-C.M. (48) 75th  power deficiencies in the Services, particularly in specialist classes suchConclusions,    as air-crews and tradesmen. At the same time, it was important that minute 4.)      nothing should be said which might be construed as committing theGovernment to any general increase in the basic rates of Service pay.The most convenient course would probably be to refer to the improved career and trade structure which had recently been intro-duced in the Royal Air Force and to say that the Government were considering what comparable measures could be applied to securethe requisite number of specially-skilled men in the other two Services.The Minister of Defence undertook to consult the Chancellor of theExchequer regarding the precise terms of the statement to be madeon this point in the course of the debate.Civil Defence.       The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee hadprevious       also considered a programme of essential expenditure on civilReference:      defence, which had been submitted by the Ministerial Committee on (50) 13th   Civil Defence, and had agreed in principle that over the next fourConclusions,    years expenditure on civil defence should be of the order of  136Minute 1.)      million. The details of this programme would be further considered,with special reference to their effects on economic recovery and onthe capital investment programme. The aim should be to select, inthe first instance, projects which would serve the double object of improving the country&apos;s capital equipment and at the same timeserving the requirements of civil defence.The Cabinet  m(1) Authorised the three Service Departments and the Ministryof Supply to incur additional expenditure totalling  100million in meeting the immediate deficiencies of the armed Forces, as notified to the Defence Committee, onthe assumption that such portions of this sum as werespent in the current financial year would be covered bySupplementary Estimates in February, 1951, and that theremainder would be included in the Defence estimates for 1951-52.
(2) Took note that, when the time came to consider the defence estimates for 1951-52, the Government would have toconsider what additional expenditure would be requiredin order to enable this country to play its full part underthe North Atlantic Treaty.(3) Agreed that the substance of the two foregoing conclusions should be announced in the debate on defence in theHouse of Commons on 26th July.(4) Took note that, while steps would have to be taken to remedy the man-power deficiencies in the Services, par-ticularly in specialist classes such as air-crews and trades-men, nothing would be said in the debate to commit the. Government to any general increase in the basic rates ofService pay.(5) Agreed in principle that during the period 1951-55 civil defence measures would have to be undertaken involving a total expenditure of the order of  136 million.3. The Prime Minister said that His Majesty&apos;s Ambas-ambassador in Washington had represented very strongly that an early offer by the United Kingdom Government to send some land forces toKorea would make a valuable contribution to Anglo-Americansolidarity. The Defence Committee had reviewed the position, inconsultation with the Chiefs of Staff. They adhered to the view thatit would be unsound to divert to Korea troops required to meet otherCommunist threats in this area, in Hong Kong and in Malaya. they also recognised the military disadvantages of operating in Korea a mixed force with separate supply lines. They had, however, come tothe conclusion that this disadvantage was outweighed by the political advantages which would be secured by an announcement that some british land forces were to be sent to Korea. Such an announcement would have a valuable effect upon public opinion in the United States,and it would also give a useful lead to other members of the united nations. The Defence Committee had therefore recommended thatthe War Office should arrange for a Brigade Group to be formed,without reducing the strength of the forces now available in HongKong and Malaya, and sent out as soon as possible to operate in korea under United States command. They further recommendedthat the decision to send these land reinforcements to Korea shouldbe announced in the course of the debate on 26th July.The Cabinet Endorsed the recommendation of the Defence Committeethat the United Kingdom Government should offer to pro-vide a Brigade Group for service in Korea under UnitedStates command.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer (CP. (50) 176) proposing that a RoyalCommission should be set up, under the Chairmanship, of a Judge,to enquire into the present system of taxation of profits and income,with particular reference to the taxation of business profits and of salaries and wages, keeping in mind the need to maintain the presentyield in relation to the national income.The, Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a committeewas examining various technical issues arising out of thecomputation of net trading profits for income tax and profits tax,and there were various other issues which required examination. Hehad reached the conclusion that the only satisfactory procedure was
to set on foot a comprehensive enquiry into the present structure oftaxation of income. If this was accepted, and The King&apos;s approvalwas obtained, the Prime Minister could announce in parliament before the Summer Recess the intention to set up a Royal Commis-sion oh the subject.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The terms of reference should include some indication thatthe burden of taxation was to be distributed fairly among the different sections of the community. This might be done by the insertion ofthe word &quot; fairly &quot; after &quot; tax burden &quot; in the eighth line of the draftterms of reference set out in paragraph 2 Of CP. (50) 176.(b) Should Members of Parliament be included in the RoyalCommission? A number of Members were knowledgeable on thesubject: on the other hand, on a complicated subject of this kind, itwas awkward if a Member of Parliament in debate on a Royal Corn-mission^ report could claim first-hand knowledge, which the responsible Minister could not pretend to have, of what the Commis-sion had in mind.(c) In any public announcement made at this stage, it shouldnot be disclosed that the Chairman was to be a Judge. In the presentpressure of business in the Courts the Lord Chancellor would have some difficulty in securing the services of a senior Judge, though hewould endeavour to do so.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Royal Commission should be set up tbenquire into the taxation of income.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to seek The King&apos;s approval tothis step, and to announce the intention to set up a RoyalCommission in the House of Commons before the summer recess.interference 5.  The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bywith Military the Home Secretary (CP. (50) 183) proposing that it should be anSupplies. offence for any person to interfere with supplies destined for use by(Previous units of His Majesty&apos;s Forces engaged overseas in active operationsReference: at a time when the country was not technically in a state of war. the cm. (50) 49th Cabinet had also before them a revised draft of the Overseas Opera-Conclusions, tions (Security of Forces) Bill (CP. (50) 185).lvLnute i.) Lord Advocate said that, in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;decision on 24th July, the Minister of Labour and he had consulted representatives of the Trades Union Congress on thequestion whether legislation on the lines of clause 2 (5) of the draftBill annexed to CP. (50) 185 was likely to prove acceptable toorganised labour. In the time available the General Secretary ofthe Trades Union Congress had not been able to make very fullconsultations, but he had indicated that the General Council wouldbe likely to prefer a form of wording, based on war-time defence regulations, to the effect that a person should not be guilty of an offence under the new Bill &quot;by reason only of his taking part in,or peacefully persuading any other person to take parti in, a strike.&quot;The General Secretary had indicated that, if this proposal was not acceptable to the Government, the alternative might be consideredof omitting the words &quot; between employers and workmen &quot; in clause2 (5) of the draft Bill annexed to CP. (50) 185. It had been suggested to the General Secretary that a third course would be to omit sub-section (5) on the ground that, in order to secure a conviction under clause 2, it would be necessary to prove intent to interfere with military supplies, and that it was unlikely that this intent could beproved against a person taking part in any ordinary industrial dispute;
but it seemed to be clear that the Trades Union Congress would wishsome specific safeguard in respect of industrial stoppages to be intro-duced into any legislation.In discussion there was general agreement that the form ofproviso favoured by the Trades Union Congress General Councilin their provisional consideration of this matter would deprive theBill of its usefulness. Active sabotage, and incitement to it, were already offences under the existing criminal law. What was required was a provision aimed specifically at the incitement of workers to take action which would impede the passage of military supplies for over-seas operations. The Bill would fail to deal with this mischief ifthere was a general exemption for persons peacefully persuadingother persons to take part in a strike. In view of the shortage ofParliamentary time, and the absence of a satisfactory understanding with the Trades Union Congress, it would not be practicable to pass the Bill through all its stages before the Summer Recess. At thesame time, in view of the risk that the Communist Party mightendeavour to impede the despatch of military supplies to the far east, it was desirable that the Bill should be brought to a stage atwhich it could be introduced and passed at short notice if parliament were recalled at any time before 17th October. For this purpose, aCommittee of the Ministers primarily concerned should examine thenature of the mischief which had to be countered, how far the criminal law already covered the position and to what extent further powers were required. The Committee should conduct discussions with the Trades Union Congress General Council to ensure that any government measure would not attract opposition from organised labour. To deal with the kind of circumstances which were envisaged,the Bill might have to be drastic in form and might have to de^l withthe policy of systematic incitement to obstruction which the Com-munists were likely to adopt.-The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Cabinet Com-mittee, consisting of the Lord President, Lord Chancellor,Home Secretary, Minister of Labour, Secretary of State forScotland, Attorney-General and Lord Advocate to revise the draft of the Overseas Operations (Security of Forces)Bill in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, and to arrangefor further consultations with the Trades Union congress general Council so that, if legislation on the subject were required at short notice in the ensuing months, a Bill likelyto command general support could be introduced in Par-liament.Cabinet Office, SWA,25th July, 1950.
