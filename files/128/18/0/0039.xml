Parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in      the House of Commons in the following week.the House of It was agreed that in the debate on Welsh affairs on 5th DecemberCommons. the Government spokesmen should be the Secretary for OverseasTrade and the Postmaster General. The Minister of Fuel and power should be in attendance in case questions should be raised about theprovision of employment for ex-miners suffering from silicosis.On 6th December the Second Reading of the Leasehold Property(Temporary Provisions) Bill should be moved by the Lord President,and the Attorney-General should reply to the debate.It was agreed that the Government should resist the Oppositionsuggestion that time should be found before Christmas for a furtherdebate on Defence.The Cabinet were informed that Parliament would be adjourned for the Christmas Recess on 15th December and would reassembleon 23rd January.Durham CountyCouncil.Conditions ofEmployment.2. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the difficulties whichwould arise if the Durham County Council sought to enforce theirresolution that all persons employed by them must belong to a tradeunion or a professional association. Apart from the political capitalwhich would be made of this in Parliament by the conservative opposition, who had already tabled a motion on the subject, therewas grave danger that it would become a source of dissension amongLabour circles in Durham.The Cabinet endorsed the action already taken by the ministers of Health and Education in deprecating the policy which the CountyCouncil were seeking to follow; and agreed that in public statements,in Parliament or elsewhere, the Government must continue to offeruncompromising opposition to the enforcement of such a policy by apublic authority. The Cabinet agreed, however, that informalapproaches should be made to influential members of the Labour^movement in Durham with a view to persuading the County Councilto refrain from enforcing their resolution against individualemployees. The Minister of Defence and The Chief Whip said thatthey would be visiting Durham at the week-end and would see whether they could arrange for suitable Labour representatives fromthe county to hold informal conversations with the Ministers ofHealth and Education.Korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 78thConclusions,Minute 1.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinefs dis-cussion on the previous day, further confirmation had been obtainedthat the Chinese had deployed a large organised force in Korea and holding even larger reserves inwereManchuria. There were alsoreports that Russian aircraft were being moved into Manchuria. Theposition was serious; and it seemed likely that the question ofreinforcing the United Nations troops would be raised before long.He was anxious therefore that a comprehensive appreciation shouldbe drawn up, without delay, of the military, political and economic consequences which would follow if United Nations forces became involved in large-scale hostilities against China. Such a development would seriously prejudice the prospects of building up a sounddefensive position in Western Europe. Not only might it involvethe despatch to the Far East of substantial numbers of troops whowere required for European defence; it would also accentuate theeconomic difficulties, due mainly to the shortages of raw materials,which were already impeding the rearmament programmes of theEuropean democracies. On some of these questions separate repre-sentations were already being made to different parts of the UnitedStates Administration. What was needed now was a balanced and comprehensive picture of the potential commitments involved, whichcould be presented to the United States Government in such a way as to ensure that it was considered as a whole at the highest level.The Foreign Secretary said that, while Europe remained exposed tosuch grave dangers, he was doubtful whether the United Kingdom
Government would be justified, in undertaking any further commit-ments in the Far East. He was certain that;, before supporting anyUnited Nations resolution which would have the effect of, applyingmilitary sanctions against China, they must see clearly what iiabilitiesthis would involve political and economic, as well as military and how far they were capable of meeting them.In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary.The Foreign Secretary added that, since the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the previous day, he had instructed the United Kingdom repre-sentative on the Security Council that he should not vote for any amendment of the resolution on Korea which would introduce a charge of aggression against the Chinese Government. He had alsoimpressed upon the United States Government the importance whichhe attached to leaving the existing resolution as it stood, and avoiding the introduction of any charge of aggression against China. He had heard that morning that the United States Government accepted his view on that point. In reply to a question, he assured the Cabinetthat he would not, without further reference to them, authorise his representative on the Security Council to support any form of resolu-tion involving a charge of aggression against China.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theChiefs of Staff and Departments concerned to co-operate in the preparation of a comprehensive appreciation of themilitary, political and economic implications of large-scale operations by United Nations forces against China.Egypt.Anglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:CM. (50) 76thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theForeign Secretary (CP. (50) 283 and 284) on policy towards Egypt.The Cabinet first considered the line which the Foreign secretary was proposing to take, in his forthcoming talks with the egyptian foreing Minister, about the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that he would open these conversations on the lines indicated in paragraphs 20-22 of CP. (50) 284. the indications were, however, that the Egyptian Foreign Minister wouldadopt an intransigent attitude reflecting the attitude of his Govern-ment that there could be no agreement, except on the basis that no british forces would be stationed in Egypt in time of peace. TheForeign Secretary said that, if the Egyptians could not be persuaded to adopt a less uncompromising attitude, he would have no alternative but to make it clear that we should stand upon our rights under theTreaty until such time as it expired,In discussion the.following points were raised:  (a) It would be open to the Egyptians to argue that the UnitedKingdom Government had themselves failed to carry out the provi-sions of the Treaty-by maintaining in Egypt troops in excess of thenumbers authorised by the Treaty, by stationing some of these in areas outside the Canal Zone, and by failing to carry out their obliga-tions to assist in the training and equipment of the Egyptian Army.It was pointed out that only a small proportion^ of the Britishtroops in Egypt were now stationed outside the Canal Zone 5 anc* that,if this were the only difficulty, it might be possible to dismantle the few depots outside that Zone. As regards numbers, it was pointedout that the limits imposed by the Treaty were 10,000 land forces and 400 pilots together with &quot; the necessary ancillary personnel for adminsitrative and technical duties,&quot; excluding civilian clerks, artisansand labourers. Although the total number of British troops nowin Egypt numbered about 38,000, the combat forces did not exceed the numbers stipulated in the Treaty. Was it not arguable that theremainder were &quot; ancillaries&quot; within the meaning of the Treaty?In reply it was pointed out that a large proportion of these addition?&apos;
trpops were employed as armed guards, and it could not be main-tained that they were engaged in &quot; administrative and technicalduties.&quot; It was the general view of the Cabinet that, if the matter were brought before an international tribunal, we should have little chance of rebutting the Egyptian claim that the numbers of Britishtroops in Egypt were in excess of the limits prescribed in the Treaty.(b) For some time past it had been the policy of the UnitedKingdom Government to reduce the size of the British garrison inEgypt, and the number of combat troops stationed there had in fact been substantially reduced. There were, however, two main reasons why it had not proved possible to make any greater reduction in thenumber of administrative troops employed there. First, Egypt hadbeen a base for large British armies during the war; and as a resultthere were still vast depots of valuable stores in Egypt. Unless these were to be sacrificed, they had to be maintained and guarded againstpilfering; and for these duties substantial numbers of troops were required. A number of Mauritians had been used for these purposes,because they were less expensive than United Kingdom troops.Secondly, our military plans still assumed that Egypt would be. abase for a large British army in a future war; and large numbers ofbase troops were kept there for that purpose. This explained thehigh proportion of administrative troops now in Egypt, in relation to combat troops. .(c) The Foreign Secretary said that, if our requirements cOuld belimited to the use of a military base in Egypt in time of war, it mightbe possible to secure a satisfactory agreement with the egyptian government on the footing that in time of peace the base installationswould be guarded by Egyptian troops and that we would station thereonly a limited number of British technicians in plain clothes.(d) It had been our military policy to maintain a foothold inEgypt until alternative facilities could be provided for a secure Britishbase elsewhere in the Middle East. The Federal State, of Libya hadnot yet come into being, but when it had we should hope to concludewith it a treaty which would contain defence provisions. If wesucceeded in this, alternative proposals could be put forward for dis-tributing our peace-time military bases in the Middle East betweenCyrenaica, Tripolitania and Cyprus. As soon as a favourable decisionhad been reached in the United Nations, these proposals would besubmitted for consideration by the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, in his forthcoming discussions with theEgyptian Foreign Minister on the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty,the Foreign Secretary should take the line indicated inparagraphs 20-27 of CP. (50) 284.(2) look note that, as soon as developments in Libya permit theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Defence would sub-mit to the Cabinet a joint memorandum on the provisionof British military bases in Cyrenaica, Tripolitania and cyprus.The Minister of Transport said that he hoped that effective action could now be taken to prevent the Egyptian Government from inter-fering with the free passage of ships through the Suez Canal. their application of inspection and contraband control within the Canalwas an increasing source of embarrassment to British shipping.The Cabinet were informed that, for the reasons stated in the annex to CP. (50) 283, the Law Officers were satisfied that theEgyptian Government had been entitled to impose these controlswifhin the Canal during the period of hostilities between Egypt and israel. They had, however, signed a permanent armistice with Israelin February 1949; and, although no formal treaty of peace had been concluded, Egypfs case for continuing these restrictions became lessstrong as the date of the armistice receded. We should therefore bejustified now in making stronger protests against these restrictions, on
Supply of Arms.(previous reference:CM. (50) 77thConclusions,Minute 3.)Sudan:(previous reference:CM. (48) 39thConclusions,Minute 1.)the ground that tney were no longer necessary for preserving security or public order in Egypt. For the moment^ however, this matter was before the Egyptian-Israeli Mixed Armistice Commission, and wastherefore sub judice.The Cabinet-(3) Took note of the statement, in paragraphs 20-25 of cp. (50) 283, regarding Egypfs right to interfere with thepassage of ships through the Suez Canal; and invited theForeign Secretary to keep in touch with developments ofthis question in the Egyptian-Israeli Mixed armistice commission and the Security Council.(4) Took note that the Minister of Transport would notify theForeign Secretary and the Attorney-General of anyfurther examples of Egyptian interference with the free passage of shipping through the Suez Canal.The suggestion was made that, if Egyptian interference with thepassage of snipping through the Suez Canal was based on the factthat a formal treaty of peace had not been concluded between egypt and Israel, the same argument could be used to justify our decision to suspend the delivery of Centurion tanks to Egypt. The foreign secretary, however, thought it would be dangerous to make a bargainwith Egypt on the basis that we would resume the supply of arms to them if they undertook to refrain from interfering with shipping in the Canal. It was true that the recent protests in the House ofCommons against the proposal to supply Centurion tanks to Egypthad been based mainly on Egypfs hostile attitude towards the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty and the maintenance of British troops in Egypt. Itwas not to be assumed, however, that such protests would no longer be made if the Egyptian Government adopted a more accommodatingattitude on those matters. If the supply of arms to Egypt were nowresumed, it would be difficult to refuse similar facilities to other states in the Middle East. And there was a strong underlying feeling in theHouse of Commons that modern types of military equipment shouldnot be exported to such countries as these at a time when our own forces were seriously short of the equipment which they required.The Cabinet-(5) Took note that, after his forthcoming talks with the egyptian foreing Minister, the Foreign Secretary would submitfurther recommendations to the Cabinet about the supplyof arms to Egypt.The Attorney-General said that he had serious doubts about thelegal basis of the government policy towards the Sudan. It was his view that the Anglo-Egyptian Condominium Agreement of 1899had not altered the fact that sovereignty over the Sudan resided inEgypt, and that, in law, the Governor-General of the Sudan had hadno power to introduce the constitutional reforms of 1948 without theconcurrence of the Egyptian Government.The Cabinet agreed that, despite the doubts about the legal position, the Government could not now depart from their policy thatthe Sudanese people must be allowed freely to decide their ownfuture. They endorsed the Foreign Secretary^ proposal that theGovernor-General should press forward with measures to broaden the electoral basis of the Sudan Legislative Assembly, and agreed that no attempt should be made to reopen negotiations with the egyptian government about the future of the Sudan.The Cabinet-(6) Endorsed the proposals in paragraphs 18-19 of CP. (50) 283regarding the Sudan.
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 282) recommending that, in view of the difficultieswhich were being experienced in trade negotiations with Argentina,the carcase meat ration should be reduced from Is. 6d. to Is. 2d. aweek from 9th December, with an addition of 2d. worth of cornedbeef a week, if the settlement with Argentina was delayed, or 4c?. worth of corned meat if a settlement was reached later in that week. Itwas also recommended that there should be a cut of about 25 per cent,in the allocations 6f manufacturing meat.The Minister of Food said that it was impossible to postpone adecision about a reduction in the meat ration. Supplies from sourcesother than Argentina had fallen off seriously. Because of the high price of wool, farmers in Australia and New Zealand were reluctant to dispose of sheep as mutton. There was also a shortage in home supplies. Whereas last year at this time the carcase meat in storeamounted to 206,000 tons, the present amount was 64,000 tons, repre-senting about 35. Ad. worth of meat per person. The present stock of canned corned beef was equivalent to five months&apos; supply at 2d. perperson per week.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While it seemed true that Australian and New Zealandfarmers were disinclined to supply mutton because of the high pricesof wool, the shortage of home-killed meat was due to the earlyfattening of livestock this year and the efforts which had been madeto secure home-killed supplies at an earlier period of the year than usual. ;lb) There was reason to believe that Argentina was in some diffi-culty because her cold stores were now full of meat. At the same timeher economic position had been improved because of the high dollarprices which she was receiving for hides and wool. It was doubtfulwhether at this stage a threat to withhold the export to Argentina of essential commodities, notably coal, would have any effect. Very littlecoal would, in fact, be going from this country to Argentina in thenear future.(c) The Argentine Government were reasonably well informed about the level of meat stocks in this country. It was for this reason that it was recommended that the ration of carcase meat should bereduced to an amount which would enable the Government to hold the position for some little time. If the Argentine Government thoughtthat the United Kingdom Government feared the consequences of a drastic cut in the meat ration and were making a smaller cut thanthe circumstances required, they might be inclined to play out thenegotiations further in the hope of forcing a higher price.(d) As there were fairly substantial stocks of corned meat, and asit was undesirable to make a reduction in the total meat ration at thisseason of the year, there was general agreement that the ration should for the present be held at Is, 6d., of which Is. 2d. worth would begiven in carcase meat and 4d. worth in corned meat.(e) Every endeavour should be made to obtain additional suppliesof meat from other sources, even if the amounts appeared individuallyto be relatively small. The present position justified the use of dollars to secure about 20,000 tons of meat which were believed to be avail-able in the United States. Supplies might also be available in Canada.Special steps would have to be taken to secure freight for the convey-ance of United States meat to this country.(/) Doubt was expressed whether, as suggested in paragraph 13 of cp. (50) 282, it was undesirable for the Minister of Food, in announc-ing the reduction in the carcase meat ration, to make any commentwhich might further strain relations between this country and Argen-tina. On the contrary, the statement should make it clear that theArgentine Government had been endeavouring to take an unfairadvantage of this country&apos;s dependence on imported supplies, andthat the reduction in the ration was necessary to ensure that thesetactics should not succeed.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, from 9th December next, the meat ration offIs. 6d. a week should consist of Is. 2d. worth of carcase meat and 4d. worth of canned corned meat and that a cut of 25 per cent, should be made in the allocations of manu-facturing meat. .(2) Invited the Minister of Food to take all practicable steps toobtain supplies of meat from sources other than Argen-tina and, in particular, to buy about 20,000 tons of meatwhich were believed to be available in the United States.(3) Invited the Minister of Food, in announcing the reductionin the carcase meat ration, to make it clear that this was due to the unreasonable attitude of the Argentine Govern-ment regarding the price of meat.Wool. 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of price of Utility  the Board of Trade (subsequently circulated as CP. (50) 295) seekingBlankets.        authority for an increase of 66-f per cent, in the maximum price ofutility blankets.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had broughtthis matter before the Cabinet because it foreshadowed the price increases which would be demanded by manufacturers over a wide field, as time went on. Blankets were quickly&quot; produced and con-sisted almost entirely of wool, so that they quickly reflected increases inwool prices. If the present application was not conceded, unemploy-ment in the blanket industry would arise within a few days. Theapplication related to September wool prices: there had been laterincreases amounting to a further 12 per cent, or 13 per cent. In afew months there would be requests for substantial increases in theprices of suits, cotton goods and other textiles.In discussion attention was drawn to the undesirability ofauthorising a substantial increase in the retail price of blankets beforethe Government had had an opportunity of considering how theyshould handle the marked increase in the cost of consumer goods which would take place in the next few months. In these circum-stances the better course would be to take advantage of the suggestion in paragraph 3 of E.P.C. (50) 120 that, while an increase in manu-facturers&apos; -prices should be conceded, consequential increases inmaximum retail prices should be delayed.The Cabinet-Agreed that the President of the Board of Trade should authorise an increase in manufacturers&apos; maximum prices,subject to some postponement of the date of their operation and to a delay in fixing the consequential increases in maxi-mum retail prices.Nepal. 7.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had arranged for Sir Esler(Previous Dening to go to Delhi and Katmandu to discuss the situation in reference: Nepal.  This was certainly not a time at which to allow a seriousCM. (50) 77th divergence of policy to develop between the United Kingdom Govern-Conclusions, ment and the Government of India. At the same time, it was veryMinute 9.) undesirable that India should take arbitrary steps in regard to Nepal.In discussion, it was pointed out that the Prime Minister of Indiaappeared to be adopting a less intransigent attitude regarding Nepal.There were advantages in delaying a final decision.The Cabinet- .     jTook note, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, SWA,30th November, 1950.
