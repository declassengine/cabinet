239CM. 87 (SO)Kef ease. 1.   The Prime Minister recalled that when, on 12th December,Acceleration of he had made his report to the Cabinet on his talks with PresidentDefence Truman he had said that he had undertaken to consider the President^Preparations. request that this country should increase its defence effort. Since his(Previous return from Washington he had been considering this matter in the reference: light of the continuing gravity of the international situation and, afterCM. (50) 85th discussions with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence,Conclusions, he had come to the conclusion that some acceleration in the pace of minute 3.) defence preparations was now unavoidable. The war planning of departments generally was still based on the assumption that therewould be no major war before 1957, though some of the departments had adjusted some of their preparations to take account of the earlier date of 1954 to which the Medium Term Defence Plan of the north atlantic Treaty Organisation was related. The United States were now accelerating their own preparations on the basis that major war might occur in 1952 or even 1951. These different planning datesgave rise to a measure of confusion and the position ought to berationalised: this process would necessarily involve some acceleration-tion of defence preparations. If Departments were told to plan onthe basis that a major war was inevitable within the next two or threeyears very large expenditure would be involved (e.g., on civil defence), and he believed that a satisfactory hypothesis could be framed on the basis that the aim was to strengthen the active defencesof this country for the purpose of preventing a major war. some increase in defence expenditure- over the next two years appeared,however, to be unavoidable. The existing programme would haveto be accelerated in some respects, and there would be need forquicker progress with the completion of paper plans. The Chiefs ofStaff were examining as a matter of urgency the measures which wouldbe required: they were likely to recommend the calling up of reserves in batches for special training, increased production of weapons andequipment, and the completion of plans for the expansion of war production in the early stages of a war. Specific proposals would beput before the Cabinet as soon as possible after Christmas.Meanwhile, it had been learned that, at the meeting of the north atlantic Council on 19th December, the United States Secretary ofState intended to make a statement calling on European governments to increase their defence effort. He would announce that the UnitedStates Government aimed to complete their share of the medium term Defence Plan in two years instead of three, and that the UnitedStates aid towards European military effort would be continued in1952 at the same rate as in 1951 ($5,000 million). He would estimate that Europe&apos;s contribution to the accelerated Medium Term DefencePlan should be between $15,000 and $18,000 million in the period to30th June, 1953, and on this basis he would ask European countries to double their pre-Korean rate of defence expenditure. In his talks in Washington, the Prime Minister had persuaded the Americans toaccept Anglo-American partnership as the mainspring of Atlanticdefence. Much of the advantage we had gained would be lost ifwe were now to be treated as merely one of the European countrieswhich were being urged by America to make a larger contributionto the common defence effort. We should align ourselves with the americans in urging the others to do more. One could not ignore the risk, however remote it might seem, that the United States mightlose interest in the defence of Europe, if her allies in the North atlantic treaty Organisation failed to play their proper part.The Prime Minister accordingly proposed that the foreign secretary should express general agreement with all that the UnitedStates Secretary of State was to say about the urgency of building upthe military strength of the West: that he should also emphasise the substantial contributions which the United Kingdom Governmenthad already made: but that he should be authorised to go on to saythat the United Kingdom Government, in view of the disturbed and dangerous international situation, had decided to increase andaccelerate their defence preparations still further, with the sole objectof assisting the Atlantic community and the other nations of the free39843-3b 2
world to resist aggression and to secure their own safety and freedom,and were now considering the form and direction which this additionaleffort should take.The Prime Minister said that it was not his intention that, if his proposal were accepted, the United Kingdom Government should atthis stage give any new figure for their enlarged defence programme:indeed, they should resist any United States pressure to specify a figure. They should not follow the procedure adopted in the summerwhen, in response to a United States request, they had stated a figureof defence expenditure before working out a definite programme.They should now revert to the more normal procedure of consideringfirst what further measures were required to meet the needs of thesituation, how far they were physically possible, and then calculatingtheir cost.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The other Western European countries had made a dis-appointing response to earlier proposals for increased defence preparations, and it was certainly desirable that there should be agreater measure of equality of sacrifice within the North Atlantic com-munity. But the fact remained that, since the invasion of Korea, therehad been a steady deterioration in the international situation, andsome acceleration of our defence preparations was required as ameasure of self-preservation. It might be true that the Soviet Govern-ment did not at present desire a major war, but there could be no certainty on this point; and there was, in any event, a serious risk thatthe Soviet Government might plunge into adventures which would set in train a succession of consequences leading to a major war.(b) At the same time the Western democracies must endeavourto strike a balance between, on the one hand, reasonably adequatedefence preparations and, on the other, the maintenance of stableeconomies and a reasonable standard of living. The Soviet Govern-ment would be well satisfied if defence preparations in the West werepushed to a point which brought economic chaos and mass unemploy-ment. While the United States Congress and Administration had shown themselves prepared to devote great resources to building upthe defence of the West, they might have to be reminded, in presentcircumstances, of the continued need to maintain the economicviability of Western Europe as an essential foundation for military strength.(c) The defence contributions so far made by continental powers in Western Europe had been disappointing. At the same time it hadto be borne in mind that about 90 per cent, of the defence produc-tion of the North Atlantic Treaty Powers was in the United Kingdom,North America and France; and the contributions of some of thesmaller Powers, while important on general grounds, could not greatlyaffect the issue from the material point of view. It would be helpful if the main contributors to Atlantic defence could reach a commonappraisal of what was required, and what could be done, over the next two or three years to build up the defences of Western Europe.(d) Differing Views were expressed about the stage at whichWestern Germany should be invited to co-operate in the defence ofthe West. On the one hand, it was pointed out that, without theassistance of land forces drawn from Western Germany, there wasno prospect of securing forces which could contain the vast Sovietland and air forces. On the other hand, attention was drawn to therisk that Russia might in present circumstances treat the rearmamentof Germany as a casus belli, and that the rearmament of germany might consolidate Soviet power in the satellite countries which fearedGermany and had suffered recently from German occupation. Therewas, however, general agreement that, in view of the present attitudeof the Federal Government and people of Western Germany and thecaution which the Russian note of remonstrance would induce in theFrench Government, the question of German rearmament was not an immediate one and could be handled on the lines which the cabinet had approved at their meeting on 14th December (CM. (50) 86thConclusions Minute 3).
(e) Some disquiet was expressed about the language which theUnited States Secretary of State was intending to use about the UnitedStates contribution to an acceleration of Western rearmament. Thisdeparted from the conception of a common partnership and pooling of resources, and reverted to the earlier idea of United States aidtowards accelerated defence programmes. While it was understand-able, from the point of view of difficulties in Congress, that the UnitedStates Government should wish to relate the amount of United state said to the increase in defence efforts in Europe, this approach wouldnot be helpful to European Governments in dealing with their ownParliaments and in countering Communist propaganda. It was, inany event, important that this form of approach should not be adoptedin connection with the United States contribution towards thiscountry&apos;s defence programme. Public opinion in this country hadgreeted with relief the termination of Marshall Aid, and would notwelcome a new form of dependence upon American aid.if) While no new figure of defence expenditure should be putforward at the Brussels meeting, Ministers should consider in the nextfew weeks the exact extent of the increase and acceleration ofdefence preparations which were regarded as desirable and practicable.ig) In view of the extent to which this country had increased its defence preparations before the aggression in Korea, we could not accept any United States suggestion that all North Atlantic countries should agree to double their pre-Korean expenditure on defence.(h) It was already clear that the implementation of the existingdefence programme would involve the introduction of a number of controls designed to ensure that the necessary resources were availablefor rearmament and to counter-inflation. To the extent to which thedefence programme was further increased and accelerated morecontrols and a wider use of emergency powers would be required.Thus, if the proposed call-up of reservists was not to interfere with production, some form of deferment and of control of labour wouldprobably be required. These implications of an enlarged defence programme would be brought before the Cabinet, when a fresh pro-gramme had been drawn up, after discussion with the Chiefs of staff and the Central Economic Planning Staff. An effort should be madeat some stage to secure acceptance of some degree of equality ofsacrifice by the civilian population of North America and Europe.(i) It was suggested that Ministers should be given a clearerpicture of the content of the rearmament programme and the extentto which it was to be increased and accelerated by the measures nowproposed. Ministers should have more precise and readily available information showing what was being done by this country and howit was related to the strategic position in Europe.(/) The Foreign Secretary was aware of the need to ensure that adequate raw materials were made available for the increased defence programme, and he would be discussing this aspect of the matter withthe United States Secretary of State. He would also ask for UnitedStates co-operation in preventing increases in world prices, whichwould mean that less effective results were secured from any givenexpenditure on defence.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council onthe following day the Foreign Secretary should say thatthe United Kingdom Government had already decided toincrease and accelerate their defence preparations stillfurther and were considering what form and direction this increased effort should take.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to inform the foreign secretary of the views expressed in the cabinets discussion.(3) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider in detail in whatdirections defence preparations could most profitably be accelerated.
economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (50) 70th.Conclusions,Minute 4.)coarse grains.Electricity.external trade.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (50) 315) covering a report on the economicsituation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer referred to the increase in man-power and production mentioned in the report. The increased outputof passenger cars in October had been striking, and it was satisfactory to note the higher level of textile production, notwithstanding thedifficulties with which the industry was faced. Stocks of food andraw materials had fallen sharply, reflecting the shortages of rawmaterials which were beginning to affect the economy, and there were other indications in the report of the new economic problems withwhich the country would have to cope next year. In November therehad been a further advance of two points in the Ministry of Laboursindex of weekly wage rates. The external financial situation was generally satisfactory. After making the necessary adjustments forterms of shipment, there would be a surplus of about  100 million onvisible external trade, and total external trade for the year might showa surplus of  200 million for the whole of 1950. The United Kingdomreserves of gold and dollars had continued to increase during november, though at a slower rate after the abnormal movementwhich had taken place in anticipation of a revaluation of sterling inOctober. Our surplus with the European Payments Union had been 50 million at the end of October and  80 milUon at the end ofNovember. In general, the country&apos;s economic difficulties were nowlikely to increase: the impact on the economy of the defence programme and raw material shortages had still to be faced.In a general discussion of the report the following points weremade:  Stocks of coarse grains were at a low level and the future of the livestock programme was precarious. The heavy dependence on imports of coarse grains from the U.S.S.R. and the Argentine wasdisadvantageous.The continuance of the increase in industrial productionmentioned in paragraph 6 of the report might well be jeopardised bya shortage of electric power. Power supplies were becoming increasingly inadequate to expanding industry.The greatest difficulties in 1951 might arise from inflationaryconditions at home rather than from the balance of payments, and ministers might have to consider some selective slowing down of theexport drive in order to meet domestic needs. The prices of someclasses of exports could probably be increased. In reply, it waspointed out that the claims of defence production and raw materialshortages were likely in themselves to reduce exports next year, andthat it would be necessary to increase imports considerably.The Cabinet-Took note of CP.discussion.(50) 315 and of the ooints raised in the assisted 3.  The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of passage State for Commonwealth Relations and the Minister of LabourAgreement (CP. (50) 306 and 320) about the desirability of renewing beyondwith 30th March, 1951, the Assisted Passage Scheme for emigrants from theAustralia. United Kingdom to Australia. The Secretary of State for Common-wealth Relations recommended that a decision should be taken to terminate the scheme and that he should so inform the AustralianPrime Minister when he came to London in January. The Ministerof Labour felt that this course would be ill-advised and that theadvantages of continuing the scheme outweighed the expenseinvolved.
The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that hehad come to the conclusion that, in view of the urgent need for every possible economy, he would not be justified in continuing the assisted passage scheme. He felt it best to raise the matter with his colleaguessince the termination of the scheme would inevitably lead to some ill-feeling in Australia and criticism at home. When he had discussed the working of the scheme with Mr. Menzies recently the argumentsraised by the latter had not been the points of principle mentioned inthe Minister of Labours paper, but had related to the Australiandesire to conclude similar agreements with other countries and thedanger that United Kingdom emigrants would go to Canada ratherthan Australia if the scheme were terminated.The Minister of Labour said that he felt strongly that it wouldbe unwise to end the scheme now. The Empire Settlement Acts wouldexpire in May 1952 and the Government ought to continue the schemeuntil a comprehensive review could be undertaken. It was in theinterest of the Commonwealth that Australia should be peopled byBritish rather than foreign emigrants. Moreover, under the present arrangement we were able to prevent to a considerable extent the emigration of skilled workers whom we did not want to lose.In discussion there was general agreement that, since theAustralian Prime Minister would be in London in January, he shouldnot be informed of a decision to terminate the scheme before thequestion had been discussed with him. Opinion was divided on thequestion whether or not the scheme ought to be continued. On theone hand, it was pointed out that we could ill afford this expenditure,especially when regard was had to the high standard of living inAustralia and her favourable financial position. It was ill-advised toencourage the emigration of British workers whose services were increasingly needed at home. Moreover, the Australian Governmenthad not hesitated in the thirties to terminate a similar scheme whenits continuation had not suited them for financial reasons, and they ought not to take offence at our doing so now. On the other hand,some Ministers felt that the cost of continuing the scheme was out-weighed by its benefit to Commonwealth relations, and that, becauseof the disparity in total populations, Australia gained more than thtcountry lost by the emigration of families from Great BritainAustralia. In discussing the question with Mr. Menzies it might bepossible to press, in a friendly spirit, for some further adjustment inour favour of the cost of assisted passages, without discarding thescheme entirely.It was agreed that a decision whether or not to renew the agree-ment should be deferred, pending discussions with the AustralianPrime Minister. In talking to Mr. Menzies, the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations should be at liberty to raise any of thepoints made in his paper or in the course of the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to discuss with the Australian Prime Minister, when he came to London in the following month, the question of renewingthe Assisted Passage Agreement, and to report the result ofhis discussions to the Cabinet.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (50) 317) proposing that, as part of a campaign for improving police supervision of motor traffic so as to secure some reduction in the very serious figures of road casualties, an experimentshould be made in certain areas of employing plain clothes police officers for the purpose of detecting road behaviour involving a risk to human life.
The Home Secretary said that he was seriously, disturbed aboutthe loss of life in road accidents. Special measures were heeded tosecure a higher standard of road behaviour. Plain clothes car,patrols were already employed in Kent and what he had in mind was anextension of that experiment in some other selected areas. Theypro-posal would meet with strong criticism from the motoring associations and this would be reflected in Parliamentary Questions.There was general approval of the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal.It was agreed that similar arrangements could be made in Scotland.The Cabinet-Authorised the Home Secretary and the Secretary of Statefor Scotland to arrange for the employment of police motorpatrols in plain clothes, on the lines indicated in paragraph 5of CP. (50) 317.Cabinet Offices, S.W. 1,ISth December, 1950.
