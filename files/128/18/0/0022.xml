1. The Home Secretary said that the Emergencies Committeehad met on the previous evening and reviewed the. latest developments in the London gas strike. The London branches, of the Unions mainly concerned were dominated by Communists and were unwilling to summon meetings at which the workers could express their views.The President of the Amalgamated Engineering Union was thereforebeing asked to establish direct contact with the men. Meanwhile,supervisory staff were carrying out a certain amount of essentialmaintenance work at gas works and the workers engaged on produc-tion had not so far objected to this. It seemed wiser to continue onthese lines than to call in Service men, especially as the Services wouldnot be able to provide enough technicians to meet the needs of thesituation which would arise if recourse to the Services provoked anextension of the strike. The North Thames Gas Board had originallyfeared that the prosecution of ringleaders under the Conspiracy and protection of Property Act, 1875, might lead to an extension of thestrike, but they had now withdrawn their opposition; and theEmergencies Committee were of the opinion that, if the strike hadnot ended by the following day and if the Attorney-General was thensatisfied that there was evidence on which to base a criminal charge against the ringleaders, there were no political or industrial reasons why he should not commence proceedings against them.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There had been some improvement in gas supplies because anumber of domestic consumers appeared to be using other forms of fuel. The industrial position was, however, serious; and the LondonRegional Board for Industry had reported that serious dislocation and unemployment were likely if the strike continued.(6) It was suggested that the boards of socialised industries ought,during a period when there were no major strikes in progress, to issueleaflets to their workers pointing out that they were under contracts of service and that, if they broke these contracts without reasonable cause, the Board would consider the institution of civil proceedings against them in the county courts for the recovery of damages.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Attorney-General to take note that, if the strike had not ended by 29th September and if he then had sufficient evidence on which to base a charge against theringleaders under the Conspiracy and Protection ofProperty Act, 1875, there were no political or industrialobjections which Ministers would wish him to take intoaccount in deciding whether or not he should institutesuch proceedings.(2) Invited the Emergencies Committee to follow up the sugges-tion that the boards of socialised industries should issuewarning leaflets indicating their intention to take civil proceedings for damages if contracts of service werebroken without due cause.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Food (CP. (50) 213), to which was annexed a copy of the reportof a working party appointed by the Overseas Food Corporation toadvise on the future agricultural policy to be followed at Kongwa.The Minister of Food said that he hoped that the Cabinet would authorise him to inform the Board of the Corporation that they mightimplement the recommendations of the working party. In the lightof this year&apos;s experience it appeared to be out of the question to go ahead with arable cultivation at Kongwa, except on the limited scale proposed by the working party. If, however, no use was made of therest of the land it would speedily revert to bush. The suggestion that-1 b 2
the main acreage should be used for the fattening of store cattle was founded on experience in the rearing of African cattle in the area and,unlike the breeding of cattle, would not involve heavy capital outlay.The Corporation were satisfied that a local market could be found forthe meat, while the hides could usefully be exported to this country.After discussion it was agreed that the recommendations of theworking party must be accepted. It was unfortunate that the reportdid not set out all the facts upon which the public could form a judg-ment of the points at issue; but a general review of the operations ofthe Overseas Food Corporation was due in November.The Cabinet then considered the presentation of the report.There was general agreement that, while it was impracticable to delayits publication, it was desirable that, by Ministerial speeches and other means, the experience at Kongwa should be put into perspectiveagainst the background of the other operations of the Overseas food corporation and the work of the Colonial Development corporation and other agencies in territories overseas.The Cabinet-Agreed that effect should be given to the recommendationsof the report of the Kongwa working party annexed to cp. (50) 213, and authorised the Minister of Food to arrangefor the publication of the report by the Overseas food corporation.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the parliamentary under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs (CP. (50) 212) recom-mending that the Government should withdraw the undertaking which they had given on 29th March, 1945, to Allied governments represented on the United Nations War Crimes Commission, to theeffect that they would be prepared to treat as an undesirable alienliable to deportation any alien against whom there was prima facieevidence that he was a war criminal or had been guilty of treacheryinvolving active assistance to the enemy.In discussion it was pointed out that no alien had in fact beendeported under this arrangement and that, if the undertakingremained in force, there might in future be some embarrassing casein which a foreign Government invoked the agreement when theUnited Kingdom Government felt that, particularly in view of thelapse of time since the end of the war, it was undesirable to giveeffect to it.     -&quot;rThe Cabinet Agreed that, as proposed in CP. (50) 212, a note should besent to the Governments concerned, informing them that theUnited Kingdom Government had decided to withdraw this undertaking to surrender war criminals and traitors.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (50) 214) on the generalstate of relations between the United Kingdom Government and theGovernment of South Africa, and on the particular issues affectingSouth Africa which were likely to come forward for discussion at theUnited Nations.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe task of preserving good relations with the Union Government wasone of the most difficult of the problems now confronting him. Thenative policy of the South African Government was one which theUnited Kingdom Government could not approve, and one whichWar Crimes. .Surrender ofWar Criminalsand Traitors.(previous reference:CM. (49) 32ndConclusions,Minute 4.)Relations with south Africa.
Indians inSouth Africa.(previous reference :CM. (46) 97thConclusions,Minute 3.)caused them serious difficulties both with their political supporters in this country and with public opinion in Colonial territories. Onthe other hand, from the strategic point of view, South Africa&apos;s good-will was of special importance to us; and on defence questions wewere making very satisfactory progress towards a better understand-ing with her. Our economic relations were also satisfactory. AndSouth Africa&apos;s attitude towards her Commonwealth membership was less difficult than it had previously been. It was important that inall these matters we should retain South Africa&apos;s co-operation as amember of the Commonwealth; and it followed that, while we should avoid expressing sympathy with the native policy of the present government, we should refrain from publicly condemning it.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was seriously disturbed by the effect which the domestic policy of the UnionGovernment was creating in Colonial territories, and also by the indications of South African ambitions for control over other partsof Africa. There were, for example, signs that South Africa wasencouraging the immigration of Afrikaaners into Northern Rhodesia.While therefore he appreciated the economic and strategic advantages of our present relations with South Africa, he feared that a time might come when we should be forced to weigh these against our Colonialinterests in other parts of Africa. The Minister of Health supported this view. He referred to the embarrassments which the domestic policy of the Union Government caused to United kingdom ministers, both in their relations with their supporters in this countryand in their international relations in the United Nations; and hesuggested that, if these continued, the United Kingdom might haveto consider whether she lost more than she gained by her presentassociation with the Union Government.Other Ministers, on the other hand, stressed the strategic importance of securing South Africa&apos;s support in any struggle againstcommunism, and the great value of the military support which shenow seemed likely to promise in the Middle East. Good progress was being made in the current discussions with the South AfricanMinister of Defence, who seemed more ready to enter into defence commitments than any of his predecessors had been. Emphasis wasalso laid on the importance of retaining South Africa within theCommonwealth.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the general policy outlined in paragraphs 1-5 of cp. (50) 214 on the relations between the UnitedKingdom Government and the Government of SouthAfrica.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations recalled that,on previous occasions when the treatment of Indians in South Africahad been discussed in the United Nations, the United KingdomGovernment had maintained an attitude of strict neutrality and hadavoided being drawn into the merits of the dispute. He recom-mended that, if this question arose at the current meeting of theUnited Nations, the United Kingdom Government should follow thesame course, avoiding participation in debate and attempting toexercise a conciliatory influence from the background. In particular,we should abstain from voting on any resolution which was stronglycondemnatory of South Africa.The Cabinet (2) Approved the proposals in paragraph 7 of CP. (50) 214regarding the attitude to be adopted by the United King-dom Government towards any discussion of the treatmentof Indians in South Africa at the meeting of the united nations.
South-West The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatAfrica. the International Court had delivered their Advisory Opinion on(Previous        South Africa&apos;s obligations to the United Nations in respect of South-Reference :      West Africa.  The Court had found (i) that South Africa was notCM. (50) 28th   obliged to submit a trusteeship agreement for South-West Africa;Conclusions,     (ii) that the status of the territory remained the same as was laidMinute 3.)       down by the League of Nations Mandate; and (iii) that South Africawas under an obligation to transmit reports and petitions on South-West Africa to the United Nations. The Prime Minister, in a telegramreproduced in the Annex to CP. (50) 214, had urged the SouthAfrican Government to accept the Court&apos;s Opinion; and the Secretaryof State recommended that, when this matter came before the united nations, we should vote in favour of acceptance of this Opinion.Some Governments might seek to lay it down that the reports andpetitions should be forwarded to the Trusteeship Council; but weshould argue that the Courfs findings should be accepted as a whole and without amendment. If, as was likely, various forms of resolu-tion were proposed, we should support whichever of the resolutionsadvocating acceptance of the full report was the least objectionableto the South African Government.The Cabinet (3) Endorsed the proposals in paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 214regarding the line to be taken by the United KingdomGovernment in the discussions on South-West Africa atthe United Nations.Attendance of The Cabinet were informed that the United States GovernmentRev. Michael had refused visa facilities to enable the Reverend Michael Scott toScott at United travel to New York for the meeting of the United NationsNations. Assembly, but had indicated that this decision would be reconsideredif the Fourth Committee themselves invited Mr. Scott to attend their meeting. The Indian Delegation were likely to bring forward aresolution inviting Mr. Scott to be in attendance during the meetingof the Committee.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that,if such a resolution were passed, it would doubtless be followed by another inviting Mr. Scott to address the Committee. He recom-mended that the United Kingdom representatives should vote againstboth these resolutions on the ground that it Was wrong in principlethat private individuals should be invited to participate in the deliberations of States in the United Nations. If our opposition were based on this principle, which we had asserted on previous occasions,the Indian Government could not take it amiss. If, on the other hand,we supported Mr. Scott&apos;s participation in the discussions, we should give serious offence to the South African Government.In discussion it was pointed out that Mr. Scott&apos;s views on the domestic policy of the South African Government were well receivedby a considerable body of Government supporters in this country;and it would be unfortunate if the United Kingdom Government gave the impression, by their vote in the United Nations, that they were opposed to Mr. Scott&apos;s views. For this reason, and also to avoidexciting the hostility of other delegations at the outset of discussions in which our own Colonial policy would come under review, it wassuggested that it might be preferable that the United Kingdom repre-sentatives should abstain from voting on a resolution which merelyinvited Mr. Scott to be present at the meeting of the Committee.On the other hand it was recognised that there were very strong reasons of principle against allowing private individuals to take partin discussions in the United Nations, and that a very dangerous precedent would be established if Mr. Scott were allowed to do so.It was clear therefore that the United Kingdom representatives mustvote against any resolution inviting him to take part in the discussions.A resolution merely inviting him to attend could have no other object
but to give him an opportunity to influence the Committee&apos;discussions and to pave the way for a further resolution inviting himto take part in them. The right course for the United kingdom representatives was therefore to vote against either resolution; butthey should make it clear that they were doing so on the point ofprinciple and not because of any view on the merits of the issues which were to come under discussion.The Cabinet-(4) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs to instruct the United Kingdom represen-tatives at the meeting of the Fourth Committee of theUnited Nations that they should oppose any resolutioninviting the Rev. Michael Scott to attend the meeting ofthe Committee, or to participate in their discussions, andshould make it clear that their attitude was based solely on the point of principle that private individuals shouldnot be allowed to participate in the deliberations of states in the United Nations.Korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 61stConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet were informed that the Indian Ambassador in peking had reported that the Chinese People&apos;s Government had become more hostile to the United States because of the Americanattitude towards Chinese complaints and Chinese representation inthe United Nations, and that the possibility of Chinese intervention in Korea could not be excluded. The Prime Minister of India took aserious view of these reports, but the Foreign Secretary had sent him a further message urging that India should support the UnitedKingdom resolutions on Korea in the General Assembly.There was general agreement that the policy of the UnitedKingdom Government towards the Korean problem should stand.At the same time, it was desirable to allay Chinese fears, and accordingly the United States Government should be pressed to agreethat representatives of the People&apos;s Government should be invited totake part in discussions in the United Nations on some of the out-standing questions, such as Formosa, and should also endeavourto placate the Chinese Government in regard to the flightsof United States military aircraft over Manchuria and the allegedbombing of places in Manchuria.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should handle the allegedstiffening of the Chinese attitude towards the Koreanproblem in the manner indicated in the Cabinets discussion.Cabinet Office, S.WA,28th September, 1950.
