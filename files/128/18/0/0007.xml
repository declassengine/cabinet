Gromyko had carried the exploratory discussions about Korea a with Russia. stage further by handing to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow a(Previous message to the effect that the Soviet Government considered that the reference: ^est approach towards a peaceful settlement of the Korean questionG.M. (50) 46th was the convening of the Security Council, with the participation of conclusions, representatives of the People&apos;s Government of China as an indispens-minute.) &apos; aD*e condition, and that representatives of the Korean people shouldbe heard by the Council. A message in similar terms had been sentto Pandit Nehru in reply to the communication which he had sentto M. Stalin. There was no suggestion in these messages that theNorth Korean Government should be required to cease from aggres-sion and the Soviet Government had in effect conceded nothing. TheIndian Government had already voted for the admission of thePeople&apos;s Government of China to the Security Council, and theUnited Kingdom Government had indicated that they would accepta majority vote on this issue. If the Soviet Government and thePeople&apos;s Government of China took part in the deliberations of theSecurity Council, one or other might veto any measures proposed bythe other members in respect of Korea, and the action of the united nations in dealing with a flagrant act of aggression would be com-pletely nullified. There was no prospect that the United States wouldbe willing to entertain the Sdviet proposal in the absence of any indica-tion that the North Korean Government were to be asked to stopfighting and withdraw to the 38th Parallel. It would be necessary toconsider further, after consultation with the United States Govern-ment, what reply should be sent to M. Gromyko; but meanwhile it seemed desirable to inform Pandit Nehru that the United KingdomGovernment regarded M. Stalin&apos;s reply to him as unsatisfactory andto draw his attention to the unfavourable course which events would almost certainly take if the procedure proposed by the Soviet Govern-ment were followed. It was proposed to go into the matter in some detail in the reply, because Pandit Nehru regarded the SovietGovernment^ answer as encouraging on the ground that it suggestedthat they were seeking a way out of the present situation without lossof prestige, and every possible effort should be made to avoid a splitbetween the Asiatic members of the United Nations who had so farsupported the action taken by the United Nations and other member states.There was general agreement that the procedure proposed by theSoviet Government could not be accepted. There was no necessaryconnection between the stopping of aggression in Korea and the admission of the People&apos;s Government of China to the security council, and the two issues should at this stage be kept distinct.Negotiations could not usefully be pursued except on the basis that, asa preliminary step, the North Korean forces withdrew to the 38thParallel. When the North Korean Government were induced orforced to cease from the act of aggression which they had committed,further negotiations with the Soviet Government might deal with such questions as the admission of the People&apos;s Government of China tothe Security Council; and in this connection it was noted that, accord-ing to press reports, the United States Government had indicated thaton this issue they would be prepared to accept a majority vote.The draft of a reply which the Prime Minister might send toPandit Nehru was discussed. It was agreed that a reference should bemade to the reported willingness of the United States to accept amajority vote in regard to the admission of the People&apos;s Governmentof China to the Security Council, and that there should be no suggestion in the reply that the Soviet Government had made an offer which other Governments had to view with distrust because ofthe past actions of the Soviet Government, since the Soviet Govern-ment had shown no willingness to make any concessions.There was general agreement that further consideration shouldbe given to the reply to be sent to M. Gromyko and that the discus-39186-2 B 2
Flour 2.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofExtraction Food (CP. (50) 144) proposing that the extraction rate of flour shouldRate. be lowered from 85 to 80 per cent. The rate had been raised during(Previous the war in order to save shipping space, and later to save wheat in a reference: time of world scarcity. These conditions no longer applied, and aCM. (48) 4lst reduction in the rate would be welcomed by the public and by theConclusions, industries concerned.  Imports of additional wheat would be largelyMinute 2.) balanced by decreased imports of feeding-stuffs, and the extra wheatcould be bought from sterling sources.The Minister of Food said that the difficult position regardingsupplies of coarse grains lent force to his proposal. Unless the extraction-tion rate was reduced it would be necessary next winter either to makea cut in the ration scales for livestock or to spend dollars on coarse grains. An additional 25,000 tons a month of feeding-stuffs wouldbecome available if the extraction rate was lowered to 80 per cent.The additional expenditure on imports had been tentatively estimatedat about  2 million in a full year, on the assumption that wheat pricesmight be about  6 a ton higher than those of coarse grains. he appreciated that the food subsidies would be increased by about 31 million, but the total would still be less than the original Ministryof Food estimate of  90 million.The Minister of Agriculture, while supporting the proposal, saidthat it must not be thought that the problem of obtaining adequate supplies of coarse grains would have been solved if the proposal wasadopted; the short-fall of coarse grains during the twelve months toJune 1951 was likely to exceed, by as much as 500,000 tons, the300,000 tons which would become available through lowering the extraction rate.In further discussion it was pointed out that the extraction ratemust be considered in relation to the general nutritional level; whiterbread could be accepted as long as other foods were available to meetthe deficiencies of the whiter loaf. Ministers agreed that the extraction-tion rate of the flour used in the national loaf ought not to be lower than 80 per cent. Imported flour of a lower extraction rate could beused with advantage in the manufacture of biscuits for export, but for home consumption it should be mixed with domestic flour so thata rate not lower than 80 per cent, was maintained.sions with the Soviet Government should be continued, since it waspossible that the Soviet Government might be feeling their way towards a settlement. There was no reason to suppose that M. Stalin&apos;reply represented the final attitude of the Soviet Government. Theprotracted negotiations which had led to the raising of the Berlinblockade might be analogous; in the course of those negotiations theSoviet Government had eventually taken up a position which hadafforded a real basis for a solution. At present there was no basis for negotiation, but we should leave the door open for a further soviet proposal which might enable the Soviet Government to save face andwas nevertheless not irreconcilable with the withdrawal of the north korean forces. Meanwhile, it was undesirable that any public state-ment should be made about the course of the discussions in Moscow,and the Prime Minister should see Mr. Eden and endeavour to inducehim to withdraw a Private Notice Question which he had proposed toask that day about the course of the Moscow discussions.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Prime Minister should send a message toPandit Nehru, through the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner in India, on the lines indicated in the Cabinefs dis-cussion. After despatch a copy of this message should besent to the High Commissioner for India in London.
The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 144, subject to thenational loaf not falling belOw 80 per cent, extraction rate.nationalisation of Public water supplies.;(previous reference:CM. (50) 44thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theMinister of Health and the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (50) 145 and 109)about the nationalisation of public water supplies.The &quot;Ministeroj-Health said that the fundamental problem was how to effect a substantial improvement in rural water supplies with-out putting an insupportable burden on adjacent urban areas or on theExchequer. If Exchequer assistance in respect of rural water supplies in England were proportionate to the grants of  20 million made inScotland, there would be no need for a drastic reorganisation of thesupply system; but he recognised that the higher proportion of ruralto urban areas in Scotland made the position there rather different from that in England. He believed that, by spreading the cost overthe urban areas and by effecting the many economies which a fullyintegrated scheme of water supplies could secure, a national waterundertaking in Englandk and Wales could make the necessaryimprovements in rural water supplies without imposing a seriousburden on urban areas or on the Exchequer.The Lord Privy Seal said that, if the water supplies of thiscountry were being replanned without regard to existing arrange-ments, the scheme put forward by the Minister of Health was on theright lines. In fact, however, any reorganisation would involve difficult negotiations. He was not concerned about the companies, whichshould go, but he did not wish the Government to be embroiled incontroversy with the major local authorities. A distinction could bedrawn between the procurement of water supplies, which involved themapping out of water-supply areas and was a national matter, and thedistribution of supplies, which should, if possible, be left in the handsof bodies founded on a local government basis. In his view, the right course was to initiate discussions with the local authority associations,with a view to working out a solution which would have their good-will and co-operation.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general agreement that, from a technical point ofview, the proposals for nationalisation made by the Minister of Healthwere calculated to secure an efficient distribution of water supplies.There was, however, a danger that a local administration, with so strong a technical bias, would endeavour to carry the improvementof rural water supplies beyond the point where it was economic fromthe national point of view; and the Minister would be under severepressure in Parliament to sanction expensive rural schemes. More-over, while the proposed organisation should effect substantial economies in staffs and equipment, there was always the danger thatthe organisation would become over-elaborate. The conception of a uniform water rate in urban and rural areas might not be sound onstrictly economic grounds, had not yet been applied in the case ofother socialised industries such as electricity, and might involve theExchequer in considerable subsidies because of the marked reluctance of urban areas to accept higher charges.(b) The Government had pledged themselves to effect a marked improvement in water supplies in rural areas. This improvement was required in order to stem the flow of population from the countrysideto the towns. Some Ministers felt that, no matter how unfavourablethe reception of nationalisation might be among local authorities, thescheme proposed by the Minister of Health should be proceeded with,if it provided the only effective means by which an improvement in rural water supplies could be brought about.   Many of the water
I 156i ....       -companies operated in rural areas, and rural local authorities had not shown themselves sufficiently alive to the need for improved supplies.Other Ministers felt that there ought to be further examination of theextent to which rural water supplies could be improved by theenergetic exercise of existing powers, together with fresh powersdesigned to enforce amalgamations of local authorities and to enlistto a greater extent the services of county councils.(c) Although only a proportion of local authorities were directly concerned with water supplies and only a limited number of membersof local authorities were involved in the administration of water undertakings, some Ministers considered that it was undesirable at thepresent juncture to remove a further major function from localauthorities. A stage was being reached at which it might be difficultto induce responsible persons to interest themselves in local govern-ment. Moreover, local authorities might fear that the grounds onwhich their functions in regard to water supplies were being taken from them could be used to. justify the removal of other functions,notably those relating to highways and sewerage^ If local governmentin this country became lifeless, it would be a high price to pay for improvements such as the provision of an efficient national systemof water supplies.(d) There was general agreement that the existing watercompanies should be brought under public ownership.(e) The mapping out of water-supply areas had already been effected by the Ministry of Health, and the results were embodied inthe scheme set out in CP. (50) 145. If the suggested distinctionbetween procurement and distribution went further than that andimplied national ownership of reservoirs and a national water gridfrom which local authorities would distribute water to householdsand industrial consumers, the matter would have to be further examined. Experience in electricity supply did not suggest that a distinction between national generation and local distribution couldbe maintained in the long run; and in many cases rural supplier couldbe secured by the tapping of underground sources without the needfor a national grid or detailed central supervision.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume at a later date their discussion of the nationalisation of public water supplies.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th July, 1950.
