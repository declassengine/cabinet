A. Maclean, who was to have been one of the part-time members of the Iron and Steel Corporation, a letter intimatingthat he was no longer willing to serve on the Corporation, in viewof the political controversy which had arisen over it, and with-drawing his acceptance of the appointment. He indicated that hewas anxious to publish his letter of resignation. The Minister saidthat he proposed to see Mr. Maclean. He had no power to stop him from resigning or from publishing his letter of resignation. If,however, he persisted in his present attitude the Minister proposed to publish, at the same time, a reply which would make it clear thatit was the duty of members of the Corporation, irrespective of their political persuasions, to carry out the terms of the Act, and thatMr. Maclean had been willing to undertake this task when he had originally accepted appointment to the Corporation.interference 2.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Homewith Military Secretary (CP. (50) 206) covering a revised draft of the OverseasSupplies. Operations (Security of Forces) Bill. This had been prepared under(Previous the direction of the Committee of Ministers appointed by the cabinet reference: at their meeting on 25th July. The Committee had not, however,CM. (50) 50th consulted the Trades Union Congress, as contemplated at that conclusions. meeting: they had thought it preferable to defer this until the minute 5.)       revised Bill had again been considered by the Cabinet.The draft Bill was intended to prevent interference with theoperation of United Nations forces in Korea and was designed topenalise action, whether by sabotage, strikes or propaganda, calcu-lated to impede active operations undertaken in time of peace byHis Majesty&apos;s Forces or by forces associated with them. the cabinet&apos;s discussion turned mainly on the question whether the Billshould be so amended as to cover such Communist attempts to disruptthe national economy as had been described at the Cabinefsmeeting on 14th September and had been the subject of the statement made by the Minister of Labour in the House of Commons on15th September. These Communist activities were likely to takethe form of attempts to disrupt communications; and they couldbe covered, so long as United Nations forces were operating in Korea,by extending Clause 2 of the Bill to actions likely to prejudice themaintenance of services essential to the life of the community.In favour of extending the Bill in this way it was argued that,if an Overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill were introduced in the near future, the Government would be asked whether it would suffice to penalise the kind of Communist activity described in thestatement by the Minister of Labour and would be in a weak Parlia-mentary position if they had to admit that it would not. Moreover,there was a serious and immediate risk that Communist activitiesof this kind would be undertaken while the Korean operations were proceeding, and it was desirable that the Government should be armed with adequate legal powers for dealing with such activities.
On the other side, it was argued that it would be unwise to tryhastily to adapt a Bill which had been devised for a specific andcomparatively narrow purpose so as to meet the different situationcontemplated in the recent statement by the Minister of Labour. Itwas doubtful whether that Communist threat could effectively be countered merely by strengthening the criminal law. It called forother measures of a different character, as the Cabinet had envisaged in their discussion of 14th September, and it would be unwise forthe Government to appear to consider that they had disposed of theproblem by a few alterations in a Bill designed for another purpose.Moreover, these indications of a Communist conspiracy to disruptthe national economy for the purpose of delaying the Governmenfsdefence programmes raised grave issues which were even more far-reaching than those covered by the present Bill and called for furtherconsideration by Ministers.The Cabinet next discussed whether the draft Bill annexed to cp. (50) 206 should be approved as a basis for further consultationwith the Trades Union Congress. The view was expressed that clause 3 of the Bill, dealing with subversive publications, was not likely to be effective. Some Ministers were inclined to think that theBill should not attempt to deal with subversive publications at all.Alternatively, it was suggested that the second of the two forms of clause 3 printed in the draft might be strengthened if the offencewere made to consist in publishing statements &quot;with a view toinfluencing public opinion in a manner likely to prejudice the carryingout of operations . . . .&quot; No final decision was taken on this point.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that if itwere found in the event that Communist activities were taking theform envisaged in the statement made by the Minister of Labour on15th September it would probably be inappropriate for the Govern-ment to introduce legislation on the lines of the draft Bill annexed to CP. (50) 206 and directed wholly or mainly at interference withthe operations of United Nations forces overseas. Subject to furtherconsideration of Clause 3, the Cabinet might approve that draft inprinciple as a measure aimed at that particular danger; but theyshould not at this stage commit themselves to proceeding with legis-lation of that character. Such legislation would not in any event be introduced until the new Session of Parliament opened towardsthe end of October; and, in the meantime, the Cabinet Committeewhich had prepared this draft could consider whether wider legis-lation should be framed to counter the kind of Communist activityenvisaged in the statement of 15th September.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that, if it-were decided to introduce legislation to penalise interference with operations byHis Majesty&apos;s Forces overseas similar to those which were now being conducted in Korea, this should follow the linesof the draft annexed to CP. (50) 206, subject to furtherconsideration of Clause 3 of that draft.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange that (as part of thegeneral enquiry which the Cabinet had on 14th Septemberasked him to undertake) the Committee which had super-vised the preparation of the draft annexed to CP. (50)206 should also consider whether the criminal law could with advantage be strengthened for the purpose ofcountering a Communist conspiracy to foment industrial unrest in this country.
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the attorney-General (CP. (50) 207) on the question whether the presentconflict in Korea was to be regarded in law as a war.The Attorney-General said that there was general agreement that the law of treason and other English laws applied as if the conflict were a war. There was much to be said for the view that,iii international law also, this was a war; but some internationallawyers were inclined to think that it represented something in thenature of a police action, especially as the nations had now agreedto banish war as a means of settling disputes. Largely for reasons of domestic politics, President Truman and the Prime Minister ofCanada had described the operations on which their countries were engaged, not as war, but as a police operation undertaken by theUnited Nations. There were many practical reasons why it was desirable to reach agreement with the Governments of other commonwealth countries and of the United States about the legalstatus of the Korean conflict.The Lord Chancellor said that he had no doubt that the TreasonActs, the Foreign Enlistment Act, and other similar measures wereapplicable to the present conflict; and he thought that this shouldbe publicly stated. More generally, he thought it plain that north korea was at war with South Korea, and that States which joinedin this conflict were also at war. Where organised States were inarmed conflict, it was difficult to argue that the operation was nota war.In discussion it was suggested that further consideration shouldbe given to the question whether the balance of practical advantage,in financial consequences and other respects, lay in agreeing to regard the conflict as a war or as a form of police action taken under the aegis of the United Nations. The question could then be discussed with other members of the Commonwealth and the United States,in both its legal and its practical aspects, with a view to securing a common policy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to state, in replying to a Parlia-mentary Question that day by Major Tufton Beamish,M.P., that a British subject who consorted with the NoithKoreans might lay himself open to a charge of treason.(2) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the practicalaspects of the international status of the Korean conflictto be further examined with the Departments concerned;and thereafter, in consultation with the Lord Chancellor,the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations andthe Attorney-General, to arrange for the legal and practical issues involved to be discussed with other commonwealth Governments and with the United StatesGovernment.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (CP. (50) 209) on the question whether twovertical borers, ordered by the Polish Government from Messrs.Craven Bros, before the export of such machinery to Eastern europe was prohibited, should be delivered to Poland.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the debate inthe House of Commons later the same day, he would make it clearthat since April 1949 there had been a complete ban on the export to Eastern Europe of various types of machinery and other equip-ment which had a military value. It had, however, been made clear
at the time that these restrictions would not apply to orders previouslyplaced. The value of the heavy machinery which was due to be delivered to Eastern Europe in respect of these earlier orders was estimated at  6,300,000, of which about  4 million was for Russiaand about  2 million for Poland. Before the war exports of machine tools to Eastern Europe had constituted 40 per cent, of the exporttrade of the industry: they now represented only 14 per cent.,though they might rise to 20 per cent, if all the outstanding orders were completed. At the same time, the Foreign Secretary was understrong pressure from the United States Government to make further reductions in exports of strategic value to the Soviet bloc, and theUnited States Government would be most unwilling to supply us with machine tools if we were ourselves exporting machine tools to eastern Europe. Moreover, public opinion in this country wasuneasy about the quantity of machinery which was going to Russiaand her satellites. He therefore proposed to announce in the debate that the export of machine tools to Eastern Europe would be suspended until particulars of these tools had been circulated, notonly to the Supply Departments in this country, but also to Common-wealth and North Atlantic countries. Subject to treaty obligations,any machinery intended for Eastern Europe which was required for western or Commonwealth defence would be diverted from eastern europe. Such of the machinery as was not required for that purpose would be delivered to Eastern Europe in accordance with theexisting contracts and trade agreements.In discussion it was pointed out that these enquiries should be conducted as quickly as possible: otherwise the machine tool industry might have in part to suspend production, since machine tools fre-quently incorporated features peculiar to the individual order. More-over, it would have to be clearly understood that other north atlantic countries would adopt a similar policy, and that any machine tools diverted in this way to other North Atlantic countries wouldnot be re-exported to Eastern Europe.The Cabinet then discussed the particular question whether thetwo vertical borers mentioned in CP. (50) 209 should be delivered to Poland. One of these, described as machine &quot; A,&quot; had been thesubject of an assurance that an export licence would be granted. Nosuch assurance had been given in respect of machine &quot; B,&quot; thoughan export licence in respect of that machine had in fact been granted in January 1950. The following points were made in discussion:-. (a) The exact dates when Messrs. Craven Bros, had signed con-tracts with the Polish Government for delivery of the two machines were not yet clear. It had previously been understood thatmachine &quot; B &quot; was ordered after the signing of the Polish Agreement;but Messrs. Craven Bros, had lately informed the Ministry of Supplythat the orders for both machines were placed before the signing ofthe Agreement. On the other hand, there had been some earlycorrespondence between the Polish Embassy and the Ministry ofSupply which proceeded on the basis that machine &quot; A&quot; did not then come specifically within the terms of the Polish Agreement.(b) A distinction could be drawn between machine &quot; A,&quot; whichwas the subject of a specific assurance under the terms of the con-fidential letter annexed to the Polish Agreement that an export licencewould be granted, and machine &quot;B,&quot; in respect of which no suchassurance had been given. At the same time the Polish Governmentwere likely to contend that the grant of an export licence in January1950 in respect of machine &quot;B &quot; was equivalent to a firm commit-ment. If, therefore, either machine was withheld from delivery thePolish Government would argue that the United Kingdom Govern-ment had broken its treaty obligation under the Polish Agreement.(c) In practice the Polish Government might not take retaliatory action if at this stage the United Kingdom Government did not go beyond a decision to retain machine &quot;B&quot; for their own use andan investigation whether machine &quot; A &quot; and -other machinery on
order were required for Western defence, since the Soviet bloc neededsterling for other purchases and a willingness to contemplate the delivery in certain circumstances of machine tools ordered before april 1949 made it clear that this country was not contemplating aneconomic blockade.(d) Machine &quot; B &quot; was required in connection with the produc-tion of tanks in a Royal Ordnance factory and the military authorities had recently stressed the need for a speeding-up of tank production.If machine &quot; B &quot; were not available, it might be necessary to order a corresponding machine from Germany which would not be avail-able until three months later and would cost substantially more.(e) The fact that the action contemplated might constitute a breach of the Polish Agreement should not be burked in the debate.There had been a considerable change in circumstances since theAgreement was signed and the obligation of the Government to honour the Agreement in full could be regarded as somewhatlessened. At the same time, it was not necessary in the debate to be too precise about the Governments intentions regarding the with-holding of machines ordered before April 1949; and from this anglethere would be some advantage in focusing attention on the decisionto requisition machine &quot; B.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that machine &quot; B &quot; should not be delivered to poland and should be retained for use by the Ministry of Supply.(2) Agreed that a list of other machine tools and equipment(including machine &quot; A &quot;) ordered before April 1949 anddue for delivery to Eastern Europe should be preparedas quickly as possible and enquiry made whether any ofthe items included in the list was required for Common-wealth and Western defence.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to explainGovernment policy, in the forthcoming debate on exportsto Eastern Europe, on the lines indicated in the cabinets discussion.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Food (CP. (50) 208) explaining that the Overseas food corporation had received a report from a working party on the short-term arid long-term agricultural future of Kongwa, and that,in accordance with the recommendations of this working party, hehad authorised the Corporation to use most of the cleared land at kongwa for grazing store-cattle. The Corporation proposed to publish the report of the working party on 20th September and to announce their acceptance of its recommendations.The Minister of Food said that, from the climatic point of view,this had been an average year at Kongwa, but the results had beenvery disappointing. The outlay on the farm had far exceeded thevalue of the harvest of ground-nuts, sunflower, maize and sorghum.A decision was required immediately on the manner in which theland was to be used next year. This would not prejudice the long-term consideration in November of the future of the East Africanground-nuts project as a whole. He was, however, proposing to take steps without delay to associate the Colonial Office in the future administration of the scheme.It was the general view of the Cabinet that Ministers would wishto satisfy themselves that the introduction of cattle-rearing on a large scale at Kongwa was justified. Accordingly, the publication of theworking party&apos;s report and of the Corporation^ decision upon itshould be postponed.
The Cabinet- 1Invited the Minister of Food to circulate to the Cabinet thJreport of the working party on the agricultural future olKongwa with a view to its consideration at an early meet in Jof the Cabinet. 1Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Wh September, 1950.
