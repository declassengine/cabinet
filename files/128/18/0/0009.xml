Ms. mackenzie king.1. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would have heard with regret of the death of Mr. Mackenzie King. He had sentto the Prime Minister of Canada on their behalf a message extendingtheir sincere sympathy to the Government and people of Canada.The Prime Minister said that he had considered whether formalreference to Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s death should be made in either house of Parliament. There were, however, strong reasons for restricting such occasions as narrowly as possible, and he thought itwould be undesirable to establish on this occasion a new precedent of paying this tribute to the memory of a statesman of anotherCommonwealth country.The Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable that no formalreference to Mr. Mackenzie King&apos;s death should be made in either house of Parliament.Explosion inPortsmouthDockyard.Interferencewith military supplies.(previous reference :CM. (50) 48thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The First Lord of the Admiralty communicated tothe Cabinet the substance of an interim report by the board ofenquiry which was investigating the recent explosions of ammunitionin Portsmouth dockyard. It had now been established beyond doubtthat the explosions had been caused by the insertion of a specially-active incendiary material into a depth-charge; and it was clear thatthis had been done as a deliberate act of sabotage..The Prime Minister said that it was desirable that thesubstance of this interim report should be communicated to Parlia-ment without delay; and he read to the Cabinet the draft of a state-ment which he proposed to make in the House of commons that afternoon. In discussion certain drafting amendments were suggested and approved.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would announce in theHouse of Commons that afternoon the preliminary findings of the board of enquiry into the recent explosions ofammunition in Portsmouth dockyard.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (50) 183) covering the draft of an Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) Bill making it an offence for any person tointerfere with supplies destined for use by units of His Majesty&apos;forces engaged in active operations at times when the country wasnot technically in a state of war.The Home Secretary said that the drafting of the Bill hadpresented considerable difficulty because it was not possible tointroduce a reference to an enemy. The precise powers which wouldbe available were specified in the Bill itself; and the Governmentwould not therefore be open to the criticism, which had been brought against some of the Regulations made under the Emergency Powers(Defence) Act, that they were going beyond the intentions of Parlia-ment. He was not himself in favour of including in the Bill clause 3relating to propaganda, but he had thought it right to bring that proposal forward for decision by the Cabinet. He thought it wouldbe difficult to resist any pressure there might be in Parliament that anOrder-in-Council bringing the operative provisions of the Bill intoeffect should require approval by affirmative resolution.The Cabinet then considered the Bill on the basis that the recentexplosions in Portsmouth dockyard showed the lengths to whichCommunists and their sympathisers were prepared to go in impedingthe flow of supplies to the Far East, and that it might therefore bedesirable to introduce the Bill immediately and pass it through all its stages in both Houses before the Summer Recess. It was true39204-2 b 2
that sabotage of the type which appeared to have been committed at portsmouth was an offence under the existing law for which severepenalties could be imposed, but the Portsmouth incident showed the dangerous consequences which might follow from; political incite-ment to interfere with; military supplies, and the existing law did notdeal adequately with all the harmful activities which might be carriedon with this in view.On the text of the Bill the following points were made:  (a) The long title, which referred only to interference with actualoperations, might appear to be less wide than clause 1 (1), whichenvisaged the possibility that an Order-in-Couhcit might have to bemade in respect of future operations. The general view was, however,that the long; title; which would have importance only in respect ofParliamentary proceedings on the Bill and not of its subsequent inter-pretation was wide enough to cover the detailed provisions of the Bill.(b) Doubt was expressed about the expediency of including apreamble, especially one which was rather narrowly drawn and didnot in terms cover operations designed to restore order in british territory^ such as the current operations in Malaya. Most Ministersfelt, however, that in a Bill of this type a preamble would be usefulas indicating the primary purposes wtach Parliament had in mind in passing the legislation. -..(c). No difficulty was expected in operating clause 1 of the Bill,since it left it to HisMajesty to determine whether the operativeprovisions of the Act should be brought into effect in any given set of circumstances.(d) Clause 2 (4) afforded a protection from the risk of prosecu-tibn to those engaged in a lawful strike arising out of a dispute between employers and workmen. It left exposed to the provisionsof the Bill those who impeded military supplies while carrying out an illegal strike of the type of which there had been several recentexamples. The Bill would be of little value if it did not penalisethose who incited or took part in unofficial strikes which were aimed at impeding- military operations and - sought to make use of somepretext such as the employment of non-unionists or a demarcationdispute between unions.. On the other hand, it was recognised that parliament would look closely at any provision discriminating inthis way between lawful and unlawful strikes. It was suggested thatcontroversy might be avoided if the protection afforded by clause 2(4) were extended to persons taking part in any strike and^ reliancewere placed on clause 5&apos; of the Bill as a means of dealing with those responsible for instigating others to strike. It was pointed out thatthis course would involve the prosecution in the difficulty of proving that the instigators of the strike had the intent stated in clause 2 ofthe Bill. The Cabinets conclusion on this point was that it would be wise to ascertain the views of the Trades Union Congress on the pro-visions of this sub-section of the Bill, r(e) Clause 3 would not be an effective weapon for dealing withpropaganda in Communist newspapers. If such propaganda wereto be stopped it would be necessary to take powers wider than thoseof clause 3, and wider than any that had been taken under defence regulations in time of war. The general view of Ministers was that clause 3 should be omitted from the Bill since it would give rise to serious controversy and would impede the speedy passage of the Bill.As regards the timing of legislation, the gerijeral view ofMinisters was that a short measure indicating that Parliament wasnot prepared to tolerate interference with military operations wouldbe acceptable to both Houses of Parliament and to the country at large. It would be undesirable to introduce the Bill now and to leaveits remaining stages to be taken in the autumn, since it would be saidthat if the Government regarded these powers- as necessary theyshould be taken forthwith. At the same time the pasage of the bill before the Summer Recess might be made the occasion for demands
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th July, 1950.that Parliament should be recalled before the middle of October.Some Ministers considered that, if the Opposition were persuaded ofthe need for legislation, it would be possible to pass the Bill throug hall its stages in a single day. Other Ministers doubted whether therewould be a sufficient, consensus of opinion on the detailed provisionsof the Bill, particularly those relating to strikes, to make it practicable to I pass it so quickly. There was general agreement that a discussionwith representatives of the Trades Union Congress of the provisionsof the Bill, and especially of those relating to strikes, would revealwhether the Bill was likely to commend itself to Government sup-porters in the Commons, and that a decision on the question whetherthe Bill should be introduced and passed before the Summer Recessshould be postponed until these consultations had taken place.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord President and the Minister of Labour, withthe Attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, to consultrepresentatives of the Trades Union Congress urgentlyand in confidence on the question whether legislation onthe lines of clause 2 (4) of the draft Bill annexed to CP.(50) 183 was likely to prove acceptable to organised labour.(2) Agreed to resume, in the light of these consultations withthe Trades Union Congress, their discussion of the ques-tion whether legislation on these lines should be introduced before the Summer Recess.
