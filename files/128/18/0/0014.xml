ie 1.  The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to send to The king and Queen a message expressing their deep satisfaction at the birthof a daughter to Their Royal Highnesses the Princess Elizabeth andthe Duke of Edinburgh, and conveying the Cabinefs congratulations to Their Majesties and to Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of edinburgh.2. The Prime Minister said that, as his colleagues would be aware, the Leaders of the Opposition Parties had urged that Parlia-ment should meet to review the defence situation at a date earlier than that (12th September) proposed by the Government. In the communications which they had made to him so far they had not put forward any specific reasons for an earlier meeting; and he himself was still of the opinion that Parliamentary discussion of thesematters would be more profitable if it were postponed until themiddle of September, by which time further progress would have beenmade in working out the details of the Government&apos;s plans and pro-posals. He was seeing the Opposition Leaders later that afternoon;and, subject to any fresh arguments which they might bring forward,he proposed to adhere to the decision that Parliament should be recalled on 12th September. So far as could be foreseen at present,it should suffice if Parliament sat for about a week and then adjourned until 17th October.The Cabinet endorsed the views expressed by the PrimeMinister.The Foreign Secretary said that he was due to attend the next meeting of the North Atlantic Council, which would open in new york on 15th September; and, as bis medical advisers would not allow him to fly, he would have to leave London before Parliamentmet on 12th September. He would have preferred to be availablefor any Parliamentary debates on defence and the international situa-tion; and he had wondered whether his absence from these debatesmight give rise to unfavourable comment in Parliament.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should attend the september meeting of the North Atlantic Council, not-withstanding the decision to recall Parliament on 12thSeptember.52ndions.4.)pmentirae.3. The Minister of Defence said that he- would have liked to see-more rapid progress made in working out detailed programmes forthe re-equipment of the Services which had been made possible by the cabinet&apos;s decision to increase defence expenditure to a figure of 3,400 million over the next three years. Detailed planning was,however, being held up because it was not known in the service departments what proportion of that total would be available forre-equipment. It would be helpful if the Prime Minister could issue a directive indicating what amount of the total expenditure could be allocated to re-equipment and authorising the Departments to placeproduction orders within that amount.The Minister of State for Economic Affairs said that the total defence programme of  3,400 million assumed financial assistancefrom the ^United States Government to the extent of  550 million;and, until it was known whether that amount of financial aid wouldin fact be forthcoming from the United States, it would not bepossible to determine finally what the total of our defence expenditure would be over the next three years or what proportion of it could be
devoted to re-equipment. It did not follow, however, that the planning of a re-equipment programme, or the actual placing of initialorders, need be held up until the precise total of the three-year programme had been finally determined. It was clear that under theexpanded programme, after allowing for the American aid we had sought, we should be spending ourselves at least another  100 million on re-equipment, in addition to the  100 million authorised by theCabinet on 25th July; and he had already suggested that the TreasuryInter-Services Committee should be reconstituted with authority to approve the placing of production orders on behalf of the services which the limits of this further  100 million. He believed that this financial authority would be sufficient to cover all the progress whichcould in practice be made during the next few months, in carryingforward a programme of re-equipment; but he would be prepared,if necessary, to consider increasing the total to  150 million.In further discussion the following points were raised: -(a) Was there adequate machinery to ensure that the expansion and re-equipment of the Armed Forces would go forward in accord-ance with a properly co-ordinated plan? In the early stages of thelast war the lack of adequate central Control over production pro-grammes had given rise to serious deficiencies in some items andwasteful surpluses in others. These errors should not be repeatednow. It was equally important that the production of equipmentshould be kept in step with the expansion of the man-power of theServices. -The Minister of Defence said that the Joint War production committee, which was constituted on the model of the similar Com-,mittee which had operated during the latter stages of the last war,was responsible for co-ordinating the re-equipment programme. Theexperience of the last war would certainly not be overlooked and, asthe defence programmes expanded, there probably would be occasion to modify and strengthen the existing machinery for ensuringco-ordination. The Prime Minister said that he was proposing to look into this question.(b) What steps would be taken to co-ordinate our re-equipment programme with those of the other North Atlantic Treaty Powers, inaccordance with the principle of building up balanced collectiveforces?The Cabinet were informed that at some future stage the strict application of that principle might involve some unbalancing of the armed Forces of the United Kingdom. For some time to come,however, the best contribution which we could make towards thebuilding up of the defences of Western Europe would be to increasethe effectiveness of our own Forces.The Foreign Secretary reminded his colleagues that, apart from western Europe, there were other areas where an enemy might strike at points vital to British interests; and he would therefore deprecateany undue concentration on the defence of Western Europe. Thefirst duty of the Government was to build up balanced and effectiveForces and, so far as possible, to reserve to themselves the decisionwhere those Forces should be deployed in an emergency.The Minister of Defence said that, while he did not dissent inprinciple from the view expressed by the Foreign Secretary, theGovernment had already accepted some commitments to supplyForces for the defence of Western Europe; and he believed that, ifthe other Governments of Western Europe were to be encouraged toimprove their state of preparedness, it might be necessary to enter into some further commitments of this kind. He fully recognised, how-ever, that the Government could not be unmindful of their responsi-bilities in other parts of the world.(c) What progress had been made in securing standardisation ofmilitary equipment among the North Atlantic Treaty Powers?
The Cabinet were informed that a great deal of work had beendone on this question and that, having regard to the practical diffi-culties, the progress made was not unsatisfactory. In the last resortthe, problem would be eased by the large extent to which the other: countries must rely upon the United Kingdom or the United states to provide them with equipment.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence, in consultation with theMinister of State for Economic Affairs, to ensure that no time was lost in planning the initial stages of the re-equip-ment programme which had been made possible by theGovernments decision to authorise a substantial increasein defence expenditure over the next three years.. 4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal toincrease the period of National Service&apos;to two years. They had before them a memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (50) 19.1)summarising the preliminary responses of the French, netherlands and Belgian Governments to his enquiry whether they would beprepared to take corresponding action to extend their period ofNational Service.The Foreign Secretary said that these replies were disappointing.The four other Governments had all dwelt on the political difficultiesof lengthening their period of National Service, and it was clear fromthe French reply, in particular, that French action was likely to dependon the receipt of additional help from the United States or from our-selves. It was becoming increasingly evident that we must turn tothe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, rather than Western Union,for effective co-operation in defence. It was his view that the cabinet should now proceed to give effect to their decision to increase theperiod of National Service to two years, without waiting for anyfurther response from the other Western Union countries. It was tobe hoped that the force of our example would lead the others to take similar measures.The Minister of Defence said that he agreed that there would beno advantage in deferring the announcement. There was some hopeof co-operation by the Netherlands Government, but there was now anew Minister of Defence in Belgium and the French were evidentlyinfluenced by the approaching elections and the fear of Communistagitation. We must build up our strength in man-power and equip-ment, irrespective of what was done by other Western european countries, and in our own interests it was essential that the period ofNational Service should now be extended to two years.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was arguable that our unilateral extension of the period ofNational Service might make the other Western Union Governmentseven more reluctant to improve their state of preparedness. France,in particular, might expect us to enter into further military commit-ments in Western Europe by reason of this increase in the size of our forces. In addition, a unilateral announcement would advertise the lack of effective co-operation between the Western Union countries.Might it not be wiser, therefore, to exert further pressure on them through renewed diplomatic approaches before we lost our bar-gaining power by announcing our decision?In reply it was pointed out that a further approach to these governments might result in definite refusals to follow our lead orembarrassing requests for further military commitments in western europe. The Governments Parliamentary position would be stronger if they were able to announce that the suggestion had been
made and that the Western Union Governments had it under con-sideration. Moreover, the Government would be in a position toexercise strong moral pressure on the other Governments once theyhad announced their decision.(b) The decision to extend the period of National Service to twoyears had been taken primarily for reasons unconnected with thedefence of Western Europe. Recruiting for the regular Army and AirForce had been inadequate, and the best material was now being found among the National Service element in the Forces. Withoutlarger numbers of National Servicemen we should be unable to carryout essential training in the Army or to deal with another emergencysimilar to that which had arisen in Korea. The extension of theperiod of National Service would not in itself meet the man-powerneeds of the Royal Air Force, but it would remedy some of theirdeficiencies.(c) If enough men were to be found for them under conditionsof full employment, the Services must be regarded as an under-mannedessential industry and steps must be taken to make such improvements in pay and conditions as were likely to attract the required number of recruits.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the decision to extend the period of National Service to two years should be announcedwithout waiting for further replies from the other Western UnionGovernments.The Cabinet then discussed the date on which the extensionshould be put into effect, and the possibility of mitigating hardship to national Servicemen who would otherwise have been released duringthe coming autumn. It was generally felt that a date should be chosen which would reduce to a minimum the cases of exceptionalhardship, while not affecting substantially the immediate increase in service strengths which was one of the primary purposes of thedecision to extend the period of service. Special care should be takento avoid, so far as possible, interfering with arrangements already made by National Servicemen to start courses at universities andtechnical colleges in the autumn of 1950.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the announcement of the Governments pro-posals for the extension of full-time National service should be made without waiting for further replies fromthe other Western Union Governments.(2) Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to examine, with officials of the Departments concerned, means of reducingto the minimum the number of cases of special hardshipwhich might be caused by this extension of the period ofNational Service; and to report the results of this examination to the Prime Minister.Essential 5.   The Home Secretary said that the Chairman of the BritishServices. Electricity Authority had suggested that the risk of sabotage at powerRisk of stations could be substantially reduced if a relatively small number of sabotage at known Communists employed in the power stations were transferredPower Stations, to other work within the electricity industry. He had asked whetherthe Authority could count on Government support if they took stepsto transfer these men and, in particular, whether they could rely on service man-power to keep the power stations in operation if this action provoked a strike.The Home Secretary said that, after consultation with his advisers and with the Security Service, he was satisfied that it would be inju-dicious to encourage the British Electricity Authority to take suchaction at the present time.  There was no reason to believe that any
organised outbreak of sabotage was imminent. But precipitate action of this kind by the British Electricity Authority might well have the effect of starting a series of disconnected acts of sabotageby irresponsible individuals. And it was almost certain to provoke a widespread strike in the electricity industry on the ground that themen concerned had been victimised.The Minister of Labour and the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Fuel &quot;and Power, endorsed the view expressed by theHome Secretary.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and power, to arrange for the Chairman of the British Elec-tricity Authority to be informed that the Government didnot desire the Authority to take any action at the presenttime to transfer to other work in the industry the knownCommunists employed in power stations.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange.for the security service to assist the British Electricity Authority in con-sidering what further steps might be taken to increase theexisting precautions against sabotage at power stations.Cabinet Office, SWA,YJth August, 1950.
