1. The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government were proposing that the post of Secretary-General to the United nations should be offered to Sir Girja Bajpai, S&amp;cretary-Generai of the IndianMinistry of External Affairs. This proposal might prove embarrassing to the United Kmg^ohi Government. For although on merits SirGirja Bajpai was a good candidate for this appointment, we might find it awkward to support a Russian proposal, especially when wefiacj already indicated support for the alternative of extending Mr.Trygve Lie&apos;s term of office for a further period.In discussion it was suggested that the Russians were not advocates-cating the appointment of Sir Girja Bajpai on his merits: they were more likely to be influenced by the fact that over Korea the indian government had recently been pursuing a policy different from thatof the Western Powers. Moreover, the United Kingdom Governmenthad in the past been inclined to argue that, in principle, the post of secretary-General should be held by a national of one of the smallerPowers. -The Foreign Secretary said that, before making up his mind onthis point, he would wish to know what attitude was likely to be takenby other Governments. When he had obtained this information hewould consult with the Prime Minister before deciding what instruc-tions should be sent to the United Kingdom representatives at theUnited Nations Assembly.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Cabinet discussed who should speak on the Governmenfsbehalf in the debate on 23rd October on the motions for the con-tinuance in force of the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers)Act, 1945, and other emergency powers. It was suggested that, as theGovernment were proposing to seek permanent powers of economiccontrol in the next session of Parliament, they should do nothing inthis debate to suggest that they attached importance to this renewal of the temporary powers; and that from this point of view it mightbe preferable if the debate were handled by one of the departmental ministers responsible for the exercise of these powers. On the otherhand it was pointed out that numerous Departmental Ministers were equally interested and that on this account it would be more appro-priate that the Governmenfs case should be put forward by Ministersexercising co-ordinating functions. It was agreed that the Govern-ment spokesmen in this debate should be the Lord President and theMinister of State for Economic Affairs.In the debate on 25th October on general problems relating to public corporations, the Government spokesmen would be the lord president and the Minister of Fuel and Power,3. In accordance with the Cabinefs decision of 16th October aGovernment motion had been tabled inviting the House of commons to declare that Mr. J. G. MacManaway was disabled from sittingand voting in the House. The Conservative Opposition had given notice of an amendment urging that a Royal Commission should beappointed to deal with the state of the law as disclosed in the reportof the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council. The Cabinet were informed that Opposition speakers would have no difficulty indemonstrating that numerous anomalies could occur under the exist-ing law; and the Government, if they declined to contemplate any form of enquiry into the general state of the law, might have diffi-culty in carrying their point on a division.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that it would be inappropriate to remit this question for enquiry by a Royal Commis-sion.  It was essentially a House of Commons matter; and, if any-4 b 2
enquiry was to be made, it should be conducted by a SelectCpmrnittee^  On tte mistake forthe Government to offer a once to move for the appointment of a select Committee; for some Government supporters Considered thatthe Government were being unduly generous in their treatment pfMr. MacManaway and would be unwilling that any further concession should be made in response to this Conservative arnendment. Inthese Ckcumstances the Cabinet agreed that the Government spokes-men should not go further than to say that anomalies could occurunder the existing law, and that the Government would be preparedto consider whether a general enquiry should be held and, if so, what form it should take.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord President to consider, in the light of theforthcoming debate in the House of Commons, when itwould be appropriate to move for the appointment of a select Committee to consider the whole state of the law relating to the eligibility of clergymen to sit in the Houseof Commons.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 235) seeking authority to introduce legislation authorising the Sunday opening of all sections of the Festival of britain.The Lord President said that legislation would be required toauthorise the opening on Sundays of the various exhibitions whichwere to be held in connection with the Festival. The question for theCabinet was whether this legislation should include a provisionauthorising the Sunday opening of the amusement area of the FestivalGardens. This would excite opposition from the churches and fromother quarters; but, despite this, he considered that, for the reasonsindicated in his memorandum, Parliament should be invited toauthorise it. Though this proposal would be opposed at the stage oflegislation, he believed that the Government would be exposed to an even larger volume of criticism during the period of the Festival if theamusement area were closed on Sundays.Opinion in the Cabinet was divided on this question. The mainarguments advanced in favour of Sunday opening were as follows: -(a) In a number of places outside London amusement parks wereregularly opened on Sundays; and it was unreasonable that at thetime of the Festival, London should fail to provide facilities whichwere regarded as normal in other towns.(b) The amusement caterers had assumed that they would be ableto open on Sundays, and some of them might withdraw if they nowfound that they were to lose the revenue from Sunday opening onwhich they had been counting.(c) If the amusement area had to be closed, it would probablybe uneconomic to open the rest of the Festival Gardens on Sundays.The Treasury calculation of the Government subsidy to be grantedtowards the Festival had been based on the assumption that theamusement area would be open on Sundays.(d) Visitors from overseas would expect the amusement area tobe open on Sundays; and week-end visitors from the provinces wouldbe specially disappointed if it were not.(e) The Battersea clergy were in favour of Sunday opening. Andthe local inhabitants, whose original opposition to the project hadbeen based on the fact that it limited their access to Battersea Park,would have a fresh grievance if the Festival Gardens were closed on sundays.
The following arguments were put forward on the other side:  (/) The representatives of the churches had already expressedthemselves as resolutely opposed to the Sunday opening of the amuse-ment area; and if the Government introduced legislation for thispurpose, they would be exposed to severe criticism from church-people generally. Non-conformist opinion, in particular, would beoutraged.(g) In Scotland, resolutions condemning the Sunday opening ofthe amusement area would certainly be passed by church assemblies;and the Government would be criticised by many of their own supporters.(h) Public opinion in Wales would link this proposal with the attempt, sponsored by the brewers, to secure the Sunday opening oflicensed premises; and this would cause grave embarrassment toGovernment supporters in Wales. .(/) In general there was a strong tradition in the Labour party of support for the principle of Sunday observance. Many Govern-ment supporters would be reluctant to vote in favour of this part ofthe proposed legislation; and, if the Opposition chose to vote against it, the Government might be defeated.The Cabinets conclusion was that the question whether theamusement area of the Festival Gardens should be opened on Sundaysshould be left to be determined by a free vote of the House ofCommons and that members of the Government, as well as their supporters, should be free to vote on this point in accordance withtheir conscience. The Bill as introduced should provide for the open-ing of the Festival Gardens as a whole, but it should be so draftedthat it would be easy to move an amendment having the effect thatthe authority for Sunday opening would not extend to the amusementarea of the Gardens. And it should be made clear, as soon as the bill was published, that it was the Governments intention that parliament should decide, by a free vote, whether or not the Sunday openingshould extend to the amusement area.The Cabinet-Authorised the Lord President to prepare and introduce legislation authorising the Sunday opening of all sections ofthe Festival of Britain, on the understanding that the ques-tion whether this authority should extend to the amusementarea of the Festival Gardens would be left to be determined in Parliament by a free vote in which members, as well assupporters, of the Government would be free to voteaccording to conscience.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 233) reporting the results of the approaches made,in pursuance of the Cabinets decision of 27th April, to the chairmen of the boards of socialised industries regarding ,the need for furtherchecks in efficiency in those industries. The chairmen of the boardshad agreed that there should be further opportunities for Parliament-ary discussion on the socialised industries, that public relations in theindustries should be developed and that there should be periodicalenquiries, probably at intervals of seven years, into each of the indus-tries. The chairmen had not, however, felt able to agree to the settingup of a common efficiency unit and, in view of their attitude, there was little prospect that such a unit would be able to operate successfully.On this point the chairmen were not prepared to agree to anything more than a statement to the effect that they were using, and would continue to use, outside consultants on particular problems and thatthey would co-operate in the work of the British Institute of Manage-ment. The Lord President recommended that this point should be pursued no further for the present; but that a statement covering all
the suggestions which had proved acceptable to the chairmen shouldbe made in the course of the forthcoming debate in the House ofCommons on general problems relating to public corporations..   The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 233.PermanentEconomicPowers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 51stConclusions,Minute 3.)6. At their meeting on 27th July the Cabinet had asked that the responsible Ministers should consider what positive powers of econo-mic planning might be included in the draft of the Economic planning and Full Employment Bill circulated with CP. (50) 178. They now had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Health(CP. (50) 230) reporting the results of these further enquiries.The Prime Minister said that the immediate question for theCabinet was whether mention should be made in the King&apos;s Speech ofthe Governments intention to introduce an Economic Planning and full Employment Bill during the forthcoming Session .of Parliament.If the Cabinet agreed that this Bill should be mentioned in the Speech,they could consider its content at a later meeting.The Cabinet (1) Decided that the Economic Planning and Full employment bill should be mentioned in the King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of Parliament.(2) Agreed to consider the content of this Bill at a later meeting.Leasehold 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordReform. President and the Lord Chancellor (CP. (50) 232) on the question(Previous whether temporary legislation should be introduced to relieve currentReference: cases of hardship in the tenancy of residential premises and shops,CM. (50) 36th pending consideration of permanent legislation. The memorandumConclusions, outlined the issues which would have to be settled if temporary legis-Minute 2.)       lation were to be prepared.The Cabinet first considered whether temporary legislation was required or whether it would suffice to expedite the preparation of apermanent measure of leasehold reform. Against the introduction ofany interim measure, it was pointed out that the Bill would be compli-cated, perhaps almost as complicated as permanent legislation, andmight prejudice the permanent solution of the problem. Moreover,if the Opposition pressed for the immediate introduction of permanent legislation they would appear to be offering tenants a more lastingsolution of their difficulties. In favour of temporary legislation it was argued that there was little prospect of securing the passage throughthe present Parliament of a permanent measure on lines which theGovernment would approve and that there were current cases of hardship, including cases arising out of the failure of the Rent Actsto cover certain tenancies within the Rent Acts limits, which oughtto be met immediately by the introduction of a temporary measure.The general view was that, subject to agreement on the scope of any temporary Bill, there would be advantage in introducing a Bill whichwould hold the position for one or two years, while permanent legis-lation was being prepared, provided that the scope of the temporary bill was restricted as narrowly as possible to cover the cases wherereal hardship was being caused.The Cabinet then considered, whether this temporary legislation should extend to all leases, or only to leases within the Rent Actslimits. It was pointed out that, while permanent legislation wouldhave to deal with all classes of lease, it was undesirable to cover toowide a field in a purely temporary measure. Leases outside the RentActs limits had not hitherto been the subject of protection and no
support for giving protection on such a wide field could be found in thefinal report Of the Leasehold Committee; On the other hand, it waspointed out that there was a good deal of hardship among the middle and professional classes because of the high rents which could becharged in the present scarcity of houses, and that the government might be accused of class discrimination if they confined temporaryrelief to the occupants of smaller dwelling-houses. It was recognised,however, that a final decision on this point could not be taken untilother questions affecting the scope of the Bill had been discussed.On the question whether legislation should apply only to leasesentered into before the war, the view was expressed that real hard-ship, due to change of circumstances, arose only in the case of pre-warleases. An individual who entered into a lease before the war hadbeen justified in assuming that at the end of the lease he would be ableto obtain alternative accommodation at a reasonable rent, but circum-stances arising out of the war had falsified this expectation and hadfavoured the landlord at the expense of the tenant in a way whichjustified the introduction of remedial legislation. Individuals who had entered into post-war leases shared in the hardship which affected the whole community arising out of the general shortage of houses,but they had entered into their leases with full knowledge of the pre-vailing circumstances, and these circumstances had not changed inany way which merited intervention by the State into the contractualrelationship between landlord and tenant. If no limit of time were introduced, individuals who had taken a short lease, possibly of a fewmonths, would find themselves given an extension of one or two years;and a landlord who had granted a lease in the expectation that hewould be able to regain possession on its expiry, possibly when he wasreturning from a tour of foreign duty, would find himself unable to gain possession. It was not to be assumed that all landlords were richand all tenants poor. At the same time there would undoubtedly be strong pressure that post-war leases should be covered because of thegeneral feeling that in present circumstances tenants were placed atan unfair disadvantage in bargaining with landlords, and because therewere certain tenancies within the Rent Acts limits (including tenanciesentered into since the war) which ought to enjoy the protection ofthose Acts but were deprived of it for purely technical reasons. If thetemporary legislation did not cover post-war tenancies, these RentActs anomalies, which were leading to numerous evictions at thepresent time, could only be met by amending the Rent Acts: and thatwould have the result of opening up for discussion the whole subjectof the Rent Acts. The view was expressed that some form of com-promise might be reached by agreeing that tenancies entered intobefore December 1945 should be covered by the temporary legislation.Subsequent discussion suggested, however, that temporary legis-lation which applied to all leases, irrespective of their rateable value,entered into before December 1945 would be a complicated measureof considerable length. Because it purported to deal with sometenancy questions in a comprehensive way, it would be criticised for not dealing with other tenancy questions. Thus, the agricultural tradeunions would object to a measure of protection being granted to lease-holders, while nothing was being done in respect of tied cottages, andtheir criticism would be all the sharper because, in a Bill covering alltenancies, it would be necessary specifically to exclude servicetenancies from protection. Moreover, it would be said that theGovernment, if they desired to protect certain classes of tenant coming within the Rent Acts limits, ought to do so by amendment of the rent Acts and not by a temporary measure relating to leases.It was therefore suggested that it would be preferable to restrict the temporary legislation to ground leases which were falling in, andto proceed as quickly as possible with the drafting of a permanentmeasure on all aspects of the leasehold problem. The specific casesof hardship to which the attention of Ministers had originally been drawn arose typically in South Wales and Lanarkshire, where ground-
Meeting of 8.   The Prime Minister said that, leaving out of account theCommonwealth special meeting held in the spring of 1949 to discuss constitutionalPrime developments in India, there had been no meeting of commonwealth ministers. Prime Ministers since the autumn of 1948. In view of the criticalstate of international relations, he thought it advisable that an attempt should be made to hold a further meeting of Prime Ministers at anearly date. From the Commonwealth point of view it Would certainly be valuable to have a full exchange of views on the current interna-tional situation; and the meeting might also have a steadying influence on world affairs. The meeting would be concerned primarily with matters of foreign policy, but it would provide a valuable opportunityfor discussion of defence problems with at any rate the PrimeMinisters of the older Commonwealth countries. Subject therefore tothe Cabinefs concurrence he now proposed to invite all Common-wealth Prime Ministers to a meeting to be held in London in theearly part of December.There was general agreement with the Prime Ministers views.The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would now take steps toarrange for a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers tobe held in London in December.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\9th October, 1950.landlords had allowed working-class houses to be erected in return fora small ground rent and where the ground leases were now falling in.A present occupier who held the ground lease had the grievance thathis forbears had built the house and argued that it was an unfaircontract which now required him to hand over the house to theground-landlord. An extension of ground leases for a temporaryperiod, if it applied irrespective of whether the ground lessee was the occupier, would have the advantage of delaying, until permanent legislation could be framed, the time when a sub-tenant in occupationof a house was liable to eviction because he did not have the protec-tion of the Rent Acts.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (50) 232 at their next meeting.
