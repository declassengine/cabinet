supplementary pensions inSocialisedIndustries.(previous reference:CM. (50) 45thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 218) reporting the misgivings expressed by theGeneral Council of the Trades Union Congress about the proposed appointment of a committee to enquire into supplementary pensions schemes. The General Council had suggested that any such investi-gation should be conducted by officials: they had also asked that nothing should be done which would interfere with the right of tradeunions to negotiate pensions schemes with the Boards of socialised industries.The Lord President said that the primary concern of the general council was to establish the right of the unions to negotiate pensions schemes with the Boards of socialised industries without interferenceby Ministers. This view did not pay sufficient regard to the fact that under the socialisation statutes pensions schemes had to be approvedby the responsible Minister. It might, however, be possible to meetthe General Council to the extent of saying that unions were free tonegotiate with the Boards, but that no indication could be given ofthe attitude which the responsible Ministers would adopt when anyagreed schemes came to them for approval. On the wider questionof an investigation into supplementary pensions, he suggested that theCabinet should agree that a departmental committee should be setup to investigate the whole position. Any general introduction ofsupplementary pensions in a socialised industry would have reper-cussions in the other socialised industries and in private industry also.It was not clear that the General Council fully appreciated the burden which generous supplementary pensions schemes would impose onthe workers and on the economy as a whole. An enquiry would revealthe extent to which existing pensions schemes had been renderedactuarially unsound by the increased expectation of life. He under-stood that the members of the General Council were not all agreedabout the form which any inquiry should take, and he hoped it wouldbe possible to bring the Council to acquiesce in the appointment ofa departmental committee.a In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The economic consequences of any wide extension of schemesof supplementary pensions were so far-reaching that a thorough investigation was required. This should be conducted by independentpersons, whose recommendations would command respect.(b) The recent increase in Service pay had revived the agitationfor a review of war pensions scales. The appointment of a committeeto investigate supplementary pensions in industry would strengthen the demand for an inquiry, by select committee or otherwise, into warpensions.(c) The objections of the Trades Union Congress and the difficul-ties about war pensions might be less if, instead of appointing a specialcommittee to consider supplementary pensions schemes, the Govern-ment referred the question for examination by the national insurance Advisory Committee, set up under section 41 of theNational Insurance Act, 1946. Some of the members of this Com-mittee were not very well known and the question might not come within their existing terms of reference, but their experience in dealingwith national insurance questions would be of value.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 218, subject to further investigation of the question whether the National InsuranceAdvisory Committee could undertake the proposed inquiry into supplementary pensions schemes.

As a result of representations which conclusions,    he had made, these men were being allowed to resume work that minute l.)       morning but were then to be given the choice whether to continue at work or to be suspended on full pay.  The North Thames gas board had asked that the troops should remain available for the next day or two, and this had been arranged.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some of the trade unions concerned had not co-operated wellwith the Government during the strike. Moreover, there had beenfrequent failures to carry out, in-the spirit or even in the letter, theinstructions given by the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineer-ing Unions and the individual trade unions. There was much to besaid for exposing in Parliament the way in which officials withCommunist sympathies had sought to defeat the efforts of the Con-federation to bring the strike to an end.(b) There was a good deal of feeling throughout the country thatthe Government had not moved quickly enough in bringing in thetroops and in instituting criminal proceedings. While it might bedesirable to take action more speedily on any future occasion, therehad been the difficulty on this occasion that the North Thames gas board had strongly advised caution lest the strike should spread. TheServices would not have been able to supply enough men to dealwith any large-scale stoppage, and it was doubtful whether the prose-cution of the ringleaders would have received full public support ifit had been undertaken at an earlier stage.(c) The Lord President, with the Ministers departmentallyresponsible, was considering whether further powers&quot; should betaken to deal with Communist-inspired strikes. * The alternativesappeared to be either to extend the existing statutory provisions relating to breach of contract in public utility services or to require a secret postal ballot to be conducted before a strike in an essentialservice was started. There would be advantage in taking fresh powersto deal with conspiracy or incitement to bring about unofficial strikes,but it should be recognised that there were always great practicaldifficulties in securing evidence on which to base charges of conspir-acy or incitement. It might be desirable as had normally happened in the past to hold a public enquiry into the whole subject before any fresh legislation was introduced.(d) It was undesirable that the ten strikers who had pleaded guiltyto a contravention of the Conditions of Employment and national arbitration Order, 1940, and were appealing only against sentence,should be allowed to absent themselves from work on full pay pendingthe hearing of the appeal.(e) The present Communist agitation against the sentences passed on the ten ringleaders in the gas strike might constitute contempt of court, since the matter was still sub judice pending the hearing of the appeal.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andof the points raised in the discussion.
3. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by theForeign Secretary (CP. (50) 222 and 223) summarising the results ofthe recent discussions in New York on German problems generally and on the particular question of Germany&apos;s participation&quot; in thecommon defence of Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that at the London meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council in May it had been his primary object to convince the Americans that European defence could not be built upon the basis that in a future war the European Powers would againhold the front alone until such time as American support was forth-coming: Europe must now be able to count on having effectivesupport from the United States and Canada from the very outset ofa future war. At the opening of the Council&apos;s meeting in New Yorkin September it had at once become clear that the Governments ofthe United States and Canada had accepted the need for giving this assurance to Europe. The United States Secretary of State had putforward his plan for the creation of an integrated force for the defenceof Western Europe, and his proposal that for this purpose substantialUnited States forces should be stationed in Europe in time of peace.The United States Government were in fact prepared to shoulder their full share of responsibility for the defence of Europe. This was avery significant development in American policy, and one of verygreat importance and value to the United Kingdom. It was, however,based on a careful and realistic appreciation of European strategy.The Americans recognised that the battle for the defence of europe should be fought as far to the east as possible. This meant that it ought to be fought on German soil, and this in turn raised the questionwhat role Germany should play in the defence of Europe. the americans had reached the conclusion that the proper course wasto invite Germany to contribute units to an integrated army for thecommon defence of Europe. The Foreign Secretary said that he him-self accepted that conclusion; but, throughout the conversations in new York, the representatives of the French Government had declined to accept the principle of German participation in this Euro-pean defence force. They preferred the alternative approach of raising in Germany an effective force of armed police which might beused for defence purposes in an emergency. This proposition would,however, give rise to conflict with the Social Democrats in Germany,who were likely, to insist that a gendarmerie should be organised and used for the sole purpose of maintaining law and order withinGermany and that any German contribution towards european defence should be made separately and openly by raising army units for purposes of external defence.The Foreign Secretary said that the problem was largely one of timing. He sympathised with the French feeling that the pace and extent of German rearmament should be kept in step with the progress made by other Western European countries in raising and equippingforces for their common defence, and also with the arrival in Europeof forces from North America. At the same time he was most anxiouslest the invaluable offer of North American assistance in the defenceof Europe should be withdrawn by reason of French reluctance toaccept the corollary of German rearmament. The offer had beenmade conditional upon this and, because of the attitude of the FrenchGovernment, it was now in suspense. It would be a tragedy if this great opportunity were lost by reason of French reluctance to acceptthe lesser of the risks which Europe was now facing. He therefore proposed that further pressure should be brought to bear on t1-?French Government, and he laid before the Cabinet the draft o a message which he proposed to send to M. Schuman through HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris.The Minister of Defence said that French Ministers had fromthe outset taken the line that they could not agree to any rearmamentof Germany until further progress had been made with the strength-ening and re-equipping of their own forces.   This, he thought, was
still their position and it would be difficult to dislodge them from it.It was, as the Foreign Secretary had said, a question of timing. If theFrench could be brought to realise that effective steps would in fact be taken in the near future to strengthen the forces of the other Euro-pean Powers, they might be persuaded to accept the principle thatGermany should participate in the common defence of Europe. Theywould certainly be readier to accept this if the French Ministers ofDefence and Finance received, in their forthcoming visit to washington, satisfactory assurances of American aid, in money andequipment, for the strengthening of the French forces. Meanwhileshould we be wise to reject altogether the alternative of building upa strong police force in Western Germany? In the recent conversa-tions which the three Defence Ministers had held in New York, theFrench had readily accepted the detailed proposals for the creation ofsuch a force and, indeed, all the other proposals for German contri-butions towards Europe&apos;s defence needs with the single exception ofthe creation of army units. With this in view he suggested that some adjustment should be made in the argument of the fourth paragraphin the draft telegram to Paris which had been circulated by theForeign Secretary.Finally, the Minister pointed out that everything that the foreign secretary had said emphasised the importance of the meeting of theDefence Committee of the North Atlantic Council which was to beheld in New York on 25th October. Hitherto there had been muchdiscussion but, with the exception of the United Kingdom, none ofthe European Powers had made any practical contribution towardsthe common defence of Europe. At the next meeting each Govern-ment should state what contribution it was ready to make, and theCommittee should show that effective practical steps would now betaken to build up forces capable of the tasks before them.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The wording of paragraph 4 of the draft telegram to Parisshould be reconsidered. As it stood, this paragraph might be thought to be inconsistent with the detailed proposals in par graph 5.(b) Paragraph 5 of the draft telegram proposed that there shouldbe no German army units larger than a division. It might help tomeet French susceptibilities if the largest permitted unit was a brigade.Alternatively, it might be preferable to make no reference to themaximum size of the units. The French were more likely to be impressed by the proposal that the German contribution to the inte-grated force should be limited to a fixed percentage of the total.(c) Substantial concessions had been made in the relaxation ofAllied control over Germany, described in CP. (50) 222. It was reasonable that, in return for these, the Government of western germany should accept some obligation to contribute towards thecommon defence of Europe.The Cabinet-(1) Took note with approval of the relaxations in Allied controlover Germany, outlined in CP. (50) 222.(2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s report (CP. (50) 223) onthe conversations in New York regarding German partici-pation in the common defence of Europe.(3) Agreed that further pressure should be brought to bear onthe French Government to accept in principle the incor-poration of German army units in an integrated force forthe defence of Europe; and invited the Foreign Secretaryto instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Paris accordingly,on the lines of the draft telegram which he had circulated,subject to further consideration of the wording of para--   graph 4 of the draft.
4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the difficul-ties encountered in securing the passage of the latest resolution onKorea by the United Nations Assembly. It was unfortunate that,despite all the efforts made, the Indian Government had not felt ableto support the resolution. He believed that there was insufficientfoundation for their apprehension that China or Russia might thereby be provoked into active intervention. He understood that united nations forces had not yet crossed the 38th Parallel in strength, andhe was suggesting that the President of the United Nations Assemblymight issue a further appeal to the North Koreans to abandon activeresistance.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th October, 1950.Korea.(previous reference:CM.
