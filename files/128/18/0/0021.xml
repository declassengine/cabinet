CABINET 61 (50)Industrial disputes london Gas Strike.Korea    ......contents subject
1. The Minister of Labour reported the latest developments inthe unofficial strike of maintenance men employed by the NorthThames Gas Board. The Confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions, who represented these men, had presented ontheir behalf a claim for a wage increase of A\d. an hour and had accepted a settlement of l^d. an hour: the men had staged thisunofficial strike in an attempt to secure their full claim. The Con-federation had asked that efforts at conciliation should be conductedthrough them; but the London District Committee of the confederation-tion, through which the Confederation itself and the Ministry ofLabour would then have to work, was dominated by Communists.The Ministry were now in direct touch with the amalgamated engineering Union and other constituent unions: they were alsoasking the Gas Board whether Service men could carry on the main-tenance work at the gas works and what risk there was that their introduction would lead to a sympathetic strike by the men engaged on the production of gas.The Attorney-General said that he was considering whether pro-ceedings could be brought against those members of the unofficialStrike committee who had themselves broken their contracts ofemployment by coming out On strike. He would wish to knowwhether there were any political and other considerations which heshould bear in mind before taking a decision; and he was in touchwith the Home Secretary and Minister of Labour on this point.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements made by the Minister of Labourand the Attorney-General.(2) Invited the Attoney-general before instituting any criminal proceedings, to afford the Cabinet an opportunity to bring to his attention any factors which he should bear in mindbefore taking a final decision.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (50) 215) covering copies of telegrams which he had exchangedwith the Foreign Secretary on the future settlement in Korea.The Prime Minister said that the United Nations Assembly oughtnow to consider the situation which might arise in the near futureif the North Korean armed forces were virtually destroyed and north korea was left in a state of chaos. It would be the d\ity of the united nations to restore peace and order in the country as a whole, and toestablish an independent Democratic Government for all Korea. Itmight well be necessary for United Nations forces to enter north korea for the purpose of achieving these objectives. The draft resolution which the Foreign Secretary had prepared was designedto meet that situation. Since the original text was received a numberof amendments had been telegraphed from New York and a revisedtext incorporating these (subsequently circulated as CP. (50) 216) was handed round as a basis for the Cabinefs discussion.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) If the United Nations forces destroyed the North Koreanforces, but did not enter North Korea, Russia might occupy north korea or anarchy might ensue. In either event it would be impos-sible to establish a stable administration south of the 38th Parallel.The United Nations had always desired that the artificial distinctionbetween North and South Korea should be abolished, and world opinion was likely to accept the unification of Korea as a desirableobjective. There was general agreement that military operationscould not be stopped at the 38th Parallel. It would, however, benecessary to present clearly to public opinion the reasons justifyinga military occupation of the whole of Korea, its temporary character and its limited objectives.
(b) The Attorney-General said that, in strict law, the general assembly was probably not entitled to make recommendations aboutKorea while the matter was still in the hands of the Security Council.He recognised, however, that this was an occasion on which the actionof the Assembly should be guided by the wishes of the great majorityof the Member States.(c) The Indian Government would find difficulty in supporting the proposed resolution, if only because the People&apos;s Government ofChina were likely to take strong exception to it. They might, how-ever, refrain from violent opposition to it if the arguments in favourof it were put forcibly to them. The Canadian Government hadtaken a legalistic point that the elections already held in South Koreawere valid for the whole country, but they might be dissuaded from pressing this. The other members of the Commonwealth were likelyto support the action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.(d) It was desirable that the resolution should provide morespecifically for the establishment of a United Nations civil administra-tion in Korea between the initial period of military government andthe establishment of a fully democratic Korean regime. It mightbe some time before free elections could be held, and it was therefore important that a civil administration should be set up alongside themilitary forces required for the maintenance of law and order.(e) The Foreign Secretary should also be asked to delete fromthe resolution the reference to consultation with the Economic and social Council on the economic rehabilitation of Korea. The council was not due to meet until the beginning of 1951 and, if this question was referred to them, they were likely to suggest the use of the South-East Asia Economic Commission which had shown itself to be some-what extravagant and inefficient. It was preferable that the united nations should make other arrangements for the preparation of a programme of economic and technical assistance to Korea.(/) The United Kingdom Government should be represented onany Committee or Commission set up to investigate the economic assistance required by Korea, since it would be necessary to ensurethat the burden of providing assistance was shared with othermembers of the United Nations, including those which had not provided military forces for the operations in Korea.(g) If the United Nations forces had to proceed beyond the38th Parallel, it would not be practicable to stipulate that UnitedKingdom forces should not go with them. It was, however, desirablethat any continuing United Kingdom commitment in Korea shouldbe as small as possible. Guerilla warfare might continue for aconsiderable time, and it was important that this country, with itscommitments in Malaya and elsewhere, should not become committed to playing a substantial part in a prolonged process of pacification.The Cabinet (1) Approved,the revised draft resolution and recommendations to be put before the General Assembly (CP. (50) 216)subject to amendments designed to meet the points referred to in paragraphs (d) and (e) above.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Foreign Secretaryaccordingly and to arrange for the despatch of a message from the Foreign Secretary to the Prime Minister ofIndia expressing his personal hope that the Governmentof India would support the resolution and recommenda-tions.Cabinet Office, SWA,26th September, 1950.
