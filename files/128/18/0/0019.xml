1. The Cabinet considered three telegrams from the foreign secretary (New York telegrams 1005, 1009 and 1010 of 14th Septem-ber, 1950) reporting further discussions of German participation in western defence which had taken place in the tripartite talks in new york. The United States Secretary of State had stressed the needfor conducting a successful defence of Europe as far to the East aspossible, to avoid German potential falling into Russian hands. Forthis purpose he sought acceptance of the participation of Germanunits, not as a German National Army, but as a section of an integrated force for the defence Of freedom in Europe. In para-graph 8 of New York telegram 1009 Mr. Acheson was reported asemphasising that the three Governments should not adopt a negative attitude to the German Chancellor^ enquiry about Western defence,but should say that they were ready to discuss what Germany could do; ahd that accordingly a decision-in principle should be taken,which could not  however, be put into effect for some time.Mr. Acheson Was anxious (paragraph 10 of TMew York telegram1009) to be able to state at the meeting of the North Atlantic council which would be held later on the same day (Friday) that the threeForeign Ministers had considered the German Chancellors com-muhicatibh about German&quot; participation in defence, and that theywere favourably disposed to this, though discussion with the germans and between the United States, Great Britain and France would benecessary before any indication could be given how and when Ger-mari participation would be achieved. The French Foreign minister had stressed the point that North Atlantic rearmament should reach a sufficient scale before German rearmament began, and had suggested that the immediate steps to be taken were to increase theGerman police force, to press ort with German labour units and tocreate an international legion in which Germans might volunteer.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Little difficulty was seen in reaching in present circumstancesan agreement in principle that at some future time, under conditionswhich had still to be worked out, German units should be includedin a Western European force to be built up to meet the threat ofRussian aggression; The real difficulties were concerned with the timing of any announcement and the form which German participa-tion in defence should take. It was clearly desirable that the western european countries other than Germany should build up their forcesbefore substantial German military assistance was recruited. Only inthis way could French public opinion be brought to accept the idea ofGerman reamament. It was also important to avoid any suggestionthat the North Atlantic Treaty countries were wooing the germans and so enable the Germans to impose conditions. The reply to besent to the Foreign Secretary should stress the need for Frenchagreement to what was to be said.(b) It appeared to be clear from the terms of the telegrams that united States agreement on financial assistance to the United King-dom defence programme would be linked with the attitude which thiscountry adopted to German participation in Western defence. Anearly decision was required about the form of United States assis-tance, in order that adequate progress could be made with the UnitedKingdom defence programme.(c) It was also important to secure German participation in thesupply programme since, if she were not substantially engaged onproductive work in connection with rearmament, Germany might very well capture many of the export markets which this country was having to drop under present circumstances.,(d) Although the United States Administration were only seekingat this stage agreement in principle to the creation of German militaryunits, it was clear that there would be great pressure for furtherpractical measures to be taken within the next few months. A gooddeal of the discussion between the three Foreign Ministers had alreadyappeared in the American press, and the United States Secretary of-2 b 2
State had made it clear that Congress would expect steps to be taken at the earliest possible moment. v   r     -(e) The proposal that German units, should participate in western defence, not as a German National Army, but as a sectionof an integrated force, raised problems of law and organisation which had still to be worked out. It might not be found practicable to proceed otherwise than through the creation of German forcesresponsible to German authorities.(/) The details of the German Chancellor^ communication tothe three Foreign Ministers about German participation in defencewere not yet available to the Cabinet, although the details were clearly important since the extent to which Germany was preparedto co-operate in these arrangements vitally affected the final form which they could take. The United States Government were apt to talk as though .it was for the North Atlantic Treaty Powers todetermine the extent and form of German participation in western defence, whereas an entirely new situation would be created if anyendeavour were made to go beyond what the Germans were them-selves prepared to do.(g) To some extent the United States Government appeared tobe endeavouring once more to commit this country to firm commit-ments -without a clear indication of the extent of the commitments which the United States was prepared to undertake. Not only wasthe financial position still unsettled, but it was not clear to what extent the United States were in fact prepared to participate in the landdefence of Western Europe.The Cabinet-Invited the Prime Minister to inform the Foreign secretary that the United Kingdom Government--(i)Were in general agreement to an acceptance in prin-cipie ,of German participation in Western defence,oh the linesrand subject to the conditions outlined by Mr. Acheson in the last three sentences of para-graph 8 of new York telegram 1009, viz., that thenext stage was exploration with the German Govern-ment.&quot;&apos;.. Importance&apos; was&apos;,! attached to the greatestpracticable extent of French concurrence. The firstdevelopment should be the enlargement of the, gendarmerie.(u^ Considered that in any statement in the atlantic council about German armed forces, on the linesoutlined by Mr. Acheson in paragraph 10 of new york telegram 1009, the subject should not be pre-sented in such a way as to suggest that the Atlanticcountries were wooing the Germans.strategic exports toEasternEurope.(previous reference:CM. (50) 57thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet discussed the terms of a Government amend-ment to a motion to be moved by the Opposition on 18th Septemberasking that the export to Eastern Europe of goods of strategic valueshould be prohibited.It was agreed that the Government amendment should begin byindicating the intention to stop, in all appropriate leases, the export to Eastern Europe of goods which were likely td be required for thedefence programmes of the United Kingdom, the rest Of the Common-wealth, or other North Atlantic Treaty Powers, and to continue, andif necessary extend, the controls oh the export of materials of military(rather than &quot; strategic&quot;) value. The amendment could thenconclude by indicating the intention to maintain trade with eastern european countries &quot; to our mutual benefit.&quot;
There was then some discussion about the main1 issues which were likely to be raised in the course of the debate:  (a) The Opposition would probably ask for a clearer indicationthan they had received so far of the Governments intentions regardingthe export to Eastern Europe of equipment of military value orderedbefore February 1949 which was not required for Western defence programmes. It would be said that it was not enough for equipment to be held back if it was required by the democracies, but that regard should also be had to the need to avoid facilitating the Russian arma-ment drive. In reply it could be pointed out that, in the generalcircumstances preceding February 1949 this country had quiteproperly entered into the production of equipment for Eastern europe which had a strategic value, and that the general policy would be to requisition any equipment which was needed or might be needed for western defence. Although the point could not be developed inthe debate, it was also true that Departments were inducing manu-facturers to go slow on orders for Eastern Europe placed beforeFebruary 1949 which were likely to be of value to the war potential of the Soviet bloc.(b) The two big jig borers, under manufacture by Messrs. CravenBros., for Poland, would probably be treated as a symbol of theGovernments general intentions, and an endeavour should be madeto decide finally before the debate whether or not the machines shouldbe exported to Poland. At least one of these machines would be ofconsiderable value in carrying out this country&apos;s rearmament pro-gramme; but under the terms of the trade agreement with Poland theUnited Kingdom Government had undertaken to place no obstacles in the way of the delivery of goods then under contract. The viewsof the Law Officers were being sought on the legal position, and itwas desirable that at their next meeting the Cabinet should have thefull facts before them so as to be able to take a firm decision.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government amendment to the opposition motion on the export of war materials should be in theterms agreed in the course of the Cabinets discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Supply, in consultation with the Law Officers, to submit a memorandum for consideration by the Cabinet at their meeting on 18th September on the question whether thetwo big jig borers under manufacture by Messrs. CravenBros, should be exported to Poland.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th September, 1950.
