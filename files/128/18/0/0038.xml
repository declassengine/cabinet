1. The Cabinet were informed that on the previous day general macarthur had reported to the United Nations that organised Chineseforces of an aggregate strength of over 200,000 men were arrayed76th against the United Nations forces in Korea, which &quot;now faced an. entirely new wax.&quot; This situation, he had added, posed issues which) i were beyond the authority of his military command and called for; a political solution. In the Security Council the United States repre-sentative had denounced the Chinese action as open aggression; andthe representative of the Chinese Peopled Government had repliedwith an intransigent attack upon American imperialism. From thelatest messages from His Majesty&apos;s representatives in Washington andNew York it appeared that the intervention of these Chinese troopsin Korea had not been provoked by the latest movements of theUnited Nations forces, and went beyond anything necessary for the limited purpose of protecting the hydro-electric installations or thefrontier zone. It seemed clear that the Chinese had mounted a majoroffensive, with a large body of organised troops, with the aim of destroying the United Nations forces in Korea. His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington had also reported that the State Depart-ment were of opinion that a charge of aggression must now bebrought, in the Security Council, against the Chinese communist government.The Foreign Secretary said that, on receipt of these reports, hehad at once communicated with the United States Government. Hehad been apprehensive that American military opinion might favoursome precipitate action: in particular, he had been concerned lestGeneral MacArthur should press his previous request for authority to launch air attacks on military targets beyond the Manchurian frontier.In reply to his enquiries he had that morning received a personal message from the United States Secretary of State containing assur-ances which were satisfactory so far as they went. Mr. Acheson had assured him that he would continue to consult closely with the UnitedKingdom Government and to bear in mind the special interest ofthose nations which had contributed to the United Nations forces in korea. He had also said that the United States Government intendedto handle the situation through the United Nations and not unilater-ally. Their purpose would remain the same, namely, to resistaggression, to localise the area of hostilities and to settle the Koreanproblem on a satisfactory United Nations basis in such a way as toavoid committing large United Nations forces indefinitely in these operations. The Foreign Secretary said that he endorsed these purposes. Though Chinese aggression must be resisted, he would strongly deprecate any move to carry hostilities into Manchuria. Ifwe had to fight the Chinese, it was much better, from both thepolitical and the military point of view, that we should do so in north korea.The Foreign Secretary said that his conclusion was that, althoughthe situation was serious, it was not out of hand. But these develop-ments in Korea called for even greater vigilance in Europe; and theCabinet should be alive to the risk that Allied preoccupation with theFar East might provide opportunities for those who were anxious tomake trouble in Austria and Berlin.The Prime Minister said that it was of the first importance thatthe United Nations should not be trapped into diverting a disproportionately-portionate effort to the Far East. Their operations in Korea had beenimportant as a symbol of their resistance to aggression; but Koreawas not in itself of any strategic importance to the democracies andit must not be allowed to draw more of their military resources away from Europe and the Middle East. General MaeArthur had been over-optimistic about the course of the campaign; and the check whichhe had suffered might lead him to exaggerate the strength of thisChinese attack. It was therefore the more important that Govern-ments should avoid any precipitate action at the present stage.
In discussion anxiety was expressed about the potential dangers of the Korean situation, and the Cabinet were informed that therewas a good deal of uneasiness among Government supporters whichmight be reflected in the foreign affairs debate in the House ofCommons which was to open that afternoon. The cabinets discussion turned mainly on the following points:  (a) Public opinion in this country was distrustful of GeneralMacArthufs intentions. For some time past he seemad to havebeen anxious to obtain authority to launch air attacks beyond theManchurian frontier; and there was a grave danger that in presentcircumstances he might take some action which would involve theUnited Nations forces in full-scale hostilities against China. TheUnited States Government seemed unable to exercise close controlover him, and the other Governments which had contributed con-contingents to the United Nations forces in Korea had no effective meansof influencing his conduct of the military operations. The UnitedKingdom proposal for the creation of a de-militarised zone in north korea had not been favourably received by the United States Govern-ment; and there seemed little doubt that this was due to the fact thatit was inconsistent with military plans already formulated by general macarthur.As against this, it was pointed out that General MacArthur had won great credit in this country for the speed with which he hadrouted the North Korean forces after he had broken out from the perimeter at Pusan; and it should not be hastily assumed that thewhole of that credit had been dissipated by the check which he had suffered in the last few days. Governments could not expect to intervene in the day-to-day conduct of military operations: thesemust be left to the military commander, so long as he kept within thelimits of the political directives issued to him. And, on questions of major policy, the United States Government had not failed to consult with the other Governments which had contributed contingents tothe United Nations forces in Korea. It was easy to criticise themilitary commander; but were we prepared to ask the United StatesGovernment to relieve General MacArthur of his command?(b) It would probably be suggested in the debate that the UnitedStates were handling the Korean operations as though they were a United States, rather than a United Nations, matter and were not taking sufficient account of the views of the United Kingdom Govern-ment and other Governments associated with them. Should we notbe adopting a firmer attitude in our dealings with the United StatesGovernment over this, and demanding that fuller account should betaken of our views?In reply it was pointed out that the United States Governmenthad riot failed to consult us on issues of major policy; and that, asthey were providing the greater part of the forces in Korea, we couldnot expect any larger voice than we had in the conduct of the militaryoperations. Moreover, it was unreasonable to blame the UnitedStates for the situation which had now arisen in Korea. We had fully supported the proposal that the United Nations forces should advancebeyond the 38th Parallel, despite India&apos;s warning that this would pro-voke Chinese intervention. We, as well as the Americans, had taken the risk of proceeding on the assumption that the Chinese would notin fact fulfil their threat. Finally, any strong divergence of policybetween ourselves and the Americans over the Far East would involvea risk of losing American support in Europe. The ultimate threat toour security came from Russia, and we could not afford to break ourunited front with the United States against our main potential enemy.(c) It was disquieting that the United States Government shouldbe thinking of bringing forward a resolution in the Security Councilcharging the Chinese with open aggression in Korea. This might involve full-scale military operations by United Nations forces againstChina, Such operations would involve us in a long-term commitment in the Far East, which would draw off large forces urgently requiredfor defence against Communist threats in Other theatres. Europe and
the Middle East would then be exposed to grave danger. Moreover,there was some reason to fear that, if the United Nations launched air attacks beyond the Manchurian frontier, Soviet aircraft would be usedin support of the Chinese forces; and.this might well precipitate a major war. In these circumstances it .was suggested that we should at once make it clear to the United States Government that, although we would be prepared to resist the Chinese offensive in Korea, weshould not be willing to agree that United Nations forces should operate beyond the Manchurian frontier either on land or in the air.Our policy should continue to be based on the principle that we hadno hostile intentions against China.On the other hand it was argued that in the last resort it wouldbe difficult to decline to support a United States resolution condemn-ing Chinese aggression. If we were to withdraw our support ^or united States strategy in the Far East, the United States Governmentwould be less willing to continue their policy of supporting the defenceof Western Europe; and, without their full assistance in Europe, wehad little chance of withstanding a Russian aggression there. Thewisest course would probably be to continue to resist the Chineseforces in Korea, but to seek to limit hostilities to Korea and refrain from any attacks beyond the Manchurian frontier. In that eventthere was perhaps some prospect that fighting in Korea wouldgradually come to an end if, as seemed likely, China&apos;s intervention was based mainly on considerations of self-defence and did not form part of Russia&apos;s world strategy.(d) Unless the military operations could be limited in this way,it was difficult to see how a long-term solution could be found.Negotiations must be undertaken with the Chinese People&apos;s Govern-ment at some stage. Was it not time to exchange views with theUnited States Government about a long-term settlement with China?(e) One of the main objectives of Russian policy was to provokedivergences of policy between the United Kingdom and United States.We should be playing into Russian hands if we allowed this adverseturn of events in Korea to be a cause of ill-feeling between ourselves and the Americans. We could not afford to lose America&apos;s support in Europe; and on that account we must be prepared, if necessary,to accept American leadership in the Far East.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in the light of their discussion, what representations he should make to theUnited States Government regarding the conduct of thediscussions in the Security Council on China&apos;s intervention in Korea.Germaay.soviet proposal for meeting of council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 73rdConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the statement which he was proposing to make, in the debate on foreign affairs inthe House of Commons later that day, about the Soviet proposal foran early meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.In discussion the view was expressed that the anxieties ofGovernment supporters about the international situation would beincreased if the Government gave the impression that they were adopting a negative attitude towards this proposal of the SovietGovernment. The Foreign Secretary would, be able to say thatarrangements had now been made for officials representing theForeign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States andFrance to meet in London during the following week to consider what further reply should be sent to the Soviet proposal. As, however,some weeks had already passed since that proposal was put forward,it was desirable that the Foreign Secretary should explain that thisinterval had been occupied by necessary consultations with the other two Governments. It would also be useful if he could stress the readiness of the United Kingdom Government to seek a settlementof outstanding world problems by negotiation, and make it clear that
the Government, while they were unable to agree that the CouncilOf Foreign Ministers should meet on the basis solely of the Praguecommunique, would be prepared to join iii FoUr-Power discussions onthe basis of a more comprehensive agenda.The Foreign secretary said thati while he was anxious to allay the anxieties of Government supporters, he must avoid using languagewhich would alarm the United States Government, who were atpresent disposed to. take a. somewhat stiffer, line in replying to theSoviet proposal for a Four-Power meeting. He could, however, in his speech that afternoon, go some way to meet the points which hadbeen made in the discussion-The Cabinet-invited the Foreign Secretary to take note of the views expressed in their discussion when referring, in his speech inthe HoUse of Commons that afternoon, to the Soviet pro-posal for a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th November, 1950.
