Mr. Peter 1.   The Prime Minister said that he had just received news thatEraser. Mr. Peter Fraser, the former Prime Minister of New Zealand, was seriously ill. *The Cabinet invited the Prime.Minister to arrange for a message to be sent to Mr. Fraser on their behalf expressing their sympathy and good wishes.Council of 2.  The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the ForeignEurope. Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (50) 236) on the Council of Europe.(Previous Further discussion showed that there was general support for reference: the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view that Ministers should not in future become. (50) 67th included in the United Kingdom delegation to the Assembly. As a conclusions, corollary, the Government must make it clear that they would notMinute 5.) regard themselves as bound by the Assembly&apos;s decisions. They mustComposition also take care to ensure that the Government supporters in the Unitedof United Kingdom delegation were aware of the general lines of GovernmentKingdom policy on the matters coming forward for discussion in the Assembly.Delegation. Ministers agreed that the delegation should not include personswho were not members of either House of Parliament. On occasionthere might be advantage in arranging for people with technical orspecialised knowledge to be available at meetings of the Assembly;but these should be advisers to the delegation, not members of it.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that Ministers should not in future be included inthe United Kingdom delegation to the Assembly of theCouncil of Europe.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom delegation should not include persons who were not members of either House ofParliament.Duplication Ministers recognised that, if the Council of Europe was to be with United found a useful field of work in such matters as full employment, socialNations security and scientific co-operation, it was inevitable that there shouldAgencies. be some degree of overlapping with the work of other international agencies. They took the view that this could be accepted, so longas the Council of Europe continued to be excluded from the fieldcovered by the Organisation for European Economic Co-operation.It was, however, undesirable that the Council of Europe should buildup large staffs for this purpose. From this point of view it would be helpful if it could be arranged that the cost of such activities shouldnot be defrayed from the general budget of the Council, and also thatthe Assembly should not have power to launch such activities withoutthe approval of the Committee of Ministers.In this connection The Foreign Secretary said that some confusionmight have arisen from his use of the term &quot; specialised agencies &quot; inparagraph 17(4) of CP. (50) 236. What he there had in mind was, notorganisations comparable to the specialised agencies of the united nations, but arrangements made by two or more European countries for the joint conduct of a common service, possibly on the model ofthe Schuman plan for the integration of the coal, iron and steel indus-tries of Europe. For the reasons given in paragraphs 10-12 of his memorandum he thought that it should now be made clear that, if other European Governments wished to make such arrangements, theUnited Kingdom Government had no intention of using theunanimity rule for the purpose of preventing them, even though they represented a move in the direction of federalism in Europe. TheUnited Kingdom Government only wished to reserve their right todecide whether, and if so how, the United Kingdom should be asso-ciated with such arrangements. Here again, it should be made clearthat activities of this kind would fall to be financed otherwise than from the general budget of the Council of Europe.
In discussion there was general agreement that the attitude of theUnited Kingdom Government towards the growth of federalism inEurope should &apos;be made more clear on the lines indicated in cp. (50) 236. Special efforts should also be made to correct theimpression, which was gaining ground in the Council of Europe, thatno one could be a good European who did not favour the promotion of federalism in Europe.The Cabinet (3) Endorsed the proposals in paragraphs 17(3) and (4) and 19(2)of CP. (50) 236, on the understanding that the foreign secretary would seek to secure that any such activities were financed otherwise than from the general budget ofthe Council of Europe, that every effort would be made toavoid unnecessary duplication of the work of other inter-national agencies, and that the Assembly would not be free to pursue such activities without the approval of the Com-mittee of Ministers.Convention on        It was recommended in paragraph 19(1) of CP. (50) 236 that the human Rights. United Kingdom Government should accept the draft Convention on(Previous       Human Rights in the form in which it had been approved by the reference:      Committee of Ministers. This meant that the Government would notCM. (50) 52nd accept the provision for individual right of petition, or the jurisdictionConclusions,    of the proposed European Court of Human Rights, or the furtherMinute 3.)       amendments which the Assembly had made in the draft after itsapproval by the Committee of Ministers. In discussion some concernwas expressed about the possible implications of accepting this Con-vention; and the point was made that this was an instance ofduplication between the Council of Europe and the United Nations,since draft Conventions on this subject had been under preparationby both bodies simultaneously. The Cabinet were, however, informedthat the Prime Minister had already discussed with the LordChancellor and other Ministers directly concerned the detailedcriticisms of the draft Convention; and that as a result the LordChancellor had agreed, with some misgivings, that it was politicallynecessary for the Government to accept, this Convention subject tothe reservations proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (4) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to accept the draft Conven-tion on Human Rights on the basis proposed in paragraph19(1) of CP. (50) 236.Reform of Further doubts were expressed about the wisdom of referring toConstitution. a committee of experts those of the Assembly&apos;s recommendations which affected the constitution of the Council. Was there not a grave risk that such a committee would recommend amendments whichwould not be acceptable to the Government, e.g., in the direction ofconferring greater powers on the Assembly? Was it clear that the officials who would represent the United Kingdom on such a com-mittee would be specially skilled in matters of procedure and constitution-making? Was there not a danger that, when the workof the experts was done, the Government would find themselves in aposition in which it would be politically embarrassing to oppose their&apos; recommendations? Would it not be preferable to take the line that,as the constitution had been in operation for little more than a year,it was premature to consider its reform? On the other hand, it was argued that our representatives on the proposed committee of expertswould be working under clear policy directions from the foreign secretary; and that, if they could not make their views prevail, theGovernment could decline to accept the committee&apos;s recommenda-tiOns. Amendment of the Council&apos;s constitution could be carried only by a unanimous vote.  It would be difficult for the Government to
take the line that proposals for amendment of the constitution shouldnot even be considered, when it was already clear that the constitutionwas not in fact working satisfactorily.The Cabinet (5) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to agree that such of theAssembly&apos;s proposals as involved amendment of the con-stitution of the Council should be referred for examinationto a committee of experts.The Cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal that theCommittee of Ministers should decline to accept the Assembly&apos;srecommendations for the creation of a European Army, on the groundthat the Assembly had no power under the constitution to discussdefence questions. It was vitally important that defence questions should not be handled by the Council of Europe. It was recognisedthat, if the Assembly chose to disregard the ruling of the Committeeof Ministers, it could not in practice be prevented from discussingdefence matters; but in that event the Government supporters in theUnited Kingdom delegation should withdraw from the discussion.There would be no difficulty in arranging this at the resumed sessionof the Assembly in November, when United Kingdom Ministers werepresent; and clear instructions would have to be given on this point to the Government supporters in the United Kingdom delegation to future sessions of the Assembly at which Ministers would not be present.The Cabinet-(6) Endorsed the recommendations in the Foreign Secretary^memorandum (CP. (50) 236) subject to the points noted in conclusions (2) and (3) above.(7) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth Governments of thegeneral line of policy which the United Kingdom Govern-ment were proposing to pursue towards the work of theCouncil of Europe.3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum bythe Minister of Food (CP. (50) 231) proposing the transfer of theBritish Sugar Corporation to public ownership. They also had beforethem a further memorandum by the Minister of Food (CP. (50) 241)explaining in what circumstances the Sugar Refining Agreement, 1937,could be brought to an end and whether compensation would haveto be paid to the private refiners if the Agreement were terminated.The Attorney-General said that he had examined the terms ofthe Sugar Refining Agreement in relation to the provisions of the sugar Industry (Reorganisation) Act, 1936, and of the Sugar industry act, 1942. The Agreement was for an indefinite period and wouldnot be ended either by the transfer of shares in the British sugar corporation to public ownership, or by the expiry of the Sugar Indus-try Act, 1942. The Act of 1942 provided that the Agreement mightbe modified by the Minister of Food, at the request of the parties, andsubject to the consent of the Treasury; but there was no formalprovision for cancellation. If it were decided to terminate the Agree-ment in the forthcoming legislation under a provision which gave, say,six months&apos; notice of cancellation, it would be in accord with pastpractice for compensation to be paid to the refiners and the amountcould be settled by arbitration. He understood that the agreement was not entirely one-sided, though the balance of advantage lay withthe refiners, and that it would be desired to retain some of its pro-visions, such as those relating to the amount and price of raw beetsugar which refiners undertook to buy. Accordingly, a modification
of the Agreement was required, rather than its abrogation. Onecourse would be to transform the British Sugar Corporation into apublic corporation, and then to leave it to negotiate for a fresh agree-ment, from the position of greater strength in which it would be placedas a result of the removal of the trade directors. Alternatively, theBill might provide that the Agreement was to terminate by a givendate unless the parties had previously agreed upon the respects inwhich it should be modified.The Minister of Food said that he was advised that the proposalto buy out the private shareholders and to transform the British sugar corporation into a public corporation was well worth proceeding with,irrespective of any action taken in regard to the Refining Agreement.He accordingly suggested that the Cabinet should decide to mentionin The King&apos;s Speech the Governmenfs intention to introduce legis-lation and should consider at a later stage how the modification of theRefining Agreement should be handled.The Cabinet first discussed whether the Minister^ proposals wouldenable effective public control to be exercised over the sugar industry.Although the Minister exercised detailed control over the corporation under the provisions of the Sugar Industry Act, 1942, the presence ofrepresentatives of the refiners on the board of directors, and theirlarge holdings of shares, gave the refiners a considerable voice in thesettlement of policy. The chairman of the board had indicated thatthe Minister would be in a stronger position in relation to the boardif it consisted entirely of Government nominees. The exact extentof the Minister^ control over any new public corporation would,however, depend on the detailed powers which he took in any legisla-tion and on the manner in which the Refining Agreement wasmodified.In regard to the Sugar Refining Agreement, it was pointed out thatthe needs of this country could not be met from the sugar beet grownin this country. This had to be supplemented by substantial importsof raw sugar from the West Indies and elsewhere which was refinedby Messrs. Tate and Lyle, who had a predominant position, and afew other companies. Since beet sugar was more expensive than canesugar, and its production had to be subsidised, it was necessaryto have an agreement with the refiners about the price and quantityof raw beet sugar which they would refine. The Refining Agreementof 1937, while it contained provisions which assisted the operations of the British Sugar Corporation, was undoubtedly more favourable to the refiners. The question whether compensation should be paidif the Agreement was modified to the detriment of the refiners andwithout their consent was a matter of policy rather than law. Itcould be argued that the Agreement was restrictive in character andthat, if it had been concluded between two private parties and hadbeen condemned by the Monopolies Commission, no question ofcompensation from the Exchequer would have arisen in the eventof its cancellation. At the same time, in previous socialisationlegislation, if contracts entered into by the undertakings socialisedwere modified to the detriment of third parties, this had been regardedas entitling those third parties to compensation. It might be practicable, as the Attorney-General had suggested, to end the Agree-ment without compensation if sufficiently long notice was given ofthe intention to terminate and the parties were afforded anopportunity to reach a compromise in the meantime.The Cabinet then discussed whether they should proceed withthe scheme outlined by the Minister of Food in C.P. (50) 231, orwhether the existing arrangements should be continued in force ona year-to-year basis until such time as the sugar industry as a wholecould be brought under public ownership. In favour of waiting untilthe whole industry could be socialised, it was argued that the produc-tion of sugar from beet and from imported materials was a closelyintegrated industry, and that attempts to bring part of the industry under national ownership would raise dirncuit problems of the
relationship of the public to the private sector which could not satis-factorily be solved under the limited proposals in CP. (50) 231. Agreat deal of time and effort would have to be spent on the modifica-tion of the Refining Agreement and on other unsatisfactorycompromises when the only wholly satisfactory course was to bringthe entire industry under public ownership. A compromise schemeof this kind would alienate the sugar refiners while disappointingthose who believed that the industry as a whole should be placed under public ownership.In favour of the proposals in CP. (50) 231, it was pointed outthat the socialisation of the entire industry would raise difficult problems about the scope of public ownership. Thus, should it cover the production overseas of cane, the importation of overseas supplies and the production of sugar beet? The transfer of the British sugar corporation to public ownership was a definite step in the directionof more effective public control over the sugar industry, and the modification of the Refining Agreement was overdue. There hadbeen no widespread support for a proposal to bring the entire industry under public ownership, but there would be general agreement thatthe 1936 constitution of the British Sugar Corportaion no longeraccorded with modern conditions. The refiners would receive no public support if they endeavoured to maintain, unmodified, theprivileged position which they had been given under the RefiningAgreement.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in Cabinet appeared to lie in favour of proceeding with the plan put forward by the Minister of Food in CP. (50) 231.The Minister of Health asked that it should be recorded thathe remained of the opinion that the preferable course would be to go forward at once with a comprehensive plan for bringing the wholeof the sugar industry under public ownership.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Minister ofFood in CP. (50) 231.(2) Agreed that The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament should include a reference to the Governments intentionto introduce legislation transferring to public ownershipthose shares in the British Sugar Corporation which werenot already held by the Government.4. The Attorney-General said that the Court of Inquiry whichhad been investigating the London printing dispute had now sub-mitted a report recommending the establishment of a national wagestructure in the industry. If the dispute was not settled as a resultof this report, he might find it difficult to refrain from institutingproceedings for breach of the National Arbitration and Conditionsof Employment Order. The Director of Public Prosecutions hadtaken counsel&apos;s opinion and had been advised that the workerscertainly, and the employers probably, were infringing that Order;and he might find it necessary to take proceedings against repre-sentatives of the employers as well as the workers.In a preliminary discussion it was suggested that, before reaching a decision on this point, the Attorney-General should consider the observations about the course of the dispute which had been includedin the report of the Court of Inquiry.The Cabinet Invited the Attorney-General to raise this matter again ata later meeting of the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.WA,24th October, 1950.industrial disputes.LondonPrintersStrike.(previous reference:CM.
