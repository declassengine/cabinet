Housing 1,  The Minister of Health said that he had been consideringProgramme. whether, in the debate on housing which was to take place in thePrevious House of Commons that afternoon, any reference should be made to reference: the possibility that the existing target of 200,000 houses a year mightCM. (50) 2lst be raised if a further increase could be secured in the productivity of conclusions, the building industry. He was anxious to avoid an impression of minute 2.)       undue rigidity in the size of the Governments housing programme.The Cabinet were reminded that, when they had modified on17th April the cut previously made in the housing programme, theyhad agreed that the programme should be stabilised for a period ofthree years at a completion rate of 200,000 houses a year, eventhough other parts of the capital investment programme had to bereduced in order to make this possible. This decision had assumedan annual increase of 3 per cent, in the productivity of the buildingindustry. Since then, the needs of the defence programme had addedanother  35 million of building work in 1951, with a prospect of even higher requirements in 1952; and something like a further 3 per cent,increase in productivity would be needed if this additional burdenwere to be carried without reducing other parts of the investment programme. These considerations, together with prospective short-ages of housing materials, made it unrealistic to suppose that therewas any early prospect of raising the housing target.The Cabinet agreed that the Government spokesmen in the debate should take the line that a programme of 200,000 houses ayear was the most that could be achieved in present circumstances.It was not, however, the maximum for all time; and, if circumstanceschanged for the better, the Government would reconsider the size ofthe programme.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to settle, in consultation with theMinister of Health and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the precise form of the statement to be made in the debate inthe House of Commons that afternoon regarding the size ofthe housing programme.Germany.Soviet Proposalfor Meetingof Council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 67thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. Following the Prague conference of Foreign Ministers ofRussia&apos;s satellite States in Eastern Europe, the Soviet Governmenthad now proposed an early meeting of the Council of foreign ministers to discuss the demilitarisation of Germany.The Foreign Secretary said that he was seeking agreement withthe Governments of the United States and France regarding the replyto be sent to this invitation. After consulting the Prime Minister hehad suggested to those Governments (in Foreign Office telegramNo. 4899 of 5th November) that an interim reply should at once besent which, while making it clear that the demilitarisation of germany was not the only outstanding issue between the Western Powers andthe Soviet Union, would indicate willingness to join in Four Powerdiscussions in the hope that these might remove the underlying causes of the present situation, so long as it was understood that an agenda for the meeting would be settled in advance and that the communique issued at the end of the Prague conference would not be taken as the sole basis for discussion. The Foreign Secretary contemplated thatthe Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom, the United States andFrance should then arrange for their deputies to draw up an agenda for the meeting, which would cover all the points on which the SovietGovernment had failed to fulfil their undertakings, or had actedarbitrarily, since the end of the war. When the deputies&apos; recommen-dations were available, a further communication could be sent to theSoviet Government, proposing that a meeting of the deputies of thefour Foreign Ministers should be held in the first instance to prepare the ground for an eventual meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.39641 b 2
The Foreign Secretary had just received the first reactions ofthe State Department towards his proposals for handling the Sovietinvitation. These were not very favourable. The State department were at present inclined to send an argumentative reply which would,by implication, reject the invitation offering merely to enter into negotiations when the Soviet Government had demonstrated &quot; by itsbehaviour and the character of its proposals a sincere desire to reachgenuine settlements.&quot; The views of the French Government werenot yet available.In the Cabinefs discussion there was general support for the line which the Foreign Secretary wished to take in replying to the Sovietinvitation.The Cabinet-Endorsed the views expressed in Foreign Office telegram to washington No. 4899 of 5th November, and invited theForeign Secretary to continue his attempts to persuade theGovernments of the United States and France to reply onthese lines to the Soviet proposal for a meeting of theCouncil of Foreign Ministers.China.(previous references:CM. (50) 55thConclusions,Minute 6 and cm. (50) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4.)intervention in Korea.Tibet.3. The Cabinet held a preliminary discussion about the possible consequences of Chinese intervention in Korea.They were informed that the United States Government werethinking of moving a resolution in the Security Council calling on all states to refrain from assisting the North Koreans. The foreign secretary, while agreeing that the situation should be promptlyreported to the United Nations and that all practicable steps shouldbe taken to restrain the Chinese Government from embroiling them-selves in the Korean conflict, was anxious to avoid any extension ofthe area of hostilities, such as might follow from the application ofUnited Nations sanctions against China.In discussion, there was general agreement that policy should bedirected towards avoiding a major conflict in the Far East. It was unfortunate that the Communist People&apos;s Government of China hadnot been admitted to the United Nations, since a Government recentlyadmitted to the General Assembly and the Security Council mighthave been more reluctant to intervene in Korea. Even at this stageit should be possible to meet any reasonable fears which China mighthave, without in any way weakening United Nations action againstNorth Korean aggression, by giving assurances, for example, in regardto the hydro-electric installations in Korea which served Manchuria.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would keep theminformed of developments in Korea.It was asked whether the Chinese invasion of Tibet was to bebrought to the notice of the Security Council.The Foreign Secretary said that he was relying on the indian government to keep him informed of developments in Tibet. TheHigh Commissioner for India was calling on him later in the day, andwould probably be aware of his Government&apos;s views on the questionwhether the situation should be reported to the Security Council.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations to keep in close consultationwith the Indian Government regarding the situation inTibet.
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 259) asking whether there were any political considerations, whether international or domestic, which he should bear in mind in deciding whether to bring proceedings for treasonagainst those responsible for propaganda conducted by the daily worker in support of the Communist cause in Korea. They also had before them a further note by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 260)setting out the terms of a Parliamentary Question by Mr. E. Thurtle,M.P., for answer on 20th November, on the question whether the law of treason covered adequately the circumstances in which the UnitedKingdom Government was waging war as a member of the united nations.The Attorney-General said that Lt.-Colonel Bromley-Davenport,M.P., had drawn attention to a pamphlet, published by the daily worker and entitled &quot; I Saw the Truth in Korea,&quot; which made graveallegations against the South Koreans and American soldiers and airmen and attacked the United Kingdom Government for then-support of United Nations action in Korea. He had little doubt thatthis publication gave &quot; aid and comfort to The King&apos;s enemies &quot; andso constituted treason, but he was reluctant to bring against the authoror publishers a charge of treason, for which the only penalty wasdeath.In discussion it was pointed out that other newspapers and periodicals had published information about alleged atrocities bySouth Koreans, and there was little doubt that the Koreans on bothsides had conducted the war in a barbarous fashion. It would, there-fore, be said that the author and publishers of this pamphlet werebeing prosecuted because of its political bias. There was also a risk that a jury, knowing that the penalty was death, would refuse toconvict. Even if a conviction was obtained, this would be regardedas a Government prosecution and it might be thought anomalous thatthe Home Secretary should thereafter advise The King to commutethe only sentence which the court could impose.In further discussion the view was expressed that, as the Koreanconflict now seemed likely to be continued for a time and as similarsituations might arise elsewhere, the Cabinet should reconsider thedesirability of introducing the Overseas Operations (Security of forces) Bill. No public statement should be made at this stage tothe effect that the Government were considering the introduction of fresh legislation on this subject; but the Cabinet should reach adecision on the point before Mr. Thurtle&apos;s Question had to be answered on 20th November.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Attorney-General to take note of the views expressed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion on the political andother objections to the institution of proceedings fortreason in respect of Daily Worker propaganda regardingthe Korean campaign.(2) Invited the Lord President to bring before the Cabinet at anearly date the question whether the Overseas Operations(Security of Forces) Bill should be introduced in thepresent Session of Parliament.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary and the Colonial Secretary (CP. (50) 249) indicating the lines on which a modus vivendi might be reached regarding rela-tions with the Yemen. A final settlement was unlikely to be securedbecause of the refusal of the Yemenis to abate their claims in the aden Protectorate.The Cabinet-Approved the conclusion of an agreement on the linesoutlined in paragraph 6 of CP. (50) 249.
Coal.(previous reference:CM. (50) 70thConclusions,Minute 4.)Exports.(previous reference:CM. (50) 56thConclusions,Minute 10.)Short-term measures.6.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda: -CP. (50) 252; by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, submit-ting the recommendations of the Production Committee for areduction in coal exports;CP. (50) 253: by the Foreign Secretary, indicating theserious consequences which would follow if the United Kingdomfailed to retain its position as a coal-exporting country;CP. (50) 254: by the Minister of Fuel and Power, regardingthe steps which might be taken to increase the production and reduce the inland consumption of coal during the next few years.The Cabinet had also before them copies of memoranda on coal supplies in the coming winter (CP. (50) 255 and 256) which had beensubmitted to the Production Committee by the Minister of Fuel and power.The Foreign Secretary said that he Was gravely concerned aboutthe effect which any breach of our coal contracts would have on publicopinion in foreign countries generally. More specifically, if our coal exports to Europe were reduced and if German coal was used verylargely within Germany and did not afford a surplus for export, therewas a danger that Western Europe would become unduly dependenton Polish coal, and it would then be open to Russia to cause wide-spread industrial dislocation by inducing Poland to stop these exports.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the Government had agreed upon a figure of coal exports which took an optimistic viewof output and a pessimistic view of home consumption. In fact, theoutput of deep-mined coal had fallen well below what had been expected and the output of opencast coal had been affected by bad weather. At the same time internal consumption of coal had risenconsiderably. It would be impossible to avoid a grave fuel crisis ifexports were not reduced.In discussion it was pointed out that the increased inlandconsumption was due in part to the demand of exporting industries such as steel and cement. On a long-term view it was better to beexporting finished products rather than raw coal; but there remained the long-term problem of providing many parts of Europe with the fuel they required, and the short-term problem of the threatenedbreach of contracts with importing countries. A committee of officials had studied the manner in which the short-fall should be distributed among coal-importing countries with whom this country had con-tracts; and they had paid regard to the terms of commercialagreements, to the current commercial negotiations which might be jeopardised, and to the extent to which these countries could bear theloss of coal imports because of the stocks which they held. It wassuggested that regard should also be paid to the factor of oil substitu-tion, since South America, for example, might be better able thanScandinavia to bear a cut in coal imports if additional supplies of fuel oil were made available.The Cabinet-(1) Endorsed the decisions of the Production Committee, set outin CP. (50) 252, relating to the reduction in coal exports.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was gravely con-cerned about the reduction in man-power and the fall which was taking place in output per man-shift of deep-mined coal. If presenttendencies continued, there might be a shortage of between 800,000and 900,000 tons, as compared with the target set in the winter coalbudget.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the immediate prospect was serious and there were not many measures which couldbe taken to mitigate it. Many of these concerned more than one department; and, with the agreement of the Minister of Fuel and
Power, he proposed that a small committee of senior officials shouldbe constituted, under the chairmanship of the Chief Planning Officer,to examine those proposals requiring interdepartmental action whichhad been made for increasing output and to keep under review the impact of prospective coal supplies on the Governments economic policies, both domestic and overseas.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) The Ministry of Fuel and Power had estimated that doublebunkering would save between 200,000 and 300,000 tons of coal inthe remainder of the coal year. The proposed official committeeshould scrutinise this estimate to see whether further savings couldnot be made by this means. They should also consider whether therewere not sufficient stocks in Service and other coal depots at homeand abroad to allow of a curtailment of supplies during the next fewmonths.(b) As a long-term measure, the mining of coal in Africa and inother Colonial territories should be examined again. It might well bethat Western Europe was now faced with a permanent reduction in coal output which would have to be redressed by productionelsewhere.The Cabinet (2) Approved the appointment of an official committee, underthe chairmanship of the Chief Planning Officer, to assistthe Minister of Fuel and Power in carrying throughmeasures for securing an increased output of coal which require co-operation by other Departments, and to keep under review the impact of prospective coal supplies onthe Governments economic plans.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations to submit to the Cabinet a memorandum on the development of coal-mining in Africa and in other overseas territories.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,&apos;  6th November, 1950.
