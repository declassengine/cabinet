Mr. Memzfes. 1.   The Prime Minister said that the members of the cabinet were very glad to have this opportunity of meeting the Prime Ministerof Australia, whom they knew as an old friend of this country bothin peace and in war. They would welcome the opportunity to takecounsel with him at any time; but his visit to London was speciallyopportune at the present moment, when the situation in the Far east was causing anxiety both here and in Australia.MilitarySituation.Korea. 2.   The Chiefs of Staff made a report to the Cabinet on the latest(Previous       developments of the military situation in Korea.Reference: The general situation remained critical.   The Americans had. (50) 44th failed in their attempt to hold the line of the river Kum, and theirConclusious, line of withdrawal lay across the direction of the enemy&apos;s advance.Minute 1.) The South Koreans seemed, however, to be offering stronger resist-ance in the east; and this might make the withdrawal of the american troops a somewhat less dangerous operation than it would otherwise have been. The best that the Americans could now hope to achievewas to hold a bridgehead around Pusan until they were reinforced.But some weeks must elapse before reinforcements could arrive;and this would undoubtedly be a critical period.Of the American divisions deployed in Korea only three regiments(totalling about 12,500 men) had been actively engaged in these opera-tions. The latest official figures of United States casualties were42 killed, 196 wounded and about 250 missing. The explanation forthis relatively small scale of casualties was probably to be foundin the general pattern of the fighting American units had constantly-been compelled to fall back, without offering serious resistance, whenenemy forces broke through parts of the line held by South Koreanson their flank and threatened their positions from the rear. Althoughabout 75 per cent, of the American troops had no previous battleexperience, there was every reason to believe that their morale was good and that they had fought well. They had, however, been heavilyoutnumbered. Further, their anti-tank weapons had made little or no impression on the heavy Russian tanks with which the NorthKoreans were operating. Supplies of a heavier type of anti-tankweapon were now being sent from the United States.The efficiency shown by the North Korean forces was probably due to the facts that two of their divisions had been under trainingwith the Soviet army for some time, and that they had with thema Russian Military Mission totalling somewhere between 2,500 and3,000 men. The presence of these Russian advisers with the north korean forces in the field had been established by interrogation ofmembers of the North Korean forces who had been taken prisoner.There was, however, no evidence that any formed units of soviet troops were operating with the North Koreans, though there had recently been reports that jet-propelled Yak aircraft had been inaction and these may have been flown by Soviet pilots.There were no indications of any general disposition on the partof the civil population in South Korea to collaborate with the invadersNor were there any signs of anything like an international brigadefrom Communist China.In the air, the North Koreans were outnumbered. At the outset of the operations they had at their disposal 150 aircraft. The UnitedStates then had about 500 aircraft in Japan including the 77thSquadron of the Royal Australian Air Force, which had given avery good account of itself in the fighting and they had since receivedreinforcements, both of bombers and of fighters. Two aircraft carrierswere also available, one British and one American; and a thirdwould shortly arrive from the United States. Air operations had,however, been severely limited by the weather, as was shown by thefact that, despite the number of United States and Australian aircraftavailable, only 1,200 sorties were flown during the first three weeks of the operations. From this point of view the North Korean attack39186-1 b 2
had been well timed; in this ar^a July and August were the worstmonths of the year for operational flying; and no substantial increasein air operations could be expected until after the end of August.Aircraft had been used mainly in close support of ground troops,though bombers had been attacking communications behind the lines.Some attention had also been given to industrial targets, particularlyoil installations, in North Korea. In this connection The PrimeMinister said that, according to information given to him, the hydro-electric plants in North Korea were joint enterprises operated onbehalf of China as well as Korea; if this were so, air attack on theseplants might give the Chinese a pretext for intervention in Korea.The Chief of the Air Staff undertook to enquire into this point.At sea, there were signs of increased activity by Soviet submarines in the Far East. It was believed that there were now between 30and 40 Soviet submarines in these waters. The British and AmericanFleets in the Far East included about 40 destroyers or frigates; but,if the situation deteriorated, the presence of this large number of soviet submarines in this area might become a serious menace.Reinforce- The Cabinet were informed that the United States Marinements: Request Division could not reach Korea before the end of August. Earlyfrom Secretary- reinforcements could be secured only from troops already in theGeneral of Pacific area. The United States authorities had not, however, madeUnited Nations, any direct requests, through political or military channels, for British reinforcements. They had been expected to ask for assistance withsea transport, but they had not done so. And the United states naval authorities had informally stressed the importance of avoiding any weakening of our naval strength in Europe. As regards land forces, the Chiefs of Staff had hitherto taken the view that it wouldbe strategically unsound to divert to Korea troops which were re-quired to meet the other Communist threats in this area, in HongKong and Malaya. A suggestion had been made that British troopsmight be sent from Hong Kong to Korea, on the understanding thatthey would be replaced by the early despatch of United States troops to Hong Kong. Ministers thought that any such suggestion shouldbe discouraged: there would be political disadvantages in associatingthe United States with the defence of Hong Kong.Mr. Menzies said that it might similarly be suggested that use should be made of the Australian troops in Japan either by sendingthem to Korea, or by increasing the Australian garrison in Japanwith a view to releasing for service in Korea one of the two UnitedStates divisions still remaining in Japan. He would, however, depre-cate such a suggestion. The number of operational Australian troopsin Japan was very small; and the use of token forces in Korea was open to the strong objection that, unless they were placed under united States command and trained to use United States weapons,there would be formidable difficulties in providing a separate supplyorganisation for them. There were also legal difficulties, sinceAustralian troops could not be ordered to operate outside Australianorth of the Equator, and almost all of those now in Japan hadvolunteered specifically for that duty. They could not be ordered to go to Korea unless they volunteered individually to do so; andany reinforcements for Japan would have to be found from menvolunteering specially for the purpose. Further, it was urgently necessary that these men should return to Australia at the earliestpossible date, to form a nucleus for Australia^ regular forces andto train the men who were to be called up under the new arrange-ments for National Service. Apart from these particular difficulties,there was a broad strategic consideration which should not be over-looked. In his recent visit to Australia the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff had put forward the view that in a major war it wasin the Middle East that Australia could make her best contribution towards Commonwealth defence. The Australian Government had accepted that view as a basis for planning. We should now beplaying into Russia&apos;s hands if we allowed our immediate preoccupa-tions in the Far East to deflect us from our long-term strategy. And
there was a real risk that the despatch of Australian reinforcements to Korea at this stage might seriously increase the difficulties of persuading Australian public opinion to accept the major conceptionthat Australia^ main role in a major war would be played in theMiddle East.; Ministers then discussed the request for ground forces for usein Korea which the Secretary-General of the United Nations had made to member States. It was felt that this might prove embarrassing, in view of the publicity which had been given to it.Mr. Lie had, however, made it clear that his request had been made after consultation with United States authorities and it might be that,on political grounds, the United States Government had preferred that such a request should be made through United Nations channels.The Secretary-General of the United Nations had various obligations under the Charter, and he was doubtless endeavouring to keep in the forefront the extent to which the United Nations as a whole were involved in resisting aggression in Korea.Ministers agreed that it would be impossible to form a final view on Mr. Lie&apos;s request, or to frame an answer to it, until the UnitedStates Government had furnished the further information which theyhad promised to supply regarding the discussions between theirrepresentatives and Mr. Lie which had preceded his request.The Prime Minister recalled that on 4th July the Cabinet had agreed that the Governments of Hong Kong and Singapore shouldtake general powers to control the export of strategic goods, but had felt that the exercise of those powers against China might increasethe risk of local trouble by Communists in Hong Kong or mightinfluence the Chinese Government in deciding whether to attackHong Kong. At a later meeting, on 10th July, the Cabinet had authorised the Board of Trade to prevent the export of strategic goods from the United Kingdom to China. On 14th July, the DefenceCommittee had reviewed the question of exports from Hong Kongto China, and had decitied that the disadvantages of postponing theimposition of this control there outweighed the risks which theCabinet had previously had in mind. They had therefore authorised the Colonial Office to instruct the Governments of Hong Kong and singapore to stop the export of strategic goods to China.The Cabinet (1) Took note that instructions had now been given to stop the export of strategic goods to China from Hong kong and Singapore.The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 4th july the Cabinet had been informed that the amount of oil currentlysupplied to China by the Shell Oil Company was of negligibleimportance and that it would suffice for the present if the company were asked to refrain from supplying more than the normalquantities. Subsequently, however, evidence had been received thatthis oil was finding its way to North Korea; and the United StatesGovernment has expressed a strong hope that the Shell company would be required to suspend altogether its imports into China. On14th July the position had again been reviewed by the Defence Com-mittee, who considered that steps should now be taken to preventthe import of British oil into China. They had therefore authorised the Admiralty to intercept a tanker bound for Tientsin and toimpound her oil for naval purposes. They had also instructed theAdmiralty to pre-empt all British oil stocks in Hong Kong. Andthey had agreed that the International Co-ordinating Committee on security Export Control should be asked to add oil to the list of strategic exports which were now being denied to China, as well asto Russia and her satellites in Eastern Europe.
The Minister of State saiji that it would be difficult to avoidpublic disclosure of this general policy of preventing the import ofBritish oil into China. The oil companies were bound to make-statements implying that their action was based on directions receivedfrom the Government. And a Parliamentary Question on this subject had been put down for answer on 19th July.It was the view of the Cabinet that this policy could be publiclyjustified, not only because we were likely to need for military purposessuch British oil as was available in this area, but also because it wasnecessary in order to prevent British oil from reaching the north korean armies.The Cabinet-(2) Took note of the steps which were being taken to prevent theimport of British oil into China.The Prime Minister said that President Truman had accepted his suggestion that Anglo-American staff discussions should be held atonce to review the strategic situation in the Far East, in South-east asia and in the Middle East. The President had nominated GeneralBradley and Ambassador Jessup as his representatives in these dis-cussions. The United Kingdom would be represented by His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington, Lord Tedder, the Director of MilitaryOperations, War Office, and the Assistant Under-Secretary of state in charge of Far Eastern affairs in the Foreign Office. These conversa-tions were due to begin in Washington in the course of the currentweek. An important object in the discussions would be to convince theUnited States authorities that the attitude of their government towards Formosa might involve them in direct conflict with theChinese Government, and might impair the solidarity of united nations support for their action in Korea. Asiatic countries, inparticular, would be unwilling to identify themselves with currentUnited States policy in respect of Formosa. And this policy was un-doubtedly giving rise to some uneasiness in the United Kingdom and generally throughout the Commonwealth. Apart, however, from theimmediate difficulties in the Far East, these discussions would alsorange over the possibilities of increased trouble in Indo-China and malaya and the need for a concerted Anglo-American policy for pre-venting this or for countering it, if need arose. They would also cover the possibility of further Soviet ventures in Persia or in Berlin.The Cabinet-(3) Took note with approval - of the arrangements made for initiating Anglo-American staff conversations on the strategic situation in the Far East, in South-East Asia, andin the Middle East.3. Mr. Menzies said that an Australian Military Mission con-sisting of officers with experience of jungle warfare was now on its way to visit Malaya to review the needs of the situation. TheAustralian Government had accepted the view, put to them by theChief of the Imperial General Staff during his recent visit, that Malayahad first priority in the cold war. Had this view been modified in anyway by recent events in Korea? If it were possible for Australia tofind a Commando Force for service overseas, would it be bestemployed in Malaya rather than Korea?The Chiefs of Staff said that they still regarded the settlement of malaya as of first importance, and any assistance which Australiacould provide there would be of great value. The Australian military mission would be given every opportunity to study the operations which were being conducted there.
In discussion of the problems of South-East Asia the followingpoints were made: -Indo-China. (a) It would be unfortunate if the fighting in Korea involved(Previous delay in the supply of United States equipment for Indo-China. the reference: French believed that with this equipment they could bring the forcesCM.

Communists in Burma were split through internal dissensions and theKarens were in a mood to give up the struggle. The Burmese Govern-menfs position had become stronger in the last six months.The Cabinet-Took note of the points raised in this discussion.Egypt- 4.  Mr. Menzies said that on his journey to the United KingdomAnglo-Egyptian he had had a talk with the Foreign Minister of Egypt. He hadTreaty. explained that the Australian Government regarded the integrity of the(Previous        Middle East as vital to Australian security, and that AustralianReference:      defence plans were being worked out in close association with the cm.

He had suggested that the Egyptian GovernmentConclusions,    should look realistically at the problem of a British garrison in EgyptMinute 5.) &apos;     since Egypt could not defend herself against attack by a majorPower, what arrangements should be made to enable Commonwealthforces to come to her assistance promptly and effectively in time ofwar?   He had been disturbed to find how unwilling the ForeignMinister appeared to be to look at matters from this angle, and howprone he was to base himself on past history and on out-modednotions of national sovereignty.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that during his recent discussions in Egypt he had formed the impression that the King andall his Ministers, except the Foreign Minister, were aware that Egyptcould not defend herself and that a British base was essential to egypt&apos;s security. They were, however, afraid that, if they openlyaccepted this position, other political parties in Egypt, and possiblypoliticians at present associated with the Government, would try tomake political capital from the allegation that the Government hadsurrendered to the British. Egyptian politicians appeared to be search-ing for a formula under which British troops would remain in Egyptbut they could say that the British occupation had ended.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,17th July, 1950.
