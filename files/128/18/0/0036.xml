1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of Statefor the Colonies (CP. (50) 270) covering the draft of a statement whichhe was proposing to make in the House of Commons on constitutional development in East Africa.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that for some time past there had been a growing feeling of anxiety and unrest through-Out East Africa, which was due partly to the policies of the SouthAfrican Government, partly to the fact that European settlers in EastAfrica were tending to turn for encouragement to that Government,and partly to the pace of recent constitutional change in West Africa.It had been suggested that a conference should be held to discuss theconstitutional problems of East Africa; but he did not favour that course, which would tend to suggest that the problems of the variousterritories in East Africa could all be solved on similar lines. Hepreferred to continue to deal separately with the different problemsof the various territories; but he thought there would be advantage in making a single statement of policy enunciating the general prin-ciples on which the Government were proceeding.In discussion doubts were expressed about the expediency ofmaking a general statement on these lines. The dependent territories in East Africa were in varying stages of constitutional development,and the problems arising from a mixture of races were more acute insome than in others. This fact was bound to be blurred if the Govern-ment made a single statement of policy applying to them all. More-over, language applicable to all these territories was not likely to be specially apt to any. Secondly was it not undesirable to offer astatement of policy in respect of a selected number of areas in EastAfrica at a time when there was increasing need to consider theproblems of Africa as a whole? Thirdly, in so far as the statementdealt with economic development, was it wise to appear to be treatingthese territories in isolation from the general problem of securingeconomic assistance for under-developed countries throughout theworld?The following points were also raised on the wording of the draft statement:-(a) The language of paragraph 2 (hi) might be thought to placeundue emphasis on the paternal aspect of Colonial responsibilities.It might be preferable to recast this in terms of assistance towards theeconomic development of these territories.(b) The reference to &quot; other sections of the community&quot; inparagraph 2 (iii) would be more appropriate to Kenya than to other territories, such as Uganda.  These words might perhaps be omitted.(c) Was it necessary, in paragraph 2 (iv), to add the warning thatsome time would pass before self-government could be fully estab-lished in these territories? It was the general view of the Cabinetthat in any such statement as this it would be expedient that such a warning should be included.(d) In paragraph 2 (iv) it might be preferable to speak of&quot; developing,&quot; rather than &quot; allowing,&quot; reasonable freedom of action by local governments.(e) The appeal for co-operation, in paragraph 2 (v), was out ofplace in what purported to be a statement of principles. If includedat all, it should be placed as a separate paragraph at the end of thestatement. There was, however, much to be said for omitting this appeal altogether.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thatthere seemed to be general agreement that before any such statementof policy was made the problem should be further considered particularly in relation to Government policy in respect of other parts
of Africa and to current discussions in the United Nations on racialproblems in Africa.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Affairs Committee to consider, inthe light of the Cabinefs discussion, the proposed statementof policy (set out in CP. (50) 270) on constitutional develop-ment in East Africa.2. The Minister of Fuel and Power, in pursuance of the cabinet&apos;s decision of 17th November, submitted a draft of the state-ment which he was proposing to make in the House of Commonsannouncing the Government^ decision to buy coal in the UnitedStates of America.The Cabinet discussed the draft in detail, and various amend-ments were suggested and approved.i -......The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, subject to the amendments agreed in their discussion, the statement should be made by the Ministerof Fuel and Power in the House of Commons that afternoon.(2) Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to arrange forcopies of his statement to be communicated, in advance,to the National Coal Board and the National Union of mineworkers.Egypt. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had to answer that after-Anglo-Egyptian noon a number of Parliamentary Questions arising from the statement,Treaty. made in the King&apos;s speech in the Egyptian Parliament, that the^Previous Egyptian Government no longer regarded the Treaty of 1936 as a reference: basis for Anglo-Egyptian relations. He submitted to the Cabinet aCM. (50) 46th draft Qf the statement which he proposed to make in reply to these conclusions,     Questions.Minute 4.) The Foreign Secretary said that he himself was doubtful whetherthe current difficulties would be overcome in negotiations conductedbetween the United Kingdom and Egypt only and limited to mattersof defence. He was inclined to think that it would eventually benecessary as, indeed, it would be preferable to seek a solutionalong the lines of a wider association of Middle East countries coveringco-operation in financial and economic matters as well as defence.Hitherto, this had been prevented by the enmity of Jews and Arabsover Palestine, but there might come a time when the United kingdom could promote some such association between the principal countries of the Middle East. Meanwhile, his main preoccupation was to keepthings as quiet as possible; and his draft statement was designed toexercise a steadying influence.The Minister of Defence said that, while he did not dissent fromthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement, it was his duty to remind theCabinet that it was difficult to make satisfactory progress with plans for the defence of the Middle East while the problem of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty remained outstanding.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Egyptian ForeignMinister was due to arrive in London in the following week to discussEgypt&apos;s sterling balances. Hitherto, considerations of foreign policyand defence had made it advisable for us to adopt a fairly conciliatory attitude on this question.   Would he now be justified in taking a coal.supplies during Winter1950-51.(previous reference:CM. (50) 75thConclusions,Minute 3.)
somewhat firmer line, in view of the latest pronouncement by theEgyptian Government on their attitude towards the Treaty TheForeign Secretary said that he would prefer to postpone giving his advice on this point until he knew the results of the current discussions at the United Nations on the future of Libya.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to minor drafting amendments, the termsof the statement on Anglo-Egyptian relations which theForeign Secretary was proposing to make in the House ofCommons later in the day.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to arrange for the text of that statement to be communi-cated at once to other Commonwealth Governments.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Minister of Defence would confertogether, in the light of the results of the current dis-cussions at the United Nations on the future of Libya,regarding the line to be taken in the discussions on Egypt&apos;ssterling balances, which were to be held with the egyptian foreing Minister in the following Week.Meeting of 4.   The Prime Minister said that arrangements had now beenCommonwealth made for a meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers to be held inPrime London in January 1951.  All the Commonwealth Prime MinistersMinisters. would be able to attend with the exception of the Prime Minister of(Previous South Africa, who had undertaken to send another Minister to repre-Reference: sent him.

Houses of Parliament.The Cabinet-Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.Korea. 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had made enquiries of(Previous friendly Governments with a view to ascertaining what support would reference: be forthcoming for a resolution, on the lines which the Cabinet had.

TheMinute2.) response to his enquiries had not been discouraging: the Govern-ments of Canada and India, in particular, had been favourably dis-posed towards such an approach. He was, however, in the difficulty that another resolution on the subject of Korea was already beforethe Security Council and, if that were withdrawn in order to facilitatediscussion of a new resolution on the lines suggested by the Cabinet,there was a risk that the area of discussion would be dangerouslyenlarged. For the moment, therefore, he thought it would be unwise to bring forward a new resolution. Meanwhile, however, he had thought there would be advantage in making a direct approach tothe Chinese People&apos;s Government so that they might be left in nodoubt about the objectives which the United Kingdom Governmentwere pursuing in the Far East, and that any misapprehensions whichthey might entertain about our intentions might be removed. Withthe Prime Minister^ approval he had instructed our representative in Peking to make this approach; and he had arranged for theGovernments of the United States and France and other Common-wealth Governments to be kept in touch with these developments.He had little doubt that they would favour the approach which he was making.
The Foreign Secretary added that he had it in mind to make astatement in the House of Commons on the course of policy whichhe had followed in relation to Korea. This would show that he had lost no opportunity of taking the initiative to confine the area ofhostilities and to bring about an early settlement on the basis of a free and united Korea. The Cabinet agreed that it would be helpful if such a statement could be made in the House of Commons later in the week. Other Commonwealth countries should be informed of the terms of the statement.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement; and invited him to make in the House of Commons later in the week astatement on Korea on the lines which he had indicated inthe course of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.China.Formosa.(previous reference:CM. (50) 73rdConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (CP. (50) 276) on the manner in which the subjectof Formosa should be handled by the United Kingdom delegationwhen it came before the General Assembly and the Security Council.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States delegation had now agreed that the proposed Assembly resolution on Formosa shouldbe postponed pending the arrival of representatives of the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government for the discussion of Formosa by the security council. There was therefore no immediate need for the Cabinet todiscuss the memorandum which he had circulated. The subject couldbe discussed at a later date in the light of developments in New York.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statementOverseas 7.  On 6th November the Cabinet had invited the Lord PresidentOperations to bring before them again the question whether the Overseas Opera-security of tions (Security of Forces) Bill should be introduced in the presentForces) Bill. session of Parliament. They now had before them a memorandum by(Previous the Lord President and the Home Secretary (CP. (50) 269) coveringReference: a revised draft of the Bill, which had been prepared in consultationCM. (50) 7lst   with the other Ministers concerned.Conclusions, The Cabinet first considered whether, if the Bill were introduced,Minute 4 (2).) it should include the power (in clause 8 of the draft) to requisitionships for the purpose of operations of the kind covered by the Bill.This additional power was required because it was doubtful whetherships needed for United Nations operations could be requisitioned by virtue of the powers continued in force under the Supplies and services (Transitional Powers) Acts, 1945 and 1947. Requisitioningpowers might not in practice be used in such a case, but it was useful to have them in the background in order to prevent excessive ratesbeing charged by shipping companies. On the other hand, theinclusion of this clause in a Bill aimed at Communists and otherdisaffected persons would be ill-received by the Merchant Navy; andthe assumption of special powers to requisition ships might throwdoubt on the legality of using existing emergency powers for otherdefence needs. Ministers agreed that, if it were found essential totake special powers for this purpose, another opportunity should besought for doing so. j !The question was also raised whether the Bill would apply tointerference with the assembly of troops and supplies in this countryin anticipation of United Nations operations abroad. The Attorney-General said that he was satisfied that this contingency was coveredby clause 9(3) of the draft Bill.
The Cabinet then considered clause 2 of the draft Bill, dealingwith subversive publications. Alternative versions of the clause were included in the draft annexed to CP. (50) 269. It had originally been intended to recommend a provision penalising the systematic publi-cation of material likely to prejudice the carrying out of the operationscovered by the Bill, and to give a defence that the published matter was true and that its publication was in the public interest. It had,however, been recognised that the Communist pamphlet &quot; I Saw the truth in Korea,&quot; although prejudicial to the carrying on of united nations operations in Korea, contained many statements of fact which the defence would argue to be true; and it had therefore been thought preferable to return to an early version of the clause whichpenalised systematic publication of material, whether or not the facts *were true, if the intention was to prejudice the carrying out of united nations operations by His Majesty&apos;s Forces. In discussion of clause2, the following points were made:  (a) Even though the need to prove intent were substituted for a defence that the facts were true and that their publication was in thepublic interest, it might still be open to the defence to bring forwardevidence about the truth of the published statements with a view torebutting the allegation about intent. There was therefore a serious risk, under both versions of the clause, that the defence would derivepropaganda value from the trial. Moreover, a jury might be tempted to convict on the basis of the effectiveness of the arguments in apublication, rather than the intentions of the author.(b) There was likely to be strong opposition to a Bill which seemed to deprive people of their right to criticise the justness of awar in which the country was engaged. Reference would be madeto anti-war statements which had been tolerated during the Boer Warand the First World War. A line could be drawn between generalpacifist sentiments and doubts about the justness of a particular war on the one hand, and statements calculated to prejudice the carryingout of operations in connection with the war. While a line of thiskind could be drawn in considering whether prosecutions should be instituted, it was not so easy to draw it in the terms of a Bill whichwould have to be debated and justified in Parliament.(c) It was reasonably clear that anyone who consorted with theNorth Koreans, or endeavoured to impede the measures which werebeing taken against them, was guilty of treason on the ground thathe gave aid and comfort to The King&apos;s enemies. Although the Crownhad always exercised a wide discretion in determining in which cases to institute proceedings for treason, it was difficult for the Attorney-General, when pressed in Parliament, to admit that the publicationof Communist pamphlets directed against the war in North Koreaamounted to treason but that he did not propose to take any actionin regard to it. It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that,if a new statutory provision on the lines of clause 2 of the draft bill were placed on the statute book, the Attorney-General might be ineven greater difficulty since he would be continuously pressed, whileUnited Nations operations were in force, to explain why he was notprosecuting in cases in which the justness of these operations wasquestioned. The question whether the Crown should prosecute underthe present law of treason was within the discretion of the Attorney-General and, where he considered that the facts amounted to treasonbut did not justify the use of so heavy an instrument, he could makeit clear that he was not proposing to institute proceedings, without committing himself too closely to the question whether the facts con-stituted treason or whether he might or might not take proceedings on a similar occasion at a later date.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inexpedient in present circumstances to proceed with clause 2 of thedraft Bill dealing with subversive publications. It was agreed that,if clause 2 were omitted, there was not enough of practical value inthe remainder of the Bill to warrant proceeding with it.
The Cabinet-Agreed that the Overseas Operations (Security of Forces)Bill should not be introduced in present circumstances.Parliament.Disqualificationof a Member.(previous reference:CM. (50) 65thConclusions,Minute 3.)RentRestrictionsActs.(previous reference:CM. (50) 66thConclusions,Minute 4.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president, the Home Secretary and the Attorney-General (CP. (50)278) recommending that His Majesty be asked to refer to the JudicialCommittee of the Privy Council, for their opinion, the questionwhether the Rev. J. G. MacManaway was disqualified for member-ship of the Northern Ireland Parliament, notwithstanding theprovisions of section 5 of the Government Of Ireland Act, 1920. Thisquestion had not been raised before the Privy Council in the previousproceedings, which related only to Mr. MacManaway&apos;s membership of the United Kingdom Parliament.The Cabinet Approved the proposal made in CP. (50) 278.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (50)273) indicating the respects in which the Rent Restrictions Acts stood in need of amendment.The Minister of Health said that this memorandum had been circulated in accordance with the Cabinefs request of 20th October,and was intended primarily for information. He hoped that, in thecourse of the debates on the Leasehold Property (temporary provisions) Bill, it would be possible to avoid giving any undertaking that the Rent Restrictions Acts would be reviewed.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (50) 273.Pensions 10.  The Cabinet were informed that the Court of Sessionfor Judges&apos;      Judges in Scotland and the Northern Ireland Judges had indicatedWidows.        that they did not wish the provisions of the Administration of(Previous        Justice (Pensions) Bill to apply to the judicial offices which they held.Reference:      In the case of the Scottish Judges, the Bill would provide subjectCM. (50) 38th   to an option to existing holders of judicial offices to elect whether theConclusions,    provisions should apply to them that a pension of  2,700 a yearMinute 3.)       after fifteen years&apos; service should be replaced by a pension of  2,060,together with a lump sum and a pension for the Judge&apos;s widow if shesurvived him. Actuarially the new provisions were as favourable asthe old. The Second Reading of the Bill was to be taken that day inthe House of Commons.It was pointed out that the question whether Scottish andNorthern Ireland Judges should be excluded from the provisions ofthe Bill could be considered at the Committee Stage of the Bill, andit was not necessary for the Government to take a decision imme-diately. The Scottish Bar would be in a better position than theScottish Bench to say whether the provisions of the Bill were likelyto appeal to future Scottish Judges.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Lord Advocate to ascertain whether opinion atthe Scottish Bar was in favour of the provisions of theAdministration of Justice (Pensions) Bill being applied toJudges of the Court of Session.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for similar enquiriesto be made in Northern Ireland.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th November, 1950
