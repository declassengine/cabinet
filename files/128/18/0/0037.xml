1. The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the prospectiveshortage of supplies, the Ministry of Fuel and Power were proposing to stop all further exports of coke for which contracts had not alreadybeen concluded, and had arranged that coal merchants and gas workswould not sell more coke in this country than they did in the precedingwinter. If these measures were applied at once, it should be possibleto avoid the reintroduction of a formal rationing scheme for coke.The President of the Board of Trade said that, in the trade nego-tiations which were now being opened with Sweden, we should probably find that our inability to offer them the coal they neededwould result in a reduction of essential imports, e.g., of timber andwood pulp, which we wished to draw from them.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals of the Ministry of Fuel and power for conserving supplies of coke during the coming winter by reducing exports and restricting sales in this country.Parliament. 2.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theBusiness in      House of Commons in the following week.the House of It was agreed that the debate on foreign affairs on 29th andCommons. 30th November should be opened by the Foreign Secretary, that onthe second day the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State forForeign Affairs should intervene to reply to miscellaneous points raised in the debate, and that the Prime Minister should make the concluding speech on the Governmenfs behalf.Coal.restriction of CokeSupplies,previous reference:CM.

This reply had not,Minute 3.) however, sufficed to prevent, the matter from being raised again laterSupply of in the day on the Adjournment of the House. It was likely thatArms. further reference would be made to it in supplementary Questions onthe weekly Statement of Business; and the Government might be pressed to find time for the discussion of a motion which had been tabled by members of the Opposition.The Cabinet were informed that the Defence Committee had discussed on 25th October whether an order for 64 Centurion tanks,which the Egyptian Government had placed at an earlier date, shouldbe executed; and they had then authorised delivery of 16 of thesetanks, for which payment had been largely completed, withoutprejudice to the fulfilment of the residue of the order. Since then,however, the Egyptian Government had publicly announced that theyno longer regarded the Treaty of 1936 as a basis for Anglo-Egyptianrelations; and, in view of the political difficulties to which this had given rise in the House of Commons, the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs had been authorised to say inthe Adjournment debate on the previous day that none of these16 tanks would be shipped to Egypt before the Foreign Secretary had informed the House of Commons of the Governmenfs intentionregarding the future course of the negotiations on the Anglo-egyptian treaty.The Minister of Health said that there was a good deal ofanxiety on this question among Government supporters. Our owntroops in the Middle East were not fully equipped with up-to-datetanks; and the Government were likely to be pressed in the House ofCommons to justify their action in sending even a small number ofCenturion tanks to a country whose Government had consistentlypursued an unfriendly policy towards us for several years past. Why39813-1 b 2
should this assistance be given to Egypt, at a time when they werepreventing the passage through the Suez Canal of tankers bound forthe oil refinery at Haifa and were seeking to deprive us of the military facilities to which we were entitled under the Treaty?In reply it was pointed out that much of the military equipment which was now being exported from this country was being delivered in pursuance of contracts dating back to an earlier period, when therequirements of our own Forces had been smaller and it had been our policy to maintain our war potential by accepting export orders. Itwas not easy to default on such contracts. And, as regards Egypt,while the Treaty of 1936 remained in force, we were under an obliga-tion to assist in training and equipping the Egyptian forces. egypt would not be satisfied with obsolescent equipment: they naturallywished to receive a small quantity of the most modern equipment fortraining purposes. It had been our policy to keep the 1936 Treaty in being until some satisfactory alternative had been found: it was by no means clear that it would be to our advantage to denounce theTreaty and abandon hope of securing any facilities for military basesanywhere in Egypt. While that policy remained substantially unchanged, it would be a drastic step to default on a contract whichwas consistent with our obligations under the Treaty.The Cabinet-Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange that noCenturion tanks would be delivered to Egypt until he had reported to Parliament the Government^ intentionsregarding the future course of the negotiations on the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.Catering 4.   The Cabinet were informed that, in a debate in the House ofWages Act Lords on 30th November on a motion by Lord Balfour of Inchrye,strong criticism was likely to be expressed about the effect of the catering Wages Act on the hotel and tourist industries in this country.In Scotland, in particular, anxiety about the effect of the Act was not limited to Opposition circles: trade unionists and other government supporters were also concerned about it.The Minister of Labour said that the employers&apos; side of the hotelindustry were seeking, from political motives, to bring the Act into disrepute. He could provide the Government spokesmen in the forth-coming debate with strong arguments and information to meet the criticisms which were likely to be expressed. Enquiries which hadbeen made into the working of the Act had shown that its mainstructure was sound, and that all legitimate criticisms could be met by minor adjustments.In further discussion it was pointed out that no time should be lost in making the adjustments to which the Minister of Labour had referred. The suggestion was also made that most of the criticism in trade union circles in Scotland would be met if a promise could begiven that a separate Catering Wages Board would be established forScotland.The Cabinet- j(1) Invited the Minister of Labour to carry through without delay the adjustments which he was proposing to make in theoperation of the Catering Wages Act.(2) Took note that the Minister of Labour would provide theLord Privy Seal with material for use in the forthcoming debate in the House of Lords.
Government 5.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theindustrial Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (5) 279) recommending the rejectionEmployees. of a claim by the trade union side of the Joint Co-ordinatingAnnual Leave. Committee that the annual leave of Government industrial employeesshould be increased from one to two weeks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in January 1950 his predecessor had rejected the claim for an additional week&apos;s leave, but had promised that it would be &apos;; high on the list of things to bedone&quot; when economic circumstances improved. Since then theGovernment had recognised that the economic situation was easier,but on balance he doubted whether circumstances yet warranted thegrant of this claim. The direct financial cost was not great; but, iftwo weeks&apos; leave were given to Government industrial employees,there would be claims for similar concessions in coalmining, ship-building and manufacturing industries.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) In the Admiralty the concession would cost  500,000 a yearand would accentuate the existing shortage of skilled men. In the PostOffice 71,000 employees would be immediately affected and therewould be repercussions on a larger number who were on less favourable conditions of service: 3,000 additional staff would berequired. In the Ministry of Supply the grant of the concession wouldhave adverse effects on production at a time when full production was required in connection with the rearmament programme.(by Government industrial employees already received ninepublic holidays a year, with pay, in addition to their week&apos;s annualleave. Moreover, they enjoyed a very generous scheme for paidsick-leave, the abuse of which, had already been investigated at therequest of the Cabinet (CM. (49) 49th Conclusions, Minute 3, andE.P.C. (50) 5th Meeting, Minute 2). There Was a tendency for someof them to take holidays under the guise of paid sick-leave, and thetrade unions recognised the danger of such abuses. If it were decidedto consider the claim for a second week of annual leave, it might bedesirable to link this with a review of the scheme of paid sick-leave.(c) If Government industrial employees were granted anotherweek of annual leave, it would be difficult to resist a similar claim onbehalf of coalminers and workers in the shipbuilding industry. Thegrant of this concession to the miners would bring about a substantial reduction of output at a time when the Government were makingevery effort to maintain coal output and;, if possible, increase it.(d) Some Ministers; doubted whether the rejection of the claim should be founded on the argument that the economic position of thecountry did not yet warrant the granting of this concession. It mightbe wiser to rely on the established principle that in such matters as these the Government followed the practice of the best employers in private industry. On the other hand;, it was argued that the state should be a model employer, that the non-industrial grade of the CivilService already received an amount of annual leave substantially inexcess of that accorded to the industrial grades, and that an attemptto prevent improvements in conditions of service in one field, before a general advance, could be made throughout the. whole field, wouldin practice slow down very seriously the general improvement of conditions of employment throughout industry.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, the tirriej was notopportune for granting an additional week of annual leave to Govern-ment industrial employees. The grounds on which the claim; was rejected in present circumstances should be formulated by theMinisters concerned, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should reject theclaim that the annual leave of Government industrialemployees should be increased from one to two weeks.39813-1b 3
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theMinister of Labour and the other Ministers concerned themanner in which the Government should express thegrounds for the rejection of this claim.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to examine theoperation of the scheme for paid sick-leave, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, with a view to bringing before the Cabinet in due course any recom-mendations for its modification.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the First Lord ofthe Admiralty (CP. (50) 275) recommending that the first report ofthe Pilcher Committee on the administration of justice under theNaval Discipline Act should be published, without any indication ofthe conclusions reached by the Admiralty or of the Government^intentions regarding the disciplinary codes of the three Services.The First Lord of the Admiralty explained that the first reportof the Pilcher Committee had been received in February 1950, but its publication had been held up pending consideration of its recom-mendations. It was known that the report had been received and,when the Courts-Martial Appeal Court Bill was published, therewould be a demand for its publication. He recommended that thisreport should be published forthwith, well in advance of the publica-tion of the text of the Bill. The second report of the pilcher committee had now been received and was under consideration inthe Admiralty.In discussion there was general agreement that publication of thefirst report of the Pilcher Committee ought not to be further post-poned. Not only did it favour the establishment of a Courts-MartialAppeal Court, but it advised against the appointment of civilianpresidents for courts-martial, unanimity of findings and other-ranksrepresentation. These questions, which affected the disciplinary codesof all three Services, were under consideration by the Minister ofDefence and the Service Ministers.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to arrange for theearly publication of the first report of the pilcher committee on the administration of justice under theNaval Discipline Act.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to complete his discussions with the Service Ministers on the main recommendationsof the Lewis and Pilcher Committees, other than the setting up of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court, and tosubmit their views to the Cabinet at an early date.7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president and the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 280) suggesting that, inthe debates on the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Bill,the Government spokesmen should be authorised to say that theamendment of the Rent Restrictions Acts was the subject of inter-departmental study.The Attorney-General said that in the debates on this Bill theGovernment were bound to be pressed to indicate their intentionsabout the amendment of the Rent Restrictions Acts. Moreover,amendments to the Bill might be moved on rent restrictions matters,in so far as these related to leases of twenty-one years and over. the anomalies under the Rent Restrictions Acts were such that, in his view, it would be difficult for the Government to say less than thatthe matter was the subject of study, although he fully realised thepolitical difficulties of proceeding with amending legislation in presentcircumstances.
Prevention ofCorruption.(Previous :Reference:CM (49) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1.)8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 263) renewing the suggestion, which the cabinet had considered at his instance on 9th May, 1949, that the Preventionof Corruption Act, 1916, should be so extended as to apply, not onlyto contracts, but also to permits and licences granted by public authorities and proposing, in addition, that the provisions of the Actshould be applied to public corporations as well as to GovernmentDepartments.The Attorney-General said that he had been moved to bring thisquestion before the Cabinet again by the result of recent police investi-gations into allegations of corruption in the British broadcasting corporation. These had brought to light several instances in whichmoney had been paid to servants of the B.B.C. by theatrical artistesholding or seeking contracts with the Corporation in circumstances which suggested corruption but offered no prospect that a convictioncould be secured so long as it rested with the prosecution to prove thata corrupt motive underlay the transaction. The Attorney therefore suggested that legislation should be introduced to bring bodies likethe B.B.C. within the scope of the Act of 1916; and that, if such legis-lation were introduced, the opportunity should be taken to extend the Act to cover licences and permits as well as contracts.In favour of such legislation it was suggested that in recent yearscorruption!, or attempted corruption, of public servants had substan-tially increased; and that the protection which the Act of 1916provided for persons employed in the contracts branches of Govern-ment Departments should now be extended to officials handlingapplications for permits and licences of various kinds and also toofficers of public corporations and local authorities who were engagedin similar work. The Act of 1916 had been passed because of thespecial temptations which might assail persons tendering for Govern-ment contracts and the officials handling their tenders; but in presentcircumstances persons applying for certain types of licences andpermits, and the officials having power to grant them, were exposed to the same sort of temptation. If it was right that a person accused of impropriety in connection with a Government contract should beleft to establish his innocence, it was logical that the onus of proofshould similarly rest with the defendant where impropriety was allegedin connection with the grant of a licence or permit.  Similarly, it wasThe Minister of Health recalled that he had been anxious thatsome of the more flagrant anomalies under the Rent Restrictions Actsshould be removed in the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions)Bill, but the Cabinet had decided against that course because they felt that a temporary Bill should be as simple as possible and confined to current hardships arising out of the law relating to leasehold. Hewas concerned at the suggestion that amendments relating to the rent restrictions Acts might be allowed in the Committee stage of this Bill.He did not, however, wish to oppose the suggestion that a statementof the Governments intentions should be made on the general finesindicated in paragraphs of CP. (50) 280, but he would prefer that thesecond sentence should be amended to read: &quot; The amendment andcodification of the law presents many complications and difficulties,but the matter is at present being studied with a view to the introduc-tion of comprehensive legislation. No prospect of early legislationcan, however, be held out.&quot;The Cabinet Agreed that in the Parliamentary discussions on the Lease-hold Property (Temporary Provisions) Bill the government spokesmen should be authorised to make a statement aboutthe Rent Restrictions Acts in the terms set out in paragraph5 of CP. (50) 280, subject to the amendment suggested bythe Minister of Health and recorded above.
illogical that the Act of 1916 should apply to some, but not all, ofthe public corporations. And legislation extending its provisions tothem all could be defended on tne basis that the Government were anxious to promote in the public corporations the same traditions ofintegrity which had been established in the Civil Service.On the other side it was argued that there was no evidence tosupport the suggestion that corruption had substantially increased inrecent years. Certainly it was true that corruption was much lesscommon to-day than it had been fifty years ago and earlier. Sugges-tions for such amendments of the criminal law were usually based on some case in which it had proved impossible to secure the conviction of a flagrant offender the Act of 1916 owed its origin, in fact, to just such a case but these might well be isolated cases which werenot symptomatic of any general tendency. Legislation extending theAct of 1916 to cover licences and permits was likely to be represented by the Governments opponents as an admission that economic con-trols had had the effect of increasing corruption. And legislationextending that Act to public corporations would similarly be repre-sented as an admission that State ownership had increased corruption.There would be great political disadvantages in introducing such legislation at the present time.It was suggested that some of the objections mentioned in the cabinet&apos;s discussion might be met if the Bill applied the Act of 1916,not only to public corporations, but to all public companies. It was,however, pointed out that in that event there would be little justifica-tion for not extending it to private companies also; and that, if so widea field were covered, a very large number of practices which were generally regarded as harmless would become criminal offences. TheObjections to this could not be wholly met by claiming that the consentof the Attorney-General would be required before proceedings couldbe instituted and that such consent would only be given in seriouscases.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itappeared that legislation on the lines proposed in CP. (50) 263 wouldnot at present command the general support of the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Adjourned   their   consideration   of   the   proposals   in cp. (50) 263 for amendment of the Prevention of CorruptionAct, 1916.9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations(CP. (50) 277) on the political situation which had arisen in Nepalfollowing the abdication and flight of the King.The Foreign Secretary said that he was satisfied that the UnitedKingdom Government should recognise the new King of Nepal, onthe ground that the present regime was firmly established and was ineffective control of the country. Unfortunately, however, the indian government were taking the opposite view&apos; and it was most undesir-able that the two Commonwealth Governments most directly interested should follow different policies in this matter. He greatlyregretted the attitude and the tactics of the Indian Government; andhe felt that they would bear a heavy responsibility if their encourage-ment of the former King resulted in a state of civil war in Nepal.While therefore he had no doubt that at some stage the UnitedKingdom Government must recognise the new King, in order to ensurepolitical stability within Nepal, he was in favour of deferring positive action for a time in the hope that India&apos;s attitude might be modified.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that he feared that, whatever arguments were used, the Indian Government
would not be persuaded to modify their attitude. He could not con-done their action in intervening in the internal affairs of a State whoseindependence they fully recognised; and, despite their attitude, he agreed with the Foreign Secretary that the United Kingdom Govern-ment would have no alternative but to recognise the new regime inNepal. At the same time he was strongly in favour of delayingrecognition for a time, and seeking to persuade the Indian Government; similarly to delay their declaration that they were not prepared torecognise the new King. During this delay events might disprove theIndian contention that internal disorder was widespread throughoutNepal. The United States Government might also be persuaded tobring their influence to bear on the Indian Government. TheNepalese Ambassador in Delhi had offered to go to Katmandu andtry, by explaining the views of the Indian Government, to bring thetwo Governments closer together; and it would be useful if the PrimeMinister of India could be urged to accept this offer.In discussion the view was expressed that the Indian government might be in a better position than we were to assess the state of poli-tical opinion within Nepal; and that it should not be assumed that theNepalese did not share the desire for constitutional reforms whichwas widely felt throughout Asia. The United Kingdom Governmentshould be slow to lend their support to a reactionary regime in Nepal.On the other hand it was pointed out that Nepal was an inde-pendent State and that its people should be free to choose, withoutexternal intervention, the form of Government they desired. india should not treat Nepal as though she were a satellite State.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to defer a decision, for at least a few days, on thequestion whether the United Kingdom Government should recognise the new regime in Nepal.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to continue to impress upon thePrime Minister of India the importance of avoiding a diver-gence of view between two Commonwealth governments on this matter, to explain the reasons which disposed theUnited Kingdom Government towards recognition of thenew regime in Nepal, to urge that there should be some further delay before final decisions were taken, and toadvise acceptance of the offer of the Nepalese ambassador in Delhi to go to Katmandu for discussions with hisGovernment.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ask the United StatesGovernment to use their influence with the indian government in this matter.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,23rd November, 1950.
