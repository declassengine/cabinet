Recall of 1.  The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition desired that parliament      the general debate on defence should last for three days, since they(Previous       were not satisfied that, if the general debate lasted for two days, the reference:      debate on the Second Reading of the National Service Bill could become. (50) 55th   sufficiently wide to cover the whole ground.   The Opposition had conclusions,    suggested that the Second Reading and remaining stages of the minute 2.)       National Service Bill should be taken on Friday, 15th September, andthey were prepared to accept an arrangement under which bothHouses sat on Saturday, 16th September, with a view to the Bill re-ceiving the Royal Assent on that day.The general view of Ministers was that a three-day debate on theGovernments motion would have to be conceded, although in fact a two-day debate would have been ample for a general expression of views. The suggestion that the Bill should be taken on Friday, 15thSeptember, was, however, open to objection. Many Government sup-porters would find it inconvenient to attend the House of Commonstill a late hour on Friday, 15th September; and, if there were manyabsentees from any divisions, the reasons might be misinterpreted athome and abroad. It might prove to be difficult to open the SecondReading debate on the Bill on Friday, 15 th September, and to con-clude it after (say) a further two hours&apos; debate on Monday, 18thSeptember. From the Governments point of view there was, there-fore, much to be said for having a general debate on 12th, 13th and14th September, and then adjourning the House of Commons untilMonday, 18th September, with a view to the National Service Billpassing through both Houses on 18th and 19th September. Therewould be an opportunity for a debate in the Commons on some othersubject, while the Lords were considering the National Service BillThere was, however, general agreement that the best course in presentcircumstances was to announce that the debate on the Governmentsmotion would occupy 12th, 13th and 14th September, and to say thatan announcement about the further course of business would be madeat a later stage.In view of the fact that the general debate was to occupy three days, it was agreed that the Prime Minister should make the opening speech.Proceedings in the House of Lords would broadly follow the samepattern as those in the House of Commons.Parliament. 2.   The Lord President said that, while there had been no sugges-New Commons tion that the opening proceedings in the new Chamber should beChamber. filmed, it had been suggested that the ceremony at which The Kingreceived Addresses from both Houses should be filmed and possiblytelevised, so that Commonwealth countries which would be repre-sented on that occasion could be shown a full record of the proceed-ings. There were precedents for a film being made of an occasion ofthis kind.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to His Majesty&apos;s approval and to general acceptance of the proposal, no objection need be raised tothe proposal that the ceremony of the presentation ofAddresses on Thursday, 26th October, should be filmed andtelevised.World Peace 3.   The Foreign Secretary said he was disturbed about a confer-Congress. ence which was being arranged in London in November next on behalfof the permanent committee of the World Peace Congress. This wasin effect a Communist body, and the organisation in London of a con-ference of this kind, to which large numbers of delegates were beinginvited from Eastern European countries, would be widely misrepresented-
Icon and Steel 4.   The Minister of Supply said that he had completed the con-Act stitution of the Iron and Steel Corporation and he proposed to set up(Previous the Corporation on 2nd October next and to fix 1st February, 1951,Reference: as the vesting date. In the ordinary way he would have made a publicCM. (50) 51st announcement about the membership of the Corporation in the nearConclusions, future, and he would be glad to know whether it was considered that minute 5.) the statement should be made in the House of Commons at one of thesittings commencing on 12th September.There was general agreement that, if the Minister of Supply hadnot previously been asked by Private Notice Question for an indica-tion of the Government^ intentions, he should volunteer a statement in the House of Commons on 14th September, giving the names ofthe members of the Corporation to be set up on 2nd October and an indication that the vesting of the iron and steel companies would beeffected as soon as was convenient after 1st January, 1951. TheOpposition were likely to demand a debate, and this might take placeon the day on which the House of Lords would be considering theNational Service Bill.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Supply should indicate the steps which were being taken to implement the provisions of theIron and Steel Act, 1949, in a statement to be made in theHouse of Commons on 14th September.Kaw Materials. 5. The Minister of Supply said that, unless further supplies ofGerman Scrap steel scrap could be secured from Germany, there was a danger thatSteel. steel production in 1951 would be from 500,000 to 750,000 tons belowthis year&apos;s production, with serious repercussions on the rearmament programme. There appeared to be ample scrap in Germany, even after allowing for German steel production, but the German Govern-ment were restricting exports of scrap, probably in order to conservewhat was in effect a wasting asset. To some extent, the position wasbeing prejudiced by speculative purchases of German scrap by UnitedStates buyers. The immediate need was for pressure on the GermanGovernment to remove their restrictions on the export of scrap.The Foreign Secretary said that there were grounds for believing1 that the German Chancellor would be amenable to reason on thissented as showing weakness on the part of the Government. TheHome Office had indicated that there was no power to ban the con-ference, but it had been suggested that the attendance of foreign dele-gates should be hampered by the Foreign Office, who might refusevisas at the direction of the Home Secretary, and by immigration officers, who might make difficulties about giving leave to land. Itwas, however, a matter of some difficulty for British Ambassadors torefuse visas to prominent Communists in the countries to which theywere accredited; and it would be preferable to try to prevent theconference from being held.Some Ministers felt doubtful whether the best method of handling the matter was to endeavour to ban the proposed conference. Therewere no existing powers under which this could be done; and, if extra-ordinary measures were suggested, the Soviet Government would ex-jloit the situation to the full. It would be preferable to take all practicable steps to expose the hypocrisy of the Communists in posingas supporters of world peace.The Cabinet Agreed that it would not be practicable to ban the proposed conference in London of the World Peace Congress.
matter, because he realised how important it was in connection withthe organisation of Western defence. The Foreign Secretary thought,however, that we should take the matter up with the.United states secretary of State in the forthcoming talks in New York; for it waspart of a larger question of the extent to which the present situationcalled for the revival of something like the combined supply boards of the war period. The subject would have to be linked with thequestion of East-West trade, since, if British exports to Russia, Chinaand the satellite countries were to be cut down, we should need an assurance that alternative supplies of timber and other raw materials would be forthcoming from sources under American control. after he had explored the matter in a general way with the State Depart-ment, further detailed work would .have to be undertaken by theTreasury, Board of Trade, Ministry of Supply and other Departmentsconcerned.In subsequent discussion it was pointed out that, if joint boardswere formally reconstituted under present conditions, it wouldprobably be impracticable to confine membership to the UnitedKingdom and the United States, since there would be strong pressure for the inclusion of Canada, France and other North Atlantic Powers.If the boards were reconstituted in this form they would be quiteunworkable. Accordingly, what seemed to be required was a muchlooser arrangement under which there would be some co-ordinationof United States and United Kingdom procurement of raw materials,combined with an understanding that these arrangements would not operate to deny to other North Atlantic Powers their essential needs for military and industrial purposes.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that steps should be taken to bring pressure on theFederal German Government to relax its restrictions onthe export of steel scrap to this country, to the extentrequired for the steel production programme.(2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should raise with theUnited States Administration the question of theco-ordination of demands for essential raw materials.Germany. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary (CP, (50) 199) dealing with the control of German industry.Reference:      The United States delegation to the Three-Power Study Group on. (50) 16th   Germany had proposed that, at their meeting in New York, theConclusions,    Foreign Ministers should instruct the Group to review the ProhibitedMinute 2.)       and Limited Industries Agreement, with the object of eliminatingrestrictions which were no longer necessary and introducing flexibilityinto the restrictions which were to remain.   The&apos; Foreign secretary proposed that he should agree to this, and that he should also informthe United States Secretary of State that, should it be necessary tomake relaxations in advance of the completion of the review, these should be made only upon the proposal of the competent international body.The Foreign Secretary said that the requirements of western european defence called for a review of many aspects of our present policy towards Germany. Subject to the agreement of his colleagues,he proposed, in discussion with the United States and French foreign ministers, to advocate the following general policies:  (i) Police and Auxiliary Military Forces. The Defence Com-mittee had already agreed that he should propose the establishmentof a federal gendarmerie, the expansion of the frontier police force!,and the reorganisation of the auxiliary force serving with theoccupation armies.
(ii) Demolitions-It had also been agreed by the DefenceCommittee that, with certain exceptions, we should agree to the dis-continuance of all dismantling and demolition in Germany.(iii) Control of Industry.-As stated in his paper, he proposed to associate himself with the United States proposal for a revision of theProhibited and Limited Industries Agreement. Many limitationswhich had been imposed for security reasons were now inappropriateto the changed situation under which Germany Was eventually tobecome associated in Western European defence measures.(iv) Occupatidn Statute. The Occupation Statute would requirerevision to take account of the changes in general three-power policy towards Germany.(v) Foreign Relations. He proposed to advocate the return tothe Federal Government of full freedom to conduct her own foreign relations, subject to a necessary reservation on her relations withEastern Europe. This reservation should be incorporated in theOccupation Statute and not put into effect through action by the high commission. He could not endorse the United States and Frenchopposition to allowing German diplomatic representation in washington and Paris. If agreement was reached between theForeign Ministers, there should be consultations with the GermanGovernment before any decisions were announced.(vi) Control of Internal Affairs, The Occupation. Statute andthe Basic Law should be revised to abolish existing excessive inter-ference by the Occupying Powers with internal administration. this action would provide a useful contrast with the position in eastern germany, where the Occupying Power exercised close control overthe German administration.(vii) Termination of the State of War.-H.e proposed to discuss with the other Foreign Ministers the possibiliy of a formal terminationof the state of war, on the lines of the action taken in respect of Italy.This would, however, cause difficulties for the United StatesGovernment, whose position in Europe was based on war-timelegislation.(viii) Displaced Persons. It would be necessary to give carefulconsideration to problems connected with displaced persons andrefugees, but it had not yet been possible to formulate a policy.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) All possible steps should be taken &quot;to meet the danger ofGerman export competition, to which we should be increasinglyexposed in consequence both of our enlarged defence programme andof the removal of limitations On German industry.(b) The return of industrial freedom to Germany was likely toassist the re-emergence of the big industrial cartels. In reply it waspointed out that cartels were prohibited under existing legislation, andthat some had already been entirely broken up.There was general agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;sproposals.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendations in CP. (50) 199 on thecontrol of German industry.(2) Approved the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary for hisdiscussion with the United States and French foreign ministers on general policy towards Germany.Claims on 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignGermany.       Secretary (CP. (50) 198) on the settlement of claims on Germany.This proposed that, in discussing this question in New York, theForeign Secretary should try to induce the United States Secretary
of State and the French Foreign Minister to agree that the limitedproposals for an interim settlement should include some provisionfor the repayment of post-war Government expenditure as well as for the repayment of pre-war debts. He recommended that if he was unable to obtain agreement to this course he should be authorised to consent to repayment for the present of pre-war debts only.The Foreign Secretary said that the question of pre-war loans toGermany, to which there had been many small American subscribers,raised political issues in the United States, and that the United StatesGovernment were in favour of making the interim settlementapplicable to pre-war debts only. He felt, however, that he shouldmake every effort to ensure that some proportion (perhaps 25 percent.) of the available foreign exchange should be used for the repay-ment of post-war Government expenditure.In discussion attention was drawn to the position of the war-timedebtors. While it might not be possible to obtain any repaymentnow, they ought not to have to wait until a Peace Treaty was concluded.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in CP. (50) 198.8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 192) on relations with Spain. This set out thearguments for and against a revision of the United Nations resolution of 1946, and for and against any wider change in United kingdom policy towards the present regime in Spain.The Foreign Secretary said that it was our abstention fromsupporting any revision of the 1946 resolution which had kept it inforce hitherto. The withdrawal of Ambassadors had, in his opinion,not been a wise move, and it was possible that the admission of spain to the specialised agencies of the United Nations would haveeconomic advantages. On the other hand, it was likely that anychange in our attitude would rouse strong opposition in this country,and he had framed his paper without making any recommendations,since this was essentially a political problem.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Our commercial relations with Spain were maintained on a normal footing on both sides, and were not hindered by our politicalattitude to the Franco regime.Kb) While Spain was of strategic importance to the defence of western Europe, a change in our present policy would not necessarily have any immediate effect on the availability of her forces in anemergency.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inadvisable to make any change in our policy towards Franco Spain.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Government should abstain fromsupporting any proposal in the United Nations to amend the provisions of the resolution of 1946 on relations withthe Spanish Government.(2) Agreed that no change should be made in our general policy towards Spain.
Eritrea. 9.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Foreign(Previous        Secretary (CP. (50) 202) on policy about Eritrea.   The ForeignReference:      Secretary recommended that the United Kingdom delegation in NewCM. (48) 12th   York should support, in the Interim Committee of the general conclusions,     Assembly of the United Nations, a draft resolution providing for a minute 2.)       federation between Eritrea and Ethiopia.  It had become clear thatthere was no likelihood of the adoption by the United Nations ofthe solution which the United Kingdom Government had hithertoadvocated   (the   incorporation   of   the   Eastern   Provincesi  in ethiopia   and  separate  provision  for  the  Western  Province).Provided that the draft resolution proved acceptable to the Italian-    and Ethiopian Governments, it was recommended that we should agree to it, and should continue our administration of the territoryfor a transitional period of two (or, if necessary, three) years.In discussion it was agreed that, should the Interim Committeereject the draft resolution, the Government should remain free toreturn to advocating the former policy of partition.The Cabinet-Approved the recommendations in CP. (50) 202.Coal Exports. 10.   The Foreign Secretary said that he was concerned about the(Previous suggestion that the export of coal under contract to Denmark and reference: Sweden should be reduced. Our wider commercial interests wouldCM. (50) 51st be gravely prejudiced if these countries felt that a temporary shortageConclusions, hi this country was being met by what was tantamount to a breach of minute 40       contract, and this view was amply borne out by the replies from HisMajesty&apos;s Representatives in these countries in response to enquiries which he had been asked to make.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and Power, saidthat, although the amount of coal involved 400,000 tons-appearedto be small in relation to the total annual production of coal in thiscountry, it was all in the form of large and graded coal. There wouldbe only 5 million tons of these coals in stock at the beginning of thewinter and 1,500,000 tons in stock at the end of the winter. If400,000 tons were withdrawn from these stocks and a severe winterwas experienced, it might prove to be impossible to supply domesticcoal for part of the year and some gas works might have to closedown. The Production Committee had been aware that, on thedecisions they had taken, there was a shortage of 1 million tons forthe export market, and had asked the National Coal Board to investi-gate the extent to which its export obligations could be deferred byagreement. Deferments of supplies totalling 600,000 tons had alreadybeen negotiated in the ordinary course of business. Denmark was dueto receive 2 million tons of coal and would receive 1,800,000 tons:the question was whether the supply of the remaining 200,000 tonscould be deferred until 1951. Similarly, Sweden would receive1,320,000 tons out of contracts totalling 1,470,000 tons, leaving a shortfall  of 150,000 tons. What was proposed was that the Chairmanof the National Coal Board, who had long experience in the Scandinavian-scandinavian coal trade, should visit Denmark and Sweden and ascertain whether some deferment of supplies could be arranged. He would deal with the matter on a commercial basis as representing, not theGovernment, but the National Coal Board.In discussion, no difficulty was felt about the Chairman of theNational Coal Board endeavouring, as a commercial matter, to secure a deferment of supplies, by agreement with the customers. there could, however, be no question of Government authority to withholdsupplies, and it would be a matter of acute embarrassment to theGovernment in their general commercial negotiations with denmark and Sweden if there was any suggestion of breach of contract.  Any
failure to honour coal contracts would redound to the serious dis-advantage of this country if the Danes or the Swedes were to respondby breaking contracts relating to food or timber. If, therefore, theChairman of the National Coal Board was unsuccessful in his nego-tiations, the whole position would have to be reviewed by theGovernment.&apos;   The Cabinet-Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Fuel and power, to arrange for the National Coal Board to conduct negotiations with the Danish and Swedish coal-importingmerchants on the lines indicated in the Cabinefs discussion.ial 11.   The Minister of Labour said that, arising out of the refusals. of the London Master Printers to meet an outstanding wage claim,i the London Society of Compositors had followed up a refusal tositors. work overtime by the adoption of restrictive practices of a cripplingcharacter which were not in accord with the established conditionsof employment. The master printers had responded by dismissingmen who refused to give an assurance not to resort to these restrictive practices. He had been advised that he should not treat the actionof the master printers as an unauthorised lock-out, since the legal position was far from clear. He had referred the dispute to a Courtof Enquiry, which would meet shortly, and this would bring to light,more clearly than was known at present, the precise claims whichthe Society were making. Printers and machine-minders were being given notice because work was not available; and this, coupled withthe general feeling that the Society had acted in an unreasonable andarbitrary fashion, should result in considerable pressure being broughtto bear upon the Society to bring the strike to an end at an early date.Attention was drawn to the serious inconveniences of the presentstoppage of printing in the London area.The Cabinet-Took note of the Minister of Laboufs statement.Cabinet Office, SWA,6th September, 1950.
