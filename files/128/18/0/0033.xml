Relations 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had to answer a Parlia-with Spain. mentary Question later in the day asking whether the Government(Previous proposed to resume full diplomatic relations with Spain. The cabinet reference: had suggested on 9th November that the appointment of a united cm. (50) 72nd Kingdom Ambassador should be delayed until other AmbassadorsConclusions. had been appointed to Spain. If he were to give full effect to this minute 6.) suggestion fie would have to qualify his reply to the Question, and hewas doubtful whether it would be wise to give this appearance ofi reluctance to accept the resolution of the United Nations Assembly&apos;  about Spain.The Cabinet agreed that it would be undesirable to imply thatthere would be delay in giving effect to the United Nations decision.They also asked that other Commonwealth Governments should bekept informed of our intentions in this matter.The Cabinet-Agreed that, in announcing the Governments decision, theForeign Secretary should riot imply that there would bedelay in giving effect to the Resolutions of the united nations Assembly about Spain.China. 2.  The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 267) on Chinese intervention in Korea, and a joint memorandum by the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (50) 268) on the contribution to be made by theUnited Kingdom towards the United Nations Fund for reconstruction in Korea. ,Intervention The Foreign secretary said that from the outset he had done hisin Korea.        utmost to prevent Chinese intervention in Korea, for he had recog-(Previous        nised that this would bring with it a grave risk of general war in the reference:      Far East.  Now that the Chinese intervention had been reported toCM. (50) 72nd the Security Council, his object was to secure that the United NationsConclusions,    should not take any action which might extend the area of the conflict.MinuteS.)       The present situation was critical; and the peace of the Far Eastturned largely on the handling of the discussions in the security council over the next few days.  In the light of experience he feltno confidence in India&apos;s influence as a mediator with the communist government of China.The Chief of the Air Staff said that the Chinese, though they hadlarge forces in Manchuria, had not yet deployed very substantial numbers of troops in Korea. Elements of five Chinese armies hadbeen identified in Korea; and the United States authorities estimatedthat about 35,000 Chinese troops were operating there.; Russian types of fighter aircraft were now being encountered in larger numbers, butit seemed likely that these were being piloted by Chinese or NorthKoreans; and, unless Russian pilots were used, there seemed no imme-diate risk that the United Nations forces would lose their commandingsuperiority in the air. So long as they held this, they would have areasonable chance of withstanding even a major offensive by Chineseforces.The Chiefs of Staff Committee were, however, Of the opinion thatit was no longer practicable, without risking a major war, to attainthe original objective of occupying the whole of North Korea andplacing it under a United Nations regime. They were doubtfulwhether the United Nations forces could reach the northern frontierwithout making air attacks on targets in Manchuria; and, even if thefrontier could be reached, it would be a difficult task to hold it along aline of about 450 miles in mountainous country. Korea was of nostrategic importance to the democratic Powers; and further operationsthere should now be conducted with a view to preventing any exten-sion of the conflict and avoiding any lasting commitment in this area.39668-2 b 2
With this in view the Chiefs of Staff Committee favoured the with-drawal of United Nations forces to a shorter line across the neck ofthe country, running from Chongju to Tokchon, roughly along the40th Parallel. In addition to being a much shorter line to defend, thiswould have the great advantage of leaving a buffer area to the north,on the Korean side of the Manchurian frontier, in which military targets could be attacked from the air without the grave internationalrisks involved in making air attacks on targets within Manchuria. Itmight be possible to declare this buffer area to be a demilitarised zone,with the reservation that any offensive concentration of Chinese orNorth Korean troops within that area would be liable to air attack.A cease-fire might be arranged on the basis of that line, pending theresult of discussions in the Security Council. Meanwhile, united nations forces would be free to clear up the guerrilla activities to thesouth,The Foreign Secretary said that this proposal, which was putforward by the Chiefs of Staff on military grounds, was in accord withhis political objectives. He was anxious to prevent the United StatesGovernment from being led by their military advisers into policies which would provoke further intervention by China. He was alsoanxious to do everything he could to allay the reasonable fears of theChinese lest the Western Powers should occupy large areas of Asianterritory under a plea of military necessity. It would be reassuringto public opinion throughout Asia if it could be made clear that united nations forces were not offering any threat to China. The moment was ripe for putting forward in the Security Council a comprehensivesolution of the Korean problem; and he would like to have the cabinet&apos;s authority to seek agreement on the basis of a buffer area on the lines suggested by the Chiefs of Staff Committee. It would help him in securing such an agreement if he could take a rather moreforthcoming attitude towards the amount of the contribution to bemade by the United Kingdom towards the fund for reconstruction in korea.In the Cabinet&apos;s discussion there was general support for this line of policy, which would enable both the Americans and theChinese to modify their present attitude without loss of prestige andalso held the promise that a larger proportion of the further expendi-ture of the United Nations in Korea might be directed towardsreconstruction rather than hostilities.In the discussion the following specific points were made:  (a) The proposed buffer area should be wholly within north korea. There were some indications that the political authorities inthe United States might be thinking in terms of a buffer area including some part of Manchuria; and the Cabinet were not disposed tosupport such a proposal.Kb) Who would be responsible for administering this buffer area?Would it be possible to arrange that, at an early stage, the Chineseshould be associated with its administration?The Foreign Secretary said that he would like further time toconsider this aspect of the problem.(c) His Majesty&apos;s representative in Peking had been instructedto explain orally to British nationals that it would be advisable for those who were able to do so to make arrangements to leave China.Might this not give the impression that we were contemplating actionwhich would give rise to hostilities between this country and China?The Foreign Secretary said that the evacuation of British women and children from China was to be imdertaken unobtrusively. Evenif it came to notice, he doubted whether it would influence the policyof the Chinese Government. And in any event he thought it unfair,both to British nationals and to the British authorities in China, toaccept the risk of taking no steps to remove the women and childrenbefore the situation deteriorated still further.
(d) The proposal to create a buffer area to the north of the40th Parallel should give rise to no legal difficulties.(e) Before this policy was put forward in the Security Council,we should seek support for it from the United States Government andthe Governments of other Commonwealth countries. The first step would be to approach the political and military authorities in washington.Contribution , The Cabinet next considered, in the light of the discussiontowards recorded above, what contribution the United Kingdom GovernmentReconstruction might make towards the United Nations fund for reconstruction inin Korea.        Korea.  In CP. (50) 268 it had been proposed that the Minister of(Previous        State should in the first instance offer a contribution of  5 million and reference:      should be authorised, if pressed, to increase this to a maximum otCM. (50) 72nd  10 million, provided that this could be presented as no more thanConclusions,    our proportionate share of a United Nations programme.   the minute 5.)      Cabinet were informed that, since this memorandum was circulated,the United States Ambassador had strongly urged that our offer should not be limited to our proportionate share.  He had indicated that the United States Government were likely to offer to contribute65 per cent, of the total cost; and he had expressed the hope thatthe United Kingdom Government would also come forward with a generous offer.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not think it reasonable that the United Kingdom contribution should exceed ourproportionate share of a United Nations fund in the same ratio asthe offer which was likely to be made by the United States Govern-ment. Moreover, as the United States and Commonwealth countries had borne almost the whole of the financial burden of the militaryoperations in Korea, it was important that other members of theUnited Nations should make a substantial contribution towards thereconstruction fund. If, however, a forthcoming attitude on this point would assist in securing agreement to the general policy which wewere about to propose for securing a settlement in Korea, then, subjectto the two points which he had mentioned, he would be prepared toagree that the Minister of State should be authorised to offer, in negotiation, to increase our contribution up to a maximum of 12 million.In discussion the point was made that much of the reconstructionrequired resulted from damage done.in the course of military opera-tions by the United Nations forces. On similar occasions in thefuture, it might be advisable on this account to ask military commanders to take special steps to ensure that such operations didnot involve any more damage than was strictly necessary for military purposes.Formosa. The Cabinet were informed that the question of Formosa was(Previous likely to come up for discussion in the Security Council in the nearReference: future; and that representatives of the Chinese Communist Govern-CM. (50) 55th ment were expected to attend for the purpose of expressing their conclusions. views on this question. The Cabinet would wish to have an oppor-minute (2).) tunity of considering the line which was to be taken by the UnitedKingdom representative in these discussions on the Security Council.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Defence,to arrange for the immediate despatch of a telegram to HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington inviting him toascertain whether the United States Government would beready to support an attempt to secure a comprehensive settlement of the Korean question along the lines indicatedin the Cabinefs discussion. Similar instructions should atthe same time be sent to the Chairman of the British Joint
Staff Mission so that a simultaneous approach could.bemade to both the military and the political authorities in washington. The telegram should be repeated, forinformation, to the United Kingdom representative on theSecurity Council.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to inform the other Commonwealth Governments of the approach which was to be made to the United StatesGovernment, and to seek their support for the general line of policy which was being proposed.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Minister of Statethat, in negotiating the amount of the United kingdom contribution towards the United Nations fund for recon-struction in Korea, against the background of the generalpolicy mentioned in Conclusion (1) above, he had authority in the last resort to offer a contribution of 12 million, if he was satisfied that other members of theUnited Nations were ready to make a reasonable contri-bution to the fund.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit at an early date amemorandum on the line to be taken, on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government, in the forthcoming dis-cussions in the Security Council on the question of formosa.Germany.Soviet Proposalfor Meeting of council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 71stConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 266) outlining the discussions which had takenplace with the United States and French Governments about theproposal of the Soviet Government for four-Power discussions on germany, and setting out the draft of a public statement which he wished to make in the House of Commons.The Foreign Secretary said that he was working towards the convening of a meeting of deputies to arrange the agenda for ameeting of the four Foreign Ministers. Unless agreement could besecured beforehand to a comprehensive agenda, a meeting of foreign ministers would be used by the Soviet Government for propaganda purposes and would produce no useful result. A meeting of deputieswould afford an opportunity of determining whether the SovietGovernment were genuinely anxious to discuss all the main out-standing questions which were causing friction and ill-will betweenEast and West. Meanwhile, he wished to give a broad indication ofthe attitude of the United Kingdom Government to the Sovietapproach, in line with public statements which had already been madeon behalf of the Governments of the United States and France.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The United Kingdom Government wished to explore everypracticable means of ending the state of tension between Russia andthe democratic countries and, if it was clear that the Soviet Govern-ment genuinely desired a conference for the purpose of seeking asolution of all outstanding difficulties, this country would gladlyco-operate. The draft statement might with advantage place moreemphasis on this fact. The passage indicating that the Governmentwould welcome an opportunity to bring the present international tension to an end through negotiation should therefore precede thepassage rejecting the present initiative by the Soviet Government.(b) It was necessary to indicate without qualification that thePrague communique afforded no basis for discussion, since any quali-fied suggestion that it did afford a basis for a meeting of foreign ministers would be used by the Soviet Government as justifyinginsistence that the discussion at the meeting should turn wholly on theproposals in the Prague communique.
(c) It was suggested that the Governments of the United States,France and this country should at some stage issue a statementexpressing the fervent wish of the Western world for a peaceful settlement of present difficulties, and indicating that these difficulties had been created by the Soviet Government and could be removed bythem. A joint statement of this kind, which asked the Soviet bloc toco-operate in securing world peace and set out without rancour the causes of the existing state of tension and the desire of the Westerndemocracies to see it ended, might do much to deprive the SovietGovernment of their propaganda initiative. The timing of any suchjoint statement would require consideration in relation to the contem-plated meeting of Foreign Ministers.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make in the House ofCommons that day a statement regarding the Soviet proposalfor a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, on thelines set out in Annex B of CP. (50) 266 subject to recastingdesigned to meet the points raised in the Cabinefs discussion.WorldPeaceCongress.(previous reference:CM. (50) 72ndConclusions,Minute 8.)4. The Home Secretary said that he was to answer that afternoon a Private Notice Question about the circumstances in whicha number of foreign delegates to the World Peace Congress atSheffield had been refused admission to this country. He proposed,in reply, to make it clear that applications for entry had beenconsidered on their merits. As regards admission of persons requiringvisas for travel to this country, he would indicate that 573 applicationsfor visas had been made and 301 granted, but that only 88 persons to whom visas had been granted had presented themselves at UnitedKingdom ports and that 75 had been given leave to land. As regardsforeigners not requiring visas, 122 had been given leave to land and106 refused.In discussion, it was suggested that the proposed answer should contain a clear indication that the Home Secretary had acted ongenerally accepted principles in deciding who should be admitted andwho should be excluded, and had not endeavoured by an arbitrary useof his powers to deny free speech and the right to hold public meetings. He should make it clear that the application of each alienwas considered separately in the light of such information as theGovernment possessed about his past and present activities and thecloseness of his relationship to the Cominform.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, in reply to the Private notice question which was to be put to him later that day aboutthe admission of foreigners travelling to the Shemeid PeaceCongress, to cover the points suggested in the cabinets discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,13th November, 1950.
