1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.2. The Cabinet considered a draft of a statement which theMinister of Defence had undertaken to make in the House ofCommons about the course of the military operations in Korea.It was agreed that the draft could with advantage be condensedinto a much shorter statement; and that passages should be addedexpressing appreciation of the conduct of British troops in korea and sympathy with the relatives of men who had been killed in these operations. It was further agreed that, in replying to supplementaryquestions, the Minister of Defence should avoid being drawn intostatements about the future course of the operations and othermatters involving questions of foreign policy.In discussion, Ministers asked whether adequate arrangements were being made to provide for British troops, in Korea the equip-ment and comforts which they would require in the severe winterweather to which they would now be subjected. It would be unfor-unfortunate if their conditions were compared unfavourably with thoseof United States troops serving in the same theatre. Now that a moreprolonged campaign was in prospect the Ministers concerned should review these matters, including the rates of pay for national servicemenserving in Korea.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to amend his proposed state-ment about the course of the military operations in Koreaon the lines indicated in the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultationwith the Service Ministers and, if necessary, the Chancellorof the Exchequer, whether further steps should be takento ensure that the conditions of British troops in Koreaduring the forthcoming winter would be such as to give no reasonable grounds for public anxiety or criticism.3. The Cabinet were informed that, in accordance with their decision of 9th November, the Ministers directly concerned hadreviewed the possibility of importing turkeys for Christmas fromHungary or Canada. Turkeys could not be imported from Hungaryunless it was decided to lift the boycott on trade between this countryand Hungary, which had been imposed in retaliation against theimprisonment of Mr Edgar Saunders, a British businessman. TheForeign Secretary was satisfied that such a relaxation of the reside-tions would be interpreted as a sign of weakness on our part, whichwould handicap him in all his dealings with countries in the Sovietorbit. The Chancellor of the Exchequer took the view that, if theUnited Kingdom now spent dollars on the purchase of turkeys from canada, he would have difficulty in restraining the dollar expenditureof other Commonwealth countries, such as Australia It was there-fore recommended that no steps should be taken to increase Christmassupplies of turkeys by imports from either Hungary or Canada.Discussion showed that opinion was divided on this question. Infavour of making these purchases, it was argued that the Governmentwould be exposed to severe political criticism if people in this country were unable to obtain their traditional fare at Christmas time. It wassuggested that a decision to import turkeys from Hungary need notnecessarily involve abandoning the whole of the existing boycott oftrade between this country and Hungary: the Government should beable to resist demands that similar concessions should be made toother trades. It was also doubted whether the boycott could be madewholly effective, so long as the Soviet Government were able to meet 1 b t
Hungafy&apos;s essential heeds for sterling. Finally, it was suggested thatthe United ^Kingdom Government ought not, in principle, to use sucheconomic sanctions as these in suppport of their foreign policy, since a country so largely dependent on imports was not in a position toenforce such sanctions without damage to her economy.On the other side it was argued that it was the Governmenfsduty to do their utmost to protect their representatives in foreigncountries; and that it would be contrary to British traditions toneglect that duty for the sake of securing increased supplies ofChristmas fare. The argument that economic sanctions should notbe used in support of foreign policy might have been a good reasonfor not imposing this boycott in the first instance: it could not offset the loss of prestige involved in abandoning those sanctions at thisstage. The original object of the proposal to import these turkeyshad been to bring down the retail price of turkeys to a point at whichthey could be bought by the poorer families; but it was doubtfulwhether sufficient quantities could be obtained from Hungary aloneto make any substantial difference in the retail price.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet lay against breaking theexisting boycott of trade between this country and Hungary for the sake of increasing the supplies of turkeys during the Christmasseason. The Foreign Secretary said that, so long as this point ofprinciple was maintained, he was ready to discuss with the ministers concerned whether other means could be found of increasing the christmas supplies of turkeys.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the existing restrictions on trade between thiscountry and Hungary should not be lifted for the purposeof enabling turkeys to be imported from Hungary for the christmas market.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider, withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the President of theBoard of Trade and the Minister of Food, whether other means could be found of increasing the Christmas suppliesof turkeys.Defence. 4.  The Cabinet resumed their discussion of a memorandum by(Previous the Prime Minister (CP. (50) 246) inviting the Cabinet to endorse the reference: conclusions of the Defence Committee on 25th October, 1950, aboutCM. (50) 72nd the financing of defence and to approve recommendations put forwardConclusions, by the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer aboutMinute 7.)       the attitude to be adopted towards United States offers of assistance.The Cabinet had also before them copies of memoranda oh the financing of defence and on the size and shape of the Armed Forces,1951-54, which had been prepared for the Defence Committee(CP. (50) 247 and 248).The Chancellor Of the Exchequer said that he advised the Cabinetto accept the United States offer of interim aid of $84 million for the dollar content of the  200 million instalment of the production programme to which the Government were already committed, butto reserve their position on the United States proposal to purchase$28 million worth of British equipment. If the latter proposal were accepted it might prejudice the position of this country under thefinal arrangements for the equitable distribution of the economicburden of rearmament, and it was not clear that equipment which theUnited States purchased from this country would, in fact, be left here.He supported the working out of a procedure for determining, on a multilateral basis, the equitable distribution between the partnercountries of the burden of North Atlantic defence; but at present theposition was complicated by the fact that, not only had a basis to befound for the equitable distribution of the burden, but agreement hadnot yet been reached on the size of the military preparations which
had to be made. The United States Government had made it clearthat they were not committed about the size of their military contribu-tion, pending a settlement of the difficulties raised by France to theproposals for German rearmament. He saw no alternative but toproceed with preparations on the basis of the  3,600 millionprogramme, on the understanding that this programme would haveto be reviewed in the light of later developments.the Minister of Defence said that^ as-he had made clear at the cabinet&apos;s meeting oh 9th November j he Was anxious to make further progress on the basis of the  3,600 million programme. He did not ask for more than general acceptance of the programme, so that forces could be built up and production orders placed in an orderly andbalanced way. He wished, however, to make it clear that, if present economic tendencies continued, there would be a sharp rise in the costof defence in the fourth year because of the steep rise in prices. Theposition would have to be reviewed in the light of developments inthe next three or four months. If the difficulties which had arisen inconnection with German rearmament were resolved and a UnitedStates Supreme Commander were appointed, it might then be easier to anticipate the extent of the contribution which the United states were prepared to make to North Atlantic defence.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) This country should continue to make it clear that it couldriot devote more of its national resources to defence than what it had proposed in connection with the Medium-Term Defence Plan. Thisshould be kept in mind in the working out of global defence needsby the military experts of the North Atlantic countries. While it was true that the United Kingdom Government could hot be committed to a larger programme than the Governmerit cbrisidered that theycould afford on economic and financial grounds, there was a risk thatundesirable pressure would be brought to bear on this country if, on military grounds, the military experts put forward a very large programme for consideration by the Governments of the countries concerned. Every endeavour should be made to ensure that whatwas economically practicable was kept in mind in the drawing up ofmilitary appreciations.(b) This country should not undertake to implement a defence programme beyond its resources on the basis that substantial financialassistance would be forthcoming from the United States, since that assistance might be the means by which undesirable economic or otherpressure would be brought to bear on the United Kingdom Govern-ment. From this angle it was satisfactory that the United States had shown a willingness to station substantial land forces on the continent of Europe. It was preferable that the United States contribution to north Atlantic defence should take the form of troops and equipmentrather than financial aid.(c) in working out, under the Nitze Plan, the contribution whichthis country should make to North Atlantic defence, full regard shouldbe had to this country&apos;s defence commitments in other parts of theworld.(d) The United States Government, in their aide-memoire of3rd October, 1950, on interim aid, had suggested that other parts ofthe sterling area should contribute to the defence effort of the&quot; UnitedKingdom. They had been led to make this suggestion by reason ofthe substantial income which some countries in the sterling area wereearning from the present high prices of raw materials. It would,however, be difficult to ask sterling area countries which were outsidethe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to make financial contribu-tions to North Atlantic defence while they were not cart of that organisation and did not benefit by it. The United States proposal would have to be taken up at a later stage when, in connection withthe defence of the Middle East and other areas, the question arose ofenlarging the scope of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.
The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusions of the Defence Committee aboutdefence expenditure, as set out in paragraph 3 of cp. (50) 246.(2) Approved the recommendations of the Foreign secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer about United Statesinterim aid and the equitable distribution of the burdenof North Atlantic defence, as set out in paragraph 30 ofthe memorandum annexed to CP. (50) 247.CoalSuppliesDuring Winter,1950-51.previous reference:CM. (50) 71stConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (50) 271) covering a report by the Official coal committee on coal prospects during the coming winter and theimmediate measures which might be taken to improve them.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was in broad agree-ment with the analysis and the remedies proposed in the official report.The fall in output during the past few weeks had been very serious and there was no doubt that immediate action must be taken. Thethree main factors which had contributed to the present situation hadbeen the large increase in domestic industrial demand, the fall in therate of increase in production in the mines, and the fall in the totalman-power which had led to a proportionately greater decrease inthe number of workers at the coal-face.The report of the Official Coal Committee gave a clear picture ofthe situation and the immediate decisions which must be made. Therecommendations made in the report, with which he was in agree-ment, were:-(a) that a decision should be taken in principle to reduce bunkersto the greatest extent possible without causing dislocation of shipping,the details to be worked out further by the Ministry of Fuel and power and the Ministry of Transport;(b) that a similar decision should be taken to reduce theinessential commercial use of lighting;(c) that the National Coal Board should be instructed to take immediate and energetic steps to import coal from the United States,of amounts up to one million tons in the first instance, but to beincreased if more could be obtained and shipped, subject to consul-tation between the Ministry of Fuel and Power and the Treasury;(d) that a Government announcement on the situation shouldbe made as soon as possible.The report also recommended that further consideration shouldbe given to the possibility of restoring control over coke supplies, andthat no further cuts should be made in exports at present. He agreed with these recommendations, but felt that officials should at onceCOI1 SI der the distribution of a further export cut, in case it shouldsubsequently become unavoidable, basing their examination on two alternative assumptions a cut of half a million tons and a cut ofone million tons.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he agreed with theproposal for importing coal from the United States. The political difficulties, though serious, were less than those which would follow a major fuel crisis. The prospective gap of nearly 2\ million tons in winter supplies was so great that lesser measure? would not suffice,and the recent trend in output was alarming. If it were decided to import coal, enough should be imported (up to i H million tons, oreven more) to enable us to face the risk of a cold winter and to main-tain exports at a reasonable level. He was doubtful of the advisability of restricting shop lighting, which was open to great political objec-tions and would not be necessary if adequate imports could beobtained. He would therefore prefer to defer a decision on thisproposal.
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It seemed clear that the sharp reduction in output was dueto the withdrawal of workers from the coal face, necessitated by the overall decrease in man-power. A further analysis of this trend was urgently needed, and the miners&apos; leaders should be consulted about it.(b) Very careful investigation was needed of the means ofarresting the decline in man-power. Full employment, the diversifiedeconomies of the mining areas, the smaller families of the miners andtheir reluctance to let their children go into the mines, must all betaken into account.(c) The two recent disasters in the mines had affected output andman-power. When the reports of the enquiries into these disastershad been published, urgent steps must be taken to restore confidence that everything possible was being done to prevent a repetition ofsuch incidents.(d) It was suggested that a supplementary pensions scheme would be the most effective way of keeping men in the mines. Sucha scheme might halve the loss of man-power among the older workers.Although this presented formidable difficulties, we could not afford,in the present difficult situation, to neglect a means of obtaining asubstantial increase in man-power.(e) In view of the shortage of coal in the United States, we mustbe sure, before facing the political difficulties that would follow froma decision to import, that adequate supplies of suitable qualities ofcoal could be obtained.(/) Some Ministers felt that the weekly figures of Output mightshow a substantial improvement very shortly, and that the seasonalspurt before Christmas might only be delayed. For this reason, eventhough it were decided in principle that coal should be imported ifpresent trends continued, might it not be wise to defer acting on thatdecision for a further week, or even two weeks?(g) The Minister of Transport said that if the situation was con-sidered to be so grave as to warrant a decision to import coal, hewould be prepared to accept the recommendation that up to 300,000tons should be obtained by savings on bunkering. He could not agreeto savings in excess of this, which could not be made without dislocation-tion of shipping.(h) The importance of proper distribution of stocks within thecountry was emphasised. It should be made clear before important decisions were made whether the levels of stocks for power stations,gas undertakings and industrial purposes were in fact likely to falldangerously low during the winter, and whether the best arrange-ments were being made to ensure mobility and a proper distributionof the stocks for each purpose.(i) The question of a further appeal to the miners was raised.On the one hand, it was suggested that such an appeal, combined withan appeal for economies in the use of coal, might prove sufficient. Onthe other hand, the view was expressed that any effect would beachieved too late to remove the need for imports of coal. Thepossibility of holding a conference of miners&apos; delegates, possibly on the shop-steward level, to be addressed by the Prime Minister and theMinister of Fuel and Power, was also discussed; but opinions were divided on the merits of this proposal.(j) The Foreign Secretary said that he agreed with the proposalto buy coal in the United States. He would, however, suggest thatthe coal should be bought and held there as a reserve available forsale to our foreign customers or for bunkering, as well as for import,as necessity arose, into the United Kingdom.It was generally agreed that, if a decision were taken to buy coal from the United States, it would be preferable to hold the coal therefor the time being as suggested by the Foreign Secretary. The fact ofthe purchase would be bound to become public, and its adversepolitical effect would be minimised by an early announcement coupled with an explanation that it had been made primarily to enable us tomeet our export commitments.
The Cabinet-Agreed to resume&quot; their discussion of C-P- (50) 271 on thefollowing day-leasehold reform.0*previous reference:CM. (50) 69thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (50) 272) on the application to the Crown of the leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions) Bill. This recommendedthat the provisions of the Bill in respect of shops should be binding on the Crown, subject to two safeguards:-(i) that a county court judge, in Considering whether to grant a new tenancy, should have regard to the interests involved where the premises belonged to a public authority; and(ii). that a Minister should be able to give a certificate whichshould not be open to question by a court that a shop or its site was required on grounds of national security.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 272.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th November, 1950
