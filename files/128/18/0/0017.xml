1.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda--(i) by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (50) 197) recommending thatthe Government should accept in principle a United States proposal that the General Assembly of the United Nations should recommendMember countries to earmark forces for service on behalf of theUnited Nations, to be called into action by the Security Council orby recommendation of the General Assembly; but should not support a United States proposal for the creation of a United NationsLegion;(ii) by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 205), pointing out thelegal difficulties of securing agreement, within the framework of theUnited Nations Charter, that earmarked forces should be used to stop aggression, and proposing that the General Assembly should encourage Members to enter into collective agreements against aggression under Article 51 of the Charter.The Minister of State said that there was little doubt that theUnited States Government ought to be dissuaded from pursuing theproposal for a United Nations Legion. The other suggestion that member countries should earmark forces which could be used on a recommendation by the General Assembly deserved, however, to besympathetically considered. The Americans recognised that onlyMembers who supported such a recommendation could be regardedas morally committed to make available the contingents which theyhad earmarked for United Nations use. There might be legal diffi-culties about this suggestion, as the Attorney-General suggested in his memorandum: there were probably legal difficulties in the way ofany attempt to get round the Soviet use of the veto in the security council. If, however, there was a determination to make the Charterwork, the wording of many of its provisions was sufficiently general to make it possible to get over the legal difficulties, particularly since the interpretation of these provisions would lie with a majorityof the Member States. Nor was he sure that, if the matter was referred to the International Court, that body would necessarily takea narrow view of the provisions of the Charter. The Attorney-General&apos;s proposal of a world-wide defensive pact between the demo-cratic nations, on the lines of the North Atlantic Pact, was funda-mentally more drastic than the United States proposal, and hithertoour policy had been to avoid action which would provoke Russiaand her satellites to leave the United Nations. He hoped, therefore,that the Cabinet would authorise the Foreign Secretary to discussthe United States proposal sympathetically, while arranging at thesame time for further examination to be made of the legal questions raised by the Attorney-General.The Attorney-General said that he saw no difficulty in thesuggestion that the General Assembly should recommend member states to earmark forces to be available at short notice on behalf ofthe United Nations. The difficulty lay in providing legal means of bringing those forces into action and controlling their operation.Under the Charter it was for the Security Council, and not theGeneral Assembly, to initiate military action; and he believed thatthis view of the Charter would be upheld by the International Courtif the question were referred to it. Russia would doubtless dislikean enlargement of the Atlantic Pact to provide against aggressionanywhere in the world, but he did not see on what grounds she couldobject and it would, of course, be open to Russia to join such a Pactif she were so minded.In subsequent discussion it was agreed that there was serious objection to the proposal for a United Nations Legion and that theForeign Secretary should endeavour to dissuade the United StatesGovernment from pursuing that proposal.As regards the proposal to earmark national contingents forprompt service under the United Nations, it was pointed out that a force of this kind could not be used effectively in a major war andthat its organisation, control and maintenance as a fighting force
would present formidable difficulties. It had, however, been recog-nised from the outset that the machinery of the United Nations wouldnot be effective for dealing with aggression by one of the major powers; and the United States proposal, which bore some resem-blance to earlier ideas of an international police force, was intendedto deal with acts of aggression by minor Powers, though promptedperhaps by one of the major Powers. In such a case it would almost certainly fall to one of the major Powers to take prompt initial action with forces available in that theatre; but the earmarked contingentscould then be used to reinforce these forces. It was with this in mind that the Chiefs of Staff had not raised objections on military grounds to the United States proposal. The proposal had also some advan-tages in helping countries to overcome domestic difficulties inundertaking military commitments on behalf of the United Nations.At the same time the practical difficulties should not be overlooked.The strategic reserves held in this country were never likely to be large and might at any time have to be employed to meet an actual or potential threat of hostilities in any part of the world or to rein-force the occupying forces in Germany. If a proportion of the strategic reserves had to be earmarked for use under the united nations, their mobility would be correspondingly diminished and itmight be necessary to maintain larger forces than would otherwise be required.The Cabinet then discussed whether, in respect of the use ofearmarked contingents or other military action by Members of theUnited Nations, an endeavour should be made to bring military measures into effect by a recommendation of the General Assembly,or whether it should be recognised that the United Nations was unlikely to be effective in dealing with aggression by a major Powerand that reliance should rather be placed on a world-wide collectivepact between the democratic nations. In discussion the followingpoints were made:  (a) It should be recognised that under the United nations charter as it now stood it was unlikely that immediate and effective action could be taken in the event of further aggression promoted by the Soviet Government. The circumstances which had enabled the Security Council to act in regard to Korea were not likely torecur. This weakness in the United Nations was an encouragement to aggression and a threat to world peace; and the democraciesshould be better organised to deal quickly and collectively with any use of force in any part of the world.(b) Because of the susceptibilities of public opinion in theircountry the United States Government were particularly anxious thatany military action to stop aggression should be taken under the aegis of the United Nations. Some Ministers thought that public opinion in most countries would not be satisfied with an arrangement, on thelines suggested by the Attorney-General, under which Ambassadorsin Washington could decide whether a case of aggression had occurredwhich called for the use of military force under some world-widecollective security pact. At the same time, it was pointed out that public opinion was primarily concerned to ensure that mechanismexisted which would deter a potential aggressor and that it waspossible to over-estimate the importance attached to action beingtaken in the name of the United Nations. The people of this country had certainly welcomed the Atlantic Pact.(c) There was general agreement that no hasty step should betaken which might disrupt the United Nations; but opinion was divided on the question whether a world-wide security pact betweenthe democratic nations would cause the Communist countries to leavethe United Nations. Ministers had not had sufficient time toweigh the repercussions of entering into such a pact, and therewere several forms which any enlargement of the Atlantic Pact might take. Thus, instead of a world-wide pact, there might be a series of regional pacts. . It was not necessary for a final view to be taken on
Employmentof NationalServicemenon active service.(previous reference:CM. (50) 54thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for War (CP. (50) 203) proposing that, when national service was extended to two years, national servicemen who were over nineteenyears of age and fully trained should be used on active service.The Secretary of State for War said that in a major war it wouldnot be practicable to differentiate between the use made of regularsand of national servicemen, and the same rule should be applied inregard to active service in Korea and elsewhere. This meant no morethan the maintenance of the traditional rule of the British Army that men were not sent into action until they had reached the age ofnineteen years and had been adequately trained. Any other policy would present formidable practical difficulties.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Secretary of State for Air supported the proposal madeby the Secretary of State for War. The First Lord of the Admiraltymade it clear that this proposal would not apply to the Royal Navy.Young men in the Navy who were under nineteen years of age couldnot be exempted from sea-service; and there could be no guarantee that ships in which they were serving would not become involved inactive operations.(b) Any suggestion that national servicemen engaged on active service should receive the same pay as regulars would require careful examination lest it introduced other anomalies: thus, regular soldierson active service did not receive more pay than those serving elsewhere.(c) Service in Malaya had not been regarded as active service,and national servicemen would continue to be sent there. Govern-ment policy on this point had been announced some time ago andthere was no reason for reversing the decision then taken.The Cabinet-Agreed that, when the period of national service was extended to two years, national servicemen, like regulars inthis question at the present stage of exploration of the United states proposals.(d) The Foreign Secretary, in CP. (50) 196, had drawn attentionto the fact that this country could not afford to dispense with the vetoin the Security Council. Was it proposed that there should be a vetopower in any world-wide collective security pact, particularly if russia and her satellites were free to join it? In reply it was statedthat under a world-wide security pact, as under the Atlantic Pact, any decision to take military action to resist aggression would be reached by majority decision.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to dissuade the United StatesGovernment from pursuing the proposal for the creationof a United Nations Legion.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to explore sympatheticallywith the United States Secretary of State the proposal toearmark national contingents to be used on behalf of theUnited Nations on a recommendation of the General .Assembly; but invited him to avoid committing himself in principle in favour of this proposal and to ensure thatthe serious legal and practical difficulties of the proposal were fully investigated.(3) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of alternative means of creating an effective system of collective security against any act of aggression committedor instigated by a major Power in any part of the world.
the Army and R.A.F. should not be sent into action before they had reached the age of nineteen years and had completed adequate training.Recall of 3.  The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for handling the de-Parliament, bate on defence, and the proceedings on the National Service Biii,(Previous during the forthcoming sittings of Parliament. It now appeared that reference: the Government could not count on getting the Bill passed through allCM.

Qf Lords and receive the Royal Assent on Tuesday, 19th September.This could not be finally decided until consultations had been com-pleted both with Government supporters and with the opposition leaders in both Houses. In the light of those consultations a BusinessStatement could be made at the opening of the sittings on the follow-ing day.strategic exports to eastern europe and China.(previous reference:CM. (50) 55thConclusions,Minute 7.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (CP. (50) 204) reporting the results of the consideration which had been given, in pursuance of the Cabinefs conclusion of 4th September, to the issues involved in imposing further restrictionson exports to Eastern Europe and China. The memorandum sub-mitted the following recommendations for the Cabinefs approval:  (i) that goods should not be exported to Eastern Europe or othercountries if they were required, or likely to be required,for the defence needs of the Commonwealth or of north atlantic Treaty Powers;(ii) that a detailed scheme for this purpose should be worked out,after consultation with the Law Officers on the legal diffi-culties of interfering with supplies under existing contracts and agreements;(iii) that the Ministry of Supply should requisition such of the machine tools now being produced for export by Messrs.Craven Bros., as were necessary for our : defence programme;(iv) that the Security Export Controls Working Party should pre-pare a list of additional goods whose export to eastern europe and to China might be quantitatively restricted;and that in the meantime administrative steps should betaken to reduce the volume of those supplies; and(v) that the Foreign Secretary should discuss with the UnitedStates Government the possibility of finding some com-promise solution in regard to the extent of the prohibitionof exports to Communist countries.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) With reference to recommendation (iii) above, The Ministerof Supply said that, although there was still some uncertainty on thepoint, it now seemed likely that the particular machine tool which he required from the programme of Messrs. Craven Bros., was beingmanufactured for export to Poland, not to Russia; and the Anglo-Polish Trade Agreement had contained an assurance that the UnitedKingdom Government would not obstruct the delivery of goodsordered under it. If this were so and this particular machine tool were now requisitioned, the Government would doubtlefss be charged withbreach of faith. The legal position would be considered by the LawOfficers; and a statement covering both the facts and the legal ques-tions involved would be forwarded to the Prime Minister for his usein the forthcoming debate.It was recognised that there might be cases in which it would be inexpedient, for contractual reasons, to requisition goods which would
be of value for our own defence programme; and it would thereforebe wiser to say, in any general statement on this question, that requisi-tioning powers would be used in appropriate cases.(b) The Cabinet endorsed the general policy that in present cir-cumstances goods should not be exported if they were required tomeet the defence needs of Commonwealth countries or of north atlantic Treaty Powers. It was, however, recognised that, apart fromthe legal difficulties mentioned in paragraph (a) above, this policy would also be open to the criticism that there were certain goods which would be of some strategic value to Russia or her satelliteseven though they were not required for the defence programmes ofourselves and our Allies. In practice, however, this difficulty couldbe met to some extent by instructing Departments to place a broadinterpretation on what was needed for Allied defence programmes.(c) Was there not some risk that the administrative measures proposed in recommendation (iv) above might provoke retaliatory action by the Soviet Government? Should such a risk be accepteduntil we had been assured that the United States Government wouldcompensate us for any loss of essential imports from Eastern Europe,e.g., timber or coarse grains? It was explained that these recom-mendations were aimed mainly at the orders which were now being received, particularly from China, for abnormally large quantities ofcertain commodities, e.g., wire, which might be needed for war pur-poses. It should be possible in these cases to confine deliveries to thenormal amounts without risk of provoking retaliatory action.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the recommendations made in paragraph 5 of cp. (50) 204 and summarised in paragraphs (i) to (v)above.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Rela-tions to inform other Commonwealth Governments of thepolicy which the United Kingdom Government were pro-posing to follow in this matter.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Wth September, 1950.
