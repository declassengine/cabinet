1. The Cabinet were informed that the Soviet Government had that morning published a summary of the messages which had passed between the United Kingdom Government and the Soviet Govern-ment following our initial request that the Soviet Government should use their influence with the North Koreans to bring about animmediate cessation of hostilities and the withdrawal of north korean forces north of the 38th Parallel. In these circumstances it would be difficult to delay making a statement in Parliament about these exchanges; and, if this was to be complete, it should cover our reply to the latest Russian message, the terms of which had beendiscussed by the Cabinet on 18th July. This reply had not yet beensent, as the United States Government had been given an oppor-tunity to comment on it. The Cabinet agreed, however, that in viewof the announcement now made by the Soviet Government HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Moscow should be instructed forthwith to deliver this reply and its terms should be disclosed in the Parlia-mentary statement about these exchanges.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a full statement should be made that afternoon in both Houses of Parliament regarding the approacheswhich the United Kingdom Government had made to theSoviet Government with a view to securing a cessation ofhostilities in Korea.President The Cabinet considered the terms of the Message which president truman&apos;s       Truman had sent to Congress on the previous day asking for the message to     immediate grant of $10,000 million for the United States armed forcesCongress.        and foreshadowing requests for further sums for military aid to the atlantic Pact Powers and other nations vital to American security.There was general agreement that the Prime Minister shouldmake an early statement welcoming this further initiative by president truman. This statement should, however, be so framed that, whileit would not convey to American opinion the impression that we intended to leave the United States to carry an undue share of theburden, it would not commit the United Kingdom Government toan unspecified increase in their current rate of defence expenditure.It was undesirable that the Government should be drawn into any discussion of increased expenditure on defence in advance of the debate on defence questions which was to take place on 26th July.From this point of view it would be preferable that the statement should not be made in Parliament but should be issued to the Press.In further discussion it was suggested that the Cabinet should consider at an early date what course they would pursue if the UnitedStates became involved in hostilities with China as a result of their current policy in respect of Formosa.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Prime Minister to issue that day a statementwelcoming the fresh initiative taken by President Trumanin his latest Message to Congress.2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (50) 174) on the question whether legislation shouldbe introduced which would have the effect of making it an offencefor any person to interfere, or to incite others to interfere, with supplies destined for units of His Majesty&apos;s forces engaged in active operations in pursuance of the Governments international obliga-tions or of the United Nations Charter.The  Home  Secretary   said   that  he had  been  disturbedto find that if, for example, dockers refused to handle suppliesdestined for His Majesty&apos;s ships now operating off Korea, there was39204-1 R 7Interferencewith military supplies.discussions with Russia.(previous reference:   5CM. (50) 47thConclusions,Minute 1.)
no means under the existing law of dealing with them or with personswho might have incited them to withhold their labour in these circum-stances. This situation had already arisen in Australia and in France;and he thought that, if it should arise in this country, the Govern-ment should not be found without adequate powers of dealing with it. If such powers were to be taken, it was for consideration whetherthey should be so framed as to extend to interference with thedespatch of supplies to Malaya, where British troops were engagedin operations which did not arise from the Governments obligations under the United Nations Charter.The Cabinet were also informed that the preliminary enquiries into the recent explosions of ammunition in Portsmouth dockyardleft little doubt that these were due to a deliberate act of sabotage.If so, this would be a specific instance of deliberate interference with supplies destined for the operations in Korea; and, when the factsbecame known, the Government were likely to be pressed to say whether they had sufficient powers to deal effectively with those responsible for such acts.The Attorney-General said that the powers available underthe existing law were not sufficient to enable the Government todeal effectively with the contingencies to which the Home secretary had drawn attention in CP. (50) 174. Further thought should, how-ever, be given to the form which any amending legislation shouldtake. In his view it would be inexpedient to relate such legislation to operations undertaken in pursuance of the United nations charter. This would involve the prosecution in argument about thenature of the legal obligations flowing from the Charter and, as theCabinet were aware, the legal^ position was far from clear. More-over, it was not difficult to envisage circumstances in which collectiveaction might have to be taken outside the framework of the Charter for example, under the North Atlantic Treaty, when the use of theveto in the Security Council had precluded action under the Charter.He would therefore prefer that the legislation should take the formof making it an offence for any person to perform any act which was designed to interfere with the movement of supplies destined for use by units of His Majesty&apos;s forces engaged in any active operations, or was calculated to assist the forces opposed to His Majesty&apos;s forces inthose operations. He envisaged a permanent Act which could bebrought into effect by an Order-in-Council in relation to anyparticular military operations.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was suggested that this legislation might follow the general pattern of Regulations 2A and 2B of the Defence (General) Regula-tions, 1939; and that cases of incitement might be covered by aprovision on the lines of Defence Regulation 90 penalising actspreparatory to the commission of the substantive offence.(b) The Cabinet were reminded that the comparable provisions in the Defence Regulations had contained a proviso that no person should be guilty of an offence under them by reason only of taking part in a strike or peaceably persuading any person to do so. would it be necessary to include a similar saving in the permanent legislationnow proposed? If so, and if it extended to unofficial!strikes, one ofthe principal dangers of the present situation would be jleft uncovered.The Attorney-General suggested that any slaving of thiskind might be limited to legal strikes in furtherance of a legitimatetrade dispute.I(c) Was it intended that this legislation should be passed beforeParliament rose for the Summer Recess? It was suggested that, if it became publicly known that the Portsmouth explosion was due tosabotage, Parliament might be in the mood to pass such legislationwith little discussion. In any event, it was desirable that draft legis-lation should be prepared as quickly as possible, so that, even if it
3 Ccould not be passed in the following week, it would be ready forimmediate introduction if it became necessary to summon Parliamentduring the course of the Summer Recess by reason of some deterioration-tion in the international situation.I The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the attorney-General and the Lord Advocate, to arrange forthe immediate preparation of draft legislation on thelines approved in the Cabinefs discussion which wouldhave the effect of making it an offence for any person tointerfere with supplies destined for use by units of HisMajesty&apos;s forces engaged in active operations at times when the country was not technically in a state of war.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of this question, onthe basis of a draft Bill, early in the following week.(3) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to consult with thePrime Minister about the handling of any public announcement regarding the causes of the recent explo-sion in Portsmouth dockyard.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the the House of Commons in the following week.House of On 24th July there would be a debate on civil defence.   It wasCommons. agreed that junior Ministers should speak on the Government^behalf in this debate. They should not attempt to conceal the defi-ciencies in our civil defence preparations, and should take the line that these were due to a deliberate decision of policy by whichvirtually all the resources available for defence preparations had hitherto been allocated to measures of active defence.A general debate on defence would be held on 26th July. Thefirst Government spokesman on that occasion would be the Ministerof Defence, and the Prime Minister would reply to the debate.Newsprint 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the President of(Previous the Board of Trade (CP. (50) 173) drawing attention to the seriousReference: shortage of newsprint for newspapers in this country, and suggestingCM. (49) 66th that the position should be alleviated by making dollars available for conclusions, the purchase of 37,500 tons of newsprint from Canada in the minute 4.)       second half of 1951 and 20,000 fathoms of pulp-wood from New-foundland, and by limiting exports of home-produced newsprint to100,000 tons in 1951.The President of the Board of Trade said that the newspaper proprietors were blaming the Government for the fact thatit had become necessary to reduce the size of newspapers from sevenpages to six since 1st July.. The Newsprint Supply Company, whichacted on behalf of the newspaper industry, had found difficulty in negotiating contracts in Canada because of the strength of the UnitedStates demand and they were pressing for authority to negotiate thepurchase of Canadian newsprint in respect of the second half of 1951.The newspaper proprietors would like to see some reduction in theexport of home-produced newsprint; but, although this was beingexported mainly to countries, such as Australia, which enjoyed much larger newspapers than this country, it made a valuable contributionto our balance of payments. The newspapers had not made profitableuse of the extra page which had been made available to them during and after the Election period, but the Government should not be
drawn into controversy with the industry on this issue. If ministers were to decide that it was undesirable that daily newspapers should fall below six pages, the policy in regard to the import of material andthe export of newsprint would have to be adjusted accordingly.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he thoughtit would be unfortunate if the newspapers had to be reduced in size below six pages. At the same time it was important that the exports of newsprint should be maintained, since this was a stableform of export which was the subject of long-term contracts and any breach of these contracts would be very undesirable. He was pre-pared to make dollars available for the purchase of 37,500 tons of newsprint from Canada in the second half of 1951 and to agree to theproposed purchase of pulp-wood from Newfoundland.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The export programme for newsprint should be maintained at 100,000 tons for 1951, since otherwise various expedients wouldbe pressed, such as an Australian proposal for the waiving ofpreference to enable them to purchase from Scandinavia, and a SouthAfrican proposal to provide dollars for the purchase of pulp-woodwhich would be processed in this country.(b) Every endeavour should be made to inform Colonial Govern-ments within the next few weeks of the newsprint supplies which theymight expect to receive in 1951.(c) While the Government should indicate that, in their view, the weekly provincial papers should not be starved of supplies of news-print for the benefit of the daily national newspapers, it would be undesirable to make this a condition of the authority to purchaseCanadian supplies in the second half of 1951.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in paragraph 21 of CP. (50)173 regarding the import and export of newsprint.InternationalLabourConventions.(previous reference:CM. (50) 27thConclusion!,Minute 4.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (50) 170)submitted by the Minister of Labour in response to their request of1st May, on the extent to which countries had ratified Conventions,and accepted Recommendations, adopted at sessions of the inter-national Labour Conference.The Minister of Labour said that, in considering the table of ratifications annexed to his memorandum, comparison would doubtless be made between the position of the United Kingdom,which had ratified 45 Conventions, and of the United States,which had ratified only five. Federal States were, however, in a difficulty over ratification and a detailed study of the action takenby individual States of the Union would disclose a more favourable position. There was now a regular procedure by which the Inter-national Labour Office enquired about the progress of ratifications and there was a general tendency for the number of ratifications toincrease.In discussion there was general agreement that this country&apos;policy of giving full effect to the provisions of a Convention whichit had ratified placed it at a disadvantage compared with countrieswhich signed with no intention of ratifying, or ratified with no seriousintention of giving effect to the provisions. At the same time, even where Conventions were not enforced, because of the1 weakness oflabour organisations or for other reasons, the acceptance of aConvention and the passage of any national legislation based upon itenabled pressure to be brought to bear for the adoption of higher standards.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (50) 170.
Native-BomAdministratorsin the ColonialCivil Service.(previous reference:CM. (50) 30thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-tary of State for the Colonies (CP. (50) 171) on the steps which werebeing taken to introduce an adequate proportion of native-bornadministrators into the higher grades of the Colonial Civil Service,particularly in Colonies which were progressing towards self-government.I The Secretary of State for the Colonies reminded hiscolleagues that the Cabinet had asked for this informationwhen discussing on 11th May the progress of Nigeria towards self-government. The application of the policy of employing native-born administrators was somewhat uneven, because of differingconditions in different Colonies. It largely depended on theprovision of educational facilities for the training of students, eitherthrough scholarships tenable in the United Kingdom, or by estab-lishing Universities in the Colonies concerned, which was thepreferable course where practicable. It was essential to hold a balance between progress towards self-government in the political field and the recruitment of native-born administrators for the higher posts in the local Civil Service.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (50) 171.Civil ServiceSalaries.(previous reference:CM. (49) 57thConclusions,Minute 2.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that on 26thSeptember, 1949, the Cabinet had decided that, in consequenceof the devaluation of sterling, it was necessary to postpone the bringing into operation of the new scales of salary for higher civil Servants which were to have been introduced progressively from 1st October, 1949. That decision had been related to the policy ofintensified restraint of wage increases which had been adopted in theautumn of 1949 in order to secure the full benefits of devaluation;and, when the decision had been announced, the Government hadexpressly stated that they hoped that no long postponement would be involved, that pensions would meanwhile be based on the salarieswhich would have been paid but for this further measure of post-ponement, and that the new salary scales would in any event be fullyoperative by October 1951.The Chancellor said that the further statement on general wages policy which, with the Cabinefs approval, he had made in the Houseof Commons on 3rd July, 1950, marked the beginning of a new phasein the development of the policy of wage restraint. It meant, ineffect, the abandonment of the specially rigid restraint introducedafter devaluation, and a return to the policy set out in the white paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices (Cmd. 7321). In viewof this modification of general wages policy, he thought it impossibleto defer any longer the bringing into operation of the new scales of salary for higher Civil Servants which had been approved in the summer of 1949 as being consistent with the White Paper and deferredat the last moment by reason of devaluation. He therefore proposedthat the gradual introduction of the new scales should begin on1st October, 1950, and should proceed by stages until the new scaleswere fully effective by October 1951. The Minister of Labour, whom he had consulted, had advised him that an announcement to this effect, if made before the annual conference of the Trades UnionCongress in September, would not embarrass, and might even help,the Trade Union Council in its efforts to persuade the Congress toaccept a policy of restraint provided that it was made clear in theannouncement that the Governments decision was taken within ageneral policy of restraint and that the new salary scales would not bebrought into full operation forthwith.The Chancellor suggested that announcement of the decision should be deferred until after Parliament had risen for the Summer
Recess, but that it should be made well before the annual conferenceof the Trades Union Congress.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the new scales of salary for higher Civil Servantsrecommended by the Chorley Committee should bebrought into operation from 1st October, 1950, by stages,and that the new scales should be fully effective by october 1951.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthis decision to be announced in the second or third week of August.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,20?/* July, 1950.
