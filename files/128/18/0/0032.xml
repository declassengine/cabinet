Festival of britain.Sunday opening.(Previous    ;Reference:(CM. (50) 65thConclusions,Minute 4.)i1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 261) giving the text of a statement which he proposed to make in the House of Commons later in the same day,when the Festival of Britain (Sunday Opening) Bill was presented, and seeking a decision on the part which Ministers should take in debates on the Bill.The Lord president said that the Bill had been drafted in a way which would make it possible, by a simple amendment, to open theExhibitions on Sunday afternoons, but to close the amusement centre,if a free vote in the House of Commons so decided. In the SecondReading debate he proposed to set out the case for and against theopening of the amusement centre on Sunday afternoons, and he hopedthat it would be unnecessary for other Ministers to intervene in the debate to express personal views against the opening of the amuse-ment centre on Sundays.In discussion, there was general agreement that, as the lord president would present an objective statement of the case for and against the Sunday opening of the amusement centre in terms whichhe would agree with the Prime Minister and the other ministers principally concerned, and as back-benchers could be expected todevelop any further arguments that were required to bring out the issues at stake, it was undesirable that other Ministers should expresspersonal views on the Sunday opening of the amusement centre inthe course of the Second Reading debate or during the committee stage. It would, however, probably be useful for the Attorney-General to wind up for the Government on Second Reading, so as todeal with any legal points that might be raised in discussion.The hope was expressed that, if the House of Commons shouldvote against the opening of the amusement centre on Sunday after-noons, the Board of Festival Gardens, Ltd., would not find it necessaryto close the whole of the Festival Pleasure Gardens on Sundays, sinceany such closure, though based on financial considerations, might suggest a petulant attitude towards the decision of Parliament. *The Cabinet-(1) Approved the draft statement, annexed to CP. (50) 261, whichthe Lord President would make when the Festival of britain (Sunday Opening) Bill was presented.(2) Agreed that Ministers should not intervene in the debates onthe Bill to express personal views on the Sunday openingof the amusement centre, but should remain free to voteaccording to their opinions.ParliamentSusiness inthe House ofCommons.Council ofEurope.Foreign affairs debate.396682. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in thejollowing week.On 13th November there would be a debate on the Council ofEurope. It was undesirable that this should develop into a general review of foreign affairs. The Parliamentary Under-Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs would open the debate and the foreign secretary would wind up. The Minister of Town and country planning would intervene in the course of the debate, as a minister who had taken part in the recent session of the Assembly.The Leader of the Opposition, in the debate on the Address, had pressed for an early secret debate on foreign affairs and defence.Debates which purported to deal with both foreign affairs and defencewere unsatisfactory, because a foreign affairs debate should cover amuch wider field than a defence debate. Since several important aspects of foreign policy were at a crucial and confidential stage, itwas undesirable that there should be an early debate. The Govern-ment should not, therefore, go beyond offering a debate on foreignaffairs shortly before Christmas, and should refuse to accede to the-1 b 2
suggestion that any debate that might be arranged on defence shouldbe held in secret.United Lord Winterton, M IP., was raising the question whether the kingdom Minister of Defence could not make periodical statements about theForces part which United Kingdom Forces were playing in military opera-operating under tions conducted by the United Nations. There was general agreementUnited Nations that, from the point of view of the Government and of Parliament, itCommand. was desirable to maintain the principle that as full statements wouldbe made about military operations in which the British Forces were engaged under United Nations auspices as would have been made ifthey were operating under a British Commander-in-Chief. there might, of course, be security and other objections to making fullstatements of troop movements and of the course of operations, butBritish troops operating under the United Nations flag should not beregarded as of less concern to the United Kingdom Parliament thantroops operating under the British flag. The reply to Lord Wintertonshould, therefore, express agreement with the point of view which he put forward and should promise an early statement by the Ministerof Defence, to be followed by similar statements from time to time as circumstances required.House of The Prime Minister said he would look into certain questionsLords. which were raised in connection with the debate in the House of lords on 8th November, 1950, about newsprint supplies.Accommoda-tion  or ministers inPalace of westminster.3. The Minister of Health said that he was concerned, as were other Ministers, about the proposal that Ministers should share theirrooms in the new House of Commons with their parliamentary secretaries. The present Parliamentary situation made it necessaryfor Ministers to spend a great deal of time at the House of Commons,and it was most inconvenient for a Minister to have discussions with officials and receive deputations in the same room as a parliamentary secretary, who might be similarly engaged. It would be useful if theavailable accommodation in the Houses of Parliament could be looked at as a whole, and he suggested that any scrutiny of this kind might usefully be supervised by a small Committee of Ministers.The Minister of Works said that, before the war and after thedestruction of the Commons&apos; Chamber, there had been sixty roomsavailable for Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries. There weresixty-four rooms near the new Chamber, and three additional roomswould shortly become available. The Serjeant-at-Arms had been good enough to offer to place at the disposal of the Governmentcertain accommodation in St. Stephen&apos;s Tower, which might yieldten additional rooms. He calculated that seventeen rooms additional to the existing rooms were needed to house Parliamentary Secretariesseparately from their Ministers, and a discussion whether accommoda-tion in the House of Lords could be made available would, therefore,be useful.In discussion, it was pointed out that the amount of work falling on Parliamentary Secretaries varied greatly from Department toDepartment; and this should be borne in mind in arrangingaccommodation for them. The number of Ministers who were Peershad fallen considerably in the last fifty years or so, and there might,therefore, be accommodation in the House of Lords which could bemade available.It was suggested that the Minister of Works should, at the outset,arrange a discussion at the official level with the Clerk of the Parlia-ments, the Permanent Secretary of the Lord Chancellor^ department and the Secretary of the Lord Great Charhberlain&apos;s Office. this discussion would show whether accommodation could be madeavailable in the House of Lords for some Ministers and parliamentary secretaries, and thereafter the subject could be looked at by a CabinetCommittee, possibly presided over by the Prime Minister.
133 C.M. 72 (SO)The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Works to arrange for a preliminaryinvestigation of the accommodation for Ministers likely tobe available in the House of Lords, on the lines indicatedin the Cabinefs discussion.Christmas FoodBonuses.    \(Previous   \&quot;Reference:CM. (49) 64thConclusions^Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (50) 258) recommending that he should be authorised to announce additions to the rations at Christmas. He proposed to issuebonuses of sugar, sweets and cooking fats, of tea to people overseventy, and of bacon if sufficient supplies arrived from Canada.The Minister of Food said that his proposals for Christmasbonuses were within the existing import programme. He regretted that no additional meat could be allocated, and that the tea bonuscould not be issued to everyone, but the stocks position made thisunavoidable. It might be necessary shortly to reduce the regularration of meat. If Canadian shipments of bacon were adequate, he might prefer to increase the ration from 3 to 4 oz., instead of giving a 2 oz. Christmas bonus. As he had explained in his paper, suppliesof turkeys would be lower than last year by 2,600 tons. Poultry prices were at present very high, but the reimposition of price control cpuldnot be recommended. If dollars could be made available it might bepossible to buy up to 1,000 tons of turkeys from Canada.In discussion, it was suggested that the question of increased supplies of imported turkeys for Christmas might usefully be further explored. If turkeys were bought from Canada and the embargo on imports from Hungary was temporarily lifted, enough turkeys mightbe available to bring prices down. It was pointed out, however, thatturkeys imported from Hungary might be infected with fowl pest andthat the price of Canadian turkeys was very high.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 258.(2) Invited the Minister of Food^ in consultation with the foreign secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer and President ofthe Board of Trade, to examine further the possibility of importing turkeys from Canada and HungaryiChina.Intervention in korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 71stConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that Chinese intervention in the korean conflict, the extent of which was still uncertain, had led togreat difficulties affecting our attitude towards the People&apos;s Govern-ment of China. Our objectives were to localise the Korean war andto press for-the entry of the People&apos;s Government into the united nations, but the happenings, of the last few days had jeopardisedtheir attainment. The People&apos;s Government had now been invited tostate their case in the Security Council, and we could do no more atpresent than await the outcome. The situation was an ugly one, andthe results of the Congressional elections might unfavourably affect itshandling by the United States Government, but he did not feel that either China or Russia was at present working deliberately to spread the conflict.In discussion, the Prime Minister said that he understood thatrelief organisations were at present forbidden by the United NationsCommander to send teams and supplies to Korea. The foreign secretary said that he would investigate the position.The view was expressed that it would be desirable to announcepublicly our policy about sending troops up to the frontier in NorthernKorea: there was great confusion, and a clear statement would have
a good effect on China. The Foreign Secretary said that, to beauthoritative, such a statement should be made in the security council, and it was his hope that this could be arranged.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.Relations with 6. The Foreign Secretary said that the Assembly of the UnitedSpain. Nations had now reversed their decision of 1946 on relations with(Previous       Franco Spain, and members of the United Nations were free to sendReference:      Ambassadors to Madrid and&quot; to approve Spanish membership of cm. (50) 56th  international agencies in relationship with the United Nations.   in conclusions,    accordance with the decision of the/ Cabinet on 6th September, 1950,Minute 8.)      our delegation had abstained from voting in Committee and in theAssembly.  He now sought his colleagues&apos; approval to the appoint-ment of an Ambassador to Spain, and to United Kingdom support,when he considered it desirable, for Spanish membership of the specialised agencies.   The question of Spanish membership of theFood and Agriculture Organisation was likely to arise in the courseof the following week.In discussion, the following points were raised:  (a) The personality of the Ambassador to be sent to Spain was of great importance in view of the strong feelings about the Francoregime which existed in this country. A Labour Attache on his staffmight do valuable work if he kept in touch with democratic opinion in Spain.(b) It might be desirable to delay our announcement of theappointment of an Ambassador until after other Ambassadors hadbeen appointed to Spain. We should not give the impression that wewere in a hurry to act on the United Nations decision.The Cabinet-Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal that an ambassador to Spain should be appointed and that, whenhe considered it desirable, the Government should supportSpanish membership of international agencies in relationship with the United Nations.Defence. 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Prime(Previous        Minister (CP. (50) 246) inviting the Cabinet to endorse the conclusionsReference:      of the Defence Committee on 25th October, 1950, about the financingCM. (50) 70th   of defence and to approve recommendations put forward by theConclusions,    Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of the Exchequer about the minute l.)      attitude to be adopted towards United States offers of assistance. , TheCabinet had also before them copies of memoranda on the financing of defence and on the size and shape of the Armed Forces, 1951-54,which had been prepared for the Defence Committee (CP. (50) 247and 248).  .The Minister of Defence said that the Defence Committee had agreed that, at the meeting of the North Atlantic Treaty DefenceCommittee in Washington which he had recently attended, proposalscosting  3,600 million should be put forward as the planned defence effort of the United Kingdom over the three financial years 1951-52,1952-53 and 1953-54. The commitment of the United Kingdom tothe full programme of  3,600 million was dependent upon severalfactors, including agreement on the United Kingdom share of the collective defence plan and on the distribution of the economic burdenbetween the North Atlantic Treaty countries. The Chiefs of staff had put forward proposals on the size and shape of the Armed forces which would have cost  3,800 million, but it was doubtful whether a programme of this size could in fact be Carried out in the time
available, and it had been agreed to adhere to the earlier figure of 3,600 million.   There had been agreement that orders totalling 200 million should be placed, notwithstanding that the total programme was not yet finally settled; and of this amount orders to the value of  103 million had already been placed, and further orders for  50 million would be placed in the near future in respectof aircraft. The Admiralty would be wishing soon to place substantialorders in respect of mine-sweepers.   It followed that orders of anj   amount in excess of  200 million would shortly be placed, and thei   Treasury had accepted this because of the.need to make speedyprogress with the re-equipment of the Services. The North atlantic treaty Defence Committee, at its meeting in Washington, had approved the Medium-Term Defence Programme, but this country had worked out in greater detail than others its component of this programme and the stages by which it would be achieved. The north atlantic Treaty Defence Committee had accepted the thesis, advanced by this country and the United States, that man-power and equipmentmust be increased as speedily as possible.   There were formidabledifficulties in the way of the speedy implementation of the Medium-Term Defence Programme.   Agreement had not yet been securedabout the appointment of a United. States Commander-in-Chief in western Europe, nor &quot;about the integration of the Western Union andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisations, nor about the preciseassistance which the United States would give in the form of addi-tional divisions stationed in Europe and of equipment for the western european armies.   The French objection to the rearmament ofGermany had proved to be the real obstacle to building up an effectivedefence for Western Europe. It was to be hoped that further examina-tion of the problem of European defence by the Military Committeeand the Council of Deputies would make it possible for some kind of compromise plan to be agreed upon. Meanwhile, it was essential, inthe interests of this country, that the strengthening of the armed forces should proceed as speedily as possible.The Prime Minister agreed that the difficult attitude adopted bythe French had seriously delayed the preparation of plans for thedefence of Western Europe. Meanwhile, the Government, for thedefence of this country, must proceed on the basis that the Medium-Term Defence Programme would ultimately be approved, and that financial assistance would be forthcoming. Progress could be madewith rearmament while leaving some element of flexibility to take account of modifications of the programme which might ultimately be agreed upon.In subsequent discussion, attention was drawn to the fact thatevents had falsified some of the assumptions on which the defence programme was originally drawn up. It had been assumed that assistance to the amount of  550 million would be secured from theUnited States and that on this basis the defence programme couldbe implemented without serious risk of inflation or of drastic retrench-ment in other items of Government expenditure.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (50) 246 &quot;at a later meeting of the Cabinet.World Peace 8. The Prime Minister said that he would be replying that after-Congress, noon to a Parliamentary Question enquiring what decisions had been(Previous taken with regard to the Communist delegates attending the PeaceReference: Congress at Sheffield on 13th November. He had now learnt that,CM. (50) 56th although 44 per cent, of the applications for visas from delegates fromConclusions, abroad had been refused, no less than 283 visas had been granted.Minute 3.) He was surprised that so many visas had been granted, since he under-stood that arrangements were being made to confine admission to a
very small number, and that delegates from Iron Curtain countries would normally be excluded&apos;] attendance being limited to relativelyinnocuous fellow-travellers from non-Communist countries. It wouldbe difficult to justify the admission of delegates on this scale, whichwould also be likely to provoke further attacks on the efficiency of thesecurity services.The Home Secretary said that, in accordance with arrangementsagreed between the Ministers concerned, only those delegates had beengranted visas against whom neither the Foreign Office nor the security services had raised objection. In general, prominent Communistswere being excluded. It would, however, be possible to cancel visasalready granted and to refuse entry to delegates in possession of visas.In discussion, it was generally agreed that, although the visas hadbeen granted in accordance with the policy agreed between theMinisters concerned, the policy had not reduced the number of visasas drastically as had been expected. There was now good reason to reconsider that policy in order to reduce the number of foreigndelegates attending the Congress. More should not be admitted thanthe Security Services could keep under close scrutiny while in thiscountry.The traditional right of asylum would not be prejudiced by a refusal to allow large numbers of foreigners to come into the UnitedKingdom for the purpose of attending a conference of this kind, whoseobject was the diffusion of views directly contrary to our democraticbeliefs. While it would not be desirable to exclude entrants bydeliberately delaying the grant of visas, it should be possible, bycancelling visas already granted, or refusing leave to land, to reducethe admissions to a less unsatisfactory number. The complete refusal of visas to all delegates from Eastern Europe or their refusal to allavowed members of Communist Parties, would be open to serious objection.It was agreed that, in the Prime Ministers reply to the Parlia-mentary Question, no mention need be made of the number of visasgranted or refused, but that the reply should re-state what had alreadybeen announced, namely, that the members of each delegation wouldbe carefully examined in the light of security considerations, and the reply could add that this policy would apply equally whether theapplicant was a Communist or not.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to reply to the parliamentary question on the lines agreed in discussion.(2) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the foreign secretary, to consider, in the light of the Cabinefs dis-cussion, whether further measures could be taken toreduce the number of foreign delegates permitted to enter the United Kingdom to attend the World Peace Congressdue to open at Sheffield on 13th November.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th November, 1950.
