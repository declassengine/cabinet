13Korea.(previous reference:CM. (50) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Strategic jExports to china.1. The Cabinet discussed the latest developments in the Koreansituation.The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary was disturbed at the possible consequences of the decision, recorded in the cabinet minutes of 4th July, that action to prevent the export of strategic goods from the United Kingdom to China should be deferred forthe time being. Ministers had agreed in July, 1949, that the UnitedKingdom should participate in this scheme for the control of strategic exports to China if the Governments of the Netherlands, France andBelgium undertook to take similar action. These Governments hadnew agreed to participate in the scheme; and the United StatesGovernment, who were aware of the earlier decision of United King-dom Ministers, would regard it as a breach of faith on our part if we now refrained from preventing the export of such goods to China.The imposition of the controls would involve no overt discrimination against China: all that was needed was to add China to the confidential -tial list of countries to which export licences were in practice refused.The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the President of the Boardof Trade said that they had not wished to object to the prohibition ofthe export of strategic goods from the United Kingdom to China; andthey considered that Minute 3 (6) of the Cabinet Minutes of 4th Julydid not accurately reflect the Cabinefs views on this point.The Cabinet Agreed that the President of the Board of Trade should take steps to prevent the export of strategic goods from theUnited Kingdom to China.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the debate on education,Business in the  which was to have been taken on the following day, was to be post-House of        poned in order that the House of Commons might debate a statementCommons.      to be made by the Secretary of State for War about his recent speech at Colchester, in which he had commented on the French Govern-menfs proposals for integrating the coal and steel industries of western Europe.War Damage At the end of that debate the House would discuss the admission(Late Claims), of late claims for war damage payments. It would be convenient ifthis discussion could be taken on the motion for the Adjournment;but the Opposition were likely to press the view that it should be taken on a substantive motion. In that event it would be preferable thatGovernment supporters, who had been active in this matter, should begiven an opportunity of tabling a motion.Some discussion followed on the line to be taken by the Govern-ment spokesmen in this debate. The Cabinet were informed that theWar Damage Commission were now admitting certain late claims,in the exercise of an administrative discretion, where it could be shownthat there was some special reason why the application had not beensubmitted earlier. This discretion was being used to admit certainclaims by applicants who could show that they had been advised bylocal authority officials that notification to the local authority was sufficient and that no separate notification to the War Damage Corn-mission was required. Ministers agreed that, while the Governmentshould take credit for the concessions which had been made in administration, they should resist the application of any automaticrule which would have the effect of admitting any late claim if theapplicant alleged that he had been advised at some earlier date bylocal authority officials that no separate notification to the war damage Commission was required.The Cabinet invited the Lord President and the Chancellor of theExchequer, after consultation with the Chief Whip, to decide whetherGovernment supporters should be encouraged to table a motion onthis subject and. if so, on what lines the. motion should be framed.39049-1 b 2
128ij3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 166) suggesting that Parliament should be askedto pass, in October at the end of the present Session, Addresses renew-ing for a year after 10th December, 1950, the emergency powerscontinued in force by the Supplies and Services (Transitional Powers)Act, 1945, and the Emergency Laws (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,1947.The Lord President said that he hoped shortly to bring before theCabinet the draft of an Economic Powers Bill, with a view to adecision on the question whether permanent powers should be sought in the following Session. There was, however,, little likelihood thatany such Bill could be passed into law before 10th December, 1950,and, even if it could, it would not cover a number of miscellaneouspowers which would have to be continued for a time on a year-to-yearbasis. He had contemplated that Addresses for the continuance ofthe emergency powers would be moved at the beginning of the next session, but it was now clear that Departments, in exercising delegated legislation, would be considerably embarrassed in the late autumn ifthey had to continue to operate under powers which were due tocome to an end on 10th December. The state of business made italmost impossible to suggest moving the necessary Addresses beforethe Summer Recess, and in his view they should be moved in thelast week of the current Session in October.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It would be helpful if a decision were taken now that theGovernment intended to keep in force the necessary emergency powers under the Acts of 1945 and 1947, since otherwise the Depart?ments might tend to plan on the basis that any essential powers would have to be sought forthwith on a permanent basis.(b) The Opposition would not be likely to offer serious objectionto a continuance of emergency powers on a year-to-year basis; but,if the Cabinet should decide to introduce a permanent EconomicPowers Bill, it would be important to make it clear in moving theAddresses that the more important economic controls were before long to be put on a permanent basis.(c) The House of Lords might make difficulties about passing the necessary Addresses and it would be important that the Govern-ment should make out a convincing case for continuing these powers for another year.(d) The Governments intention to ask both Houses to passAddresses would be announced before the Summer Recess in thestatement of business for the last week of the Session in October.The Cabinet-Agreed that Addresses, for the renewal of emergency powers for a further year, should be moved in October in the lastweek of the current Session.4. The Cabinet were informed that comparatively little successhad been achieved so far in the attempt which was being made to induce all workers in the London road haulage industry to come outon strike in sympathy with the Smithfield drivers. About 1,500 men had been brought out, almost entirely in branches of the road haulage industry connected with Smithfield. Most of the tug-boatmen were at work; but the men on the heavy tug boats had now called a three-day token strike as a protest against the dismissal of one of their fellow-workers. There was also a risk of a partial stoppage at covent garden. Finally, an effort was being made to induce the petroleum-tanker drivers to come out on strike; and, if this were successful, it
would eventually have a paralysing effect on road transport through-out the country.&quot; A crucial stage had been reached: if the strike were now extended it might last for a considerable period: if it could notbe extended, there was some hope that it would soon collapse.In these circumstances the Emergencies Committee had decidedto postpone for a day the introduction of Servicemen into the london dock area. The Chairman of the Port of London Authority had strongly recommended that they should not be so employed in viewof the risk of a general stoppage in the Port of London. It would bedifficult to provide carcase meat for the London meat ration without taking steps which might lead to an extension of the stoppage inLondon or in other parts of the country; but a full ration of canned corned meat could be provided.In discussion it was suggested that the leaders of the transport and General Workers&apos; Union should now make a sustained effort to enlist the support of loyal members of the Union in combating the continuation or spread of the strike. It might be possible for theLabour Party to assist this and other unions in combating Communistinfluences. Attention was drawn to information suggesting that thelocal machinery of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union atSmithfield was being used to assist the unofficial strike.The Prime Minister said that, in company with the Home Secre-tary and the Ministers of Labour and Transport, he would see theGeneral Secretary of the Transport and General Workers&apos; union and discuss with him some of the issues which were troublingMinisters.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Servicemen should not for the present beemployed in the London dock area.(2) Agreed that in the current week the London meat rationshould consist of canned coined meat drawn fromMinistry of Food stores.5. The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the strain whichmight be thrown on their transport facilities by the need to reinforcetheir troops in Korea, the United States authorities were anxious to accelerate the approved ^programme for stationing United States airforces in this country as part of the defence arrangements under theNorth Atlantic Pact. They expected to find it easier to move these forces now rather than later; and proposed, subject to our agree-ment, to put into operation forthwith the move of two mediumbomber groups and one fighter group to this country. The Chiefs ofStaff recommended that Ministers should assent to this proposal. TheForeign Secretary, who had been consulted, also recommended thatconsent should be given, provided that the announcement of these movements made it clear that they represented nothing more thanthe execution of a programme approved some months previouslyunder the terms of the North Atlantic Pact.In discussion it was agreed that it was important that these move-ments should not be related in any way to the situation in Korea but should be presented as routine movements giving effect to an agreed policy. From this point of view it was desirable that the announce-ment, and any necessary explanations of it, should be kept within thecontrol of the United Kingdom authorities.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United States proposal for accelerating theirapproved programme of reinforcing their air forces in thiscountry could be accepted; but invited the Minister of state to arrange that any publicity for this movement should be4handled on the lines agreed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.
130 !jNationalisationof Public water supplies.(previous reference:CM. (50) 28thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Health and the Lord Privy Seal (CP. (50) 145 and 109) on the nationalisation of public water supplies.The Minister of Health said that he was satisfied that, from thepoint of view of efficient administration, England and Wales should be divided into about fifty-three areas for the purpose of water supplies.On the question whether the service should be directly administered by bis Department or by joint local authority boards, he said thathe was aware of the strength of the opposition which local authorities would offer to the bringing of water undertakings under nationalownership and he had therefore tried to work out a practicablescheme of administration through joint local authority boards. Hehad, however, been driven to the conclusion that there were insuperable-able objections to any such scheme. One of the main purposes of reorganisation was to secure more adequate supplies for rural areas,but under any scheme of joint boards urban ratepayers in areas suchas East Anglia or Wales would have to pay substantially higher water rates in order to finance the necessary rural development. If, on theother hand, water supplies were organised on a national basis it shouldbe possible to meet rural requirements without any serious increasein charges in urban areas, though in the early years some Exchequerassistance would be required to prevent a sudden rise in urban water rates. A scheme of joint boards also presented the dilemma that either the main catchment areas must be outside the area of the joint board in a good many cases, or the areas of the boards,must be madeof unwieldy size in order to include them. Difficulties would arise onthe question whether representation on joint boards was to be related to the capital value of the existing water undertakings or to popula-tion; and the larger cities might well prefer nationalisation to a schemeof joint boards, devised on a population basis, in which they wouldoften be out-voted by the representatives of the adjacent smallerauthorities. Joint boards would be expensive to run and would requiremore staff than direct Departmental administration. The boards would be very litigious and much Parliamentary time would be taken up in considering the Bills which they promoted. The public utilitywater companies would vigorously oppose any transfer to public ownership and would expose and exploit all the weaknesses of a joint board system in discussion of the Governments proposals in Parlia-ment. There would be substantial support for direct nationalisationin the rural areas, because these areas would thereby feel moreassured of a plentiful and cheap water supply.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Scotland saidthat the present organisation was working very well in Scotland, andany suggestion that it should be replaced by national ownership would arouse strong hostility among local authorities, especially as a con-vincing case for change could not be made out. There were no private companies providing public water supplies in Scotland, and regionalschemes had secured the necessary element of mutual assistance between neighbouring water undertakings. Calculations made by theDepartment of Health for Scotland showed that, if the cost of ruralwater supplies were borne by a uniform water rate, this might amountto 2s. 6d. for Scotland as a whole, whereas the present water rate in glasgow was 9d. and in Edinburgh I0d. Very substantial Exchequerassistance would be required if, after nationalisation, the inhabitants of the larger towns were to be shielded from a substantial increasein water rates. So far as Scotland was concerned, present needs wouldbe entirely met if the Secretary of State had rather wider powers to compel amalgamations of water undertakings where this would facilitate the provision of a more wholesome or a more economicalsupply of wateriThe Prime Minister said that he was not yet satisfied that a sufficiently strong case had been made out on general grounds for making this further inroad into the functions of local authorities.
There was a serious danger that the quality of local government mightdeteriorate if so many functions were removed that the remainder were not regarded as being worthy of attention by public-spiritedcitizens. A tidy scheme of public water supplies could be bought attoo great a price. The Cabinet should consider whether they couldnot secure amalgamation of undertakings, where this was necessary,and stimulation of rural authorities to take a greater interest in theprovision of adequate supplies without going the length of bringingsupplies under direct Government administration.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, SWA,10th July, 1950.
