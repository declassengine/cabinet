1. The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet messages from TheirMajesties the King and Queen and from Her Royal Highness the princess Elizabeth expressing their thanks for the Cabinefs messagesof congratulations on the birth of a daughter to Their RoyalHighnesses the Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh.2. The Lord President said that it was proposed that, when parliament met on 12th September, the House of Commons should hold a general debate on defence questions on a Government motion in terms wide enough to permit discussion of the proposals to increase54th rates of pay in the Services and to lengthen the period of National. Service. Two days would be allotted to this debate. The motion) would conclude by inviting the Government to bring in forthwith thenecessary legislation to amend the National Service Acts, and the Billfor this purpose would be presented as soon as the motion was passed.The House of Commons would be invited to pass the Bill through all its stages on 14th September. In order that Members might have time to study the terms of the Bill, it would be published in draft inthe form of a White Paper as soon as Parliament met: if it wereformerly introduced at that stage and published in the form of a Bill,Members would be precluded from discussing that part of the Govern-ment&apos;s proposals in the general debate which was to precede theSecond Reading of the Bill. It was also proposed that, in order togive Members advance notice of its terms, the Government motion should be handed in on 8th September and communicated to the Presson the same date.It was intended that the Bill should be passed through all its stages in the House of Lords on 15th September.The Cabinet (1) Approved the terms of the motion to be tabled on the Govern-menfs behalf as a basis for the defence debate to be heldin the House of Commons on 12th and 13th September:and authorised the Chief Whip to communicate the termsof the motion, through the usual channels, to theOpposition Parties.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to seek the concurrence of theOpposition Parties in the proposals outlined by the lord president for handling the forthcoming debates in theHouse of Commons.3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Government^ decisionto increase the period of national service had evoked a promisingresponse from tfie French and Belgian Governments, each of whom had since announced their intention to make a substantial increase intheir contribution towards the defence of Western Europe. He hoped52nd that the United Kingdom&apos;s lead would also be followed in the nearfuture by Holland and Luxembourg. He was, however, disturbed) that, despite the contribution which we had made and the responsewhich it had evoked from our Allies in Western Europe, the UnitedStates Government had not yet given any indication of the amountof the financial assistance which they would provide towards ourincreased defence expenditure. This uncertainty about the expenseof American financial aid would make it difficult for the Governmentto announce any firm defence programmes in the debates in Parlia-ment in the following week. He had therefore sent a personal message to the United States Secretary of State urging him to give at least amoral commitment that the United States Government would providethe contribution of  550 million for which we had asked; and he hoped that this assurance might be forthcoming before the debate inthe House of Commons.
In discussion it was pointed out that the Government^ annouhce-ment of their intention to spend  3,400 million on defence over thenext three years had been made before they. decided to increase service pay and to extend the period of national service; and that, as a resultof those decisions, the cost of the three-year programme would beincreased to  3,600 million. Should we not therefore ask the UnitedStates Government for a larger contribution than  550 million?There would admittedly be objections to any arrangement which gave the appearance that Service pay was being financed by the UnitedStates Government. But the decision to increase the size of our forces would justify some increase in our bid for United Statesfinancial aid since our requirements of military equipment would be greater by reason of this increase in the size of our Forces.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Some orders for equipment were already being placed in anticipation of United States financial aid. This made it the moreimportant that we should know as soon as possible the extent of the aid which was likely to be forthcoming. The increased expenditurearising from these orders would involve a Supplementary Estimate inthe current financial year and an increase in the Defence estimates for the following year.(b) Because of their obligation to obtain annual appropriationsfrom Congress, the United States Government would be unable togive a firm promise of financial aid for more than one year. It was,however, hoped that this would be accompanied by an informalunderstanding of the amounts likely to be forthcoming in the two following years. Every effort should be made to avoid the pressures,experienced in connection with the European Recovery Programme,to modify national policies in order to ease the passage of appropria-tion Bills through Congress. ,(c) It was as yet too early to gauge the effect of the increases in service pay in stimulating regular recruitment to the Armed Forces.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement, and of thepoints raised in discussion; and invited the foreign secretary to submit a further report, before Parliament- met on 12th September, on the financial contribution which the United States Government were likely to maketowards the- cost of the United Kingdom defence programme.Defence of The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Minister in western London had that morning informed him that his Government wereEurope. now disposed to favour the creation of an integrated defence force inEurope tinder unified command and that, if such a force were formed,would be prepared to increase the strength of their forces in Europe.It was suggested that this integrated force might include a contingentfrom Western Germany. On this point the Foreign Secretary had said that, in view of the susceptibilities of the French, this Germanelement should be a gendarmerie not exceeding 100,000 men. TheUnited States Government were anxious that these proposals shouldbe considered in the forthcoming tripartite discussions in New Yorkand thereafter at the meeting of the North Atlantic Council.The Foreign Secretary said that he was disposed to agree that thisproposal should be discussed in the forthcoming1 meetings in new york, subject to his stipulation about the contribution from western germany, and on condition that the United States Government had first given some more definite assurances about the extent of thefinancial assistance which they would provide towards increaseddefence expenditure by the Western European Governments. No. further commitment to send United Kingdom troops to fight inEurope in the event of war would be accepted without prior referenceto the Cabinet.

The Cabinet were informed that, since their decision on 25th Julyfor Korea. to send a Brigade Group for service in Korea, the United States(Previous   j Government had strongly urged that some land forces should be sentReference: at once to Korea from Hong Kong.

(50) 52ndConclusions,Minute 1.)General.4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda bythe Foreign Secretary which had been prepared in connection withthe forthcoming discussions in New York between the foreign ministers of the United States, the United Kingdom and France:  CP. (50) 200: reviewing the general situation in Asia in thelight of the Korean conflict;CP. (50) 194: outlining the policy which the Foreign Secre-tary proposed to pursue in discussions with the United StatesGovernment about Formosa;CP. (50) 193: outlining a procedure by which it might bepossible to make arrangements, under the aegis of the united nations, for a long-term political settlement in Korea.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmenthad recently given signs of willingness to consult with this country onFar Eastern affairs. It was his aim to induce the United StatesGovernment to look at Asia as a whole and to pay due regard to thedesire of Asiatic countries to avoid any appearance of domination bythe West. The United Kingdom Government had recognised the emergence of new forces in Asia by the grant of self-government toIndia, Pakistan, Ceylon and Burma; but the United States had been much slower to recognise the new spirit of independence in Asia andhad even now to be reminded of the important role which India couldplay in Asian affairs. An exchange of view on these matters was inprogress between His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington and theState Department, and at a later stage these discussions should be merged in consultations with Commonwealth countries, France andother European countries, in order to secure broad agreement betweenfriendly members of the United.Nations and to build up a common front against any manoeuvres by the Soviet Union. A steadyinginfluence must be brought to bear on public opinion in the UnitedStates in order to reduce the risk of conflict between the United Statesand China over Formosa.In discussion attention was drawn to the great danger to theCommonwealth of any conflict with China, in view of the largenumber of Chinese in Malaya and other parts of South-East Asia whohad been exhorted by successive Chinese Governments to regard themselves as Chinese citizens rather than as citizens of the countriesin which they resided.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the general policy regarding South and South-east asia outlined in CP. (50) 200.
Formosa. The Foreign Secretary said that he did not believe that a pro-longed United States occupation of Formosa would make for stability in theFar East, nor did he think it practicable to aim at the independ-ence of Formosa in view of the undertakings already given that formosa would be returned to China. He therefore proposed to try to secure United States agreement to the adoption of a resolution bythe General Assembly of the United Nations to the effect that formosa should in due course revert to China, that action to this end should await the pacification of the Pacific area, and that in the mean-* time a Commission should be established to recommend when themoment was ripe for the cession to China and the conditions underwhich it should take place. He would hope to secure India&apos;s agree-ment to this procedure.In discussion reference was made to the following points:  (a) The Chiefs of Staff did not believe that, from the strategicpoint of view, the continued occupation of Formosa by the UnitedStates was as important as was assumed in certain quarters in theUnited States. In the defence discussions which had been held earlier in the year the United States authorities had not mentioned the need to occupy Formosa. There was no hope of stability in the Far Eastuntil Formosa was ceded to China.(b) Political considerations might make it difficult for the UnitedStates Government to accept the policy proposed by the Foreign Sec-retary, especially while Chiang Kai-shek maintained large armed forces in Formosa. At the same time it was important that an effort should be made to secure United States agreement, since this country would be placed in a very difficult position if hostilities broke out between China and the United States over Formosa.(c) It would be useful to associate the Indian Government withany Commission which might be set up to recommend when Formosashould revert to China, possibly by having an Indian as chairman, andthe active assistance of Pandit Nehru in furthering the work of theCommission should be sought.The Cabinet-(2) Approved the policy regarding Formosa outlined in cp. (50) 194.Korea. The Foreign Secretary explained that his memorandum on Korea(CP. (50) 193) was intended to analyse the situation and to indicate- the line which he proposed to pursue, in discussions of the futurepolitical settlement in Korea, in the course of the forthcomingtripartite discussions in Washington.In a preliminary discussion attention was drawn to the legal difficulties of transferring consideration of thjs question from theSecurity Council to the General Assembly. The Assembly was notat liberty to discuss a matter which was already under considerationby the Security Council; and, if this question were taken off theagenda of the Security Council in order to facilitate its discussion inthe Assembly, the status of the United Nations forces operating in korea might be jeopardised. The Soviet Government must beexpected to exploit to the full any legal difficulties of this kind. Therewere other legal difficulties about the United Nations intervention in Korea on which the Law Officers were consulting the LordChancellor.The Cabinet-(3) Agreed to postpone consideration of CP. (50) 193 pendingexamination of the legal difficulties to which reference hadbeen made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.  I(4) Took note that the Foreign Secretary.would arrange for thematerial in CP. (50) 193, 194 and 200 to be summarisedfor the confidential information of commonwealth governments and of the Governors of British colonial territories in the Far East and South-East Asia.
united nations:Abase of veto.(previous reference:CM. (47) 2ndConclusions,Minute 6.)    ;5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 196 and 197) on proposals which the UnitedStates Government were to put before the General Assembly of theUnited Nations with a view to dealing with acts of aggression orbreaches of the peace on occasions when the Security Council was likely to be paralysed by the use of the Soviet veto.The Foreign Secretary said that he was doubtful whether it was practicable to devise effective means of countering the Soviet use ofthe veto. There were objections to the first American proposal, underWhich a special session of the General Assembly would be summonedat twenty-four hours&apos; notice to consider .a case of aggression and tomake recommendations in the event of the Security Council beingprevented by the veto from exercising its responsibilities. There was less objection to the second proposal for a standing fact-finding andobservation commission of the General Assembly, which would sendobservers to areas where international tension was developing. he did not wish to discuss at present the proposals, mentioned in cp. (50) 197, for increasing the military preparedness of member states to respond to United Nations recommendations.In discussion there was general agreement that the policy of theSoviet Government in using the veto had gravely impaired the effec-tiveness of the United Nations as an instrument for preserving world peace. At the same time, a right of veto by the Great Powers hadbeen accepted at the San Francisco Conference as reflecting practicalrealities in the world situation which could not be ignored. TheUnited Kingdom Government themselves could not accept a positionin which they would have no right to veto action incompatible withvital British interests; and it was undesirable that this question should come up for general discussion in a way which might bringthe United Kingdom Government into open disagreement with theUnited States Government. The only practical answer to an unreasonable use of the veto lay in the development of general orregional pacts under Article 51 of the Charter, and it might be thatthe Atlantic Pact should be the precursor of similar pacts relatingto the Pacific and other areas. Little practical benefit was likely toaccrue from the adoption of the second proposal of the United StatesGovernment for the appoinment of a standing fact-finding commis-sion; but the Foreign Secretary need not oppose this plan if it were put forward at the General Assembly.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to urge the United StatesGovernment not to put forward the first of the proposalssummarised in CP. (50) 196, but agreed that we need not raise objection to the second of the proposals summarised in that memorandum if the United States Governmentbrought it forward at the forthcoming meeting of theGeneral Assembly.ChineseRepresentationin the united nations.(previous reference:CM. (50) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 195) proposing that he should support the admission of representatives of the People&apos;s Government of Chinaif the question were put to the vote at the beginning of the general assembly but that, if there should be a general desire in the assembly to refer the matter to some committee, this course should be accepted.The Foreign Secretary said that he had informed the UnitedStates Secretary of State that, if the question of the admission of thePeople&apos;s Government of China to the General Assembly or theSecurity Council arose in a form not directly connected with the korean conflict, he would feel bound to support their admission. Hehad not yet received any reply, and the United States Governmentseemed to have gone back to some extent on their statement that they
would accept a majority vote on this question. At the same time it seemed inexpedient needlessly to antagonise the People&apos;s Govern-ment of China, which might be prepared to take a different line in world affairs from that adopted by the Soviet Government. The best hope lay in bringing Western influence to bear on the ChineseGovernment through the mediation of the Government of India.There was general agreement that, as the United  KingdomGovernment had recognised the people&apos;s Government of China, itwas not practicable to argue that the Chiang Kai-shek administration in Formosa should continue to represent the Chinese nation in theUnited Nations. The People&apos;s Government were said to have appointed a delegation to the United Nations and the question would,therefore, arise at the outset whose credentials were to be accepted.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the policy regarding Chinese representation atthe General Assembly of the United Nations outlined in cp. (50) 195.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Rela-tions to inform other Commonwealth Governments of theline which the United Kingdom Government proposedto follow when this question came before the united nations Assembly.strategic 7.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of exports to Defence (CP. (50) 201) proposing that steps should be taken to eastern Europe restrict to reasonable quantities the import into China and Orientaland China. Russia of any goods likely to be of direct use to the North Korean(Previous forces, and that officials should explore the possibility of includingReference: a number of the goods concerned in the internationally-agreedCM. (50) 46th  security control lists.Conclusions. The Cabinet were informed that there had recently been minute 2.) abnormal demands from China for industrial goods which would beof value to the North Korean forces. The United States, because theywere more nearly self-sufficient than this country, were likely to con-tinue to press for what was virtually an economic blockade of Russia,China and the satellite countries in Eastern Europe. There was general agreement that the United Kingdom could not adopt a policyof this kind without grave prejudice to the national economy, moreparticularly since there was no indication that we were likely tosecure timber and other raw materials from America on financial terms which would compensate us for the loss of Eastern European-sources of supply. At present the Soviet Government were showing a disposition to open negotiations for the supply of timber, wheat andcoarse grains; and any provocative action taken against them mightclose this valuable source of supply and have serious repercussions onthe building programme and on agriculture.The Cabinet agreed that the Security Export Controls working party should at once undertake a general review of this question, sothat the Foreign Secretary could have in mind all the considerations affecting the United Kingdom economy in his forthcoming discussions with the United States Government. A general review of the positionwould also be of assistance in framing Government statements in theParliamentary discussion of the subject which wa!s likely to take place during the sittings commencing on 12th September.As to the manner in which any more stringent policy might beapplied, there was general agreement that the criterion should be, notwhether the goods were likely to be of military assistance toCommunist countries, but whether they were required for defence purposes by this country or by other members of the North atlantic treaty Organisation.
While it was recognised to be desirable that the current level of exports of military value to Communist countries should be reduced,some doubt was expressed whether the Departments concerned could in practice secure an appreciable reduction by administrative action.It would be undesirable to issue general guidance which might becomepublicly known, and it would be difficult to approach individually allthe firms and traders concerned as so many were involved.The Minister of Supply said that he was anxious to have authorityto use emergency powers to requisition certain machine tools whichwere being made for export to Russia. In particular, the royal ordnance Factories would find it useful to have a big jig borer whichMessrs. Craven Bros, were making for export to Russia but were not likely to complete for some months.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the SecurityExport Controls Working Party to prepare urgently areport on the issues involved in imposing further restric-tions on exports to Eastern Europe and China.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Supply, in consultation with theForeign Office and the Admiralty, to consider the reportto be furnished in pursuance of Conclusion (1) above, witha view to the preparation (for consideration by theCabinet) of material for use by the Foreign Secretary inthe United States and by Government spokesmen in theforthcoming Parliamentary debates.(3) Agreed in principle that emergency powers might be usedfor the purpose of requisitioning machine tools or other equipment or supplies which had been ordered from thiscountry by Communist Governments but were requiredfor defence purposes by this country or by other membersof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation, subject to the examination of any legal aspects of individual cases by theLaw Officers and of any policy aspects by the production committee.(4) Agreed that, pending further discussion by the Cabinet, nointimation of United Kingdom policy should be sent toother Commonwealth Governments.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th September, 1950.
