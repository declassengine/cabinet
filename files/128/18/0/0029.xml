1. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet last discussed the question of Germany&apos;s participation in the common defence of Western Europe, the French Government had producedtheir proposal for the creation of a European army, under a EuropeanMinister of Defence, into which individual Germans might be recruited. This proposal had caused some embarrassment to theGovernments of Belgium and the Netherlands; and it had beensuggested that there should be an early meeting of Foreign ministers to discuss it. He himself had thought it would be preferable to await the results of the current meeting of Defence Ministers of the north atlantic Powers, who were examining the technical aspects of the medium-Term Defence Plan for Western Europe, and to take uplater, in the light of those results, the political examination of theFrench proposal. The Minister of Defence had been advised toavoid being drawn into discussion of these political questions atthe current meeting in Washington. The Foreign Secretary hadconveyed his views to the Prime Minister of Belgium, who was forthe time being Chairman of the North Atlantic Treaty Council; andhe had since heard that these views were shared by the UnitedStates Secretary of State.The Prime Minister of France had now indicated that hisGovernment, in putting forward their proposal for the creation of a european army, had not intended to delay progress with the UnitedStates plan for the formation of an integrated force for the defenceof Western Europe, in which Germany would play some part. It was apparently their intention that the European army should be a rela-tively small force, of the order of 100,000 men, and should besubordinate to the main force. This seemed to confirm the view thatthe French proposal was, in the main, a manoeuvre in Frenchdomestic politics though it might also have the subsidiary purposeof securing that the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the integratedforce would be a Frenchman.It was the provisional view of the Cabinet that, if the french were able to persuade the other Continental Powers of western europe to join them in forming a European army on this basis, theUnited Kingdom Government need not raise objection to it though they would be unwilling to join in promoting it.Production In further discussion, the Foreign Secretary said that he had of Military arranged for officials of his Department to examine, in consultationEquipment. with the other Departments concerned, the economic implications ofGermany&apos;s participation in the manufacture of armaments for Euro-pean defence. There might be some disposition to argue that on security grounds Germany should not be allowed to undertake themanufacture of certain types of military equipment; but restrictionsof this kind might well have the effect of giving Germany an advantage over other European countries in normal civilian trade. TheChancellor of the Exchequer agreed that from this point of view itwas desirable that Germany should bear some part of the economicburden of the re-equipment programme; and he welcomed theinitiative which the Foreign Secretary had taken in having this problem examined interdepartmentally.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations drew atten-tion to the importance of keeping other Commonwealth Governmentsinformed of these developments which illustrated the difficulties of planning for total war through an organisation limited to the north atlantic Treaty Powers.Germany.Rearmament.(previous reference:CM.

(50) 242) regarding the time to be allocated for private Members&apos; business in the House of Commons in the forth-coming session.In discussion there was general agreement with the lord presidents proposal that he should seek to persuade the House ofCommons to accept, in relation to the forthcoming session, thearrangements recommended by the Select Committee on procedure which reported in 1946. Some doubts were, however, expressed aboutthe expediency of his further proposal that he should seek to deny to private Members the right to introduce Bills under the &quot; ten minutesrule.&quot; It was generally felt that, if there were strong pressure for this,it would be difficult to resist it. The Government could no longerclaim that they had a heavy programme of legislation which made itdifficult for them to concede time for Private Members&apos; business: themain argument on which they would have to rely was that the Housenow normally rose at 10 p.m. instead of 11 p.m. If, however, any concession had to be made, it was desirable that the right to introduceBills under the &quot; ten minutes rule &quot; should be exercisabfe only on one day a week, preferably on Fridays.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the House of Commons should be invited toaccept, for the forthcoming session, the arrangements for private Members&apos; time recommended by the Select Com-mittee of 1946.(2) Authorised the Lord President to accept the best arrangementhe could make regarding the right of Private members to introduce Bills under the &quot; ten minutes rule.&quot;\Korea. 2.

5. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the content of theEconomic Planning and Full Employment Bill (CP. (50) 178) on thebasis of a memorandum by the Minister of Health (CP. (50) 230)reporting the recommendations of a sub-committee of the production committee.The Minister of Health recalled that at their meeting on 27th july the Cabinet had taken the view that the Bill as submitted by the lord president^ Committee was too negative in character; and his sub-committee, which had been set up&apos; by the Production Committee fora cognate purpose, had considered wftat positive powers of economic planning might be included in the Bill. They had agreed thatGovernment Departments should have wide powers to buy, manu-facture and sell commodities and that these powers should be takenby statute. They had not felt that it was within their province to go beyond the question of powers and to consider in detail how those powers should be exercised; but it would be desirable that theGovernment, when announcing their intention to take these wide powers, should give a clear indication of the use which they proposedto make of them. Otherwise the proposal would cause unnecessaryalarm in the private sector of industry. The Labour Party, in material which had been put together for the purposes of the last GeneralElection, had endeavoured to indicate the conditions under whichunits in public ownership would compete with private industry, andthe Governments statement might follow the same lines.In discussion there was general agreement that the rearmament programme and the danger of inflation had greatly strengthened thecase for the negative powers contained in the draft of the economic planning and Full Employment Bill annexed to CP. (50) 178. Dueweight should therefore be given, in discussion of the Bill, to price control and the other economic controls which were designed toprevent inflation. It might be useful if some reference to stabilisingthe cost of living could be introduced into the title of the Bill; andfurther thought should be given to the question whether import and export controls should be included in it.As regards the inclusion of positive powers of economic planning,the general view was that further work had still to be done on thecircumstances in which the Governments Departments should beempowered to buy, manufacture and sell commodities. A case couldbe made out for Government manufacture in development areas andpossibly as a means of breaking private monopolies; but a general power to manufacture could not be represented as directly supportinga policy of full employment. There was also a clear case for thepurchase of raw materials by Departments, but not so clear a case for the purchase of consumer goods which had subsequently to be disposed of by sale to the public. The Government might find itdesirable to present a White Paper on Full Employment, to supplement the White Paper issued by the Coalition Government in 1944 (Cmd.6527), and this might be the vehicle for a reasoned statement of theGovernment^ plans for taking wider powers of public purchase and manufacture. Financial powers in support of a policy of full employ-ment were more appropriate to Finance Bills than to this generaf Bill.The proposals in CP. (50) 230 would have to be further examinedbefore Ministers were in a position to consider whether qualifyingconditions should be included in the Bill or whether it would suffice to explain in Parliament the circumstances in which the statutory powers would in fact be exercised.There was general agreement that the existing title of the Bill-Economic Planning and Full Employment Bill-should stand. Sincethe Bill need not be introduced immediately, there was time for further exploration of the positive powers which it should contain. It mustbe assumed that there would be close scrutiny of the extent of theParliamentary control over delegated powers conferred by the Bill.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Committee ofMinisters to examine the extent to which, and the condi-&apos;tions under which, the positive powers proposed in cp. (50) 230 should be included in the Economic planning and Full Employment Bill.(2) Agreed that, pending this examination, it would be undesir-able to make any reference in the Debate on the address to the inclusion of positive powers in the Bill.leasehold reform.(previous reference:CM. (50) 66thConclusions,Minute 3.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president and the Lord Chancellor (CP. (50) 244) explaining thedifficulties of extending the provisions of the proposed temporary Billabout leaseholds to cover offices as well as shops.The Lord President said that the proposal that the temporary bill should cover offices as well as shops had been put forward in thecourse of the Cabinefs discussion and had not been fully consideredbeforehand. Much of the goodwill enjoyed by a shopkeeper depended on the location of his shop. The same was not true of offices to any-thing like the same extent; and, if offices were to be protected, it wouldbe difficult to avoid giving the same protection to other types ofbusiness premises. The Board of Trade had not asked that thetemporary Bill should deal with offices, and it was now clear that an endeavour to cover them would delay the preparation and the passageof the Bill. The balance of advantage seemed to lie in favour of givingtemporary protection only in respect of residential premises andshops.The Lord Chancellor said that the drafting of a provision protect-ing offices had brought to light the great difficulty of definition.It was undesirable that temporary legislation should lead to wide-spread litigation, but there was a danger of this if offices were coveredby name. He recommended that the protection of office accommo-dation should be reserved for consideration in connection with theGovernments long-term proposals.In discussion attention was drawn to the danger that, in the debates on the temporary Bill, hard cases of professional men beingevicted from office premises would be brought forward. If theOpposition supported the extension of the Bill to cover offices, theGovernment would be made to appear unsympathetic towards areasonable claim from the professional classes. It might be practicable to frame a provision which referred to business premises rather than to shops and offices.The general view of Ministers was, however, that the temporary bill should be restricted to as narrow a field as was practicable andshould not, therefore, extend beyond residential ground leases andshops where there was known to be current hardship. If the temporary bill were enlarged to cover all business premises it would be difficultto resist suggestions that a similar measure of protection should be afforded to the occupiers of residential premises&quot;. If the scope of thetemporary Bill were enlarged, the number of borderline cases whichit did not cover would also be enlarged. Experience in the passingof the Tenancy of Shops (Scotland) Act, 1949, suggested that, providedthat the scope and long title of the temporary Bill were drawn suffi-ciently tightly, amendments proposing &quot;to extend the protection tooffices would not be accepted. It could be explained that the Govern-ment were considering, as a matter of urgency, their long-term plans of leasehold reform and that the position of offices would beconsidered in that connection.The Cabinet Agreed that, as proposed in CP. (50) 244, the temporary bill relating to leaseholds should not extend to offices.
industrial 7.   The Attorney-General said that he had received a letter fromDisputes. the London Society of Compositors complaining of his failure toLondon prosecute the master prmters for a breach of the National Arbitrationprinters&apos; and Conditions of Employment Order. He would have been disposedStrike. to reply that in his view the compositors were also liable to prosecution(Previous and had been the first to commit an offence under the Order; but reference: understood that the Minister of Labour had stated at an earlier stageCM. (50) 68th that the action taken by the compositors in imposing crippling condi-Conclusions, tions of work did&quot; not constitute a strike. Treasury Council agreedMinute 4.) with his view that, if workers took concerted action to applyrestrictive practices to a point which made it impossible for the employer to carry on his business in a reasonable fashion, that consti-tuted a strike. On the present occasion the Society had issued a circular to its members in August advising concerted measures which went very far in this direction.The Minister of Labour said that, while he must accept the attorney-General&apos;s interpretation of the law, he had been advised atan earlier stage by his Department that the &quot; go-slow &quot; policy adoptedby the compositors did not constitute a strike. He hoped that thefacts about the stoppage could be brought out in question and answer in the House of Commons or in an adjournment debate.In discussion it was suggested that the trade unions might with-draw their support for the continued operation of the national arbitration and Conditions of Employment Order if they felt that itcould be used to penalise &quot; go-slow &quot; policies adopted in the course ofindustrial disputes.The Prime Minister drew attention to the need for Ministers to consult the Law Officers at an early stage in all matters on whichquestions of legal proceedings were likely to arise.The Cabinet-Took note that if, as now seemed likely, the dispute in theLondon printing trade was shortly settled, there would beno occasion for the Attorney-General to institute proceedings against either side for contravention of the national arbitration and Conditions of Employment Order.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.30rA October, 1950.
