CABINET 53 (50)contents subject PageDefence    ...      ...      ...     ,.........      ......   199Service Pay.Period of National Service.
Tfig Cabinet had befbre them rfierhora^ida by the Minister ofDefence proposing that ftiH-tirfie&apos; national service Should be extendedto two years (*B.P: (50) 188) and that increases should, be made in service pay (CP. (50) 190);The Minister of Defence said that the Army ario^ the Royal AirForce were becomng unbalanced because of the seripus reduction inthe regular epmppnent of each Service. This was a long-term trend,adversely affecting the efficiency of the Services^ which had to be corrected, and it could not be met by his proposals relating to thelength of national service. Following the Estimates debates in march last, an inter-Service working party had been set up to make a compre-hensive enquiry into conditions of service in the three Services and ithad been intended to complete this enquiry by October next. TheKorea crisis and its consequences had made it necessary to speed upthe enquiry and to undertake urgent negotiations with the Treasury.The working party had found that a substantial increase in pay wasnecessary to stem the. serious decline-in regular recruitment and thedisinclination of regulars to re-engage for further periods of service.There was special need for an increase in flying pay and in re-engage-ment bounties. They had accordingly recommended increases of pay which would cost about  56 million in a full year. The basic pay of lower ranks would be increased by 3s. a day, and of Warrant officersby 6s. a day. A second lieutenant would receive an additional 4s. 6d*a day, and a major Is. a day. The figure of  56 million also included the cost of the recalled reservists and a proposal that the increasedregular pay should be given to national servicemen in the last sixmonths of their full-time service if the period of service was raised to two years. The Treasury had been reluctant to agree to proposalswhich would cost a sum substantially in excess of the figure of 30 million a year which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had indi-cated in CP: (50) 181, and subsequently communicated to the UnitedStates Administration, as the likely cost of improved pay and increasedpersonnel of the Armed Forces. He had discussed the matter withthe Minister of State for Economic Affairs; and, if financial considera-tions were to override other considerations, he was prepared to acceptcompromise proposals estimated to cost  40 million or a little more.Under these compromise proposals, the lower ranks would receive anincrease of 2s. a day and warrant officers 5s. a day. There would becorresponding reductions irt the increases proposed for officers; andit was suggested that, instead of giving the national servicemen (ifthey were required to serve for two years) full regular pay for the last six months, a bounty of  15 might be given at the conclusion of theirtwo years&apos; service.The Minister of State for Economic Affairs said that he was notprepared to accept the proposition that, having regard to all thecircumstances, Service pay was low in comparison with that of civil employment; but he recognised the need for some increase in pay inorder to increase the size of the regular forces. While the treasury were prepared to agree to proposals costing  40 million, they would wish to have ah opportunity in the next few weeks to scrutinise more closely some of the details of the proposals put forward by theMinister of Defence. The Treasury would not be prepared to regard the present increases in pay as a precedent for increases in other services which were paid from the Exchequer or received a substantialExchequer Contribution.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Army was seriously short of regulars: if present trendscontinued, the number of regular troops would fall by 1st April, 1953,to 107,000. Moreover, these Were not highly trained veterans: manywere young soldiers of a relatively poor type inferior to the national servicemen and were not suitable for promotion to non-commissionedrank.   The officer position was also disquieting; and a fall in the
number and quality of officers would have an even more serious effect on the efficiency and morale of the Army. This year there were300 vacancies at Sandhurst and only 200 suitable candidates to fitthem. Many officers in the middle grades were anxious, on fiiianciaigrounds, to leave the Army as soon as they could. In the Royal Air.Force regulars were required to provide air crews and non-commissioned ranks. At present home air defence was far belowstrength, and there could be no question of making an adequatecontribution to a European tactical air force unless regular recruitment for air crews was substantially increased. The Navy&apos;s difficulties werenot so serious; but they were not able to fill all their vacancies andwere experiencing great difficulty in getting men to re-engage forfurther service.   ;(b) Ministers discussed how Service earnings compared withcivilian earnings. A second lieutenant was regarded as receivingemoluments equivalent to  499 if single and  636 if married, and thiswas contrasted with the much smaller pay which other professionalmen received at an early age. Some doubt was accordingly expressedwhether increases in pay would, in fact, have the favourable effect onrecruitment which the Service Ministers believed. On the other hand,it was pointed out that, whatever paper calculations might suggest,those in close touch with the Services found many officers and non-commissioned officers in serious financial straits, to an extent notparalleled in civil life. Officers who were in stations for short periodshad frequently to take expensive living accommodation for their families because of the shortage of married quarters, and they alsoincurred heavy expenditure on the education of their children. Whilethe necessary steps had been taken to protect young officers fromrunning up high mess bills, unavoidable expenditure in other directionsmade it difficult for them to make ends meet. Officers and non-commissioned officers could do more than any other agency to securethe recruitment of national servicemen and other young men to theServices; but in present conditions many of them tended to discouragerecruitment by dwelling on the difficulties in which they found them-selves and on the superior financial attractions, as they thought, of civilian life.(c) The Minister of Labour did not wish to oppose the proposed increases in pay since they were not likely to have serious repercussions on current wage negotiations. In most of the industries where wagesclaims were expected, the claims had already been lodged and were likely to go to arbitration. While an increase in Service pay mightbe used by the trade unions as an argument in support of their claims,conditions in the Services and in civilian employment were so different,in regard to hours, discipline and general conditions of service^ thatthe analogy could not be pressed very far.(d) Whatever increases in pay were agreed upon, it was essentialto take other steps simultaneously to encourage recruitment for theServices. Recent police experience showed that substantial increases of pay did not necessarily lead to an increase in the recruitment of menof the necessary quality. It would therefore be necessary to take all practicable steps to eliminate any out-of-date and unnecessaryconditions of service which rendered Service life less attractive, toimprove amenities and housing, and by efficient public relationswork to make it clear to the country at large, and to parents in par-ticular, that in present circumstances service in the Armed forces was of the highest importance for the safety of this country. in public statements, the existing rates of pay and the proposed increases should be expressed in weekly, rather than daily, amounts.While it was recognised that the compromise proposals, involving an expenditure of  40 million a year, might go some way to stimulateService recruitment, the general view of Ministers was that they wouldnot go far enough to check present trends.   It was urgently necessary
to create an efficient fighting machine to deter aggression. The pro-posals originally put forward by the Minister of Defence were basedon the investigations of a working party which included members ofthe three Services and had endeavoured, by detailed enquiries, toascertain the minimum improvement in conditions which was likelyto secure and retain the right type of recruit for the various services the compromise proposals were governed by considerations ofnational finance and, while it was clear that the additional expenditure involved in the original proposals would have to be met either bysavings elsewhere or by additional taxation, the general view wasthat it would be lamentable if the current large expenditure on defence was rendered in part nugatory in order to effect a saving ofthe order of  15 million a year. Experience showed that expensiveequipment could be largely wasted if it were not in the hands of high-quality troops. It was unfortunate that further time was not availableto examine whether a more selective scheme of pay increases couldbe devised to correct the most serious shortages. Particular concernwas expressed about the proposed cut in the additional pay for officers.It was felt that it would be better to give national servicemen in thelast six months of their, service the increased pay for regulars, ratherthan to give them at the end of their service a bounty of smalleraggregate value which might be used in unprofitable ways.Period of Before taking a final decision on pay, the Cabinet examined theNational related proposal in CP. (50) 188 for an increase in the period of full-Service, time national service.The Minister of Defence said that, although the original intentionhad been simply to train national servicemen as a war reserve, it had from the first been necessary to use them for overseas service and this had made it necessary to retain them for eighteen months. He had recently resisted insistent proposals by the Chiefs of Staff that theperiod of service should be further increased to two years, but he was now fully convinced that this increase was urgently needed. he intended that the additional trained men which an extension of theperiod of service made available should be used to build up thestrength of our occupation forces in Germany to three divisions andif, as he believed possible, the other Brussels Pact signatories wereinduced by our example to speed up the growth of their forces, itshould be possible by next year to have forces in Western europe which would provide a useful deterrent against aggression. The pro-posed increase in the period of service would require legislation and inhis view it would be important to give the national servicemen theincreased regular &quot;pay for the last six months of their two years&apos; service as a consolation to existing national servicemen for the extra time theywould have to serve and to facilitate the passage of the necessary legislation through Parliament.In subsequent discussion the following points were made:  (e) The Chiefs of Staff said that an extension of the period of full-time national service was required because the danger of a general war had increased in recent months. The devices to which it hadbeen necessary to resort in order to gather together a brigade groupfor service in Korea illustrated the parlous position in which the Armyfound itself. Russia might engineer another act of aggression in thenear future, in Germany or in Persia; and an increase in the periodof national service would yield the forces needed to meet any threat of this character.(/) The proposed increase in the period of national service wouldgive the Army 50,000 men, and they would be used to render effectivevarious garrisons overseas and to provide a small strategic reserve inthis country consisting of an infantry division, an armoured brigade and an airborne regiment.   The increase in the period of national
service would cause a temporary stoppage of the build-up of theTerritorial Army, but this would not be altogether a disadvantagesince it would give time for the necessary training facilities to bedeveldped in respect of the present volunteer recruitment to theTerritorial Army and the national service intake, both of which were going well.(g) The ground services of the R.A.F. were in an unsatisfactorycondition and were about 50 per cent, of establishment. The pro-posed . increase in the period of national service would yield 28,000additional men between now and mid-1951 and would enable theR.A.F. to improve the serviceability of its equipment. national servicemen with two years&apos; service could be given flying training, andby joining the first line reserve would raise the war strength of theR.A.F. The Navy would not increase the token entry of 2,000national servicemen and would not benefit by the proposed increasein the period of service.(h) The proposal to withhold 80,000 National Servicemen for afurther period of six months would riot be so serious in its effects on industry as the calling-up of older and more skilled men fromthe various reserves. The loss of 80,000 young men would not be serious in a working population of 22 million. If the proposals forincreased pay succeeded in attracting more regular recruits, afurther 40-45,000 persons might be lost to industry, and on this assumption the total loss of production might be of the order of 75 million a year. The Exchequer cost of extending the periodof national service would be  16 million, plus a further  5 millioriin respect of the increased Service pay proposed for national servicemen in the final months of their service.&apos;(/) The proposed increase in the period of national service wouldriqi be popular, particularly among men nOw serving who had expected to be released in the near future and had made arrange-rilents for re-entry into civilian life. At the same time, it was notedthat the retention of tradesmen in the R.A.F: for periods of from three to six months at the time of the Berlin airlift had not met withthe unfriendly reception which had been expected. Care would haveto be taken to explain the national needs which had led to thedecision to extend the period of national service.(j) Special attention would have to be paid to the repercussions ofthe extension of the period of national service on university and tech-nical education. Every endeavour would have to be made (while pf e-servirig, so far as possible, uniformity of treatment among all national servicemen) that those who were going on to university and technicaleducatibn did not lose more time than was unavoidable through thethe sudden increase in the period Of service. While industry at large and the trade unions had gone a long way to accept service trainingin a trade as meeting in some degree apprenticeship and other civilrequirements, the position might have to be reviewed to see whethermore should be done, in view of the longer period of service. Appren-apprenticeship after release from the Services might also be further reducedby an intensification of the methods of training. The operation ofthe national service grants scheme would have to be reviewed toensure that it worked expeditiously in the new conditions.(k) It would be necessary to explain to the United States Govern-ment that additional expenditure was being incurred because of theincrease in the period of national service. Doubt was expressedwhether any endeavour should be made to secure further assistancefrom the United States Government on this score, particularly sincefurther assistance might be given on irksome conditions.Most Ministers thought that the case had been fully establised for an increase of the period of national service from 18 months to two years, though the view was expressed that further time might usefully have been given for the consideration of a measure which involved a considerable amount of personal hardship and was likely
to be of prolonged duration, since it was linked with western european defence arrangements.The general view of the Cabinet was that recent developments in the international situation had not lessened, but increased, the dangers of sudden aggression: and that the arrangements for the[defence of Western Europe had reached a critical stage at whichdecisive action had to be taken. Even on a narrow view of thedefence interests of this country, some speedy augmentation of thenumber of trained men was urgently required to meet possibledemands on the Armed Forces and, in particular, to meet the urgent rquirements of the Royal Air Force for the air defence of thiscountry.The wider needs of Western European defence pointed in the samedirection/ The lengthened period of national service was requiredto enable the United Kingdom to play its part in the defence of western Europe, but it was also needed to encourage the otherBrussels Treaty Powers; to increase the length of national service andso tp render their forces more effective. Would it be enough to givea lead to these countries, or should some more tangible proof of theirintehtions be forthcoming before the Cabinet took a final decision?Some indication of what other countries were proposing to do wouldbe of great value in securing Parliamentary authority for a two-year period of national service. It was agreed that the Foreign secretary should inform the Foreign Ministers of France, the Netherlands,Belgium and Luxembourg that the Government were favourably disposed towards a lengthening of the period of national service, but would wish to know, before reaching a final decision, whether thesecountries had in mind to take a similar step.If a two-year period of national service was to be introduced on or before 1st October next, it would be necessary to recall Parliamentto pass the necessary legislation. It was desirable that the Bill shouldbe as short as possible, so as to facilitate its passage through bothHouses in two or three days. There was reason to believe that theOpposition had it in mind to ask shortly for a recall of Parliament;and, since the Government should retain the initiative in a matterof this kind, a statement should be made forthwith that an emergencymeeting of both Houses was being arranged. The most convenienttime of meeting would be Tuesday, 12th September.The Prime Minister had provisionally arranged to broadcast tothe Forces on Wednesday, 23rd August., and it was the general viewof Ministers that this opportunity should be taken to announce the government&apos;s policy on increased pay and on national service. a white Paper should be issued at the same time to acquaint bothHouses with^the Government^ proposals on national service andthe decisions taken (which did not require legislation) on pay.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that Service pay should be increased, at an annual cost estimated at  56 million, on the lines of the scheme outlined in the Annex to CP. (50)        f$*(2) Agreed in principle that the period of full-time nationalservice should be increased from eighteen months to twoyears.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Foreign ministers of France, the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg in confidence that the United Kingdom Government were giving favourable consideration to a proposal for a two-year period of national service and to enquire whether their Governments would follow suit.(4) Authorised the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theMinister of Defence, to arrange for the drafting of the short Bill required to extend the period of national service to two years.(5) Agreed to consider at a meeting of the Cabinet to be held inthe near future, and in any event before 23rd August, theresults of the enquiries made under conclusion (3) above.
I     204. (6) Took note that, as indicated in paragraph 4 of CP. (50) 188,it would be necessary for the Royal Air Force to suspend the release of regulars, as the other Services had already done.(7) Invited the Prime Minister, after consultation with Mr.Speaker, to issue forthwith a public statement that bothHouses would meet on Tuesday, 12th September, todiscuss the defence situation.(8) Took note that the Prime Minister would inform the lord president, as Leader of the House of Commons, of, thereasons which had made it necessary to re-call parliament on 12th September.(9) Took note that the Prime Minister would announce the government&apos;s decisions about Service pay and the government&apos;s proposals about the extension of full-timenational service in a broadcast provisionally arranged forWednesday, 23rd August.(10) Agreed that a White Paper indicating the Governmenfsdecisions about Service pay and the proposals about- national service should be sent to the Members of bothHouses at the time of the proposed broadcast.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\2th August, 1950.
