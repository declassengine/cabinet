industrial disputes.Duple MotorBodies,Limited.(previous reference:CM. (50); 83rdConclusions,Minute 9.)BritishOverseasAirwaysCorporation.(previous reference:CM. (50) 83rdConclusions,Minute 9.)1. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Labour and the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 304 and 305) regardingthe strike at Duple Motor Bodies, Limited, Hendon.The Attorney-General said that this strike, though a clear breach of the National Arbitration and Conditions of Employment Order,did not raise any issues of great public importance and he had not hitherto been disposed to take proceedings for this breach of theOrder. It had, however, been suggested, in a Parliamentary question by Mr. Lionel Heald, M.P., that the Works Committee at the neigh-bouring factory of Park Royal Vehicles, Limited, were bringing pressure to bear on employees at that factory to contribute towards a fund for supplementing the strike pay of employees at Duple MotorBodies, Limited. Police enquiries indicated that this suggestion waswell founded. This was a more serious matter; but he was in thedifficulty that the only charge which was likely to succeed against theWorks Committee at Park Royal Vehicles, Limited, was one of aidingand abetting the strike at Duple&apos;s, and he could hardly bring such a charge unless he also prosecuted the trade union and other leaders forcounselling and procuring the strike at Duple&apos;s.The Cabinet were informed that the dispute at Duple&apos;s had nowbeen referred to arbitration; and it was agreed that this strike raisedno important issue of public interest. As regards the action of theWorks Committee at the neighbouring factory, the Attorney-general would doubtless satisfy himself, before deciding to instituteproceedings, that this action had not been taken with the knowledge and approval of the Executive of the trade union. Difficult issuesmight arise if anything were done which could be construed as anattempt to restrict the rights of trade unions to raise funds for thesupport of a strike. There was also likely to be misunderstanding ifcriminal proceedings were taken in respect of a dispute which hadalready been referred to arbitration. There would be no public dis-advantage if the Attorney-General decided not to institute any proceedings in respect of this dispute.The point was also made that, if the dispute could not be settled by an award at arbitration, it would be helpful if the Minister ofLabour could announce that a public enquiry would be held.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Attorney-General to take note of the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider that part of the Attorney-GeneraFs memorandum (CP. (50) 305) which was concerned withthe strike of electricians employed by the British Overseas airways corporation.The Cabinet were informed^hatrthe men who had been on strike had resumed work that morning. The Attorney-General hadnot to institute criminal proceedings against them. He was, however,anxious to explain, in reply to an arranged Parliamentary Question,that his decision was based mainly on the fact that the Minister ofLabour would not have referred the dispute to arbitration even if ithad been reported to him.The Lord President suggested that an announcement on those lines should not be made without consultation with the Prime Ministerand the Minister of Labour.The Cabinet-(2) Agreed that the Attorney-General, before announcing his reasons for refraining from taking proceedings in respectof the recent strike of electricians employed by the british overseas Airways Corporation, should consult with theMinister of Labour and the Prime Minister regarding theterms of the announcement which he was proposing tomake.39842-3 b 2
NationalArbitrationand Conditionsof EmploymentOrder.(previous reference:CM. (50) 64thConclusions,Minute 2.)In the course of the discussions recorded above reference wasmade to the difficulties of enforcing the National Arbitration andConditions of Employment Order, and doubts were expressed aboutthe advantages of maintaining it in operation. The Order had been designed for war-time conditions: and there were undoubtedly great difficulties in maintaining, in time of peace, a system of compulsory arbitration for industrial disputes.The Cabinet-(3) Took note that the Minister of Labour would shortly submit to them a general memorandum on the question whetherthe National Arbitration and Conditions of EmploymentOrder should be continued in force.Korea. 2.   The Foreign Secretary reported the latest developments in(Previous        relation to Korea.Reference: The military situation, though still grave, seemed to be lessCM. (50) 82nd critical. The military commanders now believed that they could con-Conclusions, concentrate their forces south of the 38th Parallel, and hold positionsMinute 1.)       there against any weight of attack which seemed likely to develop.In the United Nations, thanks largely to the helpful intervention of the Indian Government, a constructive and realistic approach wasbeing made to the problem; and there now seemed to be a fair chance that a resolution could be passed calling simply for a cease-fire in korea. The Foreign Secretary said that he had bent his effortstowards securing that the resolution should call for a cease-fire without seeking to impose conditions on either side.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the Indian Govern-ment were likely to suggest that the new resolution should also include some reference to the desirability of negotiation with the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government on Formosa as well as Korea. The point wasmade that the United States Government would probably find difficulty in accepting a resolution containing such a reference toFormosa. The Cabinet agreed, however, to defer their considerationof that issue until they had received the Prime Ministers report onhis discussions with President Truman.There seemed to be some indications that the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment were not anxious that hostilities should continue in korea. Indeed, the improvement in the military situation might bepartly due to the fact that the Chinese armies had not exploited theiropportunities to the full. The suggestion was made that, in view ofits reaction on the political situation, the Cabinet might with advan-tage see a summary of any military intelligence which gave a clue toChinese intentions. The Minister of Defence said, however, that very little military intelligence of this kind was reaching him fromKorea.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Germany.soviet proposal for meeting of council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 82ndConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the official representativesof the Governments of the United Kingdom, the United States andFrance had now completed the draft of a reply to the Soviet proposalfor a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. He would submit the draft for consideration by the Cabinet at a meeting later in theweek. His representatives had found no difficulty in keepingwithin the limits of the instructions approved by the Cabinet on 5th December.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
Germany. 4.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that, at their meeting inRearmament.   Washington in October, the North Atlantic Defence Committee had(Previous        remitted to the Council of Deputies and the Military Committee,Reference:      meeting separately in the first instance and thereafter jointly, the taskCM. (50) 69th   of finding a solution of the deadlock which had arisen from theConclusions,    French opposition to the United States proposals for enablingMinute l.)       Germany to contribute towards the defence of Western Europe.  TheCouncil of Deputies had now evolved a compromise which would allow progress to be made with the formation of German militaryforces; and they were to discuss this with the Military Committee ata meeting during the current week.   It had been proposed that, ifapproved by the Military Committee, this plan should be considered at a meeting of the North Atlantic Council to be held in Brussels on18th December.  It was contemplated that, on the day preceding the Councils meeting, there would be a preliminary discussion between Ministerial representatives of the United Kingdom, theUnited States and France.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the gravity of theinternational situation, he had been concerned about the timing ofany public announcement of a decision to proceed with the rearming,.of Western Germany. The Cabinet would have to consider very carefully the possible repercussions of such an announcement, andhe had not felt confident that they would be able to reach a finaldecision before 11th December. He had therefore thought it righttp give a warning through the United Kingdom Deputy that HisMajesty&apos;s Government reserved their position on the timing of any approach to the Germans and also on the details of the plan evolvedby the Council of Deputies. He had consulted the Prime Minister,who Was agreeable that the Brussels meeting should be convened.The Minister of Defence said that he presumed that the recom-mendations of the Council of Deputies and the Military Committeewould be reported in the first instance to the North Atlantic DefenceCommittee, before they were considered by the North atlantic council.In further discussion the point was made that the timing of any announcement of German rearmament would have to be considered in relation to the proposal for a meeting of the Council of foreign ministers. The reaction of public opinion in Western germany would also have to be considered. Even if the anxieties of the Frenchcould be overcome, it was by no means clear that the creation ofGerman military forces would be welcomed in Western Germany.The Cabinet-. Took note that the Foreign Secretary would submit for their consideration later in the week a report on the latest developments in the discussion of Germany&apos;s participation in the defence of Western Europe.Nepal. 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that Sir Esler Dening&apos;s mission(Previous        to Katmandhu seemed likely to produce fruitful results.  The delayReference:      which had been imposed had given an opportunity for wiser counselsCM. (50) 79th   to prevail in Delhi.  The Government of Nepal had now put forwardConclusions,    certain proposals for constitutional reform; and, although these were minute 7.)       not as far-reaching as the Prime Minister of India had wished, theyat least provided a possibility of finding some accommodationbetween the Governments of India and Nepal.   The situation nowlooked much less serious than it had.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.
Egypt.Anglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:CM. (50) 79thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Foreign Secretary said that he had not been able tomake much progress in his discussion with the Egyptian ForeignMinister regarding the future of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that a complete deadlockhad been reached in his discussions with the Egyptian Foreign Ministerabout Egypt&apos;s sterling balances.The Cabinet- 5Took note that the Foreign Secretary would submit, for the cabinet&apos;s consideration later in the week, a report on had discussions regarding the future of the Anglo-egyptian treaty.European 7.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that during the pastEconomic two weeks he had been discussing with representatives of the economic co-operation. Co-operation Administration the future of Marshall Aid, and he hadMarshall Aid. now received a firm indication that the United States Government(Previous did not propose to make further payments to this country under the reference: European Recovery Programme. He had stressed the need for anCM. (49) 15th immediate settlement of the outstanding differences between the twoConclusions, countries about the Counterpart Fund. The question of united minute 5.) States assistance for rearmament was being examined separately. he proposed to make ah announcement in the House of Commons on13th December about the cessation of Marshall Aid.The Cabinet-Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Food. 8. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the ArgentineMeat Supplies. Government had now stated that they were not prepared to supply(Previous meat at  97 10s. a ton for more than one month pending a final settle-Reference: ment. They clearly intended to persist in demanding higher pricesCM. (50) 83rd for long-term contracts. A period of one month would not giveConclusions, . adequate time for further negotiations, and he therefore recommendedMinute 5.) that the Cabinet should refuse to accept the Argentine offer.The Minister of Food said that the Argentine Government had never formally abandoned their claim for  140 a ton. At this juncturethey would not be likely to accept less than  120 a ton; and the UnitedKingdom Government could not afford to pay this amount, havingregard to the consequential increases which would follow in the pricesof beef and mutton from Australia and New Zealand.   Even ifArgentina had agreed to resume shipments at once, it would have been necessary at this date to go down to a \0d. ration of carcase meat forsome part of January. In the present unfavourable state of the nego-tiations he wished to announce at an early date that, as from31st December, the weekly meat ration would go down to lOd^-worth of carcase meat and 2d.-worth of corned meat.  That ration couldbe held until mid-February, and until mid-March if 15,000 tons of meat could be obtained from Uruguay. It was possible, however, thatArgentina would persuade Uruguay not to send meat to this country.If the Argentine Government remained obdurate and Uruguayanmeat had not been received, it would be necessary in the third week of January to announce that from the middle of February the ration of carcase meat would go down to 8d. a week; but the total rationcould be kept at Is. by increasing the amount of corned meat to 4d.This ration could be held until April, when spring supplies would becoming in from Australia and New Zealand.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Subject to decisions which would shortly be taken by theEconomic Policy Committee, it should be possible to raise the sugar
ration to 10 oz. per week. It might also be possible to increase thecheese ration by 1 oz. in the middle of January and the bacon rationby a similar amount. There was general agreement that the Ministerof Food should, if practicable, delay his announcement about the cut in the meat ration until he was in a position to announce the proposed increases in other rations. He could not, however, delay the announce-ment beyond 19th December; and, in order to avoid making it toonear to Christmas and to give notice to the Argentine Governmentthat the United Kingdom Government were not prepared to payhigher prices, the announcement should if possible be made duringthe current week.(b) It might be necessary to reintroduce price control for fish, forwhich there would be an increased demand. Long-term measures for improving the distribution of fish should also be considered: inparticular, further thought might be given to a scheme for centralisedfish-frying in populous areas, so that housewives could be induced to make greater use of cooked fish.(c) The Overseas Negotiations Committee should at once consider what steps could be taken to deny important supplies to Argentina,with a view to inducing the Argentine Government to adopt a more-conciliatory attitude about meat.(d) The general view was that it would be undesirable to placefundue stress, in public statements about the cut in the meat ration,on the high prices which the Argentine Government were demanding.If precise figures were quoted, there would be speculation about the compromise price which the United Kingdom Government might beprepared to pay. . It would also be embarrassing to have to refer to ,the possibility of consequential increases in the meat prices paid to &apos;other Commonwealth countries.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the present proposals of the Argentine Govern-ment about meat supplies could not be accepted; and that from 31st December the weekly meat ration should bereduced to 10d.-worth of carcase meat and 2d.-worth ofcorned meat.(2) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce this reductionin the meat ration as soon as he was able to announcecompensating increases in the rations of sugar, cheese orbacon.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for the overseas Negotiations Committee to consider what steps might be taken, by way of reducing exports or otherwise,to bring pressure to bear on the Argentine Governmentto adopt a more reasonable attitude on the price of meat.9. The Cabinet discussed the handling of the debate on the coal situation which was to take place in the House of Commons on thefollowing day. They considered the terms of the Government amend-ment to the Opposition motion, and agreed that its wording shouldbe finally settled by the Lord President and the Minister of Fuel and power. They also agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power andhis Parliamentary Secretary should be the Government spokesmen inthe debate.10. The Cabinet considered the proposal, put forward by theMinister of Fuel and Power in paragraph 10 of CP. (50) 302 and inparagraph 13 (c) of CP. (50) 297, that young men should be given anopportunity to opt for two years&apos; employment in the mines as analternative to military service.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the National coal board were satisfied that, if this proposal were adopted, there would
be a valuable increase in the labour force of the industry and thatsome of the young men who entered it under this system would remain permanently in the industry.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the National coal board were unduly optimistic about the number of recruits to beobtained by this means. Moreover, since these young men couldnot be required to remain in the mines for more than two years, itwould become difficult to maintain the present arrangement underwhich youths in the industry who opted for service in the mines were expected to remain in the industry until they were tWenty-six yearsof age. If the impression were given that the coalmining indusrty was so unattractive that this sort of expedient had to be introduced in order to induce men to go into it, the campaign in favour of workin the mines as a well-paid and important calling would be very seriously prejudiced.The Cabinet-Agreed that it was undesirable in present circumstances toproceed with the proposal that young men should be given  an option to serve in the coalmining industry for two years in lieu of National Service.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,llth December, 1950.
