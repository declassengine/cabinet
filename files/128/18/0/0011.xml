The Prime Minister read a telegram which he had receivedKing. from the Prime Minister of Canada expressing the thanks of his(Previous       Government for the Cabinefs message of sympathy on the death ofReference:      Mr. Mackenzie King.CM. (50) 49thConclusions,Minute 1.)Parliament. 2.   The Opposition had insisted that the debate on Defence in business in the House of Commons should be continued for a second day; andthe House of they intended to divide the House on a motion that the second day&apos;sCommons. proceedings should be held in secret session. In these circumstancesRequest for the Prime Minister had thought it right to speak in the first day&apos;secret Session debate, in case the later proceedings should have to beheld in secret;on Defence. and it was agreed that the Government speech in reply to the debate(Previous on the second day should be made by the Minister of Defence. It was reference: further agreed that the Government should continue to resist the cm. (50) 45th proposal for a secret session.Minute 2) * ^ne Minister of Defence mentioned to the Cabinet four pointswith which he would wish to deal in replying to the debate. First,he had enquired whether it would be administratively practicable toensure that no menunder nineteen years of age were included in the brigade Group which was to be sent out for service in Korea. If an assurance could be given on this point, it should go a long way towards meeting the misgivings which had been expressed about allowingyoung National Servicemen to take part in active operations in theFar East. Secondly, he proposed to analyse the total expenditure on defence since the end of the war, with a view to emphasising the largeproportion represented by terminal expenditure and by improve-ments in the pay and conditions of the Services. Thirdly, in view, ofthe references which the Leader of the Opposition had made to hisconfidential discussions with members of the Government on defence questions, he would like to make it known that no concrete suggestionshad been made to the Government on behalf of the Opposition duringthe course of those discussions and that the Government were stillawaiting a memorandum which Mr. Churchill had offered to submitwhen the discussions were broken off in October 1949. The cabinet considered that there would be political advantages in making a public statement on these lines, and that it could be made without breach of confidence.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week immediately following the summer recess.Solicitors Bill. It was proposed that in the course of that week the House ofCommons should be invited to give a Second Reading to the SolicitorsBill. This was a Private Member&apos;s Bill, promoted by the law society, which had passed through all its stages in the House of Lordswithout opposition. The Lord Chancellor and the Law Officersthought it a valuable measure and had urged on that account that itshould be presented to the House of Commons as a Government Bill.A point of principle was, however, involved. When the Governmenthad allowed no time for Private Members&apos; Bills in the Commons, was it reasonable that they should invite the Commons to pass as aGovernment measure a Private Member&apos;s Bill which had been introduced in the House of Lords? Backbenchers in the commons would surely resent a procedure by which the privilege of initiatinglegislation, which had been denied to them, was in effect preservedfor members of the House of Lords. Moreover, once this precedentwas established attempts would be made to apply it to Bills whichwere less desirable on their merits.The Cabinet agreed that in these circumstances the preferablecourse would be to decline facilities for the discussion of the Solicitors
PermanentEconomicPowers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)Bill in the House of Commons during the current Session, but tore-introduce the Bill in the House of Lords as a Government measure in the following Session.3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 178) covering the draft of an Economic planning and Full Employment Bill, designed to continue on a permanent basis the essential economic controls which at present depended mainly on emergency powers.The Lord President said that the Lord Presidents Committeehad arranged for this Bill to be prepared, in accordance with theCabinet&apos;s decision of 30th March, in order to facilitate further con-sideration of the form in which essential economic controls shouldbe continued in force on a permanent basis. The powers conferred by the Bill, like the existing powers, were negative in form; but itmight be practicable to import some more positive powers into thedraft at a later stage. The Bill was likely to be opposed in the Houseof Commons and to be rejected by the House of Lords; so that, if itwere introduced next Session, it might become one of the main issuesat a General Election. The title of the Bill had been chosen to indicateits broad purpose, and a preamble.had been added. On balance, hewas in favour of introducing the Bill next Session, since the alternative was to rely on the annual renewal of emergency powers, and this, inrespect of the more controversial economic powers, would become more and more difficult as time went on. If the Cabinet approved the Bill in principle, Ministers would have further opportunities forsuggesting detailed improvements. As the Bill affected a number of departments, the Lord Presidents Committee had suggested that heshould take charge of it in the House of Commons.In discussion it was pointed out that the practical effect of theBill would be to preserve in permanent form the economic powers which the Government had been using since the end of the war.Despite its title, it was better adapted for the purpose of preventinginflation than of securing full employment. It might be that by theautumn the repercussions of expanded defence programmes and the partial relaxation of the wages freeze would have increased the dangers of inflation, and that Parliament would be more ready topass legislation primarily designed to counter inflationary tendencies.The prospects for a Bill on these lines would be further enhanced ifthe United States Government had sought from Congress similarpowers to control inflation. Even within the limited field coveredby the present draft, the responsible Ministers might wish to suggestdetailed amendments e.g., in regard to the maintenance of utilityschemes and price control.From a rather longer-term point of view, however, the negativecharacter of the Bill had political disadvantages. Criticism of the bill could be expressed shortly and pungently, whereas the defence of its provisions would require a fairly long exposition. It would bring intosharper focus the extent of the powers which the Government were already exercising: this was less obvious now, when the existing powers were scattered among numerous emergency statutes and regulations dating from the war and immediately thereafter. Theneed to compress within the provisions of a relatively short Billpowers which in their practical application filled many volumes of statutory instruments meant that far wider powers had to be takenthan would in fact be exercised by the present Government, but thislaid the Government open to the allegation that they were encroach-ing upon the legislative functions of Parliament and taking wide powers of government by decree. It would be expedient, therefore,that the negative character of the Bill should be modified by theinclusion of positive powers to plan the national economy. A Sub-Committee of the Production Committee was examining the questions
of manufacturing, in Government-controlled establishments, goods for civilian use and of dealing with unemployment in the development areas: the President of the Board of Trade was contemplatingmeasures for promoting industrial efficiency: and various other pro-posals were under consideration by Ministers for introducing a widerand more positive element of public ownership and control into Britishindustry, with a view to ensuring the continuance of full employment.The Ministers concerned with economic affairs should, therefore,consider in the light of these developments what further powers should be taken to maintain full employment; and the question could then be considered, before the beginning of the new Session, whether some more positive provisions of this kind should be introduced intothe Bill. The timing of the introduction of such a Bill would require careful consideration, especially as the public might be concerned inthe autumn rather with the danger of inflation than with any threat to full employment. The Co-operative movement should be consulted on any positive powers proposed for inclusion in the Bill, even though they might be more concerned with executive measures taken under those powers.The Cabinet were informed that the subject-matter of the bill was one which fell within the province of the Parliament of NorthernIreland and that, when the form of the legislation had been settled,it would be necessary to initiate discussions with the Government ofNorthern Ireland, with a view to endeavouring to secure their agree-ment to introduce similar legislation.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed in principle that permanent economic powers shouldbe secured on the general lines proposed in the draftEconomic Planning and Full Employment Bill annexed to CP. (50) 178.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for the responsible ministers (i) to consider what further powers might beincluded in such a Bill to promote a positive policy ofeconomic planning and full employment and (ii) to arrangefor the necessary drafting to be undertaken.(3) Agreed to discuss at a later meeting in the autumn the timing of the introduction of an Economic Planning and full employment Bill, in the light of the conditions then pre-vailing.4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C.P7 (50) 177) covering a report on the economic situation.The following points were made in discussion:  The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he continued to be concerned lest coal requirements should out-run supplies. The export programme of coal had already been reduced, and it now seemed likely that there would be a shortfall of 500,000 tons even on the reduced target. There was a risk that the National Coal Board might even have to break their contractual commitments for exports.The Cabinet were informed that these difficulties arose mainly from the increased industrial demand for coal, consequent upon theincreased rate of industrial productivity. It was estimated that overthe next five years the rising curve of industrial productivity wouldinvolve an annual increase of 4 million tons in the industrial con-sumption of coal. The National Union of Mineworkers had under-taken to co-operate in a special campaign for increased output, whichwas to open in September. This might secure an additional 1 million tons of output. And further results were expected from the extensionof the new sysytem of piece-work which had been mentioned in theCabinet&apos;s discussion of 13th July. The situation was to be reviewed by the Production Committee at their next meeting.
Reference was also made to the delay which had occurred in settling the current wages claim in the coalmining industry. This, would now be referred to arbitration. Several Ministers stressed theimportance of securing the earliest possible decision on this claim.Prices. Import prices continued to rise.  The higher prices of rawmaterials such as rubber and tin, while they improved the dollarbalance of the sterling area as a whole, increased the indebtedness ofthe United Kingdom to the rest of the sterling area.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (50) 177 and of the points raised in thediscussion.5. The Minister of Supply said that the leaders of the steelindustry had declined to give him any assistance or support in per-suading suitably qualified people to accept appointment to the Ironand Steel Corporation. In spite of this opposition he had found a chairman, and some persons suitable to act as members, of the Cor-poration.The Cabinet Took note of this statement and invited the Minister ofSupply to continue his efforts to bring the Iron and steel act, 1949, into operation in accordance with their decisionof 29th June.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Chan-cellor and the Minister of Defence (CP. (50) 180) proposing, in thelight of the reports of the Lewis Committee on Army and Air force courts-martial and of the Pilcher Committee on Naval courts-martial,that the existing system of courts-martial should continue, subject tothe institution of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court and to a number of detailed improvements to be agreed upon between the Departmentsconcerned.The Lord Chancellor said that the somewhat conflicting recom-mendations made by the Lewis and Pilcher Committees had been examined by an interdepartmental working party which had reachedthe broad conclusion that the existing system should be continued,subject to the institution of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court whichwould be linked with the Court of Criminal Appeal and would bepresided over by a King&apos;s Bench Judge. Provision would be madefor appeals on questions of law, or mixed questions of law and fact,at the instance of the convicted person or of a reviewing authority.An adequate case did not appear to have been made for the repre-sentation of &quot; other ranks &quot; on courts-martial; and since courts-martial were, in the future as in the past, to resemble benches of magistrates rather than a judge and jury, it seemed right that theexisting system of majority verdicts should continue.The Minister of Defence said that the final report of the pilcher committee on naval courts-martial was about to be signed, but wouldhave thereafter to be considered by Ministers. It would be concernedwith the system of summary justice which played a larger part in theNavy than in the other Services, but, pending consideration of thisreport, it would be difficult to deal comprehensively with the courts-martial procedure of the three Services in the immediate future. the alternatives were to pass legislation dealing with Army and Air force courts-martial and to postpone legislation on Naval courts-martial,while indicating, possibly in a White Paper, the lines on which the sub-ject would be dealt with, or to postpone legislation on all three Servicesuntil a comprehensive Bill could be prepared. The Bill would not attempt to place all three Services on a uniform system, since theBoard of Admiralty attached importance to various features of navalcourts-martial which were peculiar to that Service.Iron andSteel Act.(previous reference:CM. (50) 40thConclusions,Minute 1.)ServiceCourts-Martial.^previous reference:CM. (49) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)
In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general support for the proposed establishment ofa Courts-Martial Appeal Court. The establishment of this court would allay a good deal of the anxiety which had been felt about thesystem of courts-martial. The Secretary of State for Scotland and theLord Advocate would wish to discuss with the Lord Chancellor what steps might be taken to give the Court a greater appearance of separa-tion from the English Court of Criminal Appeal.(b) The Government might be embarrassed, and the discipline ofthe Services might be adversely affected, if legislation were introduced in present circumstances which enabled all possible modifications incourts-martial procedure to be canvassed in Parliament: in particular,the Government might have difficulty in resisting proposals that, onthe analogy of United States practice, &quot; other ranks &quot; should berepresented on courts-martial. In view of the Governments narrowmajority in the House of Commons there could be no guarantee thatsuch a Bill would emerge from that House in a form acceptable to theGovernment.(c) It would be undesirable to proceed with legislation relating toArmy and Air Force courts-martial and to postpone legislation on naval courts-martial, since the Government had hitherto argued thatthe procedure as respects all three Services must be considered together. The better course would therefore be to introduce legisla-tion limited to the establishment of a Courts-Martial Appeal Courtcovering all three Services, and to postpone legislation on other aspectsof the subject until some future time.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that a Courts-Martial Appeal Court should be estab-lished for all three Services, and that the necessary legislation should be drafted by the Departments con-cerned, with a view to the introduction of a Bill in thefollowing Session.(2) Agreed that legislation on other aspects of courts-martial pro-cedure should be deferred for the time being.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (50) 175) regarding the action to be taken by the UnitedKingdom Government in respect of certain Conventions and oneRecommendation adopted by the International Labour Conference at its meeting in Geneva in 1949.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should notratify Convention No. 91 on Vacation Holidays with pay for Seafarers, or Convention No. 93 on Wages, Hours ofWork on Board Ship and Manning.(2) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should ratifyConvention No. 92 on Crew Accommodation on board ship as soon as the necessary regulations had been madeunder section 1 of the Merchant Shipping Act, 1948.(3) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should ratifyConvention No. 97 on Migration for Employment, subjectto a declaration excluding from the ratification Annexes Iand III of the Convention.(4) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should acceptRecommendation No. 86 on Migration for Employment,subject to the reservation stated in paragraph 6 of CP.(50) 175.(5) Authorised the Minister of Labour to notify these conclusions to Parliament in a White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to CP. (50) 175.Cabinet Office, SWA,21th July, 1950.
