Parliament,Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the week following the Christmas Recess.Housing. 2.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of(Previous Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (50) 314) seekingReference: authority to announce that it was the policy of the Government toCM. (50) 7lst build as many houses as possible within the limits imposed by theConclusions, capital investment programme and by supplies of materials and that,Minute l.)      in view of the adoption of incentive bonus schemes on house-building,it shOuld now be possible to obtain more houses for the same amountof capital expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was content thata public statement should be made in the terms set out in paragraph 8of CP. (50) 314. It was, however, important that Ministers should adhere closely to the precise terms of that statement, which had beenvery carefully considered.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Works to include, in a public announcement which he was proposing to make on 15thDecember regarding his recent consultations with thebuilding industry, a statement on house-building in the terms set out in paragraph 8 of CP. (50) 314.Germany.Soviet Proposalfor Meeting of council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 84thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 312) covering the draft, prepared at the Parismeeting of official representatives of the Governments of the UnitedKingdom, the United States and France, of the reply to be returnedto the Soviet proposal for a meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.The Foreign Secretary said that, since his memorandum was circulated, the United States and French Governments had proposedvarious amendments of the draft. He drew the Cabinefs attentionto these, and handed round a revised version of the draft, subsequentlycirculated as CP. (50) 319;In discussion of the revised draft the following points weremade:  (a) Was it necessary, in paragraph 3 of the draft, to place somuch emphasis on the allegation that the armed police in theSoviet Zone of Germany had been trained on military lines withartillery and tanks? Might not this be regarded by the Soviet Govern-ment as a provocative statement? In particular, was there clear evidence that this force was armed with tanks?The Foreign Secretary said that it was essential to deal firmly withthe Soviet allegation that the democracies were preparing to rearmwestern Germany, while eastern Germany had been demilitarised.He would, however, be prepared to dispense with the final sentence in paragraph 3 of the revised draft, if he found that the two otherGovernments were not attaching special importance to its inclusion.He would also verify, before the note was despatched, that there wasample evidence to support the statement that the armed police in eastern Germany were provided with tanks.(b) Was it necessary to state, in the second sentence of para-graph 5 of the draft, that the existing international tension: aroseprimarily from the general attitude adopted by the Soviet government since the end of the war?  Was not this unnecessarily provocative?39843-2 b 2
The Foreign Secretary said that he was not prepared to attend afurther meeting of the Council pf Foreign Ministers unless it had first been made clear that the purpose of the meeting was to discuss the realities of the international situation. He had insisted from the outset that the meeting could not be confined to the situation in Germany:it must address itself to the underlying causes of the international tension. It was also pointed out, in the discussion, that resolutionshad already been passed in the United Nations deploring the general attitude of the Soviet Government in international relations; and itwas therefore unlikely that this particular sentence of the draft wouldbe regarded as provocative,(c) Paragraph 6 of the revised draft incorporated a proposal, putforward by the United States Government, that officials of the four powers should meet for the purpose of examining the problems a tissue as well as drawing up an agenda for the meeting of Ministers.The Foreign Secretary said that he could not accept this proposal.It was quite unrealistic to suppose that officials would be able to makeany progress if they were invited to examine the. merits of these problems; and, if a successful official discussion were made a condi-tion precedent to the meeting of Ministers, it was clear that theMinisters would never meet. To include this proposal in the reply would be tantamount to rejecting the idea of a Ministerial meeting.The Cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view. They agreedthat the proposed meeting of officials must be restricted to the draw-ing up of an agenda for the Ministerial meeting.(d) The Lord President said that he was sorry that the foreign secretary had not felt able to adopt the suggestion, which he had made when the Cabinet considered this matter on 13th November,that in the reply to this Soviet proposal the opportunity should betaken of voicing the desire of the western world for a peaceful settle-ment of international difficulties.The Foreign Secretary said that he had been anxious to avoid giving a misleading impression of the results which might follow fromthe proposed meeting. He would, however, consider again whether some reference to this point might be included in paragraph 2 of thedraft reply.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a reply to the Soviet proposal for a meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers should be sent in theterms of the draft circulated with CP. (50) 319, subject tothe amendment noted in paragraph (c) above and tofurther consideration of the points noted in paragraphs(a) and (d) above.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth governments in advance of the terms of the reply which was to be sentto this proposal.(3) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would communicate theterms of the reply in advance to the Governments ofBelgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Austria; andwould also arrange for a copy to be shown to theChancellor of the Federal Republic of Germany.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (50) 311) on the latest developments in the discussions regarding Germany&apos;s participation in the defence of western Europe.The Foreign Secretary recalled the various stages through whichthese discussions had passed. When the United States Governmenthad first put forward their proposal that German military units should be included in the integrated force for the defence of western
231CM. (86) 50Europe, this had formed part of a comprehensive plan including theappointment of an American as Supreme Commander, the stationingof a substantial force of United States troops in Europe in time ofpeace and the conception of partnership in sharing the economicburden of North Atlantic defence. It was in consideration of these other aspects of the plan that he had felt able to recommend theCabinet to accept the principle of Germany&apos;s participation in theintegrated force. Since then, however, much time had been lost inthe discussion of the alternative French plan for the creation of a european army; and during that time reverses in Korea had post-poned the date by which fully effective American forces could arrive in Europe. We were therefore in a very much weaker position to run such risks as might be involved in embarking upon the processof rearming Germany. He had therefore felt considerable anxiety about the proposal to go forward at once with the compromise plan for German rearmament which had been evolved by the Council of deputies and the Military committee of the North Atlantic Council.He had held personal consultations with His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Moscow and with the United Kingdom High Commissioner inGermany. As a result he was satisfied that, if the German Govern-ment were pressed to say at once whether they were willing tocontribute to European defence on the basis outlined in Annex A to cp. (50) 311, they would make an unfavourable response. In that event, if a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers were to beheld, he would be in a weak bargaining position there. Moreover, ifthe Germans firmly declined to participate in the defence of western europe, he had no assurance that the United States would go forward with their original proposal to station a substantial force in Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that in these circumstances he would prefer to proceed somewhat cautiously with the plan evolved by theCouncil of Deputies and the Military Committee. If that plan wereendorsed at the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Councilon 18th December, he would propose that the German Governmentshould at this stage be informed merely that the plan had been adoptedbut should not be asked either to accept or to reject it. Secondly, hewould press the United States Government to proceed at once withthe appointment of a Supreme Commander and the creation of an integrated force for the defence of western Europe. In that event, ifa meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers were arranged, thewestern Powers would be able to discuss the demilitarisation ofGermany without having taken any irrevocable step towards therearming of western Germany. While he would not go back on his acceptance of the principle of German participation in the defenceof western Europe, he would urge that discretion should be used intiming the implementation of that principle.   This course would havethe additional advantage that it would not be necessary to solicitGerman help in the defence of Western Europe.  It would create a place for Germany in the scheme of European defence; and informalefforts could then be made to ensure that, when the time was ripe,the Germans would themselves offer to take their place in the scheme.The Minister of Defence said that he was in broad agreementwith the views expressed by the Foreign Secretary. The Cabinet mustface the fact that there was little military strength in western europe to resist any Russian aggression, Europe could not be defendedwithout American support &apos;T and our defence policy must therefore continue to be kept in close alignment with that of the United StatesGovernment. It was also his view that, as far ahead as could before seen, western Europe would require some contribution fromGermany if she was to be able to resist a Russian aggression. he therefore considered that we should stand firm on the principle thatGermany should participate in the defence of western Europe. Butit did not follow that this principle must, or could, be implementedforthwith. He considered that at the forthcoming meeting of theNorth Atlantic Council we should support the compromise plan put
.   i II 232IIforward by the Council of Deputies and ;the Military Committee.But, if that plan were then accepted, the next step would be to con-sider how it could best be presented to the Germans. He himselfthought that it would be better to take time to persuade the germans to offer to participate under that scheme, rather than seek to impose the plan upon them. He therefore favoured the tactical approachsuggested by the Foreign Secretary.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in agreement with theForeign Secretary&apos;s views. The following were the main points madein the discussion: -id) The United Kingdom Government should stand firm on theprinciple of German participation in the defence of western Europe.The Cabinet recognised that an effective German contribution was essential to the successful defence of western Europe.(b) At the same time it was important to avoid offering any.unnecessary provocation to the Russians, who were genuinely appre-hensive about the resurgence of German militarism.  The form and timing of German rearmament must therefore be considered very carefully and any precipitate action must be avoided. ,(c) Public opinion in western Germany must also be broughtround to accept the idea of German rearmament. From Annex b of CP. (50) 311 it appeared that there was at present strong oppositionto this in the trade unions and in the Social Democratic Party; and appropriate steps should be taken to secure a change of opinion inthose quarters.   Time would be needed for this,id) There would be difficulty at present in finding military equip-ment for German forces. The other European Powers should havethe first claim on such equipment as was available.(e) All possible measures should be taken to increase the military strength of France. The Cabinet were informed that some progress was being made. The main obstacles were French commitments in indo-China, where more than half of the French regular army were engaged; and the short period of compulsory military service, which made it difficult to build up a sufficient cadre of non-commissioned officers.Further efforts might also, be made to allay French apprehensions of German militarism. Could not the French be persuaded that theNorth Atlantic Treaty guaranteed their defence against any aggressor,whether German or Russian? That assurance had been accepted bythe other European Powers.(/) There was some reason to believe that the approach suggestedby the Foreign Secretary might be welcomed by the military advisersof the United States Government, who appeared reluctant to take any step which would give the impression of soliciting German helpin the defence of Europe.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their acceptance of the principle that germany should be enabled to contribute to the defence of western europe; and authorised the Foreign Secretary to accept,at the forthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Councilin Brussels, the plan for applying that principle which hadbeen evolved by the Council of Deputies and the military committee.(2) Approved the suggestions made by the Foreign Secretary inthe discussion regarding the tactics for putting that planinto operation by stages, adjusted to the progress madein building up an integrated force for the defence of western Europe under an American Supreme Commander.(S) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth Governmentsof the attitude which the United Kingdom Governmentwere proposing to adopt towards this question at theforthcoming meeting of the North Atlantic Council.
Egypfc 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignAnglo-Egyptian Secretary (CP. (50) 310) proposing that detailed studies should beTreaty. made of the military and political aspects of a proposal, which he had0?previous        adumbrated in his talks with the Egyptian Foreign Minister, that the reference:      military base in the Canal Zone should remain British-owned butCM. (50) 84th   should be maintained by the Egyptians on the understanding that, in conclusions.    the event of war, the Egyptian Government would provide fullMinute 6.)       facilities throughout Egypt for the Forces of the United Kingdomand her Allies.  The Foreign Secretary also proposed that he shouldbe authorised to inform the Egyptian Foreign Minister that theUnited Kingdom Government were studying this method of approach to the problem, in order to see whether it satisfied essential defenceneeds.The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed this proposal with the Egyptian Foreign &quot;Minister on a purely personal and tentativebasis, but he had not given him any indication when the process of transfer might be completed. It would be a condition of any alliancewhich took the place of the 1936 Treaty that not only the Forces ofthe United Kingdom, but also those of her Allies, should have fuilfacilities throughout Egypt in the event of war. These proposals would have to be examined by the Chiefs of Staff. They might involve some short-term military disadvantages, but it was in his viewimportant for the security of the Middle East to reach an agreementwith the Egyptian Government and to bring to an end the presentimpasse. There was a population of 25 million in Egypt and theSudan, and with the assistance of the water power in Uganda it shouldbe possible, if the friendly co-operation of these peoples was secured,to develop industrieis in the Nile Valley which would raise the standardof living in peace and provide a valuable industrial potential for war.The Egyptian Government would probably be prepared to agree tothe continued presence in Egypt of a number of British technicians,including some Service men in uniform, and for periodical inspection of the base by British experts. He was anxious that the Chiefs ofStaff should examine his tentative proposals constructively andsympathetically, and that meanwhile he might be allowed to informthe Egyptian Foreign Minister that the matter was under examination.He had sounded the Egyptian Foreign Minister on the questionwhether Egypt would be prepared to join in a more comprehensivedefensive alliance, including Israel. The Foreign Minister had saidthat this was out of the question at the present time; but he had indicated that Egypt would make no protest against bilateral discussions on defence between the United Kingdom and Israel. Inthe present international situation and in view of her economic diffi-culties, Israel was likely to be willing to discuss defence and other outstanding questions with the United Kingdom Government, thoughit could not yet be said confidently that she would be ready to give facilities for combat troops transferred from Egypt.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was concerned about the possible financial implications of these proposals. The base at Tel-el-Kebir was said to have cost over  200 million, and theconstruction of an alternative base in Israel or in Cyrenaica might cost a very large sum. He hoped, therefore, that nothing would besaid at this stage which would lead the Egyptian Government or public to believe that, if sufficiently pressed, the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to leave the Canal Zone and construct a costly base elsewhere.The First Sea Lord said that the Chiefs of Staff would undertake a detailed scrutiny of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal. For thispurpose they would wish to arrange for the Commander-in-Chief,Middle East Land Forces, and the Air Officer Commanding-in-Chief,Middle East, to come to London for consultations.The Cabinet agreed that this examination of the foreign secretary&apos;s proposal should be undertaken at once.
Some anxiety was, however, expressed about the risks involvedin giving any further indication; jto the Egyptian Foreign fVfihistef thatthe United Kingdom Government were seriously considering a solu-tion on these lines. Some Ministers felt that in the present Jtoliticalatmosphere hi Cairo the Egyptian Foreign Minister^ if informed toodefinitely that the United Kingdom Government were considering thisproposal^ might make a public statement to that effect in Cairo and,by raising Egyptian expectations, make it more difficult to secure asatisfactory settlement. It was also important that other Common-wealth Governments who had a direct interest in Middle East defence should not receive a distorted Version of the course of the conversa-tions through press leakages in Cairo.The Prime Minister said that the Foreign Secretary could meet this point, in his next conversation with the Egyptian Foreign Minister,by using a form of words which avoided, ori the one hand, a brusqueadjournment of the talks without explanation and, on the other hand,the creation of extravagant expectations in Egypt. It would be enough to say to the Egyptian Foreign Minister that the two ministers had had interesting talks in which a number of ideas had beenventilated, that these would now have to be further explored, and thatthe conversations could be resumed early in the new year.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the necessarystudies to be undertaken without delay into the military,political and financial aspects of the proposed settlement with Egypt outlined in the Annex to CP, (50) 310, with aview tP an early report to the Cabinet.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to inform the egyptian foreing Minister, on the lines proposed by the PrimeMinister, that these discussions would be resumed earlyin new year.Summer-time 6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the home in 1951. Secretary (CP. (50) 309) reporting that the Lord Presidents Com-(Previous mittee had agreed that double summer-time should not be introducedReference: in 1951, and inviting the Cabinet to decide whether single summer-C.M. (48) 1st time should extend from 18th March to 28th October, as proposed by conclusions, the Minister of Fuel and Power, or from 15th April to 21st October,Minute 4.) which the Agriculture Ministers would be prepared to accept as a compromise solution.The Home Secretary said that he had hoped to revert in 1951 tothe statutory position under which single summer-time would have begun on 22nd April and ended on 7th October; but, in response tothe request of the Minister of Fuel and Power, he had felt obliged torecommend to the Lord Presidents Committee that single summer-time should extend froih 18th March to 28th October, which repre-sented an extension of eight weeks over the statutory period. At an earlier stage in the discussions he had understood that the extensionof single summer-time for eight weeks would save 50,000 tons of coal,but latterly the Minister Of Fuel and Power had increased the esti-mated saving to 100,000 tons. In view of the strong opposition ofthe agricultural community to double summer-time, he assumed thatthe Cabinet would not wish tb re-open the decision of the lord presidents Committee that there should be no double summer-timein 1951.The Minister of Agriculture said that he understood that theamount of coal which might be saved by extending Summer-time foreight further weeks, as distinct from three further weeks, would amount to 62,000 tons. This relatively small saving would be securedat the expense Of great hardship to the agricultural community,particularly in the north of England and in Scotland. The Agriculture
Ministers had waived their objection to an extension of the pro-gramme of opencast workings, and they should receive some consideration on the present issue. In his view the Cabinet ought toconsider the reduction of shop lighting before asking for furthersacrifices by the farmers, who were endeavouring to increase agri-cultural production in the national interest.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, at the end of thepresent winter, coal stocks at electricity generating stations and else-where would be at a perilously low level and even a relatively smallsaving might prove of great value. The estimate that an extension ofsummer-time for eight weeks would save 100,000 tons of coal was probably conservative, since it did not take account of economies ingas consumption. If summer-time began on 18th March there mightbe some easement in the peak load of electricity, in addition to the saving in coal.In further discussion attention was drawn to the seriousness ofthe coal situation and to the need for a comprehensive review of allpossible economies in coal consumption.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to submit to theCabinet at an early date comprehensive proposals for fuel economy.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,XAth December, 1950.
