1. The Cabinet considered, on the basis of a memorandum(CP. (50) 229) by the Lord President and the Home Secretary, whetherthe Overseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bill should be intro-duced in the forthcoming session of Parliament.The main arguments for and against introducing this Bill were summarised in paragraph 5 of CP. (50) 229. Discussion showed thatthere was general agreement in the Cabinet that the balance of thearguments lay against introducing the Bill in advance of any occasionjustifying the assumption of these fresh powers. It was agreed thatthe draft Bill should be completed and held in readiness for immediate introduction if any such occasion arose. No further consultations should, however, be held with the Trades Union Congress about theform of the Bill until it was about to be introduced.The Cabinet-(1) Decided that the Overseas Operations (Security of Forces)Bill should not be introduced unless some further occasionarose which justified the assumption of the additional powers which it would confer; and agreed that the Billshould not be mentioned in The King&apos;s Speech on theOpening of the next session of Parliament.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the draft Bill tobe completed and held in readiness for immediate intro-duction if the occasion arose.2. At their meetings on 14th and 18th September the Cabinet had invited the Lord President to consider what further steps could betaken to counter Communist endeavours to cause industrial unrest and, in particular, whether the criminal law could with advantage be strengthened for this purpose. The Cabinet now had before them(i) a memorandum by the Lord President and the Home Secretary(CP. (50) 229) reporting their provisional conclusions on this ques-tion; and (ii) a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 224)suggesting that the weapon of civil proceedings for damages for breach of contract should be used more extensively against personstaking part in unofficial strikes.The Cabinet first discussed the question of introducing fresh legislation on this subject and considered the three alternative possi-bilities described in paragraph 3 of CP. (50) 229. The first of these was that the provisions of the Conspiracy and Protection of PropertyAct, 1875, should be extended to cover all essential employments. Itwas pointed out in discussion that, in defining &quot; essential employ-ments &quot; for this purpose, it would be difficult to decide where to draw the line. Moreover, the Act of 1875 had been based on the fact thatthe workers whom it covered had enjoyed greater security of tenurethan those in other industries: this would not apply in some of theother industries which would now be regarded as essential to the life of the community, and in any event, under conditions of full employ-ment, workers no longer prized security of tenure so highly as to be willing to accept in return for it disabilities from which their fellowsin other industries were free. Finally, this course had the disad-vantage that it would increase the number of criminal proceedings tobe taken against persons taking part in strikes.The second possibility was to enact in permanent form provisions on the lines of the Conditions of Employment and National Arbitra-tion Order. The Attorney^General said that, so long as this order was continued in operation, it would become increasingly difficult for him to evade his responsibility for enforcing it particularly now thathe had invoked it in the recent proceedings against ten men who hadtaken part in the London gas strike. If it was to be kept in operation and enforced, he would prefer that it should have the direct authorityb 2
of Parliament. On the other hand, The Foreign Secretary said that hewas doubtful whether a requirement Of compulsory arbitration for industrial disputes could be maintained much longer under peace-time conditions. In trade union circles in the past the view had alwaysbeen taken that, under normal conditions, the workers would not accept compulsory arbitration; and this system operated effectivelyonly in Communist countries where all strikes were prohibited. he believed, therefore, that some new approach would have to be madeto this problem; and he had been wondering whether this might not take the form of establishing, in place of a single national tribunal,separate arbitration tribunals for the main industries whose decisions would be accepted as final by both sides of the industry. This methodhad worked satisfactorily in the boot trade and in the steel industry,and it might be capable of extension to other industries. The cabinet were informed that, for the moment, both sides of industry seemed tobe willing that the Conditions of Employment and National Arbitra-tion Order should be continued in force, though it was thought thatthe trade unions would wish to see some minor amendments made init. Despite this, there was general agreement in the Cabinet that itwas not too soon for Ministers to give consideration to the long-term development of the existing machinery for wage negotiation in indus-try. It was further agreed that, if that development followed the lineof separate machinery for particular industries, care should be takento ensure that the need for some central guidance on general economicconditions was not overlooked. In this connection it was suggestedthat further thought might be given to the role and functions of thetrade unions in a planned economy under conditions of full employ-ment and, in particular, to the functions of trade unions in nationalised industries.The third possibility discussed in CP. (50) 229 was that it shouldbe made an offence for any person to take part in a strike in anessential service until the members of the trade union or unions con-cerned had all voted in favour of strike action by a secret ballot. in discussion it was pointed out that many unofficial strikes were suddenand spontaneous demonstrations against some minor grievance, andthat such disputes were often composed within a day or so. On such occasions it would usually be impossible to restrain the men fromwithholding their labour until steps had been taken to hold a secretballot; and it would be neither desirable nor practicable to prosecutethem after the event for having gone on strike before a ballot hadbeen held. There would also be practical difficulties in determiningwho should hold the ballot in an unofficial strike, it would be unreasonable to expect the union to do so and in defining the classesof worker in the industry among whom the ballot should be held.There was also the disadvantage that, if the ballot went in favour ofthe strike, the moral position of the strikers would be greatly strengthened. It was the general view of the Cabinet that thisproposal was not practicable.Discussion then turned on the suggestion, made by the Attorney-General in CP. (50) 224, that more recourse might be had to civil proceedings for damages against persons who took part in unofficial strikes. Some Ministers favoured this suggestion, largely on the basisof experience in the mining industry where it was believed that the fear of civil proceedings for breach of contract had in fact operated asa deterrent against unofficial strikes. The first step would be to warn the workers in essential industries, by the distribution of leaflets, thatsuch proceedings would in future be taken against any persons who took part in unofficial strikes in breach of their contracts. On theother side it was argued that civil proceedings were apt to be pro-tracted, and that an unfortunate impression would be created ifdamages were awarded long after the strike had ended. Moreover, itwas pointed out that in Scotland strikers would be entitled to freelegal aid in such proceedings. Doubts were also expressed about the attorney-Generai&apos;s proposal that the practice of instituting civil pro-
ceedings should be made general, in the first instance, in the socialised industries. It was contended that, if this policy were to be adopted,the criterion should be, not whether an industry was socialised or not,but whether it provided an essential service; and it was arguable thatsome of the industries or services still under private ownership (e.g.,food distribution) were more essential to the life of the communitythan some of those which had been brought under public ownership(e.g., steel or even coal).In paragraph 4 of CP. (50) 229 it was suggested that it mightbe desirable for the Government to arrange for a public enquiry tobe held before introducing any legislation amending the law relatingto strikes. In discussion there was general agreement that it wouldbe inexpedient for the Government to introduce any major legislationlimiting the right to strike unless this were based on the findings ofsome form of public enquiry. On the other hand, Ministers felt thatthis was not a suitable time at which to launch a general enquiry onthis subject.The general conclusion reached by the Cabinet was that theGovernment should undertake discussions with the Trades UnionCongress on the two questions (i) what further steps should betaken, whether by strengthening the criminal law or by furtherrecourse to civil proceedings or otherwise, to counter Communistendeavours to cause industrial unrest; and (ii) how the existing machinery for the negotiation of wages settlements in industry could best be developed, on a long-term basis, to meet the needs of a plannedeconomy under conditions of full employment. On the first of these problems the Government must be in a position to make some state-ment in the course of the Debate on the Address in the early weeks of the new session of Parliament. The second question, thoughequally important, was less urgent. The Cabinet considered, however,that no approach should be made to the Trades Union Congress on either of these questions until the Government were in a position toput forward specific proposals for discussion; and for this purpose itwould be convenient if a small Committee of Ministers, assisted by a group of official advisers, could be convened to formulate such pro-posals for consideration by the Cabinet.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to arrange for a Committee ofMinisters, assisted by a group of official advisers, to formu-late for consideration by the Cabinet specific proposals for(i) countering Communist endeavours to promote industrial unrest, particularly by means of unofficial strikes; and (ii)adjusting, in the light of current conditions, the existing machinery for the negotiation of wages settlements in industry.Parliament.Disqualificationof a Member.(previous reference:CM. (50) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president and the Attorney-General (CP. (50) 225) on the action tobe taken following a report from the Judicial Committee of the privy council that, in their view, Mr. J. G. MacManaway was not eligible to sit as a Member of the House of Commons because he was an ordained clergyman of the Church of Ireland.The Lord President said that an Order-in-Council had been madedirecting that the Home Secretary should communicate the report ofthe Judicial Committee to the House of Commons. He proposed thatthe House should then be invited to declare that the seat was vacant.It would be necessary to introduce a Bill of Indemnity: the magnani-mous course would be to give Mr. MacManaway a completeindemnity for the penalties he had incurred, both in the imperial parliament and in the Parliament of Northern Ireland.
In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) Need any oral statement be made on behalf of the Govern-ment? The advice Of the Judicial Committee could be formallypresented and circulated shortly thereafter. The general view was,however, that the House of Commons should be told at the earliest practicable moment of the effect of the advice; and it was agreed thata statement should be made after Questions on the following day.(b) The Home Secretary said that, while he would on this oeca-sion communicate the effect of the Judicial Committee&apos;s advice inaccordance with the Order-in-Council, he thought it would have been more proper for the Lord President to do so. It was true that on a previous occasion the Home Secretary had reported the advice to theHouse of Commons; but at that time the Lord President had been amember of the House of Lords.(c) The Bill of Indemnity could not cover Mr. MacManaway&apos;s membership of the Northern Ireland Parliament unless that Parlia-ment accepted the advice of the Judicial Committee. This point would have to be discussed at an early date with the Northern ireland government.(d) If the common informer who had initiated an action against mr.. MacManaway had not discontinued his suit, his position wouldhave to be taken into account in the drafting of the Bill of Indemnity.(e) There was general agreement that it was undesirable at this juncture to introduce legislation on the general question of member-ship of the House of Commons by ordained clergymen.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (50) 225.Parliament.legislative programme for 1950-51Session.CPreviousReference:CM. (50) 30thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (50) 228) covering a legislative programme for the1950-51 Session, which had been prepared by the Future legislation committee.The Lord President said that it had been difficult to draw up asatisfactory programme because of the number of Bills on whichfinal authority to proceed had not yet been given, or policy approvalhad not been secured. The time available for legislation would makeit impracticable to proceed with all the Bills which had beensuggested.The Prime Minister said that Departments were too often dis-posed to delay the framing of legislation until late in the parliamentary session. Bills were often lost because they had not been ready in theearlier part of the Session, when more time was available for legisla-tion. He urged Ministers to ensure that policy decisions were securedand drafting undertaken at an earlier stage, so that the legislative programme could be planned with greater effectiveness.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The question whether the Economic Planning and full employment Bill, the Leasehold Property (Temporary Provisions)Bill and the British Sugar Corporation Bill should be included in theprogramme depended on decisions which the Cabinet would take atforthcoming meetings.(b) The principal measures which would result from the work ofthe Distribution and Marketing Committee could not with advantage be introduced in the coming Session, though one or two small Billsdealing with distribution might be suggested at a latter stage.(c) The decision not to proceed with the Law of Defamation Billin the coming Session should be attributed, in any public discussion,to the volume of more urgent legislation which had to be undertaken,and not to the failure of the newspaper proprietors to set up a PressCouncil.
(d) The Treasury would wish to introduce a Public Works loans bill, to be brought into effect before the end of the year.(e) The Cabinet would have an early opportunity of considering whether Private Members&apos; time should be allowed in the forthcoming session.The Cabinet Approved the legislative programme outlined in CP. (50)228, subject to the points made in the Cabinefs discussion.IheKiiijfsSpeeches on theProrogationand Openingof Parliament.(previous reference:CM. (50) 6thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Lord Presi-dent (CP. (50) 226 and 227) covering drafts, prepared by The King&apos;speeches Committee, for The King&apos;s Speeches on the Prorogation and opening of Parliament.In discussion various drafting amendments on both Speecheswere suggested and approved, and the following points of substancewere made:  (a) The Prorogation Speech should contain a reference to thepassing of the Medical Act. *(b) There should be references in the Opening Speech to the intentions of the Government with regard to the export trade, housing and the rising cost of living.(c) The Opening Speech should not refer to the amendment ofthe Food and Drugs act or to the Judges Pensions Bill.The Cabinet Subject to amendment on the points noted in paragraphs (a)to (c) above, approved the draft Speeches annexed to cp. (50) 226 and 227.Foreign 6.  The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the ForeignAffairs. Secretary (CP. (50) 220 and 221) reporting the results of his recentMeetings in discussions in New York.New York in The first of these (CP. (50) 220) was a general report on the september discussions between the Foreign Ministers of the United Kingdom,1950. the United States and France, on the meeting of the North atlantic council and on the opening stages of the Fifth Session of the general assembly of the United Nations.The second memorandum (CP. (50) 221) was a report on develop-ments in Far Eastern policy which had taken place in the course ofthese discussions in New York.The Cabinet expressed their appreciation of these valuablereports, and congratulated the Foreign &quot;Secretary and his staff on the substantial diplomatic gains which had been achieved in the courseof these conversations.The Cabinet Took note of the reports submitted in CP. (50) 220 and 221&quot;.United 7.  The Foreign Secretary said that in the current discusions inNations: the General Assembly of the United Nations the United StatesAbuse of Government were making satisfactory progress with their proposalVeto. for countering the Soviet use of the veto in the Security Council by(Previous conferring power on the General Assembly to deal with acts of aggres-Reference: sion or breaches of the peace.   The Iraqi Delegation had now,CM. (50) 55th however, produced a resolution urging an early meeting of the fourConclusions, Great Powers, and were putting this forward as an alternative to the minute 5.) United States resolution.  The Foreign Secretary said that he was
most anxious that this new resolution should not distract attention from the United States proposals; for nothing would be gained by holding a meeting of the four Powers if, at the end of it, the SovietGovernment were able to Continue to abuse their power of veto inthe Security Council. He therefore wished our representatives totake the line that the two proposals were not in fact alternatives; butthey were more likely to be successful in this if they were not requiredto offer strong resistance to the resolution proposed by the IraqiDelegation. He therefore proposed that they should say that theUnited Kingdom Government were not opposed to a further meetingof the Council of Foreign Ministers and would, indeed, be ready tobe represented at such a meeting if it were proposed by one of theother three Powers and if there was a definite agenda for the meeting.He thought there might in fact be some advantage in holding such ameeting if the other three Governments were prepared to take theinitiative in asking the Soviet Government to explain their policy and intentions in the various parts of the world where there seemed to bea threat of Communist intervention.The Cabinet Endorsed the line which the Foreign Secretary was proposing to instruct the Minister of State to take in relation to theproposal, sponsored by the Iraqi Delegation to the united nations, for a further meeting of the Council of foreign ministers.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th October, 1950.
