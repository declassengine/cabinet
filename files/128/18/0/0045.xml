Mr. PeterFraser.Parliament.Death ofMr. oliver stanley, M.P.1. The Cabinet received with regret the news that Mr. PeterFraser, formerly Primje Minister of New Zealand, had died on theprevious day. They invited the Prime Minister to send on their behalfa message of condolence to the New Zealand Government.2. The Cabinet were informed that it had been suggested by the leader of the Conservative Opposition that an opportunity should beprovided for leaders of the three political Parties to pay tribute to thememory of Mr. Oliver Stanley, M.P., who had died on the previous day.In discussion it was suggested that this would be contrary to recent practice, which had tended to limit this mark of respect toformer Prime Ministers or leaders of Parties and to Ministers dyingwhile in office. On the other hand, it was suggested that there wereearlier precedents which would justify a somewhat less restricted view.The Cabinet invited the Prime Minister to settle, in consultationwith the Lord President, what attitude the Government should adopt towards this suggestion by the leader of the Opposition.primeministers visit to washington.(Previous  - -Reference:CM. (50) 80thConclusions.)3. The Cabinet welcomed the Prime Minister on his return fromhis mission to Washington and Ottawa.The Prime Minister said that his talks with President Trumanand his advisers had been conducted in an atmosphere of franknessarid candour. When the talks opened, the military situation in Koreahad seemed very critical, but before he left Washington there seemedto be a reasonable prospect that the United Nations Forces would beable to establish and hold a line to the south of the &apos;38th Parallel.The United States Government fully recognised the importance ofbuilding up military strength in the West, and the dangers of becomingtoo deeply involved in the Far East. At the same time they tended to believe that Chinese policy was dictated by Russia, and they had-been considering the idea of a limited war against China by way ofan economic blockade and stirring up internal trouble in China. He(the Prime Minister) had stressed the need to avoid major war with china and had indicated that the broad choice was between a settle-ment of the Korean problem or a general drift to world war. He had pointed out that China would not be seriously affected by any economic blockade and could seriously hamper Western interests byfomenting disorder in Indo-China, Malaya and Hong Kong. He had explained that the United Kingdom Government were not convincedthat the People&apos;s Government of China was a puppet of Moscow and thought that, if China were nbt forced into closer alliance with Russia,her deep ^rooted xenophobia and consciousness of her ancient civilisation-sation would make her reluctant to accept Russian domination.Before the end of the talks the Presidents advisers had developeddoubts about the value of a limited war against China; and he and thePresident had agreed that the primary aim should be to secure a ceasefire in Korea. They had also agreed that the cease fire should not behedged around by conditions which would require long and tediousnegotiations. This was in accord with United States fears-that thequestion of Formosa would be linked with any negotiations abouthostilities in Korea.The Prime Minister had discussed with the President the conductof the military operations in Korea. Some of General MacArthur&apos;public pronouncements had been unfortunate; but he was an ablecommander and had conducted the earlier operations in Korea withmarked success. In the later stages intelligence! about the Chinesemovements had evidently been inadequate; but it must be recognisedthat the terrain in North Korea made it possible to conceal the move-ment of large forces of Chinese infantry, which travelled light and
were skilled iii infiltration tactics. The Prime Minister had drawn attention to the need for1 distinguishing between politico-militarydecisions, in which United Nations Government should be consulted,and the purely military questions which could be left to the com-mander in the field; and he had given the President a memorandumsuggestmg improvements in the existing arrangements for liaison.There had been general agreement in the talks that the future of formosa was not an immediate issue. The United States Chiefs ofStaff attached strategic importance to Formosa: they had pointedout that the attack on the Philippines had been launched from there.On the other hand, the Chinese People&apos;s Government were concerned at the threat to their security which was presented by the concentration of Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s forces in Formosa. The Prime Minister had suggested that the United States Government might consider a corn-promise solution under which Formosa would, for a number of years,be neutralised under nominal Chinese sovereignty.As indicated in the communique issued after the washington talks, it had not proved possible to reach agreement about the recognition of the Chinese Pebple&apos;s Government and Chinese repre-sentation in the United Nations.President Truman had entirely satisfied him about the use of the atomic bomb. The President, at his press conference on 30thNovember, had not intended to make any fresh pronouncement onthe subject ancThad never had any intention of using the atom bombin Korea. He had assured the Prime Minister that he regarded the atomic bomb as hi a sense a joint possession of the United States,United Kingdom and Canada, and that he would not authorise its use without prior consultation with the other two Governments save in an extreme emergency^ such as an atomic attack on the UnitedStates which called for immediate retaliation.The United States Government were in full agreement about the paramount importance of the defence of Europe. They had welcomed the compromise plan evolved by the Council of Deputiesfor enabling Western Germany to contribute military forces for thedefence of Western Europe. The Prime Minister had felt that he hadno alternative^ but to support that plan, as a means of securing theearly appointment of a Supreme Commander of the Europeanintegrated force, to which he and his Cabinet colleagues attached suchgreat importance. Some of the United States forces which had been intended for the West would now be required in the Far East, but other divisions in substitution for these, though not fully trained,would be sent to Europe in the course of 1951.The President and his advisers had been very forthcoming on thequestion of ensuring that raw materials were made available for essen-tial needs outside the United States. It was proposed to set up asteering committee representing the United Kingdom, the UnitedStates and France, which would have an initiating and co-ordinatingresponsibility over the whole field of raw materials. Some of the other commonwealth countries might feel that they should have a seat onthis committee; but, if its membership were extended beyond these three, it would be difficult to know when to draw the line. They andthe other interested countries would have an opportunity to play their part on the commodity boards which would be established to handleparticular materials. He had been glad to find in Ottawa that thisarrangement was acceptable to the Canadian Government.The United States Government had asked that the UnitedKingdom Government should increase their defence effort. He had explained the military burdens which had fallen on this country sincethe end of the war and the difficulty of imposing further defence expenditure on the national economy. He had, however, undertaken to consider this request further; and it must be assumed that theUnited States Government would return to the subject at a later stage.Both at Washington and during his visit to the United nations assembly in New York he had kept the representatives of other commonwealth Governments in touch with the course of his con-
versations. In New York lie had also been able to discuss with theUnited Kingdom representatives, the latest developments in the united nations discussions oh Korea.In Ottawa he had met the Canadian Cabinet and had explained to them the course of his conversations at Washington. He had foundthat the Canadian Government were inclose agreement with the viewsof the United Kingdom Government-&apos;on the present international situation, and he had been impressed with the friendly atmosphere inCanada and the desire of Canadian Ministers to work closely with theUnited Kingdom Government.The Cabinet thanked the Prime Minister for his report, andcongratulated Mm on the success of his mission:The Cabinet then considered whether the Prime Minister should that afternbbn make a preliminary report to the House of Commonsbh his^inissibh to Washington, or whether he should make a fullerstatement on the following day. Asthe House Of Commons was inany event to hold a full debate on the international situation on14th December, the balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favourof the Prime Ministers makihg a relatively short statement that afternoon, immediately upon his return from Washington. It was,however!, agreedthat this; statement could be somewhat longer thanthe draft which had been circulated with CP. (50) 308; and various suggestions were made for expanding and modifying that draft.The Cabinet agreed that in the debate in the House of commons on 14th December the Government spokesmen should be the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary. &apos;   &apos;-    The Cabinet- y-(.1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ report on his mission toWashingtoh.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to make a preliminary statementoh his mission in the House of Commons that afternoon;and agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should simultaneouslymake a corresponding statement in the&quot;House of Lords.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th December, 1950.
