London port-workers defence committee had recently returned fromi a Warsaw conference convened by the Polish dockers&apos; union, andr they doubtless had been given a plan of campaign.   In Liverpool adock strike committee had been formed which might provoke a strike/in the Liverpool docks on the following day. Unofficial port-workers&apos;b\ committees had been formed in Manchester and Hull.  The aim at-  all the ports was to put forward claims on behalf of the dockers forincreased wages, a shorter working week and pensions schemes.Information had been received which suggested that an attempt mightbe made to interfere with the sailing of two ships which were loaded. . with goods for Korea.   An article in a publication of the Czecho-slovak Ministry of Foreign Trade, signed by an official in the PolishMinistry of Transport, stated openly that it was hoped to capture for. Gdynia the trans-shipment trade now done in London and other european ports. He suggested that early discussions should be held. with the General Council of the Trades Union Congress on the steps which could be taken to Counter this Communist campaign. TheGeneral Secretary of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union was pressing for action to be taken against the Communist Party.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Communists had evidently embarked upon a campaign of political warfare, which they would intensify as the Government^defence programme got Under Way. Hitherto they had tried to obtainrepresentation in Parliament and to secure control of the trade&quot; unions: they had now abandoned parliamentary action and wereconcentrating oil fomenting industrial troubles. They would doubt-less continue the efforts to capture control of the key unions.&apos; !(b) The criminal&apos;law could riot be invoked effectively against these efforts to cause industrial strife. The promotion of a series of strikes was not in itself an offence; and, when it came to proof ofseditious intention in any charge of conspiracy, it would be difficultto establish that an accused person had not been moved by a desireto improve the conditions of the workers who were being asked to strike. The Cabinet would shortly be considering the draft of anOverseas Operations (Security of Forces) Bin (CP. (50) 206), but themischief at which this Bill aimed was narrower than a Communistattempt to oSisrupt the economic life of the country, and some ministers felt doubtful whether criminal proceedings againstindividuals could play an effective part in dealing with the Communistthreat.(c) There was general agreement that there should be an early meeting of Ministers with the General Council of the Trades UnionCongress to plan the measures required to prevent the CommunistParty from securing leadership in the trade unions. The fact thatthere were now no Communists on the General Council would facilitate these discussions. The great mass of trade unionists didnot wish to give any support to Communist manoeuvres and wouldrespond to a lead, if the facts were placed before them. This matter could not be effectively&apos; handled centrally, and full use should be made- of the regional councils of the Labour Party.y id) The Minister of Labour had to answer that afternoon aPrivate Notice Question relating to the London bus strike. His replyto this could be restricted to the circumstances of that strike. Heshould, however, make a fuller statement in the House of commons on the following day on the evidence of a Communist conspiracy topromote industrial stoppages.
(e) The Government should also make a direct appeal to workersgenerally, through the medium of a broadcast. This should give anyreliable evidence of foreign intervention in the industrial affairs of thiscountry, since the workers would.not tolerate any suggestion that theywere to be used for furthering international Communist policies.Charges of foreign intervention should not, however, be made unless they could be fully substantiated. It might also be desirable to referby name to individual Communists in this country who wereprominent in fomenting industrial strife for political purposes; but here again no statement or allegation should be made which couldnot be fully substantiated. Disputes in which the Communists tookadvantage of genuine industrial unrest should not be treated asCommunist-inspired. After discussion the Cabinet agreed that thisbroadcast should be made by the Minister of Labour, and not givenout in the form of a Government statement read by a B.B.C.announcer. While the statement would have to be carefully preparedif it were to carry weight, it was desirable that it should be made assoon as possible, since the exposure of Communist manoeuvres wouldbe more effective in preventing men from coming out on strike thanin securing their return to work after they had gone on strike. Onthe assumption that the Liverpool dockers were not likely to strikebefore Monday, notwithstanding reports of a Friday stoppage, the broadcast could be made during the week-end, possibly on Sunday.(f) A small group of Ministers should review the action requiredto counter this Communist campaign.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Labour to make a general statement in the House of Commons on 15th September on Com-muriist intrigues to promote industrial stoppages and tofollow this up by a broadcast to the; workers of thecountry on 16th or 17th September.(2) Invited the Lord President, .in consultation with the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Labour, to consider, in thelight of the Cabinets discussion, what further steps couldbe taken to counter Communist endeavours to cause in-dustrial unrest.Iron andSteel Act.(previous reference:CM. (50) 56thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet considered whether in present circumstances theMinister of Supply should defer, until after the reassembly ofParliament on 17th October, the announcement of his intention toset up the Iron and Steel Corporation and to implement the other provisions of the Iron and Steel Act.The Leader of the Opposition was to ask the Prime Minister that afternoon, by Private Notice, whether he would give an assurance that the nationalisation of this industry would be postponed until thepresent international crisis had passed and the electorate had had afurther opportunity to express an opinion on this question. Therewas reason to believe that, if the Government now reaffirmed their intention to proceed with the Act, the Opposition would at once pro-ceed to table motions of censure in both Houses of Parliament andto press for these to be debated during the present sittings.After discussion the Cabinet reaffirmed their decision of6th September that Parliament should be informed that afternoon ofthe steps which were being taken to implement the provisions of theIron and Steel Act. They further agreed that, if the Opposition tableda vote of censure, the Government spokesmen in the debate in theHouse of Commons should be the Minister of Supply and the lord president.
3. The Prime Minister drew the Cabinefs attention to two tele-grams from the Foreign Secretary (New York telegrams Nos. 996 and998 of 13th September) reporting that the question of German partici-pation in western defence had been raised in his discussions with theUnited States Secretary of State and the French Foreign Minister.Mr. Acheson had stated that the American offer to station UnitedStates troops in Europe was dependent on the assembly of a sufficientforce to make the whole enterprise successful and that, in the UnitedStates view, this could not be achieved without some German partici-pation in the defence of Europe. He had therefore invited theForeign Secretary to agree in principle to envisage the incorporation of German units in a, western force under unified command, though he recognised that details would have to be discussed later and thatin the meantime publicity should be avoided. The Foreign secretary was disposed to express general concurrence in this proposal.The Cabinet agreed that in the current defence debate in theHouse of Commons Government spokesmen should leave open thequestion of German participation in western defence. In the trypartite discussions in New York, the Cabinet considered that the foreign secretary should continue to explore the subject with the american and French Foreign Ministers, but should not at this stage agree inprinciple to any form of German rearmament which went beyondthe measures decribed in the Cabinefs discussion on 6th Septemberlast. It was not yet known what attitude the French Foreign minister was taking towards the United States proposal and it was by nomeans clear that general German support would be forthcoming forthe formation of military units other than a gendarmerie of limitedsize. It was doubtful whether any decision in principle to agree tothe creation of a German army could be kept secret, even if the de-cision related to a period some considerable time ahead; and it was important to keep in mind possible Russian reactions to proposalsfor German rearmament, at a time when western defence was still very weak.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to inform the Foreign Secretaryof the views of the Cabinet on the United States proposal for german rearmament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\4th September, 1950.
