Wages Policy. 1.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Chancellor of the(Previous       Exchequer (CP. (50) 151) on wages policy. Appended to this was a reference:      copy of a document issued by the Trades Union Congress to theirCM. (50) 24th  affiliated unions on 28th June, in which, after reviewing recentConclusions.    developments in the country&apos;s economic situation, they recognisedMinute 3.)      that there must now be some greater flexibility in wage movementsthan had been envisaged in their earlier statement of the previousJanuary. The Chancellor of the Exchequer thought it desirable that,he should offer some public comment on this document, and a draftof the statement which he proposed to make in the House of Com-mons was also appended to CP. (50) 151.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Secretary of the Trades Union Congress had seen and approved the terms of the statement which the Chancellor of theExchequer proposed to make, and he was anxious that nothing morethan this should be said until after the annual conference of theCongress in September.(h) It was suggested that the statement might give the impres-sion that the Government had abandoned the possibility of using awages policy as an instrument in economic planning. Wage-fixingtribunals, in particular, might interpret the statement as meaningthat the Government had no guidance to offer them and no longerexpected them to have regard to general economic conditions whendealing with the particular applications which came before them.In reply The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he did not intend to modify, by this statement, the principles laid down in 1948in the original White Paper on Personal Incomes, Costs and Prices(Cmd. 7321), but only to relax the more rigid application of those principles for which he had called after the devaluation of sterling inthe autumn of 1949. It was agreed that, in order to make this clear,the wording of the final paragraph of the statement should be amended so as to invite those concerned with the fixing or negotiation of personal incomes to bear in mind the principles laid down in theoriginal White Paper.(,c) It was also agreed that words should be added, at the endof the draft statement, to make it clear that the abandonment of theexisting policy of restraint in relation to wage claims would in theend undermine the standards of living which the workers hadattained.(4) It was suggested that the statement might also refer to thefact that in some industries average earnings had increased, eventhough wage rates had not risen. This suggestion was, however,rejected as being likely to provoke applications for increased pay inoccupations remunerated by salary or by flat-rate wages.(e) It was hoped that discussions on wages policy would be resumed with the Trades Union Congress after their annual confer-ence in September. For this purpose it would be helpful if the Minis-ter of Labour would submit to the Cabinet a summary of theinformation available about the systems in operation in certainScandinavian countries and elsewhere by which some measure of central control was established over the fixing of wage-levels in thevarious industries.The Cabinet  , ,    ,(1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make in theHouse of Commons a statement on wages policy in theterms of the draft annexed to CP. (50) 151, subject to amendment on the points noted in paragraphs (b) and (c)above. \(2) Invited the Minister of Labour to incorporate, in the paper on wages policy which the Cabinet had asked him on24th April to submit to them in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, a summary of the informa-tion available regarding the systems in operation incertain foreign countries by which some measuij of central control was established over the fixing of wage-levels in the various industries.
White fish industry.(previous reference:CM. (50) 39thConclusions,Minute 2.) j2.  The Cabinet had before them (i) a memorandum by the Minister of Agriculture and fisheries and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (50) 146)indicating that, in their view, the only short-termmeasure which would bring relief to the white fish indus-try was an Exchequer subsidy to the inshore fishermenand the owners of near- and middle-water trawlers; and(ii) a memorandum by the Minister of Food (CP. (50) 147)summarising the measures which were being taken toincrease the consumption of fish and stating that, after examining the position in consultation with the ministers concerned with public services, he had reached the con-clusion that there was little more that his Departmentcould do to increase consumption.- r- The Cabinet agreed that, in the statement which he was to makein the House of Commons on the following day, the Prime minister should announce the Government&apos;s intention to introduce legislation in the following Session for the establishment of a White Fish industry board which would re-organise and regulate the industry, and shouldalso indicate that the Government proposed to initiate discussion inthe Organisation for European Economic Co-operation with a viewto securing a uniform policy regarding excessive landings of coarsefish and over-fishing generally.As regards the possibility of increasing the consumption of fish,Ministers recognised that it was inevitable that, with the variety ofother foods now available, there should be some reduction from thehigh level of consumption reached in the war years. They felt, how-ever, that more might still be done to increase consumption, particu-larly if the price of fish could be made to compare more favourably with that of meat and canned foods. They were informed that theBritish Trawlers&apos; Federation were working on plans for an extensivepublicity campaign. It was suggested that, if fat for fish frying couldbe released from control, there would be a greater incentive to enter the fish-frying business, where new entrants were somewhat ham-hampered by the size of their fat allocation. It was also felt that more could be done to increase the consumption of fish in the Services,and it was noted that the question of increasing the consumption offish in hospitals, schools and Government hostels was under urgent consideration. The Cabinet agreed that the Prime Minister should refer, in his statement, to the measures which were being taken toincrease the consumption of fish, since increased sales were necessary if the existing unemployment in the fishing industry was to be reduced.The Cabinet then considered whether the representations whichwere now being made on behalf of the fishing industry could beregarded as adequately met by the setting up of a White Fish industry board, and the adoption of measures designed to increase the con-sumption of fish and to regulate the landing of foreign catches, orwhether an Exchequer subsidy should also be given as a short-termmeasure to ease the difficulties of the industry until such time as theselong-term plans began to show their results.The proposal of the Fisheries Ministers was that a subsidy shouldbe given to vessels under 140 ft. in length, being those engagedinshore and in the near- and middle-waters. The terms on which thesubsidy would be paid were set out in Annex B of PC (50) 64; andthe scheme was in effect an insurance arrangement under which lesssubsidy would be paid if the gross proceeds of voyages rose by reasonof increased sales or increased prices. The- subsidy was estimated to cost  3^ millions a year, and Ministers accepted a stipulation of theChancellor of the Exchequer that this should be off-set by a corres-ponding reduction (either generally or in respect of particular articlesof food) in the food subsidies administered by the Minister of Food.The subsidy would in effect buy time until the proposed White fish industry Board had produced its plans for the re-organisation of the39001-1 &quot; b 2
industry; and, in order to emphasise its temporary character, thesubsidy could be granted in the first instance for not longer than sixmonths. Although it was not likely to have the result of increasingthe number of trawlers now at work (and indeed that would be undesirable if it increased the supply of fish at unreinunerativeprices) the subsidy should prevent a further serious fall in employ-men t, since many trawlers were at present operating at a loss pendingan announcement of the measures which the Government proposedto take. The subsidy would go to the trawler-owners, since the fisher-men still at work were receiving good pay and the losses were falling on the owners. It would give the Government a useful lever forsecuring the re-organisation of the industry, and some trawler-owners were opposed to Exchequer assistance on that very ground. All theother measures proposed by the Fisheries Ministers would take sometime to operate, and only by means of a temporary subsidy coulda further collapse be prevented in an industry which was important to the country in peace and in war. If the subsidy were linked withthe food subsidies, it need not become a precedent for Exchequerassistance to other distressed industries, e.g., shipbuilding.Against the grant of a subsidy it was argued that it was inevit-able that the white fish industry should contract from the high levelof activity which it had reached during and after the war, and thatit was undesirable to mask the true state of affairs from, those engagedin the industry. Not only were people unwilling to eat as much fishas they had during the war: the high cost of building and maintain-ing. trawlers was bound to- increase the price of fish and this was afurther cause of reduced consumption. The Fisheries Ministers didnot contemplate that very strict conditions should be attached tothe grant of the subsidy: unlike other subsidiesv it would not be condi-tional upon the attainment of production targets and greater efficiency. A subsidy to the trawler-owners would do nothing toimprove fish distribution, which was costly, wasteful and badly in need of re-organisation: in fact, there was a risk that some of thesubsidy would find its way to the distributors and increase stillfurther the profits which they were making. It seemed very doubtfulwhether the subsidy, once granted, would prove to be a temporary measure; for the White Fish Industry Board would be faced withthe same problem as the Cabinet and would press for continuedExchequer assistance to the industry. It might be found that the bestlong-term solution would be for the State to own trawlers and to rentthem to fishermen; and it should be recognised that the payment ofa subsidy to the trawler-owners would increase the value of their boats and raise against the State the price that might have to be paid incompensation. While the present rate of unemployment (over 8,000)was admittedly high,, some of it was seasonal in character: thus, thenumber of unemployed had fallen from 5,130 in May 1949 to 1,910in August 1949: Investigation might show that many of thoseclassified as unemployed fishermen bad never expected more thanpart-time work in the industry. Similarly, the number of boats laidup might not be a reliable guide to the present situation, since boats were laid up in relays at this time of year for painting and repairs.As the subsidy was to be paid only to the inshore fishermen and tothe near- and middle-water trawler-owners, it might be argued thatthe Government were subsidising the better quality fish consumed bythe higher income-groups; and, if unemployment continued amongdistant-water fishermen, the Government would be exposed to con-tinued pressure for further measures of alleviation. jThe Cabinet (1) Agreed that a subsidy on the lines indicated in Annex B ofP.C. (50) 64 should be paid in respect of fishing vesselsunder 140 ft. in length, for a period of six months inthe first instance, and that the cost should be found bya reduction in food subsidies.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theMinister of Food how the cost of this subsidy (estimatedat  3^ millions a year) should be found by reduction ofexisting food subsidies.(3) Invited the Minister of Food, in consultation with theMinister of Defence and other Ministers concerned, toconsider further the measures which might be taken toincrease the consumption of white fish, particularly in theServices.(4) Agreed that the Prime Minister, in answer to parliamentary questions on the following day, should announce theGovernment^ decision to introduce legislation to estab-lish a White Fish Industry Board and to undertakenegotiations with a view to regulating the landing offoreign catches in this country and over-fishing generally,to adopt measures for increasing the consumption of fish,and to grant a temporary subsidy to the white fish industry for a period of six months.Korea. 3.  The Cabinet were informed that, when the situation in Korea(Previous was debated in the House of Commons on 5th July, various pointsReferences: were likely to be raised about the legality of the action taken by the cm. (50) 39th United States and other nations in South Korea and of the declaredConclusions, intentions of the United States Government in respect of Formosa.Minute 4, and The Attorney-General would be ready to intervene in the debate toCM. (50) 40th deal with these points; but, from the point of view of world opinion,Conclusions, it was inexpedient that the debate should end on this note and itMinute 2.) was agreed that the final Government speech should bring the debateback to the broader political considerations which were involved.The Cabinet therefore agreed that the Prime Minister shouldopen the debate and that the Lord President should make the finalreply, the Attorney-General intervening briefly at an appropriate moment to deal with such legal points as had been raised.The Cabinet further agreed that it would be preferable that the debate should not end in a division.Industrial 4.
