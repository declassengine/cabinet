It would not be possible to midCM. (50) 52nd time for the discussion of these Motions, but the Members who wishedConclusions, to put them down were concerned about the extent to (which ttheMinute 2.) Opposition in both Houses were able to appear to take the initiative in making constructive suggestions in the field of foreign affairs.There was general ,agrgement that no objection need be taken tothe tabling of these motions, provided that the motion relating to theproposed Four-Power Conference was recast to make it clear thatthe final decision would have to be taken in consultation with theUnited States and France,The Cabinet Agreed that nonobjection need be raised to the tabling by government supporters of motions relating to the proposedFour-Power Conference and to Korea.brio.&apos;(previous reference;, -;CM (50)72nd,Conclusions,Minute 5.)--,The Prime Minister ^said^Xfat.he, had been \ approached;onbehalf of the Save the Children Fund, and other charitable organisa-tions aiif t&amp;spcountry,,,about, the-,jrefusaj^pijvther ynite^r,$atiQnj5Commandev-in-Chief ip admit these 6rgariisation^vt6.fKpfe^i(whilemilitary operations were in progress.

He would, however,make a fresh approach to the United States Secretary of State andwould emphasise the need for urgent action.The Cabinet-Took note that the; Foreign Secretary would raise with theUnited States Secretary of State the need for greater progress with relief work in Korea, including the admissionvoluntary relief organisations.ofCoal.supplies during Winter,1950-51.(previous reference:CM. (50) 74thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Minister of Fuel and Power (CP. (50) 271) covering a reportby the Official Coal Committee on coal prospects during the coming winter and the immediate measures which might be taken to improvesupplies.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had examined certain points raised in the Cabinefs discussion on the previous day. the seasonal spurt in output before Christmas had started as usual thisyear, but it had been on a greatly reduced scale. This seasonal spurthad been taken into account in preparing the estimates of winteroutput contained in the report of the Official Coal Committee. Hehad also re-examined the-stock position. At the end of October thestock levels had, with the;.exception of stocks fon gas, railways andgeneral industry, been lower than a year ago, and stocks at the end
There was general agreement that, in view of the substantial gapwhich was likely to exist between the supply and demand for coal inof the,-winter- would be -considerably; below, Jast yeasls levels. TheNational-Goal Board;could certainly obtain hall.a million tons of coal from r.the United -States and probably&apos;;, greater amounts up toa. million, tons or more, Large coal for household, consumption, andsome coking coal, might, be available within this total. No timeshomd:be;lost in placing oxders, if, it were decided to buy, sincedemand for United States coal was increasing and prices were rising.the Minister of Transport said that port and transport capacity in the United Kingdom should be adequate to handle such quantitiesof United States coal as might be brought to this country. It shouldalso be possible to. handle the diversion to domestic consumptionof export coal which became available through any switching to export markets of coal bought in the United States. If United States coal was required,in this, country at the beginning of the year, sea transport arrangements would have to be.made without delay. In addition,freight rates were rising and the use of tramp shipping for transportingcoal would cause a further general rise.;-r. Tshe (Cabinet then discussed the use which could be made of coalboiignt^Mu^-U^iited;,Sta^s.:-,There was general agreement that, asfar a$ was, practicable, this-coal should be used for; bunkering and toreplace exports to our foreign customers, rather than for direct importinto the United Kingdom. In this connection, the following points were made&apos;:-vi (d) The,; analysis;-:,of coal exports from this country, set out inAnneXjTll ot,t&amp;e-jrejwrt; atj^fegcL C.P* (50) 271, suggested that asubstantial proportion of any coal bought in the United States couldbe used iin meeting this.cquntr.y&apos;s export jorders. The National CoalBoards should be pressed to secure a switching of orders in this way,in order to avoid more United States coal being brought to thiscountry than ,was; necessary and. to save the freight charges whichwould have to be borne if British, coal were exported to, say, theArgentine,..and united States coal brought to this country. Inpractice, however, there would be fairly: severe limits on the extentto which aswitching of orders could be effected because foreigncustqmers often required a particular quality of coal which might notbe available in the United States. - -,,.(^). While this country should do everything possible to meet therequirements: of foreign customers, it had to be borne in mind that many of them had defaulted on contracted supplies to this country.(c) Where, foreign orders for British coal were met by the supplyof American coal, care should be taken to avoid;the impression thatthis country was in a position to supply dollar goods when deliverycould not be met from sterling sources. Deliveries of American coal should, therefore,,,be, made only in respect of existing contractual obligations and should not, for example,- purport to meet obligationsfor which, :a postponement had already been secured.,(d) There, would be.-practical difficulties in the way of buyingcoal in,the United States and holding it there to meet our needs asthey arose. In any event, as had been, pointed out by the Minister ofTransport, early transport arrangements would have to be made forany coal which was to be delivered to this country in the early partof next year.(e) It would be preferable if any,purchases in the United states could be made by coal-exporting firms in this country, rather thandirectly by the National Coal Board. The purchase could then insome measure be represented as part of the world-wide business of buying and selling coal in which these firms were engaged, and jn somecases it might be possible to make use of options on United States coal which these firms had already secured.
the next few months, arrangements should be made without delayfor the purchase of coal in the United States. News of the purchasewas bound to become public and the Government should, as soon asthe commercial negotiations permitted, forestall criticism by an early announcement, which should stress the great increase in internalconsumption due to increased production and full employment.The Cabinet then had a preliminary discussion about long-term measures to stimulate output in the coalmining industry. Opinion was divided on the desirability of direct dealings between the Govern-ment and the National Union of Mineworkers about the steps whichmight be taken to secure a better spirit among the miners, and differingviews were expressed about the advantages and disadvantages of introducing a supplementary pensions scheme for miners. under arrangements which had already been made, the Minister of Fuel and power was having a discussion with the National Coal Board and theNational Union of Mineworkers about the disappointing results ofthe autumn drive for increased coal production. It was agreed that,at an early date, the Cabinet should have a general discussion aboutthe problems of the coalmining industry, including the relationsbetween the National Coal Board and the miners and the disparity between the day rates of wages and piece-rates in the industry.Similar problems arose in other industries, notably the railways.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the provision of coal for bunkering and for export to overseas bunker depots should be reduced to themaximum extent compatible with avoiding dislocation ofshipping, the details to be worked out by the Minister ofTransport and the Minister of Fuel and Power.(2) Agreed that no reduction should be made for the time being in the commercial use of lighting.(3) Agreed that no further cut should be made for the presentin exports of coal, but that the Minister of Fuel and power should arrange for the examination by officials ofthe distribution of a further cut, should this subsequentlybecome unavoidable, on two alternative assumptions a cut of half a million tons and a cut of one million tons.(4) Agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power should arrangefor the purchase of about one million tons of coal in theUnited States and of further amounts (subject to consulta-tion between the Ministry of Fuel and Power and theTreasury) if more could be obtained.(5) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to secure that, so faras was practicable, United States coal was used to fulfilexport contracts in substitution for British coal, in orderto reduce the extent to which American coal had to bebrought to this country.(6) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to submit to theCabinet at their next meeting the draft of the statement which he proposed to make on the purchase of UnitedStates coal.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11 th November, 1950.
