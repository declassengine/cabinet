Reference:

CC(87) 1.1

THE LORD PRESIDEtffcw THE COUNCIL said that in the Committee Stage in

the House of Loros jK/ythe Criminal Justice Bill the Government&apos;s

proposals on leniehxYMjJ^ences had been approved by a majority of 43

votes.    This very saW ractory result had been achieved with the

assistance of useful Ync r#J*ntions in the debate by the Lord Chief

Justice, Lord Ackner an^^&amp;^l. Roskill.    The proposals for abolishing the

prima facie rule in extrfurt tipn proceedings had, however,  faced a good

deal of opposition.    He urra x! t!Apd that the Home Secretary intended to

stand firm on the principle\$u$N*as considering some minor modifications

that might help to secure tha^Mfe/sage of this part of the Bill. There

was a risk also that the GoveriybeJ* Owould face defeat on its proposals

for abolishing the peremptory cnali^wge of jurors.    This had been

recommended by Lord Roskill&apos;s fra d trials committee and it would be

helpful if Lord Roskill could be p&lt;r^y*atted to take part in the debate.

It appeared that the Opposition mignb^&amp;acceed in carrying an amendment

at Report Stage to change the presentC^^Jron life sentences for

homicide.    It should be possible to reverse in the House of Commons any

defeats on major issues of principle.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said^that it would be

helpful if the Government&apos;s position on extradition could be settled as

quickly as possible.    If it were decided to pxgjjB^head with the

abolition of the prima facie rule, an early announcement of this could

help to ease the ratification of Irish accessionvT^ ne European

Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism.

3.      THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the underwriters of the

fixed price underwriting agreement for the sale of Government shares in

British Petroleum had made formal representations to him earlier that

week seeking consultations with a view to terminating the offer of sale.

&apos;NHe expected to reach a decision later that day on whether or not the

?^:fer should proceed.    This decision would need to be communicated to

/Xfye underwriters and to the market as soon as practicable and the House

&apos;/  ^&gt;pmmons would expect to be informed at the earliest opportunity. He

^JupKconsult the Lord Privy Seal about the timing of an announcement in

tb^iidji^e of Commons.

In og^i^irsion it was agreed that the primary consideration in deciding

upon u^e/^ming of an announcement must be compliance with legal

requirements and with the legitimate needs and interests of the

underwriters and the market, even if the timing indicated by those

considerations was not ideal from the Parliamentary point of view.

Prisons

THE HOME SECRETA^^^id that he had spoken to representatives of the

Prison Officers&apos; As^ j aa ion (POA) as he had been authorised at the

previous meeting or ^n^Oabinet.    All prisons were now receiving

prisoners although pr^\ra\&gt;fficers at Wandsworth had merely suspended

their industrial action. &gt;^^national delegate conference of the POA had

been called for the folM$W&gt;n&apos;g\ day.    While the situation in the prison

service had improved over^h^previous week, with the numbers of

prisoners in police cells ha&gt;Wl^ fallen,  it was too early to be certain

of the final outcome. \S&gt;^7

4.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he and the

Secretary of State for Defence had that week attended the Meeting of

Foreign and Defence Ministers of the seven meafpe^v countries of Western

European Union.    The meeting had adopted a dc(aume\ t entitled &quot;Platform

of European Security Interests&quot;, which set out^^axly the main

conditions of European security.    It declared unamb-lfiAously that

European security was founded on deterrence and on^ydi^presence of

United States forces in Europe.    During the meeting nmg&amp;b. had been

useful discussions about the situation in the PersiaDOS&amp;Jv-    The Defence

Ministers of the five European countries with a naval pre^race in the

area had been able to consult directly,  for the first t&amp;R&amp;f&apos;S&amp;out the

co-ordination of minesweeping in the Gulf.    The Federal R^p^p^\c of

Germany was now contributing indirectly, by moving mines we e-^ja^^to the

Mediterranean to compensate for the departure of Italian mii^svej%&gt;ers

from that area to the Gulf.    Luxembourg was helping to pay fo^a^i^ian


and Netherlands minesweepers&apos; operations in the Gulf. The European

presence in that area was an effective contribution.

TH^F^felGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had seen the United

StaBj^-jJg^retary of State, Mr George Shultz, at a meeting of the North

Atlanxv^Council on 24 October, after Mr Shultz&apos;s visit to Moscow.

Mr ShuVp^had at first been puzzled by the Soviet hesitation, after

major progress had been made towards an agreement on intermediate range

nuclear forces (INF),  about proceeding to a summit meeting between the

United States and Soviet leaders.    In retrospect,  it seemed that

significance shejrW be accorded to the remark by the General Secretary

of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, to

Mr Shultz to tho.arfX&amp;ct that he had to consider the question of a summit

as a politician a/ wall as a human being;  in other words,  there might

have been politicai^CHjuistraints in Moscow on Mr Gorbachev&apos;s freedom of

action with regard YOy^^&amp;ummit.    The Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard

Shevardnadze, was noX^OV^sit Washington on 30 October, apparently with

a view to fixing the S&amp;t&amp;^cyp a summit.    The Government&apos;s position was

that an agreement on INF^JxM^d be concluded and that the question of a

summit could be treated s^&gt;ariifcely from that.    It was possible that

there would be a summit in ^&gt;ejc*m\er 1987 without any significant change

beforehand in the United Stavtfes^neysition on the Strategic Defence

Initiative.    During Mr Shultz^^^/sit to Moscow there had been progress

towards an INF agreement;  the percAeroXfor withdrawal of short range INF

had been set for 12-18 months anu th&gt;r^ f or long range INF at three

years.    The details of verificatiofl ofj^he proposed agreement were now

being discussed. ^^C^^

In discussion,  the question was raisedvwjvether deployments of United

States INF in Europe should continue afttir the signature of an INF

agreement.    There were arguments on both sides, but the main point was

that such deployments might serve no purpose.    It might therefore on

balance be preferable for an announcement to be^jnade, on signature of an

agreement, that further moves on deployment wdVld^e suspended. The

suspension should probably be for a stated pervaL ^*K case the agreement

for any reason should not enter into force.    Meanwhile, the Government&apos;s

line should be that there would be no change in rhe-^aployment

arrangements before signature of an agreement, and VatoMng arrangements

for exercising with Cruise missiles should continue. (?ro^vhultz had

rightly rejected a suggestion by Mr Gorbachev that INrd&amp;bjfoyment should

be suspended from 1 November 1987. NX^-v

forces were being deployed the possibility of an

announcement at the time of signature of an

/   further moves in deployment would be suspended

^^or a given period.

Kri Lanka

THE FORESfcN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Indian peacekeeping

force in yri Lanka had claimed to have taken control of the town of

Jaffna.    But the town did not seem yet to have been fully secured; nor

had the Indian fp-cces captured any of the leaders of the &quot;Tamil Tigers&quot;

guerrilla ovgai/Y ayion.    The Indian operations in Sri Lanka were clearly

taking longer o^n/J ad been planned.    The first Commander of the Indian

peacekeeping forc/e/nath been quietly replaced.    The resistance of the

Tamil Tigers was l^fe^^Sto continue for some time.

In discussion,  it was/jxj  ti that the events in Sri Lanka could affect

the case, awaiting an ^J^teM. hearing in the House of Lords of six Tamils

seeking political asylum^^^Bi^itain.

Hong Kong

Financial

Markets

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH &gt;S^C^^ Y said that the Hong Kong stock and

futures exchange had been closed(^for/&gt;Apur days in the previous week.

The underlying reason had been coo^exn^about the state of the futures

exchange and the risk that speculato^^on that exchange might default,

with repercussions for the stock excfeSgfe&apos;as well.    The stock exchange,

after reopening on 26 October, had suEfr^erJ^ a fall of 30 per cent. This

had been followed by fluctuations both^fys, so that the net fall stood

currently at 30 per cent.    The Hong KongvGovernment had taken

substantial measures to support the markets, providing funds for the

restructured Futures Guarantee Corporation.    Independent banks and also

the Bank of China had contributed largely to tl^-s^ipport fund. It

seemed that the situation was being managed saWisfWctorily.

In discussion,  it was pointed out that speculati&lt;\fejw/&gt;Jie Hong Kong

futures market amounted virtually to gambling on tTy^*tfture of the stock

market index.    The Hong Kong Government was looking an/yfos wider

question of the future management of the markets.    IrK5pHft^n) many

members of the public found it difficult to understand wrn/S^ople who

for years had made profits in the financial markets had ^^^^helped as

soon as there was a week with serious losses.    The GoverniwnVmight need

to be ready with an appopriate explanatory line on this. &lt;^/&lt;Cv&gt;

(^Mr Yeutter, the Commission and the European Airbus Ministers had been

^Masonably satisfactory.    Agreement had been reached on a framework for

pK^e^ives.    Negotiations might drag on in to 1988.    During this period,

no^^fwus orders would be placed by the United States.

Blockade of

THE FORE^JN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that French fishing vessels

had tried to blockade French channel ports in protest at the extension

of British territorial waters under the Territorial Sea Act 1987 which

came into force^piKl October.    He had discussed the issue earlier that

position was trra^^S^v blockade had been lifted.    Further discussions

Jurvey

The Cabinet ^^^^lered a memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury

(C(87)  16) on^M^^|87 Public Expenditure Survey.

THE CHIEF SECRET ||Q|EASURY said that his paper set out the agreements

he had reached wiznjH^teagues on their programmes.    After allowing for

the higher provisioKjPfclocal authority current expenditure already

decided,  there would^^ii^reases in programmes totalling  4.6 billion

in 1988-89,   6.1 billion^%989-90, and  7.7 billion in 1990-91. A

large part of these increases reflected estimating changes, and

decisions taken before the Survey.    On social security the increases,

ranging from over  900 million in 1988-89 to over  3 billion in 1990-91,

were the result mainly of estimating changes, together with the earlier

decision to raise benefits to Profi^fct income support claimants against

the cost of the 20 per cent ratemjp^tr ibut ion.    On health the increases

reflected the cost of the Review^^j^kwards agreed earlier in the year,

higher demand on the Family Prac t i p%r s Servic es and the growing cost

of AIDS.    Home Office expenditure ha^^^^ increased mainly to cover the

expansion and acceleration of the pris&apos;^^^^lding programme agreed in

the summer.    Launch aid for the Airbus a^Rl^ed for a major part of the

increase in the Department of Trade and IJ)R|y programme.    The figures

also allowed for substantial increases in^^H|fci&apos;s net contributions to

the European Community.

Because of these pressures for higher spending^it had been possible to

hold the totals to acceptable levels only by taking difficult decisions

elsewhere.    In social security, for example, the Secretary of State had

announced that the new income-related benefits would be introduced in

1988 at levels slightly below the illustrative rates givag^.n the 1985

reform White Paper,  that Child Benefit would not be up4U in 1988, and

that the housing benefit taper would be raised.    In the^^fcgBmalised

industries,  there would be substantial  increases  in elect^Hfc^ prices.

The Secretary of State for Employment had agreed,  in view ofc^BH^

improved prospects for unemployment, to absorb the extra cosK oW2he

January employment package.

As to running costs, a total increase of  560 million had been a?5tf^^^

for 1988-89.    The target agreed by Cabinet in July of at least hal^3| ^

the bids received had not been met,  inpart because of the increase &quot;i^^^W


market rents and the need to catch up with the backlog of maintenance

work on the Government Estate.    The outcome was, however, broadly

consistent with the other objective agreed by Cabinet of constraining

k running costs to their present share of the planning total.    In the case

^of ten Departments he had agreed a provision based on suitable

management plans.    Other Departments were still developing their plans.

^Hakhoped that in all cases suitable plans would be in place in time for

JJ^mext Survey.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the increases agreed in

programmes clearly left the reserves at an inadequate level. He

proposed that they should be fixed at  3.5 billion for 1988-89,  7

billion foi^989-90 and  10.5 billion for 1990-91.    The result would be

increase^w the planning totals of  2.6 billion in  1988-89 and  5.6

billion ^ 5j^-90.    The new figures  for the planning totals would then

be  156.8 mC^i in 1988-89,   167.1 billion in 1989-90 and  176.1

billion in The growth in the planning totals was, however,

partly of f set       animal growth in debt interest, as a result of low

borrowing.    Th^ki^kK of national income taken by public spending,

without allowing^^fcJ|y:ivatisation proceeds, would be 42 per cent, 41-V^

per cent,  and 41^^(^2|^cent in the three years, meeting the Cabinet&apos;s

objective of keepin^P^l^in the percentages in the previous year&apos;s White

He had agreed with the Secretary of State for Social Services the

National Insurance Contribution levels to be announced in the Autumn

Statement.    There would be no change in rates, but the Lower Earnings

Limit would rise to  41 a week, the Upper Earnings Limit to  305,

broadly in line with inflationism

The Autumn Statement would also ^fCw1 the new Industry Act forecast.

It was of course especially diffi^W5^^make an economic forecast at

the present time, and although he h^Ft ed to take the effects of the

fall in share values  into account it^fc^dknot be until the pre-Budget

forecast  in the New Year that a proper^WdMient could be made. His

present expectation was, however,  that gpKu^^in the United Kingdom

would be 4 per cent in 1987, and 2i per (^POk 1988.    The 2i per cent

figure was better than it appeared, since ^le^mitr ibution of North Sea

oil in 1988 would be negative, at       per cen|^Tn both years,

investment would grow faster than consumers&apos; expenditure, and

manufacturing output faster than the economy as a whole.    Inflation as

measured by the Retail Price Index was forecast to be 4 per cent by the

fourth quarter of that year, and 4i per cent by the fourth quarter of

the following year.    The Gross Domestic Product deflat^^ould be

per cent that year and 4i per cent the followinMiML   The balance

of payments was especially difficult to predict, but l^JdW^keeping to

the Budget forecast of a deficit of  2^ billion that ye^L^^d

forecasting one of  3i billion the following year.    The &quot;^^^^B was tne

product of a faster rate of growth in the United Kingdom t^M^^the

rest of the industrial world,  for which he estimated growth oE er

cent the following year.    Unemployment would continue to fal 1 .^^raAnow

expected the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement outturn in l^M^^^^o

be only  1 billion.    This was well below the  4 billion estimate^R^^


Budget mainly because of the buoyancy of the revenue, but partly because

the planning total would undershoot by  1 billion. This undershoot was

largely the result of higher proceeds from sales of council houses and

land; other spending in total was broadly in line with plans.

Jfche cause of the current market turmoil was lack of confidence in United

*S^tes policy.    Some international agreement was needed to minimise the

and he was  in continual contact with Finance Ministers  in the

^Tther major countries.    The key to restoring confidence was effective

action by the United States Government to reduce its budget deficit. If

such action were taken, other countries could help by cutting interest

rates.    The United Kingdom would be affected less than most by the

collapse o^^narket confidence.    But it could not expect to be immune,

not so nAalo the direct effect as the indirect effect,  through the

slow-downfcA^^e United States growth.    There was however, no need, if

appropr iat^Hk^c ies were followed,  for the slow-down to become a

In discussion ^ft|^^llowing main points were made -

a. The incrJE^WkLn the proceeds now expected from sales of

housing and l  ^by ^ocal authorites and new towns had made a major

contribution to^a^P  the problems of the Survey.    It showed the

success of privatisation in the local authority area also. Since

the undershoot in 1987-88 was largely attributable to those

receipts,  it would not be appropriate to increase other expenditure

to offset it.

b. The electricity indu  ^iad accepted the need for a higher

financial target.    A r i se ^l^^^kce s was necessary to finance the

big increase  in electricity^^^^Vtment required over the next few

years.    It was important  in p^WBl^resentat ion to stress that

higher prices were needed to pi^fcii^^adequate and efficient

capacity,  so as to rebut the char^^^^^iat their purpose was to make

the industry more attractive for ^ i^isation.

c. The figures  for the Department l^%rtrie and Industry&apos;s

programme provided for a restructuring^o^J^giona 1 assistance which

would have an initial cost but produce ^rereasing savings by the

end of the Survey period.    Corresponding changes would be made in

Scotland and Wales.

d. Any downturn in world growth would compl icate^^he management

of the United Kingdom economy over the next two Tbe level

of real  interest rates was important.    They had excessive

levels throughout the world and if they could now ^^^D^ught down,

prospects for renewed growth would be much enhanced^^^P^

Administration were well aware of the need to cut  the buJ^WgK

deficit.    Action would have to be taken to reduce spendingRg^^^

increase taxes,  or probably both.  It would have to be on a

substantial scale over a period of years, and the longer it ^^^^

i


postponed the more substantial it would have to be.    But it would

not be easy to get the necessary decisions made, because of the

structure of decision-making in the Administration,  the political

difficulty of raising taxes especially with an election the

following year,  and the failure so far of American opinion

^F^^k generally to recognise the gravity of the situation. Other

? ^J^overnments would need to do all they could to ensure that the

^^right decisions were taken.    Another important task was to stiffen

the Administration&apos;s resistance to the pressure for protectionism.

f.      It could be argued that the international markets should be

allowed^o work by letting the value of the dollar fall. Certainly

thera^^^no case for trying to maintain exchange rates if they

wereljyfe wrong,  and international co-operation had helped to

achieve^flB^stantial devalution of the dollar over the past two

years.   ^kXi^un control led fall in the dollar at that time would

be most da^giBg for world markets and its short-run effect on the

United Stat^l^ kde balance would be a still greater deterioration.

g.      At first sr^n^Vwas surprising that shares in London had

fallen faster tha^^Mbt in New York or Tokyo.    This was because of

the different chara^^ristics of the markets.    In New York there

were many traders prepared to buy, even at some risk, if they

thought prices had fallen too far.    The London market was dominated

by cautious institutions, who preferred to wait until prospects

were clear.    The falls in Londp^had resulted in the large part

from marking down of prices vw9r than the high volume of selling

seen on Wall St. ^^mVW.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the d^o^B^n,  said that the Cabinet

congratulated the Chief Secretary, TreMurfin the outcome of the Survey

and endorsed his recommendations in C ( 8^Jd|^^k Th e y also endorsed the

proposals by the Chancellor of the Excheqneji^: the new levels for the

reserves and planning totals over the Surve^E^H|^d.    It was essential

that no information about these decisions shofc^^fccome public knowledge

before the Chancellor delivered his Autumn Staxen^^on 3 November,

particularly in view of the Government&apos;s legal position in relation to

the British Petroleum flotation.    The Lord Privy Seal would teli the

House of Commons that afternoon the date of the Autumn Statement. She

would arrange for the press to be told that the Cabinet had that day

successfully concluded its work on the  1987 Public Expenditure Survey;

and that the outcome,  together with the Industry Act forAcm^, would be

set out in the Autumn Statement which the Chancellor prop%^UAo make to

the House on Tuesday 3 November.    Nothing should be said t6^P ^ress

beyond that. ^^^Tm
