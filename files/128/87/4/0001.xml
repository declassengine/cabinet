AFFAlRS^g^

1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House of

Commons in the week beginning 19 October.

| Arms Control

QJffi^SlREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that  it appeared that the

Oftg^rpion intended to use the Second Reading of the Arms Control and

Disajraajngjit (Privileges and Immunities) Bill as an occasion for a major

deba&lt;J^w&apos; arms control.

I The

I Legislative

Programme

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 23.5

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a number of Bills would be

ready for earlxOiTvKroduction in both the House of Commons and the House of

Lords.    The management of the legislative programme was largely dependent

on making earlyTO(5gMss with the three major Bills - Housing, Education

and Rates Reform.\\_^ as already clear that the preparation of the Rates

Reform Bill was taT&lt;^ /Longer than had been hoped, and this made it vital

that the Housing and iWkJj^&amp;^ion Bills should be introduced on the agreed

timetable.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE Fw^FHyS ENVIRONMENT said that he hoped that it would

be possible to include pro^u-j^ro*\s in the present Session&apos;s Housing Bill on

as many as possible of the t m^^ which the Ministerial Steering Committee

on Economic Strategy, Sub-ColmrL^B on Local Government Finance had

contemplated.    In order to res^jM^o the timetable for introduction of the

Bill, he had devised a simplifi^gVapJypach on the proposals for giving

council tenants the right to opt landlords, and had also trimmed

his proposals on improvement grantSy^Ke was in consultation with his

colleagues over these new proposals

HOME AFFAIRS

Peterhead

Prison

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said thaXj^j&gt;rison officers at

Peterhead Prison had been taken hostage on 28 SepteTraay^ One had been

released the following day but his colleague, who had/&gt;Bj^(layed remarkable

courage, was still being held.    About 50 prisoners had&gt;Jjk ^ involved in the

original disturbance but only three, all of whom were exrrarjfely dangerous,

now remained.    It appeared that a constructive dialogue MMren

established with them that morning, and he was therefore fwjjp^&amp;l that there

would be a peaceful end to the incident. &lt;^^0^


Pr iso^^\&gt;

THE HOME SECRETARY said that, as part of an industrial dispute at

Wandsworth Prison, prison officers there were refusing to take in new

inmates and this was making it necessary to accommodate prisoners in police

^ cells.

West Glamorgan

Fire Authority

mg^SME SECRETARY said that he was in touch with the Secretary of State

fot^&amp;e^ence and had alerted the Civil Contingencies Unit about the

possibility that action might be needed to deal with a dispute over manning

in wfepfyt Glamorgan Fire Authority.    It might become necessary to

authory^/tjie deployment of &quot;Green Goddess&quot; fire appliances later that day.

Coal Industry

Reference:

CC(87) 26.1

THE SECRETARY OjE^TATE FOR ENERGY said that the National Union of

Mineworkers (NIWl) &lt;J ad begun an overtime ban the previous week. Their

President, Mr A?ty 5?v\Sc argil 1, had tried to escalate the dispute, but it

was clear that NUMjnembers had little stomach for further industrial

action.    The LeadVr^i/the Opposition had endorsed Mr Scargill&apos;s approach

of seeking to presefyjKMe system of pit umpires.    However, this system had

been used on only abMft^PfKoccasions in the previous 10 years. Most

aggrieved mineworkers pref^red to take their cases to industrial tribunals

because this route provi^fea/rhem with a further avenue of appeal and

Mr Scargill was thus seeMWiQ revive a system from which his members had

turned away.    The Union ort^Mwratic Mineworkers was reported to be making

successful efforts to recru\\wew\members.    Coal stocks were high and had

not been affected by the dispo  /^

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting between

the United States Secretary of State, Mr Georg^Shul tz, and the Soviet

Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,  in Washington on 15-17 September

had confirmed the political impetus behind anv^jp^Sftient on the elimination

of intermediate range land based nuclear missile/ (iNF).    It had been

agreed that warheads would be rendered inoperable  )r^tfart of an INF

agreement.    The agreement would completely exclude^xp-Od party&quot; systems.

Agreement had yet to be reached between the United si^CeVvand the Soviet

Union on verification;  the United States were consulriny^ blies closely and

agreement among them on the details of verification was/visually complete.

Mr Shultz hoped to finalise an agreement when he visitedy^o^oow in the

third week of October.    It would be difficult to resolve aMXavtstanding

details by then, but both sides were under political presso^vtHvconclude

an agreement. Is\


THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that the essential

point, which would be readily understood by the public, was that when the

Soviet Union had made moves to install intermediate range nuclear missiles

\ the West had been resolute in making clear that it would respond by

-^deploying its own intermediate range missiles.    It was only because the

\vjest had stood firm that the Soviet Union was now prepared to contemplate

,&gt;/m7 agreement removing this category of weapon.    Attempts by the

^aa^^riuclear lobby in the United Kingdom to claim credit for the agreement

khonjjknot be allowed to gain credence.    Nor should suggestions that the

ag^emwt was evidence of positive change in Soviet foreign policy.

Iran/Iraq War

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 27.2

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, thanks in large measure

to the United Kingdom&apos;s efforts over recent months, there was encouraging

agreement among the Permanent Members of the United Nations Security

Council on the/^rfeVt steps towards ending the Gulf war:    that the United

Nations Secreftajcy^Sfi^neral, Mr Perez de Cuellar, should continue his effort

to obtain the imjy^myhtation of Security Council Resolution 598 and that

work should begin^-ojrMa&amp;asures to enforce the Resolution.    It was a

considerable prize ^e^nave persuaded the Soviet Union and China to accept

the latter point.    Tpe/^&amp;ent visit to Tehran by Mr Perez de Cuellar had

elicited some slight dj^^lvpment in Iran&apos;s attitude, with the dropping of

her insistence on the ove^mpw of the President of Iraq, Mr Saddam

Hussein.    But there was N^roSavidence of a harder line in the Iranian

regime, notably the uncom^ mj^ing address to the United Nations General

Assembly by the Iranian Pre^^n^., Mr Ali Khamenei, the Iranian attack on

21 September on the British^^.agj^ed tanker &quot;Gentle Breeze&quot;,  Iran&apos;s mining

of the Gulf and her threats o ^yap isal against the United States for the

attack on 21 September on the m^Jrel^yer &quot;Iran Ajr&quot;.    The prospects for a

ceasefire were not promising, butXtKss important to maintain pressure on

both Iran and Iraq.    The Soviet Un Lerfp&apos;was seeking to make political capital

out of the situation, by criticising^ttS/western naval presence in the Gulf

and by proposing the establishment of/a^H^Lted Nations naval peace-keeping

force.    He was sceptical as to the restarts of the pressures for an end to

the war, but would continue to pursue ily as the best hope of achieving

progress.

It was noteworthy that there had been a me e t ia^pTviring the General Assembly

of the Foreign Ministers of the five PermanenWM^bers of the Security

Council; this had not happened since 1972. y^y)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the R^^/flavy&apos;s Armilla

Patrol in the Gulf was operating successfully.    Brim P /rainesweepers had

begun operations but no mines had been detected.    The^Rov&amp;l Navy&apos;s

operations were being co-ordinated with those of the Belg^pi and Dutch

Navies.    The French were so far being less co-operative^mdpie would take

this up with the French Defence Minister, Monsieur Andre^i^rd,  later in

that day.    The attack on the &quot;Gentle Breeze&quot; might not have^&amp;aR^n place had

the Master sought naval advice beforehand about the route t^Vr^k^ in the


In discussion,  it was noted that the idea of a United Nations naval force

was not practicable; and that the attack on the &quot;Gentle Breeze&quot; had

^provided the opportunity to close the Iranian Military Procurement Offices

^V&gt; London; the Federal Republic of Germany had given an assurance that it

^auld not agree to the relocation of the Offices there.

; Fiji

&apos;previous

Reference:

CC(87) 20.4

THE CESS^GN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation in Fiji was

unclea*y^ !^llowing the second coup on 25 September by Colonel Sitiveni

Rabuka.vC There were signs of a power struggle between supporters of the

Fijian Nationalist Movement, Taukei, and members of the Armed Forces who

were attempting to sustain loyalty to the Crown, especially following the

firm statement bv Her Majesty The Queen.    Although Colonel Rabuka had

agreed the prafo&apos;oTys day to meet political leaders on 5 October under the

Governor-GenenALj spicjiairmanship, he was reported earlier that morning to

have abrogated tWa^coBstitution and to have declared himself as Head of

State.    The GoveAjvo^p^ieral was displaying tenacity and courage in

refusing to accept ^0j6jy&amp;l Rabuka&apos;s action.

In discussion,  it was ^&gt;&lt;&gt;^^that, were Fiji to become a Republic, her

continued membership of Lk^Spmmonwealth would be dependent on no other

member objecting. \V^y

Meeting of

Commonwealth

Finance

Ministers

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER^u^hat the Commonwealth Finance

Ministers had met in Barbados on 2^24^&gt;eptember.    a greater sense of

realism had been detectable than at&gt;t^ vious meetings.    Several countries

now appeared to accept that their eo^ fiSflfVc problems were self-induced and

that the remedy lay in their own handsA/^JJe meeting had endorsed the

United Kingdom&apos;s proposals for tacklingf^xfhe debt problems confronting the

poorest countries in Sub-Saharan Africa.v

Meeting of the

International

Monetary Fund

and the World

Bank

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that he ha^/&amp;tTM ded the annual

meeting of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) \knjK/j*  World Bank in

Washington from 25 to 30 September.    In discussion ^^if^A debt problems

confronting the poorer countries, the United Kingdom^^p^posals had

commanded some support, but there had been reservatiofv^|^q&gt;it the

suggestion that there should be concessionary interest ra^&amp;v.   The British

initiative had prompted the IMF to put forward their ownC^^pysaIs, which

were more widely targeted and were attracting widespread sadj^Aa.    It was

important that there should be agreement on this issue by th^^n^of that

year.    The middle-income debtor countries in Latin America w\n:e^a^V:ause for

concern, especially Argentina and Brazil, although there was n^Wk-Alihood

of any country defaulting, either unilaterally, or in a concerted^t&apos;Wton.

Encouragingly, Mexico&apos;s economic position was improving thanks to^reV.

privatisation programme,and the resulting reversal of the outflow of^/


capital.    The announcement by the United States President, Mr Ronald

Reagan, of his intention to sign the Gramm-Rudman Bill, which was aimed at

curbing public expenditure, had been well received, as had been the

^ reaffirmation by the Group of Seven of the Louvre Accord of February 1987,

/^which was designed to stabilise exchange rates.

O^Hwdiscussion, concern was expressed about the level of debt in South

v^n^ica; there was a danger that this might be exploited by the Soviet

4Mon*yh^-ch was pursuing a more active role in the area, typified by the

cu^^n^ visit by the Soviet Foreign Minister and by the planned visit the

folLer^nj? year by the General Secretary of the Communist Party, Mr Mikhail

Gorb$  ^

; COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Agriculture

4.      THE MINISTER^QP^SRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that at its

meeting on 21-22 SafJ^mher the Agriculture Council of the European

Community had had it/*v rst substantial discussion of the Commission&apos;s

proposals for agricurrJwTfc^stabili&amp;ers.    In most areas he had strongly

supported the Commissionj^/Sany of their ideas were similar to those put

forward by the United K&amp;^o1s\in the Community the previous July, though

some did not go as far.   Nte_^jAd\. however,  firmly restated the United

Kingdom&apos;s opposition to the^&lt;d^ s\and fats tax, on which the Commission

continued to maintain its prop{js&lt;rt.    Wider opposition to the stabiliser

proposals was expressed by th^Cxrpn^ns, the French,  the Mediterranean

countries and the Republic of Ixf&amp;ayi and it was clear that there would be

a big battle ahead to ensure that/  fr&lt;*icient progress would be made on

stabilisers in preparation for the E^opean Council in December.

Fisheries

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD reported that the Fisheries

Council on 29 September had agreed a number of minor decisions which had

been acceptable to the United Kingdom. f/^))

Steel

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that&apos;^jfe^ndustry Council on

21 September had considered for the first time the Od^m^sAion&apos;s proposals

for the steel regime that would replace the Community^s^y^&gt;tem of quotas

for most categories of product, due to end in December &lt;MS^\ After a

difficult discussion it had been recognised that the Corm(wn^rv. must commit

itself to a process of restructuring which would reduce tfTe^rtnient excess

of steel-making capacity.    The main need was to put pressurA^ah^fche Federal

Republic of Germany to make cuts in capacity.    The technique^H^se-o was the

appointment of Three Wise Men to report by mid-November on how^ajre^j^te


commitments to restructuring might be obtained.    It was likely that the

resumed Council in December would be a long and difficult one.    His aim

would be that, if in the end it was found necessary to carry forward a

I system of quotas,  the position of the British Steel Corporation, which was

/adversely affected by present quotas, should be safeguarded and improved,

would keep his colleagues informed.

I Airbus

Industrie

THE  pAN ELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that he had been taking a

leadxJJ^^ncouraging the Ministers of the countries concerned with Airbus,

especiVn&gt;Pthe Federal Republic of Germany and France,  to work closely with

Commissioner de Clercq in dealing with complaints from the United States

about Government launch aid for Airbus Industrie.    Both the United States

Administration and the United States manufacturers, McDonnell Douglas and

Boeing, were restive and a move by Boeing might trigger United States

action againsty^Jrr^ividual member states or the Community.    The United

Kingdom and th\aCc*imission were at one in seeking ways of satisfying the

United States ony^rleyapplication and effect of the launch aid and of

avoiding this issVe^^ing added to other trade issues currently in dispute.

But the French ana^fefman Governments were more defensive;  the latter

Government in particviK^J/recognised that the generosity of its terms for

launch aid made it vu&amp;vera^le.    In advance of a critical meeting later in

October between CommissiS ^-de Clercq and the Airbus Ministers on the one

hand and the United StaMMttde Representative on the other, he would be

grateful for the assistarVoe-^^the Foreign and Commonwealth Office in

helping to pave the way botV^nvthe United States and in France and Germany

for a constructive dialogue&gt;\^/^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SE^ETARY said that he had already spoken to

the United States Secretary of Sta  )vto draw his attention to the issue

and the need to avoid it becoming catjgnt up in a process of retaliation and

counter-retaliation.    He would cons^frS^^further diplomatic steps.
