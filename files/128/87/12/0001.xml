?rf^E SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that a group of

(Sp^Vnment backbenchers had tabled a Motion for the Second Reading of

(frWeiXcal Government Finance Bill the following week instructing the

S^tfa^Bjg Committee to consider the desirability of banding rates of

Comnrt$ifl_k* Charge according to individuals&apos; means.    While he understood

that&quot;C ms Motion would not be debated,  the proposal of a banded charge

might Aey^r theless provide the immediate focus for criticism of the

Bill.   v(C banded charge would be manifestly unjust and should be firmly

resistedy   It would create poverty traps at the bottom of each of the

proposed bands and it would be very difficult and expensive to

administer.    The version of the proposal that was currently being

canvassed was ^&quot;eTnynstr ably vitiated by flaws in the figuring on

which the ana\taiS--was based.    That proposal would not significantly

extend local govArinnant accountability beyond the present 18 million

ratepayers, wherr^as-^ASsmillion people would be liable to the Community

Charge under the G^OTment&apos;s proposals.    In addition, there would be

very large differenoe^^rtythe charges levied on the more affluent in

different areas:  sucrr^pecmie would have a great incentive to move out of

high charge areas and thvs^^ould have an adverse impact on the

communities concerned, e-Jjpe^vally inner cities.    The argument that the

Government&apos;s proposals we^&amp;A/piair because of their regressive nature

could best be rebutted by p&lt;*p^s^ig out that nearly one-half of local

government income would be trar^from taxation, compared with one-quarter

from the Community Charge anc04Jk&amp;ther quarter from the business rate,

and that more affluent members^o-cIpciety would accordingly continue to

make a much larger contribution t-JJ^rn^Othe less well-off.    He would

urgently circulate to colleagues an-d/to Government backbenchers briefing

material explaining the objections^tC^hided charges.

&apos;^B^hCRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that,  following his letter to

tha^hwirman of British Caledonian Airways (BCal) that he had described

to th^Cabinet the previous week, Scandinavian Airlines System (SAS) had

made^^fiHrtier proposals to BCal,  involving a smaller holding then they

had prayApspfcly sought.    The most recent proposal took the form of a

complicroea package involving SAS&apos;s acquisition of 26 per cent of BCal&apos;s

ordinary^hares, though this would be diluted by new rights issues

totalling  50 million, of which SAS would underwrite  20 million without

increasing their voting rights.    The overall result of the proposals

would be to giy^Ps&amp;&gt; 23i per cent of the voting rights in BCal, though

that would be fc^ipatyle of increase to 40 per cent if in the future the

controls on Brirr^^~a^r 1 ines passing into foreign hands should be

relaxed.    SAS1 s myainyp/a-rtner in these proposals was Investors In

Industry, which wass&amp;fAQyestment group owned by the British clearing

banks and in which tha/rfank  f England had a small stake.    As he had

explained to the Cabir(g v&lt;t\^ previous week, his powers to direct the

revocation of air transpor^^icences in the event of an airline passing

out of British control w *j ^CViggered by his being informed by the Civil

Aviation Authority (CAA) v&amp;&amp;/Apch a situation obtained.    The CAA&apos;s duty

was to keep the ownership of~^3&lt;rvines under continuing review, and to

inform him whenever they thookWrr^t&apos;hat a transfer of ownership within the

meaning of the Act had taken p&lt;^&lt;^^&gt; But he was powerless to act unless

he was so informed.    He was natu/JKi \anxious that SAS might be banking

on edging through the statutory cop&amp;Qbs in the way he had described

and, when they judged they had secure^y&apos;established themselves,

increasing their effective control c&gt;f^-el^^company in the expectation

that they would not then be dislodged\yVL ^as essential that he should

act in strict accordance with the law g&amp;C^very stage, and he would

continue to keep in touch on this with rl^ Attorney General.    In the

most recent development, British Airways (BA) had increased by  80

million their cash offer for all BCal shares, so that it now stood at

 200 million.    It remained to be seen how the B ?3*\directors and

shareholders would react to this, but the Chairfaan(/&gt;f BA could be

expected to mount a vigorous public campaign aga-ftr^t-^AS&apos; s proposed

involvement. \V_xv&gt;&apos;\

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion,   ajftK&gt;J*at the subject

clearly provided many possibilities for legal challeng^^O^e Cabinet

agreed with the Secretary of State for Transport about thV^ftportance of

his being seen to handle the matter in strict conformity^ 5^&apos;Wie law&gt;

and noted that he would continue to keep in touch with the\Xta&gt;//pf ficer.

^Washington the treaty between their two countries eliminating

^atermediate Range Ground Based Nuclear Missiles  (INF).    The Summit

v&gt;0n^kting was now engaged in detailed discussion of a range of issues. A

^ramber of working groups had been established and would be reporting to

OTr^&apos;Dfop leaders.    Little hard news was emerging about the progress of

cne/d^^cussions but the atmosphere appeared to be good.    Mr Gorbachev

waVinaj rtig a strong and positive impression on the media and public

opir^raa-djfr the United States.    Both sides appeared to be at pains to

damp aS^Mexcessive public expectations of results from the meeting.

THE PRIME MINISTER sardObih^k the short stop of the General Secretary of

the Communist Party of t^rj % Nn.et Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, and his

party at the Royal Air Fo^e Jbjase at Brize Norton on 7 December, on the

way to the United States, Tva^x^Jje well.    Mr Gorbachev had appeared very

confident.    He showed no vis^^^^tffects of the difficulties he had

recently encountered at home \&gt;a^Wys campaigns for the restructuring of

Soviet society, known as peresrysfafferv and greater openness, known as

glasnost.    He had clearly set hre airgttis on real progress in these

fields and intended to pursue it.C&apos;Mr/ftorbachev was very pleased about

the agreement between the Soviet Un^fu-arvd the United States on the

elimination of Intermediate Range Grvtfjw&apos;Based Nuclear Missiles (INF).

This agreement was indeed a major breajy^Fough, not least in its

extensive provisions for verification. \She had warned Mr Gorbachev that

there might be difficulties in the Uniteu States Senate about the

ratification of the INF agreement, and had suggested that those

difficulties would be diminished if the Soviet JJoion were to make

further improvements in its performance in thf/fi&amp;ld of human rights,

for instance through a higher level of emigrac^^i^  As on previous

occasions, Mr Gorbachev had been sensitive on th/iis matter, saying only

that it was a domestic question for the Soviet Unsfcrra^^hich would do

what it thought best.    She had told him that the p&lt;#w   s for

ratification by the United States Senate of the INF ^g^e^sent would also

be helped if he would declare that Soviet forces woul^^ redraw from

Afghanistan.    The impression she had gained was that Mr J3J*  achev would

like to withdraw Soviet forces from Afghanistan but stir*^nop d to be

able to leave behind a government that would be reliable sifM^ftsie Soviet

point of view.    She had pointed out to Mr Gorbachev that th^fcnalied

Kingdom, when it had withdrawn from colonial territories, hai^p^X/

insisted that the governments left behind should be pro-BritiMy/^Jfoe

had again made clear to Mr Gorbachev that the British nuclear dWerrent


was already at an irreducible minimum strength.    The objective of arms

control should be a world free of war rather than a world free of

nuclear weapons.    In a nuclear-free world immensely destructive

1  conventional wars could take place; and, since nuclear weapons could not

&gt;-ybe disinvented, countries engaged in war might produce them quickly if

^Miey had not clandestinely retained some.    The stability created by

V^yclear deterrence was especially important in Europe, where two world

MW^SAhad started.    The next priorities in arms control in Europe, after

yvvcent: cuts in the strategic arsenals of the Soviet Union and the

UfCrt edO&gt; t a t e s , should be reductions in conventional forces and the

eli J^^a-^W3n of chemical weapons despite all the difficulties of

ver iri&amp;ac ion.

Mr GorbSrfchev&apos;s recent admission that the Soviet Union was engaged in

strategic defence research opened the possibility of reciprocal

arrangements concerning activity in that field.    She had argued to him

that the aim sbould be to create predictability and confidence on both

sides.    There/yslToy\ld be a requirement for negotiations before any

deployments to^k^Hrsce.    The Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty should be

extended, perhapjsrfon a further seven years.    During that period, each

side should infoxfer^Jre} other of the types of strategic defence research

on which it was en^a^^A

Her discussions with wr*^ ocbachev had been friendly and frank. His

attitude to this countryxv$  \clearly influenced by the fact that the

British Government had a &amp;\ihe first to recognise him as the rising man

in the Soviet leadershipjxgJwMte also was grateful for the Government&apos;s

expressions of support for        ^campaigns for perestroika and glasnost.

While the talks were continumgA^XBrize Norton, Mrs Gorbachev had paid

an extremely successful visit Cwa^ntearby school, where she had seen a

nativity play performed by the p^fpoLs^   As a former teacher, she had

visibly enjoyed the experience.    L6^ag_ satisfactory that her visit had

gone well, particularly in view of^^jMcal remarks about her in a

recent article in the British press, synj % had caused serious annoyance

in Moscow. \S

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had held talks at

Brize Norton with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr Eduard Shevardnadze,

and other senior members of Mr Gorbachev&apos;s psr&gt;Cyyi   He had pressed the

Soviet Foreign Minister again to co-operate \j^mj*y s towards an embargo

on arms sales to Iran, as a follow-up to Unitet^Na&quot;Mons Security Council

Resolution 598 concerning the Gulf war.    The Sow^Vlkiion accepted in

principle the idea of an arms embargo but was not/ydyceady to move

forward on this.    There had also been discussion of/*j jH^n rights, and he

had handed to Mr Shevardnadze new lists of personal ^a^v in the Soviet

Union where the Government was pressing for a resolutiop&lt;^Jt had been

provisionally arranged that he would visit the Soviet W&amp;zfiyin February

1988.    Mr Gorbachev would pay another visit to the Unit&amp;XJ^gdom in due

course.

&lt;&lt;

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Minister of

Poland, Mr Marian Orzechowski, had that week visited the United Kingdom.

The Government had renewed its efforts to persuade the Polish regime to

1 adopt more sensible economic policies and less illiberal ones in the

&gt;^olitical field.    The invitation to the Prime Minister to visit Poland

^rn. 1988 had been renewed.    That visit would provide an opportunity to

^^o/tinue to encourage Poland towards sensible reforms.    It would be

iy^P^cult to achieve much in this regard, but the attempt should be

wa&apos;mtaVned.

THE FOREIGN AND COMM^^^XTH SECRETARY said that the disputes that had

arisen during the tout ^fePakistan by the England cricket team were most

regrettable.    They could^^&amp;pect general relations between this country

and Pakistan and could o rt a^V\ the United Kingdom&apos;s international

reputation in matters conc^w^Vg sport.    But the difficulties were not

the responsibility of the Gxww^Jpent, which should not become involved.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARV^faid that the Chief Minister of

Gibraltar, Sir Joshua Hassan, had resigned.    He had made clear that his

decision had nothing to do with the arrangements agreed to the previous

week between the British and Spanish Governments about Gibraltar

Airport.    Sir Joshua Hassan had been Chief Myrfi-Siter for 34 years, with

an intermission of three years; he was aged f a4a wanted to rest. He

would be replaced by Mr Adolfo Canepa, his deptr^^Iiyr the past seven

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had received a visit f&amp;f&amp;X&amp;e French

Minister for Internal Security, Monsieur Pandraud, who nMdAk^ccibed the

arrangements between France and Iran under which two Frenc&quot;Jrj(dA ages had

recently been released from Lebanon.    He had been struck by\C&amp;p/yase

with which the French Government had been able to expel Iran^^^^^


opponents of the present regime in Tehran.    He expected more expulsions

of such people from France.    He had gained the strong impression that

France saw questions of this kind as matters of foreign policy rather

\ than of principled opposition to terrorism.

4.      T^tV^REIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting of the

Europea^cCounci1 on 4-5 December had been a business-like occasion at

which significant headway had been made.    There had been no sustained

attack on the United Kingdom abatement.    The Prime Minister and he had

made substantial progress in pressing the general argument on containing

the growth of /^gV^ultural expenditure.    The alliance with the Dutch had

been maintaineAorVaericultural stabilisers and the Commission had for

the most part aTary^s^npod firm on this issue.    The French move towards

the Germans had khjL^rpaduced a reciprocal German response and the

Franco/German concc^nLt Jiad come under strain and subsequent criticism.

On the structural tunef^rt had been possible, though only with some

difficulty,  to hold YifaMlQnded countries to levels consistent with

budget discipline:   it wool^be necessary to forge firmer alliances on

this issue before the F&amp;J^ksV meeting.

In discussion it was noted ti^w^Chancellor Kohl of Germany and President

Mitterrand of France had noc\bVe&gt;tl^prepared even to discuss the draft

conclusions tabled by the Dan^y/v^sidency on the second day and had

suggested instead agreement on * xstSternent of principles.    It had been

made clear in response that gener^r^pjinciples had already been agreed

at Brussels the previous June.    Towa^^s the conclusion of the meeting

Chancellor Kohl had somewhat dising^rrtaSfely suggested that there should

be a common presentation emphasisingjttap^io one country was responsible

for the absence of agreement and emphasising the commitment to work

together.    This had been followed by a^^&gt;ng and gloomy intervention by

President Mitterrand on the European prospect.    He had been reminded

that on a previous occasion an inconclusive meeting had been followed by

the highly successful settlement reached at FajEE^inebleau under his

chairmanship. \C (J

Looking ahead to the run up to the special Euroc^ajv^ouncil now to take

place on 11-12 February it was suggested that a ftr^K^/object ive should

be to detach the French from the Germans.    It vas^dfamle that at the

meeting the Germans might be prepared to give a 1 it*d^d&gt;r\ this was a

necessary price for a successful outcome for which tne Nse^rtnan Presidency

could take credit.
