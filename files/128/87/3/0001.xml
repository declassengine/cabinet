Deaths in ^

Hungerford

1.     THE HOME SECRETARY said that in the light of the shooting on

\ 19 August by Mr Michael Ryan of 16 people in Hungerford, he would

J/shortly be putting proposals to colleagues on changes to the firearms

,0^gislation.    He would also be bringing forward proposals to implement

jjfy Manifesto commitment for more effective arrangements to reflect

f/^^^ic concern over violence in the media.

Hotting Hill

Carnival

THE H^^^&amp;gfcRETARY said that that year&apos;s Notting Hill Carnival had been

a huge affair. For much of the time it had been reasonably peaceful, but

there ha^been one murder and towards the end of the carnival a great

deal of indiscriminate violence and rioting.    The Metropolitan Police

were currently considering what changes might be needed to the

arrangements airtp-yjsnue for future carnivals;  including the possibility

of a request t(dhiy to use his powers under the Public Order Act 1986 to

ban processionsS-^^Ptra\matter would require careful public handling and

he had already bdtn^/tr,.touch with a number of Members of Parliament

about this issue .^&quot;ttffaygb it was not yet clear exactly what changes

would be needed, he wi^^tnre that the carnival could not be allowed to

continue on the sameN^^^s hitherto.

THE HOME SECRETARY said thaf^2Vo* the 26 defendants whom the Belgian

authorities were seeking to bS^tf/t^ trial for offences committed in the

Heysel Stadium disaster had bee^^TC^essfully extradited to Belgium the

previous day. ^^/^

THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Home Office wa -i&amp;ontinuing the process

of notifying Tamils claiming political asylumMfnao) their appeals had

been rejected, and that they were therefore nov35o^ &amp;k permitted to

remain in Britain.    This process was being frustrfetefl) by the Tamils

immediately seeking leave to apply for judicial r^vj&amp;vf which in most

cases was being granted.    A hearing of the judicia^DB^H^w application

of six Tamils would take place in 24 September.    Thiv^rowrN be important

in establishing the Government&apos;s ability to implement^r }^licy of

returning to Sri Lanka Tamils who failed to qualify for^ frtj&amp;ee status.


Local

Educatrtjro^

Authority^

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the recent

controversy over the choice of primary schools of 26 children in

Dewsbury, Yorkshire had not been handled well by the Kirklees Local

\Education Authority (LEA).   The LEA had closed two temporary classrooms

the primary school for which the parents had a preference, thus

yfreatxicting the number of places available.    The parents concerned had

//^erased to accept places for their children at a primary school where

^W^r cent of the pupils were Asian. The Government could not allow

YtseXP to be drawn into the dispute as the Secretary of State was

enrayec&amp;d to intervene only where the LEA had acted unreasonably or had

beenY^breach of its statutory duty.    The press had generally taken a

help&amp;ol^i&apos;ine, particularly in pointing to the effects of the

Government&apos;8 forthcoming legislation in increasing parental choice. It

was by no means certain that increased parental choice would necessarily

lead to greater segregation in education.    But, whatever the case on

that issue, tbe-jiew national curriculum would be taught in all schools.

Accident on

M4 Motorway

THE SECRETARY OF ^jjfc&gt;FOR TRANSPORT said that an inquiry would take

place into the accytwpoon the M4 motorway the previous day in which

four people had died&lt;^Ljpvappeared to have been caused by a van

attempting to make a U^&gt;frk across the central barrier. The

Parliamentary Under Seqrafxany of State, Department of Transport, would

be discussing with the ehlfiig^Xcy services as a matter of urgency the use

of such gaps in the centr^i*^evervation.   Although this was the second

recent severe accident on tro rf ways, motorways remained the safest roads

in the country, despite the MfoM^terable increase in the traffic they

carried. ^Oovv

Coal Industry

Reference:

CC(87) 26.1

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY, s *a that, as he had predicted to his

colleagues, the National Union of Minaworkers (NUM) had voted in favour

of taking industrial action against the British Coal Corporation&apos;s (BCC)

revised code of conduct.    There was little new of substance in the code,

the necessity to codify existing practice hatP^jfcisen because of the

emergence of the Union of Democratic MinewoWkerV (UDM).    There were, in

fact, a number of points on which BCC would OB^Jr^Vared to see

modifications to the code, but it appeared tha\LjlTAAxthur Scargill had

not passed on to the NUM executive the notificat^pWthat he had had of

this through the Advisory Conciliation and ArbitraW^^Service. While

it had to be accepted that Mr Scargill had contriv jp\ ^force himself to

the front of the stage once more, there was anxiety in^jj&amp;ts of the NUM

that any disruption they caused might work to the betf&amp;ttt*&amp;  the UDM.

He had had discussions with the Chairmen of BCC and or\Xke/p ntral

Electricity Generating Board and would continue to keep ;EnJ^buiole

situation, including the question of coal stocks, under verV^ose

review.

FOREIGN

AFFAIRS

Situation in

the Persian

Gulf

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 20.4

&gt;^^E FOREIGN AND COMMONWEATLH SECRETARY said that there had been

con &lt;iuing and intense diplomatic and military activity since July

coi^gS^jmig the Iran/Iraq war and the resulting tension in the Persian

GulfS/pj&gt; elements in this activity had included continued diplomatic

efforr^to promote an end to the war and to limit the scope of the war

meanwhile, and moves to protect merchant shipping passing through the

Gulf.    The Government had also had in mind the need to contain as far as

possible the risk of confrontation between the United States and Iran,

which Iraq had^53ken seeking to promote.    On the naval side, there had

been a growir^ tqareat from mines in the Gulf.   At the end of July, the

United States^Arfjf^hpproached the Government with a request that British

minesweepers beUseWf-to the area.    The Government had not responded at

that time, partry^waorause of the risk of being drawn into a

confrontation betwaem^he United States and Iran.   The subsequent mining

of the Gulf of Oman^raa^psed a direct threat to British ships, and the

Government had thereroM^ecided in August to send minesweepers, which

would operate in suppog&amp;^wvthe Royal Navy&apos;s Armilla patrol in the Gulf

south of Bahrain.    The ^j^Wpnment had pressed other West European

countries to send mineswVejrere.    France and the Netherlands had decided

to do so.   Italy was expe&amp;e^Yo do so, and Belgium was likely to follow

suit.    On the diplomatic SM^/here was increasing recognition that it

had been a British initiative/rjHfKhad lead to Resolution 598 passed by

the United Nations Security Coun^^on 20 July.    Since then the

Government had been working to aip^in as close co-operation as

possible among the members of th&lt;&gt;5j * rity Council and especially the

five Permanent Members.    The GoverTl^MtJiad been encouraging contact

concerning the Gulf between the Unirad/States and the Soviet Union:

although the Soviet Union was seekingAto score points against the West

in its public statements about the Gurr, it seemed willing to co-operate

with the other Permanent Members of the Security Council.    The United

Nations Secretary General, Senor Perez de Cueilar, was about to visit

the area, primarily to seek Iranian acceptaoc&apos;ejaf Security Council

Resolution 598.    Iraq had complicated the syQ&amp;Sririm by its recent

resumption, after a pause following the adoptiim of the Resolution, of

attacks on shipping in the Gulf.    The Governmextt^aft made clear that it

would support an arras embargo against either ortydtty^i the belligerents

if they did not accept the Resolution.

The Government would maintain pressure through the Uni^e^sNations for

the acceptance and implementation of Resolution 598.   ^Siaxjut was

unlikely that Iran would fully accept the Resolution.   \ h&gt;^kr must

end some time, and in the long term, pressure, including^ e j&amp;ps by

means of an arms embargo, might help to bring about that CQjtej^ae. But it

was difficult to be optimistic.    Meanwhile, the United King^do^^Xs

playing a full part both on the diplomatic front and in the jj^otwc^tion

of shipping in the Gulf and was seen to be doing so. ^^^^&gt;


The Opposition had sought to criticise the transfer of Kuwaiti merchant

^ vessels to the British flag.    But the Government had made clear that

J^there had been no alteration in the existing law on registration of

^O^yips and that the Armilla patrol would continue to restrict its

^M^&amp;rations to the southern area of the Gulf.    There had thus been no

V^54|Oof applications for transferring vessels to the British flag.

THE^E^JiETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that the four British mine

count^&apos;jneasures vessels, which could both hunt for mines and sweep

them,&lt;r^2rtlvtheir support ships were now in the Red Sea on their way to

the GuDfi^^hey were due to arrive in Southern Oman on 14 September and

would ba^vailable for operations in the Gulf from 17 September.

Arrangements for shore support were being made with Oman and the United

Arab Emirates.    The vessels would operate in support of the Armilla

patrol and under its command.    Operations would be undertaken in

response to kno^-V suspected mine hazards.    Operations were likely to

start off Fujat^ahvAn the United Arab Emirates.    In Ministerial talks

with the Netherra^S^\\it had been agreed that British and Dutch

minesweepers woul&amp;jpzjV/undertake joint operations as such but that there

would be close co-ot^rtyation and that, where Dutch minesweepers operated

in close association w*^J^British minesweepers, they would benefit from

the protection provideg^o^the latter by the Armilla patrol. In

practice, the threat to tn^2|inesweepers would often be such as not to

require direct support fwra/fYi gates.    He hoped also to arrange

discussions on the co-ordlAaJ^AfK of national minesweeping operations

with France and with Italy lTj^fNrlian minesweepers were sent to the

Gulf.    There were also contaoAS^^^bh Belgium.    There was no prospect

that the threat from mines in^^&amp;/k^.f would disappear.    Iran possessed

large numbers of them and was sefij^&apos;na^ore.    Indeed, Iran might begin to

lay mines actually in the Straits o^Hwrmuz.    It would be helpful if

colleagues, when referring to these meters in public, were to point out

that the Armilla patrol had been in^rfi^Jilf area for a long time (since

1980) and had been very successful iiTaWorting British merchant vessels

in and out of the Gulf.    In 1987 the Arw^Ia patrol had so far escorted

over 200 British vessels in safety.

Hostages in

Lebanon

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said tha^rfje^taierican and the

West German hostages recently released in LebanonHjiadybeen unable to

provide information about the British hostages herd-^ft&amp;yre. There

appeared to be no substance in the various recent rumojiJ^^pn this

subject,  for instance on the whereabouts of the Archb\^fto&lt;6,oqf

Canterbury&apos;s Special Envoy, Mr Terry Waite.    The Governrnewp^ould

continue to seek information about the hostages through ^ j^pvssible

channels.    There had been reports that the release of the\S^_raJn, hostage

had been part of a deal involving reduction of the sentences~^&amp;^wrab

terrorists held in the Federal Republic of Germany.    The Fed^xay^arman

Government had denied this but had virtually admitted that the^eriftpaoy

I   that employed the released hostage had paid a considerable ransop X&apos;i$\

second West German hostage was still held in Lebanon.    The Governmejjr ^

would be urging the Federal German Government and also the French

4


Government not to depart from the agreed policy of refusing to do deals

with terrorists holding hostages.

CC(87) 26.2

/p^FORElGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the agreement reached

Mjy^t^dia and Sri Lanka on 29 July with regard to the Tamil problem had

Kd &gt;wa substantial improvement in the situation in Sri Lanka. India

wav^e^ftperat ing with Sri Lanka, and there was considerable optimism

abouly&amp;ne^prospects.    But the attempt on the life of the President of

Sri Lvw^a; Mr Junius Jayewardene, on 18 August had shown that there was

continuing disaffection, and Tamil militants had not abandoned the

ultimate aim of an independent state.    The agreement contained

provisions that Sri Lankan ports would not be made available for foreign

military use cen-trary to India&apos;s interests, and it was evident that

India wished/Vo ^xtend its influence.

Canada

THE FOREIGN AND COM^^ffiXLTH SECRETARY said that he had visited Canada

that week.   His discvss^d^ had been part of the regular prograumte of

British/Canadian consuLtxfrtVns but he had timed them so that he could

try to influence Canadar^a^proach to the chairmanship of the

Commonwealth Heads of GovS Mrf&amp;3t Meeting (CHOGM) in Vancouver from 13 to

17 October.    The press coy*fm&gt; of his visit had not focussed on CHOGM

but on British views regara^n^uie decision of the opposition New

Democratic Party in Canada toyB/re^ate that country&apos;s departure from the

North Atlantic Alliance and onx^he^uestion of the future of the

British/Canadian air services a^reera it, which was due to expire shortly

unless negotiations could produce^^^mpromise. In discussion of the

prospects for CHOGM, it had been dS^^ced that there was now much wider

recognition in the Commonwealth of tra^^rguments against applying

sanctions to the Republic of South Awca and of the importance of the

help being provided to the front line states in Southern Africa. But

there was a potential problem at CHOGM of pressure for some move by the

Commonwealth with regard to the internal situation in South Africa.

Denmark

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^pt^aeneral election in

Denmark on 8 September had produced a confusing si&gt;c  ^on.    The right of

centre coalition headed by Mr Poul Schluter had los^-reajs but the

left-wing parties had not secured a majority.    Mr Schlij^^vhad at first

resigned as Prime Minister but had now been requestedM^^fry to form a

new government.    A key question was whether he would se^ujpp^Ahe support

of some of the uncommitted centre in Parliament for his ge^c^es on

major issues.


Argent

Reference: /

CC(87) 15.3\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in the general election

\ in Argentina on 6 September the Radical Party led by the President,

&apos;/Or Raul Alfonsin, had lost control of both Houses of Congress and there

$^d been a heavy swing against it in elections for regional

^&amp;*v)ernorships.    The principal beneficiary had been the Peronist party.

^wtf/iA it was of interest that democratic elections had been carried out

^exe&amp;sfully in Argentina, there would probably now be greater

unc^^cMJity in that country&apos;s policies.

In di^tfa^n-on, it was noted that the debt problems of Argentina among

other c^Djm^ies would be discussed at the annual meeting beginning on

26 Septerff&amp;er in Washington of the International Monetary Fund and the

International Bank for Reconstruction and Development.

Value Added

3.    THE CHANCELLOR OF^^B^CHEQUER said that he did not now expect that

the Commission&apos;s proposal^^A. tax approximation would be substantively

discussed at the informa^^^aing of Economic and Finance Ministers on

12-13 September.    The CommN^s^0p J s Challenge in the European Court of

Justice to certain United Kin^(^b\zero rates of Value Added Tax - but

not in relation generally toN&amp;obtL^ was a separate issue, on which the

Court&apos;s judgment might be expeq^J^^J or about the end of the year.

Agriculture

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYwlfi&gt;that there was now clear

evidence that milk production in the Cowtwmity was responding to the

restrictive measures taken recently,  in particular during the United

Kingdom Presidency in December the previous year.    It seemed that

because of weather conditions the cereal surplus was also now likely to

be less than had been forecast earlier.

In discussion it was said that milk production TvaVKe 3\tainly fallen;

stocks of milk products had begun to decline and raie/jiblurae being

purchased by the intervention agencies was expected-^  )5e substantially

below the level of recent years.    The wet weather hafl/^^cted the

cereals crop, as a result of which it had been necessa^VMf^adjust the

standard for moisture content.    Intervention purchases weVe/^ikely to be

lower than had been expected before the harvest.

Food Aid

I  THE PRIME MINISTER said that a recent report of the Court of Aud/^^K

had shown a very unsatisfactory situation in the handling and condLfe^J^

I   of some Community food aid.    The report had drawn attention to some


v   cases where the food aid had been unsuitable for consumption or had been

n too late to respond to an emergency.    It was desirable that this should

followed up vigorously within the Community.
