(X^&gt;\HE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he had

awJ&amp;Jumied earlier that morning that he had accepted the advice of the

Dira^or General of Fair Trading not to refer to the Monopolies and

MerggS^^gommission (MMC) the proposed involvement of Scandinavian

Airliiros^&amp;stem (SAS) in British Caledonian Airways (BCal).    He had

taken Vvs decision within the existing policy that the issue of

competition was the principal criterion for references to the MMC. It

had been represented that the proposed merger should be referred to the

MMC on other public interest grounds.    That should be done only in

exceptional ci^c-wtastances, and in the present case the Secretary of

State for TraUspoVt already had powers under the Civil Aviation Act 1982

to revoke licerra^ &quot;&quot;Wben control of an airline passed out of British

THE SECRETARY OF STVwmW TRANSPORT said that the Civil Aviation Act

1982 required the C rta^V^i a t i on Authority (CAA) to inform him if it had

reason to believe that a^Stapany holding an air transport licence had

passed out of effect ivev^B^*tuksh control.    Should the CAA notify him to

that effect, he would beN^m^ayered to direct that the licence be

revoked.    He had that mornutfgOuileased the text of a letter he had sent

to the Chairman of BCal ina^&amp;c/aVirftg that,  if the CAA were to notify him

that effective control of BCa^llafKpassed out of United Kingdom hands

because of the purchase of a splJ^Ta^tial shareholding by SAS, he would

be minded to direct the revocatipty&amp;hjSCal1 s present licences and to

withhold consent for the grant ing of/flew ones.    His principal reasons

for taking this view were, first, Tg^E^f the CAA were to certify that

BCal had passed out of effective UnikadKjngdom control, overseas

Governments would be bound to take trre^ame view, and this could well

lead them to withdraw traffic rights rr^pm the airline, to the detriment

of United Kingdom civil aviation interests.    Second, he believed that it

would be unacceptable, and would distort competition,  for a private

sector British airline to fall under the conbr^Kof a foreign

state-controlled airline.    Third, British aicuin^s were not able to take

over foreign airlines on a comparable basis. ^5tfJ&gt;?3^b,  the proposed

involvement of SAS would not be in the in teres t^/o//Br itish consumers,

since SAS pursued a policy of charging high fares-^y&apos; a service which

was aimed predominantly at business travellers: zhMy^posed

arrangement would therefore run directly contrary c^/u&lt;^\povernment1s

policy of promoting cheaper fares and increased competition.    The terms

of his letter had been drawn so as to minimise the riag/jr^-vi successful

application for judicial review.    He understood that SA^vwa^e.now likely

to restructure their bid.    The rival bid from British AirV^s&quot;\emained


THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the Managing Director of

BCal was his son-in-law.    He had no financial interest in BCal or in his

y\ daughter&apos;s and son-in-law&apos;s financial affairs.    Nonetheless, he wished

V^to place on record that he had thought it right to take no part in any

^T^c^isideration of proposals affecting BCal, and that he would continue to

\^prfaid any participation in the matter.

TJJB&apos;T^IME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussion,  said that it was

claaf^v important that the Secretary of State for Transport should

concise to handle the matter in ways that were designed to reduce the

risks^o^^yudicial review to the minimum.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that negotiations between

the Post Offica/^ahagement and the Union of Communication Workers were

delicately balance^/    There appeared to be a reasonably good prospect

that a settlemen^^o 3^d be reached shortly on terms within the

negotiating 1imitfe^agyefid by the Ministerial Steering Committee on

Economic Strategy^S^Sjy-Committee on Public Sector Pay.    The threat to

suspend the Post Ofri/^mwiopoly had increased the pressure on the Union

to settle, and the UnTO*C vieadership were well aware of their members&apos;

vulnerability on this.    Tne-r^ had, however, been some industrial action

by local groups of posta ^w Hcers.

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SEC^^RX said that negotiations which

he and the Secretary of State for Tran4 &lt;$pr had conducted with

the Spanish Foreign and Transport MinisBArs had reached on the previous

day a conclusion which satisfied all the Government&apos;s requirements in

the dispute with Spain about the use of Gibraltar Airport.    This would

enable the agreement in the European Community  fl&gt;the liberalisation of

air services to enter into force.    Spain wouldMfe Consulted on the

future development of civil aviation at GibralK^s^-^IShe right of Spain

to fly services to and from Gibraltar had been rrf/ognised, in line with

the rules of the European Community.    A new SpaniVE^^rfhinal for

Gibraltar Airport would be established on the northvf^^ajkie of

Gibraltar&apos;s frontier with Spain.    Passengers to and i(r^srt&apos;xSibain would use

that terminal and would not go through British controfsTvDk should be

possible to gain acceptance for the agreement among the iraf^J&amp;tants  f

Gibraltar; but to minimise the risk that the package migh^ca/iEe them

dismay,  the Government would stress that no concessions haa^^j^onade

regarding sovereignty and that the package would enter into^( &gt;K^e2&gt;pnly

after the necessary legislation had been passed in Gibraltar vij&amp;Ahe

concurrence of the House of Assembly.    The Chief Minister of Gid/^^mt,

Sir Joshua Hassan, was being helpful. ^sy\ 


Spain had undertaken to move urgently towards the resumption of the

.   ferry service between Algeciras and Gibraltar and to reduce the delays

y\ to vehicles crossing the frontier between Gibraltar and Spain.

had discussed the general issue of Gibraltar with the Prime Minister

^ o^Spain, Senor Felipe Gonzalez,  in the previous week in Madrid. The

v^^rfSsh Prime Minister had seemed more relaxed about the matter than

l e/for)e\    This was important, not least because tension over Gibraltar

coM^aMjve negative effects on British trade with Spain.

In dig *rifgion,  it was agreed that the agreement reached by the Foreign

and CorotamW alth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Transport with

the Government of Spain was a valuable step forward.    The contents of

the agreement would be announced in Parliament that day in a written

reply by the Secretary of State for Transport.    If there was a need for

a statement as well, it should be made on Tuesday 8 December, after the

meeting of the /pra&amp;spovt Council of the European Community on

7 December.      (( V

Soviet Union

THE FOREIGN AND COMMoS^J&amp;D^ SECRETARY said that the General Secretary

of the Communist Party or\m Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, would

make a short stop in Bri k jPyn 7 December on his way to Washington for

the Summit meeting with tt&amp;Jtyks^.ident of the United States, Mr Ronald

Reagan.    Although the meeting^(3oJ.d be brief, it would provide an

important opportunity for th&gt;^.G yeVnment to reiterate its views on key

points concerning arms controi^w/mMi rights in the Soviet Union and the

problems of Afghanistan and the ^JHt \^

jpoland

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY^^^ld that there had been a low

turn-out for the referendum on economic^i^form and democratisation in

Poland on 29 November.    A majority of the low vote, but a minority of

those entitled to vote, had assented to the Government&apos;s position. This

showed the continuing lack of confidence betwea*p*he Government and the

people of Poland.    The Polish Government inter/aed ^hat reform should go

ahead but with some modifications and perhaps afc^ar^S^ywer pace.

Haiti

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the J^riS^ election

arranged in Haiti on 29 November, which would have been ^JrJ^fXrst for 30

years, had been cancelled because of widespread disruptid^r&apos;anja) killings.

Factions supporting the former dictator, Monseiur Jean-Clao-aj^pwalier,

had led the disruption, but the army had been slow in attemj^^g^t0

curtail it.    There were few British subjects in Haiti; one hav^&amp;/ri shot

in the leg. v^^\


Aircraft/

Crash ^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMON WEALTH SECRETARY said that a Korean Airlines

flight from Baghdad to Seoul had disappeared near the border between

Thailand and Burma on 29 November.    The wreckage had not yet been found.

\  There had been suggestions in the media that this crash might have been

?^caused by terrorists.    North Korea might possibly have been involved.

^Alternatively, the fanatical terrorist organisation known as the

^yjahanese Red Army might have been behind the crash.    There was no

C^atfjr&amp;ence that the crash of a South African Airlines aircraft near

4f ut^itius on 28 November had been caused by terrorists, but there would

ba^auggestions to this effect.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he had asked the French

Foreign Minister, Monsieur Jean-Bernard Raimond, on 30 November about

the arrangements surrounding the release of two French hostages from

Lebanon and tb^d^carture for home of a member of the Iranian Embassy in

Paris and a me^ibev of the French Embassy in Tehran.    He had pointed out

that it would a^rV ag~eAthe agreed policy of the European Community

countries of firUn_gXs^&gt;against terrorism if bargains were entered into

over hostages and s&amp;rfiAar matters.    Monsieur Raimond had evaded his

detailed questions, /tfw^mitigation of the French action,  it could be

argued that a loan r^g^wmyit by France to Iran had been due to take

place in any case.    There/J^s no point in public denunciation of France;

it would merely display^^S^Uyity among European Community countries. It

was also relevant that FKanj^^bad recently captured the merchant vessel

Eksund carrying a cargo of^MsV^lestined mainly for terrorism in

Ireland.    The Government snwaM/cV&gt;ntinue to reiterate its own policy of

not dealing with terrorists, ^hlVbAwas supported by public opinion; and

should continue to seek by evertf/pc&amp;sible means information about the

British hostages held in Lebanon .X!^^

4.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND IND^ST^ said that at the

Internal Market Council on 30 November there nSd^Sijsn discussion of the

Commission&apos;s proposals for a regulation which w(auldyapply to major

mergers with a European Community dimension:    a rh^tCsynold of 1 billion

ecu turnover had been suggested.    Like the French, wp^^iad taken the

lead in discussion,  the British Government had reacVjjd^ceptically

towards the proposal.    But it was important to be awareA)^the

Commission&apos;s existing powers to scrutinize mergers und^p^ArAicles 85 and

86 of the Treaty.    Recently British Midland Airways had\toadA/an

application to the Commission for them to intervene in the^ rt)Aosed

merger between British Airways and British Caledonian Airw^yso/sit did

not appear that the responsible Commissioner, Mr Sutherland^^^/keen to

take action in this case but there would be a desire on the paVf/A^


of the Commission to be more active on mergers generally, even if under

*   Articles 85 and 86 this was with retrospective effect.    In addition the

\\ Germans would be likely to push forward discussion on a draft merger

V^-cegulation during their Presidency in the first six months of 1988. He

 ^Osikreed with the Chancellor of the Exchequer that early collective

X^Lr^cussion to establish the Government&apos;s approach was necessary.

i European

i Council,

U-5 December

THE FOREIGN AND^COQMONWEALTH SECRETARY,   introducing C(87) 17,  said that

the agreements &gt;S^Ss\Fontainebleau European Council in 1984 had been

designed to securracjratrol of Community expenditure, particularly on the

Common Agriculturair^P^Acy (CAP).    But in important respects they had

proved ineffective:M^\^2tticular agricultural expenditure had risen

from  9 billion in 19^K&lt;oVv 19 bill ion in 1987.    The Fontainebleau

agreements had envisaged^h^ possibility of an increase in the

Community&apos;s own resource^^env 1.4 Value Added Tax (VAT) to 1.6 VAT from

1 January 1988; but this ^uLd/only be agreed by unanimity.    This gave

the United Kingdom the opporjjtfai^y to insist that before any increase in

the Community&apos;s own resource^o^uid be agreed there must be improved

systems of budgetary control jm&apos;jWd&apos;et a i 1 e d and binding agreements on

stabilisers for agricultural cowfat&amp;ifrv&amp;ies.    Any increase in the

structural funds must fall well Bho^-^f the objective for the doubling

of the funds injudiciously propose**! hy^President Delors.    The Community

was already spending beyond the lev^^-^feYesources provided at a 1.6 per

cent VAT rate, but it was important VhSy&apos;whatever new level of own

resources was agreed should be no moreC^^an adequate to meet legitimate

Community expenditure in 1988 and contiVnie on a level base thereafter.

The key issue for the forthcoming meeting of the European Council at

Copenhagen would be whether agreement could be reached that would

measure up to the British requirement for genuijt-e-v effective and binding

agricultural stabilisers, the most crucial beiYgtmose for cereals,

oilseeds and proteins.    It was valuable that tH^e^Brjt.ish approach was

shared by the Commission and the Netherlands.    ^ \Fn rj&gt; he was not

optimistic that such an agreement was within the%Ej^fipz the Council.

If it came about, then the Prime Minister and he wc* rT7v&gt;  able to

negotiate constructively on the other elements in thqyfawage.    If there

was a failure to reach overall agreement at Copenhage^&apos;i^ Vas important

that it should not be seen to be on account of a dispute^5j ^\ the United

Kingdom abatement - which remained of vital national imperafanMe - but

over the failure of other member states to face up to the^eB^tfious

problems of agricultural expenditure. vOv^s

In discussion it was said that, while the levels of agriculturay/^^-

expenditure would continue to feature prominently in public disWss^\

&lt;sy&gt;


it was important to get over to United Kingdom farmers that it was in

their interest for expenditure under CAP to be brought within control

V    since the alternative could be a breakdown in the normal funding of

)i   agricultural support.    While it would be necessary for the European

^^Council to concentrate on key commodities it was also essential that the

^&gt;\^Oouncil should set an intensive programme of work which would ensure

&gt;\^ nat before the measure implementing any decision on new own resources

^y&lt; ^agreed genuine and effective agricultural stabilisers for the

vremajjXing commodities would have been put in place.    It was important to

a^jaacl^ny of the agreements on agriculture at the European Council being

prqa^^o^al.

THE PMME/MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that it was

essentfkl that the European Council should tackle the unacceptable

levels cd which Community agricultural spending, both on internal

support and export subsidies, had reached.    The Government could not

compromise or cpjidone a fudge on this issue.    If other member states

recognised thit^amd were prepared to agree to the effective and binding

measures on agxicjwnture which the British Government regarded as

essential, then /yfT&apos;vifluld be possible for us to work towards agreement in

other areas,  inc&gt;l^d&gt;p^\ some additional expenditure on the structural

funds, though not tfry/C/ysmission1 s proposal for doubling of that

expenditure.    It was^J*  &amp;ntial to maintain the Fontainebleau abatement.

Given current levels ^yrvCcwamunity expenditure it seemed inevitable that

a new level of own resoujraA would have to be established at a rate

above that represented W/itOw per cent of VAT.    This would mean an

increase in the net Briti^ho^ertytribution after abatement which, compared

with  900 million now, cou^f \ r$e by over  150 million.    This would be

unwelcome.    So would the faM t^St in covering expenditure for 1988 it

would be necessary to accept ^fy^rfked for an increase in expenditure on

agriculture.    This is why it w^ud^d^ote essential for any overall

agreement to include fully effecg^veMseasures to stop the growth in

surpluses,  together with depreciati^f\of existing surpluses to wipe the

slate clean.    She was sure that sharj^ifrtf/the Foreign and Commonwealth

Secretary would have the Cabinet&apos;s fiJvL^acking in pursuing the

objectives in paragraph 13 of C(87) lt rid particularly for the stand

that they would be taking on the controu of agricultural expenditure.

If,  together with the maintenance of Britain&apos;s abatement, an agreement

on this could be achieved which met British requirements,  there would be

scope for agreement in other areas,  includina^tlm structural funds, and

to an increase in the own resources ceiling fcGffv^ient to cover real

1988 requirements. vC^y)

The Cabinet -

2.      Took note that the Prime Minister and the  #^^gn

and Commonwealth Secretary would be guided by the yy^

Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of the discussion for^^^yy,

the purposes of the forthcoming meeting of the Euro^eap^y

Council at Copenhagen. &lt;^v\v




5.      The Cabinet had before it memoranda by the Chancellor of the Duchy

of Lancaster (E(a)(87) 37) and by the Secretary of State for Scotland

(E(a)(87) 38), a minute by the Secretary of State for Defence dated

30 November 1987, and the minutes of a meeting of the Economic Affairs

^Sub-Committee of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Strategy

|^ield on 1 December 1987 (E(a)(87) 13th Conclusions).

CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that there was general

agreement about the desirability of early privatisation of the British

Steel Corporation (BSC), probably towards the end of 1988, possibly in

mid-1989.    He proposed to make a statement accordingly that afternoon.

The question was what this statement should say about the future of

Ravensar^^.    Following discussion at the meeting of the Economic

Affair^^^^Committee of the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic

Strategy^^W^on 1 December, he had discussed this with the Secretary of

State for^j^kjLand,  and they had agreed on three points in the statement

which shour&lt;j^ffem&gt; to reassure Scottish opinion.    First,  it would report

an assurance^|^^^e BSC that subject to market conditions there would

continue to be^B^^pmnercial requirement for steelmaking at Ravenscraig

for at least thJRA seven years.    BSC could not however give any

assurance about KDwels of output or employment at Ravenscraig during

this period.    Secofcj^ jbe statement would say that BSC had indicated

that,  if they should^tfH^ at some stage because of market conditions to

close their steelmaking facilities at Ravenscraig,  they would consider,

on a commercial basis, any wholly private sector offer for these

facilities as an alternative to closure.    Third, the statement would not

now say that the Ravenscraig hot strip mill would close:  it would say

only that BSC had decided on.q^^ercial grounds that all their present

hot strip mills,   including t = Wue n s c r a i g mill, would continue to

operate at least until  1989. ^fljjwould leave BSC free to take their

own decision after pr ivat isat io^^^mut the hot strip mills.    It was

accepted that they might then derjtf^wi close the Ravenscraig mill.

There were also three points of deta^^^kFirs t,  the draft statement

would not say that BSC would be privat Rdk 1 as a single entity&apos;. This

was to avoid drawing unnecessary atterrap^^ko the alternative

possibility of privatising BSC&apos;s Scotti ^tn^rests separately.    But he

had agreed with the Secretary of State forJ^mland that,  if he was

questioned on the point, he could confirm^iat BSC must be sold as a

single entity, and that separate flotation of its Scottish interests had

been examined but found to be impracticable.    Second, he still awaited

final comments from Sir Robert Scholey, the Chairman of BSC, who might

in particular want BSC&apos;s readiness to consider offera^or its

steelmaking facilities at Ravenscraig to be qualifApmMy the words

&apos;subject to their commercial interest&apos;  rather than^|^^|^:ds  &apos;on a

commercial basis&apos;.    Third,  the form of any assurance^BB^ given about

the future of the Dalzell plate mill still had to be ^s^^with BSC.

They would be prepared to give an assurance on Dalzell ^mi^r to the

one they had agreed for Ravenscraig steelmaking but weakw^^pfcraaps by

the addition of a word such as  &apos;probably&apos;. ^^ A*.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he agreed withmj%^^

statement as amended along the lines described by the Chancellw&quot; ojkthe


Duchy of Lancaster.    He thought that it should now be possible to

convince Scottish opinion of the case for privatisation and he was

grateful to colleagues for their help in taking account of Scottish

k sensitivities.

*%KE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the addition of a steel

^0^Lvat isat ion Bill  to an already very full legislative programme for

^the current Session would undoubtedly add substantially to the

difficulties of managing that programme.    He,  the Lord Privy Seal and

the Chief Whip had taken the view that the Bill was of such importance

to Government policy that it had to be accommodated in the programme for

the currmt Session.    But the consequences for management of the

prograApImist be recognised.    There would certainly need to be an

oversp^J^^kthe autumn,  and it could be the longest for 30 years,

perhaps &apos;^PG^be end of November.    There would be no reserve of time

available^kKifct unexpected emergency business had to be taken. The

Government \KilBhave to be prepared for accusations, especially in the

House of Loral^^^kat it was  trying to carry through legislation without

adequate time ^^^^ebate.    The business managers hoped that colleagues

would do all the^^H^d to minimise the difficulties.    They should keep

in close touch wi^^^^Kkbenchers to ensure that they fully realised and

understood the siz^anj^radical nature of the programme, and remained

firmly in support ofi^ff^ Colleagues would also understand that

additions to Bills which might be desirable in themselves might not be

practicable in the circumstances of the current Session.

In discussion, the following main points were made -

a. The draft statemen^Jk^^that BSC had decided to continue to

operate all their hot str^Bfcils at least until  1989. This

formulation would create a^u^^^bout the prospects after that

date,  not just of Ravenscrai^pum of the other three mills. There

was no question of closing tn\^a^nills in South Wales,  and this

could be made clear by means o^pKmance from the Welsh Office when

the statement had been made.    ThiflTC^ld increase the pressure for

reassurance about the prospects ft^^Efckenby,  but  there seemed no

way of meeting that without drawingkjurjter attention to the

greater uncertainties at Ravenscraig^^^^

b. Sir Robert Scholey&apos;s desire to qualify the BSC&apos;s readiness to

consider offers for Ravenscraig steelmaking by the words &apos;subject

to their commercial interest&apos; could be argued substantially to

change the sense of the statement on that point^fcand should be

resisted.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said 1^^%here was

general agreement on the desirability of the early prr ^^^:ion of BSC.

On the text of the proposed statement it would be bette^fo^j^he BSC&apos;s

readiness to consider offers for Ravenscraig s teelmaking^ftg^^kqual i f ied

by the words  &apos;on a commercial basis&apos;, rather than  &apos; s u b j e c tTtir

commercial  interest&apos;  as preferred by Sir Robert Scholey. TrK^W^rance

to be given on the Dalzell plate mill still needed to be agre^^fc^^i BSC

but it should be similar to,  though if necessary somewhat weaklr iAjj,


that already agreed for steelmaking at Ravenscraig.    Subject to these

points, and any minor amendments agreed between the Chancellor of the

Duchy of Lancaster, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of

-State for Scotland, the Cabinet endorsed the draft statement. The

^statement would also be made in the House of Lords by the Secretary of

^?% ate for Trade and Industry; the business managers should ensure that

^Jk^angements  for the statements in the two Houses were properly

^^o&apos;ordinated.    It was agreed that the Welsh Office could make it clear,

when the statement had been made, that the future of the two hot strip

mills in South Wales was not in question.    There should also if possible

be a statement to that effect from BSC.    Finally, the Cabinet noted the

warning by the Lord President of the Council about the difficulties of

managirw^^e current Session&apos;s business.    They agreed on the importance

of keep^M^Wckbenchers  in close touch with the Government&apos;s thinking,

and of av^fG^ additions to the Bills  in the programme so far as

poss ible.^^^^^

The Cab^fc&amp;L

1. Took n^KAwith approval,  of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up. ^^^^^

2. Noted that^^^^ements would be made in the two

Houses of Parliament that afternoon, by the Secretary

of State for Trade and Industry and the Chancellor of

the Duchy of Lancaster, along the lines agreed.
