1.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would be relieved to know

that the Lord President of the Council was in excellent spirits and was

making a good recovery after being taken ill earlier that week. She

invited the Cabinet to join her in sending him a card conveying their

PARLIAMENTARY

AFFAIRS

2^//Jw Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the House

of Cjjjrffjyjas in the week following their return from the Christmas

AdjotwJ^rnt on Monday 11 January.

Protection of

Offic ial

Information

Bill

THE HOME SECRETARY said that he had spoken several times, most recently

the previous Jyksyay,  to Mr Richard Shepherd MP about his Protection of

Official InforfcatWin Bill which was due to have its second reading in

the House of ComjWn&quot;s\\on 15 January.    He had emphasised the firm

commitment that Vmd y/liiy the announcement that week of the Government&apos;s

intention to publiajy^White Paper setting out proposals for the

replacement of SectLof ^&gt;of the Official Secrets Act 1911, with a view

to early legislation.^&gt;^t^as clear that a matter so close to the heart

of Government could not J^^^dlowed to go into Committee in the hands of

a Private Member, and hejvj^oyleft Mr Shepherd in no doubt on that point.

Any difficulties of denyx&amp;g^*&gt; v Bi 11 a Second Reading were far

outweighed by the dangers o^^^pwing the Bill to proceed.

Public Service

Pensions

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER sai^diat the Paymaster General would

announce the following day, by mear^SJ^a Written Answer, that the

Government would not be making paymetjof^ members of public sector

pensions schemes which it admin is texevSjto compensate them for the small

error which had recently come to lighten the calculation of the Retail

Price Index (RPI).    Compensation would have required computations to be

made of the sums owed to each beneficiary, according to their individual

circumstances, and the total cost of this exe^SX^, which would have far

outweighed the total amount of benefits whicnfwotyld have been paid out,

would have been prohibitively expensive.    It we^p^posed instead to

make the sum concerned available to suitable charj^trjfes,  including the

main public service benevolent associations actiV^Xui/support of retired

or needy members of the public services, and the Exxp^miar would

therefore not derive any benefit from the error in TOj*T&lt; vlculation of

the RPI. &lt; ^\

In discussion, it was suggested that it would be help the

interests of heading off possible criticism, for the WrictM^ftXswer to

give a clear explanation why compensation to public servicS p nayoners

would not be feasible. ^llss


The Cabinet -

Took note.

Prisons

^fLy THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Prison Officers&apos; Association (POA)

{yera^balloting their members on the possibility of industrial action in

pjfpteVt against the Government&apos;s plans for increasing the use of

civi-^ran staff in the prison service.    This was part of a sustained

camprjl^jyby a faction within the national executive of the POA,

incluoi ng^ts chairman, of opposition to the new Fresh Start working

arrangements.    The best estimate was that there would be a small

majority^in favour of industrial action.    He thought that,  in that

event, the POA would seek to re-open discussions with the Home Office

about the use of civilian staff in prisons.    The Government would need

to stand firm/^gajinst any pressure of this kind from the POA. The

ParliamentaryUUndUr Secretary of State, Home Office (the Earl of

Caithness) haa^T^dTsya very effective presentation of the Government&apos;s

position on thaiAsmpjAing&apos;s &apos;Today&apos; programme on BBC Radio 4.

Asylum

THE HOME SECRETARY saict^ rt\the House of Lords had ruled the previous

day in favour of the Gov^^n ep t in an appeal hearing in connection with

applications by six Tami Is &gt;-f^^olitical asylum in this country. This

was a very welcome decisional MJe&apos;SwouId now proceed, as quickly as

possible, to review individuj^Cwc-jich of the applications by Tamils who

had come to this country seekin^^Slitical asylum.

Unemployment

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 32.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the unemployment figures

for November would be published that day.   The seasonally adjusted total

had fallen by about 63,500 since October to atebt 2,649,000; this total

had now fallen for each of the previous 17 trfonthy.    Over the previous

12 months there had been the largest sustaine*I\r^3bction of unemployment

since records had been kept, with unemploymentfqavJne fallen by 300,000

over the previous six months.    Unemployment stoo&lt;K W9.5 per cent of the

working population and was now at the lowest leven^M&amp;e 1982.

Unemployment had fallen in all regions, with the larjgj^*p\reductions

occurring in Wales, the West Midlands and the North^eVt^^ Unemployment

among school leavers was 29 per cent below that in Noyj aJ&amp;&gt;-*r\ 1986 and

represented the lowest November total since 1979.    Unffjfrey/vacancies at

job centres stood at the highest level on record; this iKid^r^qred the

strong growth which had been taking place in the economy.\YI1pe/ nly


point of concern was that the annual increase in average earnings had

risen from 7V4 per cent to 8 per cent. Aside from that, the overall

position was extremely encouraging.

-*sA recent exercise by Department of Employment fraud investigators in a

Oqumber of south coast towns had indicated that more than one quarter of

/jiffrsons claiming unemployment benefits had simultaneously been at work.

 &apos;f&amp;pL supported other evidence that the &apos;black economy&apos; was well

(pe&apos;v^Toped in many areas.    Over the following few months he would be

g^Jmi&amp;Ngreater prominence to this, and his Department would be devoting

grear^^^efforts to tackling the problem.

THE CtfAH00,LOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that unemployment was now below the

averag^iof that in other European countries, and the reduction in the

rate of^ neraployment in the United Kingdom was greater than that in any

other major European country.    This provided further confirmation that

the economy was forging ahead vigorously.    Although there was likely to

be some reduc/^OTyvin the rate of economic growth during the following

year, suggestlipnsVthat the economy was likely to move into recession

were manifestly^yTTyfounded.    The main point of concern, as the

Secretary of St&amp;b^Q*) Employment had indicated, was the recent increase

in the growth of aV^Mg  earnings.

THE PRIME MINISTER, ^JjajO^g up a brief discussion, said that it was

important to get across fr^oublic opinion that the thriving British

economy not only br ougrffe^boht higher standards of living but also

provided the means by whS$cJx^frandards of social services could be

raised.

The Cabinet - &lt;sl/&gt;

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 36.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND T^pUSTRY said that it had come to

notice that, following a formal complaint by British Midland Airways,

the European Commissioner responsible for competition issues,

Commissioner Sutherland, had it in mind to \n&gt;*C %\to British Airways (BA)

and British Caledonian Airways (BCal) to infMrm &lt;jlhem that he was

currently disposed to think that a merger bebwe.e^~^bem would constitute

an abuse of a dominant position under the terai(^f/Article 86 of the

Treaty of Rome.    This action would create an exprt^We situation,

especially in view of the Monopolies and Mergers ComJ^eion report

clearing the proposed BA bid.    He had therefore spo^ejT^s^ Commissioner

Sutherland, who would only be able to exercise the rornra^&gt;functions of

the Commission under Article 86 after the merger was otfMMJ  \ed, to urge

him to refrain from precipitate intervention and, insteM_vytfa keep the

developing situation under review.    Commissioner Sutherlapx^Wowever,

tended to the view that, on the facts and legal advice ava^labjfa to him,

there was little doubt about the application of Article 86^^^no\

proposed merger, and that it would create far more trouble if/&amp;rt!\only


became apparent at a later stage.    Commissioner Sutherland, who was

active in the competition area and was promoting a new Community

regulation on mergers, stressed that he had been very strongly pressed

|   by British interests, and it had to be accepted that he could not ignore

/^formal complaints that were made to him.

...

,X^JHE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that the

(/^rtpean Commission&apos;s intervention in the way that Commissioner

({MtWeNrland had in mind would be a most unwelcome development, and the

Caj^nKt endorsed the line that the Secretary of State for Trade and

Indu^tryliad taken with the Commissioner.    It would be appropriate for

the ^SffliJMssioner to be informed that the Secretary of State had the full

suppowfr^p^his colleagues on this matter.

The^Cabinet -

2. Invited the Secretaries of State for Trade and Industry and

for TranartJo^S. to be guided by the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of

4.      THE FOREIGN ANrV^QfW^WEALTH SECRETARY said that recent reports

from United States and Sjp&lt;$2t sources confirmed that the recent meeting

in Washington between t5^^PtAsident of the United States, Mr Ronald

Reagan, and the General s&amp; ^?  ry of the Communist Party of the Soviet

Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev^vjTM been successful.    Not only had the

agreement on eliminating grourm^ased Intermediate Range Nuclear Weapons

(INF) been concluded, but coo^illeFjeble progress had been made towards an

agreement on 50 per cent cuts ip/iM. strategic nuclear weapons of the

United States and the Soviet Uniojp^OOn the other hand, the Soviet Union

had not made significant concesslcm^on human rights, and real progress

on the regional problems in variou^tfa^s of the world was still some

way off.    Since the Summit meet ing, J^fte^tjpited States and the Soviet

Union had commented sensibly in ways*&amp; signed to avoid an impression of

either euphoria or gloom.    The INF agreement was a significant

achievement.    It was important that the United States Senate should

ratify it.    The West should maintain pressure on the Soviet Union on

human rights and on regional issues, especiaW^&amp;fghanistan; there was a

remote possibility of a Soviet move towards withdrawal from

Afghanistan. ^&quot;^/^^\

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the candidate of the

Korean Government, Roh Tae Woo, had achieved a clear win in the

presidential election in the Republic of Korea on 16 December.    He had

I obtained 37 per cent of the votes in a 90 per cent turnout. As

[^ expected, the opposition candidates were challenging the result. If

Owtters were reasonably well handled in Korea, the new President should

^n^able to take over on schedule in late February 1988 without serious

j^JA^yrbance.

THE Rm$GJ AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the general election in

BelgiumVMi 13 December had left a confused picture.    The Flemish Social

Democratic Party led by the Prime Minister, Mr Wilfried Martens, had

lost six seats; but the centre right coalition led by Mr Martens could

theoretically re-form with a very slender majority in Parliament.

The Socialists^JSJk however, become the largest political group in

Parliament, aiMit^)was likely that a coalition including them would

eventually be ro&gt;rfj 3^v  This could take some weeks.

Foreign Affairs Council on lflK^fefcember had discussed how the review of

future financing would be carriAa^forward during the German Presidency.

These plans were now as well in^pLa^sXas could be expected.    There had

been agreement on the timetable fordiscussions in the Foreign Affairs

Council leading up to the special l* p g pn Council in February.    It was

accepted that the general basis of B^Zdssion should remain the

Presidency text tabled in Copenhagen,(^6 Agriculture Council would

have discussions in January on set asiire.    Permanent Representatives

would undertake more detailed work in certain other areas such as the

fourth resource.    It seemed that within the German Administration, the

German Foreign Minister, Herr Genscher, would have responsibility for

the preparations as a whole.    The Council had&apos;VfirVklly reached agreement

on the regulation covering radioactivity levexj^ vfr-*foodstuffs to come

into operation in the event of another major nuttear) accident.

Agreement had also been reached on the EC/Israe^v^Mc&amp;ation protocols,

in the light of an acceptable compromise on implen( fy^4pion by Israel of
