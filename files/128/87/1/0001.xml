THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the Wreck

&apos;y^amiesioner (Mr Justice Sheen) had the previous day submitted to him

Wle jre\(ort of the formal investigation into the loss of the Herald of

Fr^e EMerprise off Zeebrugge.    Mr Justice Sheen would be making the

repo^ ^u*blic the following morning, and he would then make a statement

to tfie^Jouse  f Commons in the afternoon.    It was important that no

Governs^m^comment should be made on the matter in the meantime. The

report &amp;(uld make a number of recommendations for action in the short,

medium and long term:  those for action in the short term were all

acceptable to him, and he was giving urgent consideration to the

preparation of the Government1s response to the other, more complex,

recommendatioiys^yShe report would expose defects in the present law

relating to fivAaesJj^to proceed to sea and it was now clear that, as he

had indicated onwfeyjous occasions,  it would be necessary to include

provisions on thi^-Bra^^Ver in the Merchant Shipping Bill for which he had

a place in the legi^nffjve programme for the present Session.    He would

consult the Lord Pre/r&amp;5 J. of the Council about this.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summu*j(  u&gt; a brief discussion, said that it was

important that the GoveMSrartrtAs response to the investigation&apos;s report

should be vigorous and de^is^J^s. and that all practicable action should

be seen to have been put in&gt;f&amp;mfc\as a matter of urgency. This

requirement was given added ^Am^m^ is by the fact that the report was

appearing in the middle of th^KicAijday season.    It was clearly right

that the defects in the law exp^^ovy the report should be repaired,

and the Secretary of State for Tr^jJ^pwt should consult the Lord

President of the Council about the &gt;ejressary provisions.

Invited the Secretary of State foreran sport to

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said^Sj^Othe United Nations

Security Council had passed unanimously on 20 July^^p^datory

resolution calling for a ceasefire in the Gulf war. V^EjJftVvwas an

important move.    It was the first time for many yearff&apos;tM^the five

Permanent Members of the Security Council had jointly ^ef&amp;qxed such

action.    There had been a substantial British input intd^rche/)

achievement, and he had taken the opportunity of the SecuV^Jy^Oouncil

meeting to pay tribute to the United Kingdom&apos;s former Pemarfe^tY*


Representative at the United Nations, Sir John Thomson, who had made a

considerable contribution to the launching of the resolution.

?yThe resolution might have concrete effects on the war, because the

^wrcumstances of its passing gave it particular international authority.

s^J/^aq was likely to react positively to the resolution;  its Foreign

/Minister was expected very shortly to visit New York to see the United

^sKi^ns Secretary General.    The initial reaction of Iran had been

dipffcZ&amp;kive, but might not be a definitive reaction.    The point of

decis^em had not yet been reached on the question whether there should

be a^ffl^Wier resolution in the Security Council about measures to

enforcNe/tb^ resolution of 20 July.    The United Kingdom could support an

arms enfelrfgo against any belligerent which did not comply with the first

resolutr^n.

The most important requirement in the immediate future was a cessation

of attacks on a^t&amp;ping in the Gulf.    The Government were doing

everything pos ib]($  to mobilise pressure for this on Iraq and Iran.

There was hopeN^ ?-5&gt;he message might have some effect.    Meanwhile, it

was necessary toUjpJw^d freedom of navigation in the Gulf.    France and

the United Kingdonrr^&amp;/well as the United States, were taking measures

to protect their shij/]fewg\in the Gulf.    So was the Soviet Union, which

had a frigate, minesw^^^ and trawlers in the area.    The first Kuwaiti

vessel flagged out to thV^j&amp;ited States, and travelling under escort of

United States warships, ^rad/vto far carried out successfully its voyage

through the Gulf.    The Ga^jariejit should continue publicly to reaffirm

that a number of countries&quot;~&quot;wrevupholding freedom of navigation and that

the belligerents in the GulKAws^r/should desist from attacks on shipping.

As regards the question of Ku^j^o^hips sailing under a British flag,

it was necessary to make clear tKaxCsrrangements for flagging and

reflagging were provided for unaer^f^tish law and were not a matter for

political decision or one which nVce#  rily carried implications

concerning military protection of tf&amp;^-j^sels concerned.    Kuwait had in

fact applied for the reflagging, as av&amp;eskire, of one vessel under the

flag of Gibraltar. Yr^

In discussion,  it was agreed that applications by foreign vessels to use

flags of the United Kingdom or dependent territories should not be

handled in a way which would encourage a rush jy &gt;applications.    it would

be necessary to check,  in the case of each such ap/plication, that there

was no other ship of the same name on the Brip S&gt;h^2&amp;gister and to be

sure that the applications were bona fide.    The (](aw/on the procedures

for registration could not be altered without thV-ej^^ent of Parliament.

The Armilla patrol of the Royal Navy in the Gulf wxs/ptfp ating

effectively and could not be increased in size. X^\Vs.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that France was engaged in a

dispute with Iran concerning the behaviour of Iranians in France, which

was in some ways similar to the United Kingdom&apos;s recent dispute with

,/\Iran but involved additional complications.    He was in touch with the

Ottome Secretary about the implications of a bomb attack on 18 July in

*vL&lt;rt&gt;don on an Iranian, who had been Minister of Agriculture in the time

&apos;/dvz&amp;.e. Shah, and of the shooting on the previous day of a Palestinian

b^Li^ed to be a critic of the present Iranian regime.    The one official

whp^&gt;rSa been left in the British Mission in Tehran after the recent

wirhd^wal of the rest of the staff had now returned to London, at least

tempM*a^D.y.

In discission,  it was noted that there was no clear information so far

on whether the Iranian authorities had been behind either of the

terrorist incidents, but they were known to be interested in activities

of this kind.    Officials were considering the arrangements concerning

visas for Irani^S&amp;vto visit Britian, which might be tightened; and

whether there rwere(^other measures which might demonstrate British

seriousness to^J-^jJ-fvNsuch as action regarding the Iranian airline

Iranair or the Ir^mLan-of f ice in London concerned with arms purchases.

It would also be iretS^ary to review the numbers of Iranians resident in

Britain, distinguisnrag^s far as possible between supporters and

opponents of the pres^fxOs^sgime.

Portuguese general election on 19 July, achieving the^r^rsk overall

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the discussion of arms

control during the Prime Minister&apos;s visit to Washington on 17 July had

been followed on 22 July by the Soviet Union&apos;s acceptance of the Western

iposition that a ban on longer range intermediate nuclear weapons should

vke global.    The Government should ensure that this was seen as Soviet

^wceptance of a United States proposal.

 ^mK^RIME MINISTER said that her visit to Washington had been valuable.

wfeJpui discussed arms control, the Arab/Israel problem, the Gulf war,

Mo^kmh^ue and economic matters including protectionism with the

Pres^rf^jifev Mr Ronald Reagan, and with other members of the

Admin^^Jyation and with senior members of the Congress.    She had given a

number^^E^nterviews on United States television, and had attempted to

persuada^he media to focus on other matters than the hearings in the

Congress^bout the sale of arms to Iran and the diversion of funds to

the Contra rebels in Nicaragua.    President Reagan had assured her&lt;l that

he would not conclude any arms control agreement which was not fully in

accord with We^erA interests.    The United Kingdom&apos;s relations with the

United States ^djtts reputation there were currently very good.

THE PRIME MINISTER sa# ^&amp;t the Prime Minister of Jamaica, Mr Edward

Seaga, faced difficulties&lt;^*  ause the previous Government had left

behind a very serious emn^M situation.    Mr Seaga had taken major

measures,  including devaTyjU^pav and increases in food prices, to correct

the situation.    The worst wa^^^bably past, but the question was

whether there was long enougK^m&gt; ll the next election, due by the end of

1988,  for Mr Seaga&apos;s policies^mAitow results.    During her visit she had

visited the Police Academy of J^ja^iSk and had seen the impressive

efforts that were being made to c&lt;ejJ(&amp;aNP.drugs despite great difficulties.

She had announced a new loan of  /.5^rillion to Jamaica.    Since her

return, she had asked that the ques^rtfiw^f providing aid in the form of

grants but in lower volume should be frontier ed, and this was in hand.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that colleagues were expressing different views

on the question whether there should be an immediate substantive

announcement about the funding of space research and development. The

European Space Agency was looking for an increase in members&apos;

^contributions to its work.    Colleagues had not considered that it would

^paoright to give up other priorities in order to increase expenditure on

^iicfi.    Officials were currently engaged in discussions on the programme

air^nrnding of the European Space Agency, and needed instructions. The

rece* s\decisions on the co-ordinated consideration of priorities in

rewar^ and development,  including the setting up of the Sub-Committee

on SQ^ljyatfS and Technology of the Ministerial Steering Committee on

Econo^Jw/^rategy (E(ST)) under her chairmanship, had been welcomed. It

would ^ ^&amp;Kisistent with this approach if no final announcement of the

Government&apos;s position on space research and development were made until

E(ST) hau looked at the issues after the Summer Recess.    In discussion

the following points were made -

a. Befcroeme Election Ministers had considered a variety of

options D^ y&amp; *ce policy.    It had been argued that the Government

should seri pslTjconsider a course which would involve increasing

Government e^jrM ^ture on space by up to  100 million in 1990-91

(option 3).    ^^^5&gt;*^h some small amounts of money might be found by

the reordering e&amp;JpC^rities and from contributions by industry, it

did not seem lik^^XtVat these would be anything like sufficient to

make that course pnjM&amp;Vf without additional total spending on

research and develowi  nu4   In these circumstances there was a case

for an announcement Xh^P^jJtaat there would be no increase in the

British contribution t^xtteoEuropean Space Agency, in order to

clarify the situation r^ehrwofficial discussions with the Agency.

b. It was important that^^wh^ifcher or not there was an immediate

announcement, there should b^ffoXindication that the Government was

reconsidering the matter or th^^any further public money would be

found. ^V^/

c. It was some time since the Imi discussion of this issue by a

Ministerial Committee and in the mlyantime E(ST) had been set up and

some private sector money had been identified.    The present

instructions stood, but it would be wrong to make an immediate

public announcement,  so soon after announ^*^g the new co-ordinating

machinery. {( v

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, iat there was no

change in the United Kingdom&apos;s position on the fu W of space

research.    Officials engaged in discussions with tna/^fe&amp;pcpean Space

Agency should be so instructed.    Before any final pu^p^Twinouncement

was made about the United Kingdom&apos;s future contribution^rf^the European

Space Agency, the Government&apos;s policies on space and thjK^sOSurces to be

committed to space research and development should be lo&lt;&amp;ie?)a  by E(ST)

and a meeting should be arranged for the early autumn. /sZC\\

5.      The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the

Exchequer (C(87) 13) on Economic Prospects and a memorandum by the Chief

Secretary, Treasury (C(87) 14) on the 1987 Public Expenditure Survey.

^THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the economy was now stronger

^han it had been for a very long time.    In particular, growth that year

0^^ld be closer to 4 per cent than the 3 per cent predicted at Budget

time, although it would be wrong to plan on the assumption that it could

be sustained at that rate.    But, while general prospects were good, the

markets were nervous about signs of overheating in the economy, and it

was important not to increase their concern by departing from policies

of prudeja^ and caution.    As to public expenditure,  it was essential to

ensureAtVaB the proportion of public expenditure to Gross Domestic

Produc^^^p^should continue to fall,  particularly if the Government

were alsj^^^chieve the important objective of reducing the burden of

non-North^^^^cation as a share of GDP.    While the proportion of

public expe^it^g to GDP had been falling since 1982, it was still

above the lev^^pfce Government had inherited in 1979.    This objective

might allow soWejJ^rease in the planning total, but  if that it happened

at all it shouldRrffcept to the absolute minimum.

THE CHIEF SECRETARY,^p^SURY said that the Government&apos;s objective,

based on its Manifesto commitment, must be to ensure not only that the

level of public expenditure should be held as close as possible to the

existing planning totals, but also that its share of national income,

without allowing for privatisation proceeds, should not exceed the path

in the previous year&apos;s White Puer.    This objective had already been

made harder to achieve by inAraaes in local authority expenditure,

demand-led increases in soci^Jea^r ity spending especially, and recent

policy decisions which would r^flPmepar tmental expenditure. The

additional bids which he had nol^Ra^ved could not possibly be afforded

within the commitment. ^F^M

The Government would therefore be fl^K^ith difficult decisions. No

area of expenditure could be exempt f^^SA^rching scrutiny.    The bids

for education, health and defence woul^Pfc3^ to be scaled down. The

demand-led increases in social secur ity^owjo prospec t were very large,

and offsetting policy changes should be ca^^^red.    As  to employment

expenditure, the welcome fall in unemployment should make significant

savings possible; but they were largely offset by the results of

demographic changes and increased take up of benefits of claimants.

Spending on regional policy should be reassessed to see if resources

could be released for the Inner Cities.    TerritoriaMfcxpenditure should

be scrutinised.    The bids made  for the na t ional ise^m^us tr ies were

unrealistic.    With the exception of electricity,   tfflK^^sion must be

held to baseline or below,  and for electricity it mus^^^as  low as

possible.    Stringent financial and efficiency targets^ ^^ set for

As to running costs, he proposed that their share of total W&amp;J 

spending should not rise above the Survey period.    This was^dWkstent

with an  increase of about  1 per cent a year in real terms; bu^^fcijfik was

an increase across the board, not an entitlement for individual&apos;^J^


programmes.    The objective he proposed would require efficiency gains of

at least 1.5 per cent a year in the use of all resources including

manpower, which could be achieved only by careful planning in advance,

by means of the management plans over the full Survey period suggested

kin his paper.    It also meant that the bids received for 1988-89 would

^ave to be reduced by about half.

^n^discussion the following main points were made -

a. The Government had followed a consistent policy of financial

prudence and firm control of expenditure.    This policy had produced

a strong and successful economy and had been endorsed by the

electorate.    There could be no question of departing from it now.

More Mkjrticularly,  it would be wrong to make permanent increases in

expAmMire on the basis of a rate of growth in output which might

pr ov^Jr^korary.

b. Cu%(^fl^uneasiness in the markets about credit conditions and

the traddttaMnce would make it especially unwise to adopt measures

which they^^^pfcl see as a change of course.    The previous year the

markets haa^mMbted a substantial  increase  in the planning totals

without diffi^dfl^   They were unlikely to take such a relaxed view

that year.    AdW|3aciarket reaction could have damaging effects,

for example on  tMKt rates.

c. There was much to be said for concentrating on the biggest

programmes (not excluding the demand-led programmes like social

security) in the search for the reductions necessary to achieve the

Government&apos;s objectives.    I^jfould then be easier to take a less

stringent view of smaller4KVrammes which could bring political or

economic benefits dispropo\pjo^^e to their size.

d. The proposed increases security expenditure resulted

almost entirely from es t imat ing|^h ge s and demographic movements.

Offsetting policy changes were M^Ke, but would be extremely

unpopular.    On the other hand, not^^l^the right time for

considering such changes, which couQ^^kstantially increase the

Government&apos;s room for manoeuvre. ^^X^^.

e. During the Election the Governinent^R^stressed how their

successful management of the economy had made it possible both to

raise expenditure and to reduce taxes.    Commitments given then

indicated the need for higher expenditure in some areas. Moreover,

some expenditure in desirable areas could be regarded as

investment,  since it could bring a substantial r^tffc1 in extra

receipts.    All these considerations pointed to llAlmortance, as

the Manifesto had said, of deciding and concentra^J^Jwi priorities

within the general objective. ^ft^^

f. Running costs posed a particular problem.    Furth^^^Auctions

in Civil Service numbers without a corresponding reductaKS

functions could lead to a deterioration in quality of selJQj^

More dispersal  from London might be one way of containing


technological developments should help to reduce some of the

obstacles to dispersal in the past.    Recent studies had suggested

that there was further scope for improving efficiency of management

^        and getting better value for money.

^ g.      At present, all spending by local authorities was included in

the planning total,  although the Government had little control over

^ it.    The case for including only Government grants to the

authorities within this total should be reconsidered.    The general

review of local government finance provided the opportunity for

such a reconsideration.

THE PRAM^LNISTER,   summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet

endorse%KJj^^roposals by the Chief Secretary, Treasury.    He should now,

as propoS^W^onduct bilateral discussions with spending Ministers in

the usual^^^^^teinst the objectives which had been agreed.    She hoped

that these dKc sions would be able to reach agreement.    If that proved

impossible,  S^^^J^ld at  the appropriate time establish a small group

under the chairajp[y.p of the Lord President of the Council, which would

consider outstan ^^%Lssues and make recommendations to the Cabinet.

Meanwhile,  in rep^^tcBwuestions,  she would explain that the Cabinet had

discussed public e^ejJfcture,  that they had reaffirmed the policy that

public expenditure s^oula continue to take a declining share of national

income, as set out in the last Public Expenditure White Paper, and that

within that constraint the Chief Secretary, Treasury would hold

bilateral discussions in the autumn.    Questions about the possibility

that the planning totals might^^t be held would require very careful

handling.    It would be necesAe^rato emphasise the Government&apos;s

determined adherence to stric^J|ad^prudent policies.    Other members of

the Cabinet should adhere stri^H^^^&gt; this line in any outside contacts.

The bilateral discussions shoula^|5i Arried on in confidence and,  as all

Ministers had agreed,  it was essei^Ta* that there should be nothing on

which the press could base speculaolfc|^ktories of Ministerial

disagreements. ^^W&amp;

The Cabinet - ^^^^L

1. Took note, with approval, of the^^^te Minister&apos;s

summing up of their discussion.

2. Approved the proposals in C(87) 14, and invited

accordingly. A^^k

3. Noted that the Prime Minister would,  if n^K^B^,

establish a small group under the chairmanship

Lord President of the Council to consider any ^^^^k

outstanding issues  in the autumn and make recommen amicjA

to the Cabinet.
