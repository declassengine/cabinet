1.      THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the House of Lords had that day

upheld by a majority of 3-2 the Government&apos;s interim injunctions against

The Guardian, The Observer and The Sunday Times preventing them from

publishing material from Mr Peter Wright&apos;s book Spycatcher.

Action

THE SE^^^RY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that,  following the

Civil advice pay settlement,  firm action would need to be taken to deal

with resvdual industrial relations difficulties in local offices and the

local office computer project.    This could lead to some localised

industrial action.

Local

Authority

Manual Workers

THE SECRETARY OF STA^^^^THE ENVIRONMENT said that local authority

manual workers had been Tyj^red pay increases averaging 10.6 per cent.

This was an unacceptablj^^fetivoffer, especially since the conditions

originally designed to in&amp; gA&amp;&amp; productivity had been heavily watered

down and that costs had alrt^oWobeen inflated by manpower increases of

0.75 per cent over the prev\5ouvjnear.    Part of the problem was that

contracts of employment were ^ra^ftife, and there was national pay

bargaining.    This episode gave jempfn&amp;eis to the need for the community

charge.    Once this was in place, a^Sgs larger proportion of the

population would have a stake inT^ee^jJ&amp;g down local authority costs.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he expected to

receive within the next two weeks the advice of the Director General of

Fair Trading on whether he should refer to the^frariopolies and Mergers

Commission the proposed merger of British Cal/swnian with British

Airways.    The correspondence he had received X2J5^3J nly divided for and

British Coal Corporation&apos;s (BCC) proposed code of conducrv_/6^ xpected

that the NUM would vote in favour of industrial action whi^p^LVht lead

to a work to rule or one-day strikes.    The propaganda whicn\Sb/ vl(UM

executive had issued against the proposed code had been highry-^^^.


misleading.    BCC had written to each miner explaining the code and

seeking to allay the concerns which had been aroused.    The Union of

V  Democratic Mineworkers had accepted the code and had stated that they

TH^K)Hj  SECRETARY said that the Minister of State, Home Office

(Mr&lt;&amp;*pJr y) had been considering afresh the cases of Tamils from Sri

Lanka&apos;wM) had arrived in Britain the previous February and claimed

politira^^sylum.    There was a risk that,  following their disorderly

behaviocAat airports earlier that year, airlines might refuse to carry

any of tnose who might not be allowed to remain in Britain.    There was

also a risk that action by the Government might be subjected to judicial

review.    He was^u^ently considering options for dealing with the

problem. ttl)

CC(85) 20.5

THE HOME SECRETARY s^G^jhat he wished to give his Cabinet colleagues

advance notice of one^p&apos;o&amp;fl^.that might attract attention during the

Recess about the extradif^w*&quot;yproceedings involving a number of British

citizens allegedly invof^erm the Heysel Stadium disaster. The

extradition request agaiiv^fc^frp^ee defendants had been based on charges

of manslaughter; but it nov^^ree^red that the Belgian authorities might

wish to pursue other charges^t&amp;affast them.    That would represent a

breach of the United Kingdom&apos;^exj^adition treaty with Belgium.

The Cabinet -

1.      Took note.

Abolition of

Domestic Rates

(The Community

Charge)

Previous

Reference

CC(87) 21.2

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said that the Ministerial

Steering Committee on Economic Strategy, Sub-Qf&gt; 3Kttee on Local

Government Finance had that morning agreed ttwt ivtes should be phased

out and replaced by the community charge over^aA^emNyear period in

England, with the charge starting at the level (^twAQ.    The safety net

that would be necessary to moderate the impact or~T^aytransition on

local authorities and on charge-payers would be phaag&amp;^H1- over s&amp;me

four year period.    In Wales the transition from rate-^J\0^he community

charge would be effective immediately, but the safety nejxGould be

phased out over four years, as in England.    He and the &lt;&amp;j ^eOkary of

State for Wales would announce these decisions by way ofvjjr^fe. notices

that afternoon.    The press notices would emphasise three pr^M^irguments

in favour of the Government&apos;s proposed system, embodying th^&amp;bjpaunity

charge.    These were that the community charge was more wider^^Ase^, and

thus more equitable, than rates;  that a high proportion of loc^f^jX


authority expenditure would continue to be met by the taxpayer through

j  central Government grants that took account of local needs; and that the

/^ame level of local authority service, delivered with the same

&lt;Twficiency, would lend to the same community charge in any area. High

^rt&amp;imunity charges would thus be seen to be due solely to extravagance or

 ^^^ficiency by the local authority concerned.

Education

Reforms

THE SEgOT^RY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE said that the

consultative document he had recently issued on the core curriculum had

been weP^ received; that concept was generally very popular and there

was also a considerable degree of bipartisan support for his proposals

on financial delegation to schools.    The consultation document on

grant-maintain^P^chools, on which responses would be requested by

30 September, raighyr meet with a more mixed reception.    The preparation

of instructionV-^^P Yliamentary Counsel on the Education Bill were,

however, on cours^^a/id he remained confident that the Bill would meet

the date that had TSp&amp;ti/planned for its introduction.

THE PRIME MINISTER stt&amp;An^f: it was important that members of the

Government should ensureM^l^t the initiative was retained on the

Government&apos;s major polic^tg^diuring the holiday period.    In particular,

the strong arguments undeHN^xij/jxthe Government&apos;s proposals on the

community charge, education _^jftfvv.ousing should be pressed home

vigorously.    The Cabinet wou^dv^Aticularly wish to congratulate the

Secretaries of State for the ^yn/p ment and for Education and Science

for their success in co-ordinat^ng^aQsi the work that had been necessary

to enable a series of important da^^UDns to be taken on the Bills for

which they were responsible, so tnat^enrk could proceed on preparing

this legislation during the Recess .C^rt^ftad been a major achievement to

follow up the General Election by sucTy4wj t and effective action.

The Cabinet -

2.      Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s remarks and

recorded their congratulations to the Secc^E^ries

of State for the Environment and for Edua/tiqp

2.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that eement

concluded on the previous day by the President of Sri L^ffer^lr Junius

Jayewardene, and the Prime Minister of India, Mr Rajiv Gawhj//

concerning the Tamil areas of Sri Lanka, had been endorsed^bj^^M. the

Tamil groups except the extremist group known as the &quot;Tamil \Mgifera&apos;.

There had been some adverse reaction among the majority commuKi^^/af

Sinhalese in Sri Lanka^ Reading to some rioting and a few deatns//^Tfte

attempted attack by one of the Sri Lankan guards of honour on Mr Gaxunfy.

had attracted wide attention.    The essence of the agreement was ty^^


for a ceasefire and to provide for a degree of self-rule in the northern

province of Sri Lanka, where the Tamils formed the majority, and in the

eastern province.    The agreement was subject to a referendum by the end

) of 1988 in the eastern province, where the Tamils did not comprise a

tThe British reaction should be to welcome the agreement, even

t was by no means certain to be carried out successfully. There

a suggestion, supported and possibly initiated by the

alth Secretariat,  for some Commonwealth role with regard to the

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that a new Italian

Government had been installed, led by Mr Giovanni Goria of the Christian

Democratic Vavfyf^yk former Finance Minister and the youngest Prime

Minister of IR^J^rSs-ince the Second World War.    Two major figures,

Messrs Craxi and*/ae~M\j.ta, were not in the Government, but there were

some familiar fafi^ op*fctably Mr Amintore Fanfani as Minister of the

Interior and Mr Gii^^^Ajdreotti as Foreign Minister.    The new

Government was not e^jwJarfJXd to last very long.

Arms Control

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 20.4

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALT^^^ETARY said that the United States

Secretary of State, Mr George Vbjfttz, and the Soviet Foreign Minister,

Mr Eduard Shevardnadze, wouldvm |rtO!.n September.    This was a consequence

of progress recently made in th^fieVk^iations between the two countries

on the elimination of their intecaj &lt;frKte range land based nuclear

missiles.    A summit meeting between^Jfe United States and Soviet leaders

might take place before the end of^jf^^to conclude an agreement. The

major remaining question was whether Ype^/j^ershing lA missiles of the

Federal Republic of Germany would be cohered by an agreement. This

obstacle was unlikely to prevent the conclusion of an agreement.    It was

a matter primarily for the Federal Republic and the United States to

resolve, and the United Kingdom should not play a prominent role.

Iran/Iraq War

Previous

Reference:

CC(87) 25.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that^T^r^iad responded to

the resolution calling for an end to the Gulf War, wfjfcrawiad been passed

by the United Nations Security Council on 20 July,  o^^kj^ging in

contacts with the United Nations Secretary General.    Irau^^reaction had

been unfavourable, but had stopped short of actual reje^^^tw)f the

resolution.    The United Kingdom should help to maintain X^e^hessure for

further discussions about implementation of the resolution^wjrt^

indicating a prospect of British support for a further reso\&amp;Nlp*\

imposing an arms embargo if that became necessary.    It was h #p^/Lvthat

pressure for a cessation of attacks on shipping in the Gulf se^m^d^o^ be


having an effect, although there was the notable exception that the

\ Kuwaiti tanker Bridgeton,  flagged out to the United States and escorted

y^y the United States Navy, had hit a mine in the Gulf.    The absence of a

 yOlJ^nesweeping capability was a serious hindrance to the United States

yZPJfyy i  the area.    There had been reports that the United Kingdom and

^Qap^f countries might be asked by the United States to provide a

^nesweeping capability.    Ministers would need to consider this rapidly.

Th ^e ad been no flood of applications by Kuwaiti ships to be placed on

the sapping registers of the United Kingdom or dependent territories.

IncI^jSrfJJy on the registers, which had to be allowed when the stated

CTitervarv&amp;te met, did not imply any greater protection than the Armilla

patrol MB already providing to British vessels in the southern area of

the Gulf&amp;

In discussion,  it was noted that the most important consideration

regarding the 0&lt;jO\was that this important international waterway must

be kept open, ((^f Vran were able to close it, there would be devastating

effects for theSJ&amp;6^rts\and its oil supplies.    The United States had

decided, after be\iri / iticised by Gulf countries for failing to counter

the Iranian threacT^^jipping, to keep the waterway open by the use of

the United States f\av/p y$he waterway had so far been kept open. The

Government should conC^^^^fe on exerting pressure against attacks on

shipping and should not cx^jXcise the efforts which the United States

was making.    The longer i^J^W  of securing an end to the Gulf War

should also be pursued. v^/A*

Minister&apos;s

Discussions

with the

French Prime

Minister

3.      THE PRIME MINISTER said that in hS^r^is cuss ions with the French

Prime Minister, Monsieur Chirac, on 29 JBily he had once again argued

strongly the case for the introduction of a Community oils and fats tax,

on this occasion praying in aid the supposed needs of Spain and Portugal

stemming from their accession.    The French Mini 3^x of Agriculture,

Monsieur Guillaume, had argued similarly whenfae irat the Minister of

Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on 28 July.    TivSyPfl^ Minister had made

it clear to Monsieur Chirac that, while she recotnis/fl the importance of

domestic political considerations, she saw no futW^w pursuing the

idea of this tax; it was economically and politicaNT^^^conce ived and

in particular paid no attention to the needs of conswwX In her view

discussion of the tax at the December European CouncirwwaJ&amp; detract

from the main purpose of that Council, which was if poss^W^sAo reach

agreement on enforceable financial discipline for the CoiMmuAfy.

including effective control of its agricultural expenditure-^etfVB base

for deciding what reasonable increase in the Community&apos;s owfyveyejwrces

would be justified. V^//&gt;\


THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that in Copenhagen on

24 July he had also pressed the Danish Prime Minister, Mr Schluter, on

J  the same lines.    We would need to continue to counter these arguments in

&apos;^iiscussions both with the French and with the President of the

^C mmission who still appeared to be committed to the tax.    The United

y/&amp;i.pg6.om could usefully make the point that recent experience on beef and

^jrt/ot^products showed that action to modify the impact of intervention

Vas Jj e effective than taxes or levies in bringing support costs under

Budget Council

23 July 1987

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Budget Council meeting on

23 July had reached deadlock in its first discussion on the Commission&apos;s

preliminary drafJ^Community budget for 1988.    The Danish Presidency had

pressed hard f/^raSnreement on a draft budget well in excess of a Value

Added Tax ratexg-f^^rA. per cent.    The United Kingdom had argued that to

adopt such a budg/axwould be illegal.    This view had been supported by

the Federal Repubxjo jO Germany and by a ruling of the Council Legal

Services that a dva&amp;Jpyfoet which exceeded the own resources ceiling

would be illegal unlasS^U^ere was unanimous agreement by member states

that the extra resourc^^^OTjJd be provided.    There had been no such

agreement.    From a diff ec^w^fcoint of view, Spain had also opposed the

draft budget.    The Budgec ^6uVcil would meet again to discuss the draft

budget on 17-18 SeptemberX^^j^^as not clear how the Presidency would

handle matters and the GoverafliraWwould need to consider tactics. But

it was most likely that the i^s^i^ys? relating to 1988 would be caught up

in the discussions on the wholet^^e financing of the Community at the

European Council in December.

The Cabinet - ^^^-\

1.      Took note. V/?

Hague

Convention on

International

Access to

Justice

THE PRIME MINISTER drew attention to reports sifgg^ting that a proposal

from the European Commission that member state\S^hMuld sign and ratify

the 1980 Hague Convention on International Access&apos;/f&apos;oSjustice could

assist terrorists.    The suggestion was that underx^tire^&amp;pnvention any

witness called to give evidence in another member s^ra/would be granted

immunity for seven days before and after appearance wipj^rftcee dings. A

report from the House of Lords Select Committee on th^B&gt;ori&amp;&gt;ean

Communities on the implication of the Commission&apos;s propos^^t^d just

been published; it recorded the Government&apos;s reservat ionB^nt^is point.

The risks, particularly in the context of international te^*d%&lt;Sm, would

need to be very carefully assessed. &lt;&lt;Vvv


The Cabinet -

2. Invited the Home Secretary and the Secretary

of State for Northern Ireland to consider whether

further action by the Government was needed in

&gt;      the light of the House of Lords Select Committee&apos;s

7) report.
