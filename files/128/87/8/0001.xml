N&lt;^^e31ANCELL0R OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that at the meeting of the

E^xfpe^sN) Space Agency earlier that week he had signified the

GovfiralfmMit1 s decision not to join the three optional programmes that

were utfjrer discussion.    These were projects for the Ariane V launcher,

the H?CT&gt;^ymanned spacecraft and the European element of the Columbus

space sua/idfa.    All three projects were vastly expensive.    Proposals for

a Europea^project to put a man in space by the year 2000 were

grandiosefar removed from sensible industrial and commercial

considerations.    There was no British industrial interest in the manned

space proposals,  in which the French had the dominant share, and he did

not foresee that^SSVh a British interest would develop.    It was

possible, howevWr^ viat British Aerospace might develop an interest in

the polar platfonfy^rMaent of the Columbus project, and in that event he

would wish to giveU^uy/ber thought to the position that the Government

should take.    SimiraJ^fatttisiderations might possibly apply to Ariane.

British Aerospace ana Royce could be expected to continue lobbying

the Government for supM^^&amp;pr the Horizontal Take-off and Landing

Project which was another^v^tly expensive set of proposals, albeit

conceived in Britain. He our aged British Aerospace to pursue the

matter further with the GeXroajyimd Japanese aerospace concerns in the

first place.    He proposed to-J^feNa statement later that day about the

European Space Agency meeting\WNi^&amp; d circulated the text to his

colleagues most closely conceriw^/.

Financial

Assistance

for

Haemophiliacs

Infected

with the

AIDS Virus

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SER^T^t^xaid that the Home and Social

Affairs Committee, Sub-Committee on AID* ^H&quot;Ca)) had earlier that week

approved his proposals for making  10 miVlion available to assist

haemophiliacs who had been infected with the AIDS virus by treatment

with blood products that had subsequently proved to be contaminated. He

had now completed the consultations that H(A) had- invited him to carry

out with the Chief Secretary, Treasury and preliminary discussions with

the Haemophilia Society of Great Britain had arx^be^s. carried out as

H(A) had requested.    The Haemophilia Society weref huajaware that the

Government would assist them in the administrationvn&gt;^fte financial

assistance being made available, and he believed tha&amp;pJafoeting later

that day of the leading figures in the Haemophilia So j^ ^otfould confirm

the Society&apos;s welcome and support of the initiative. if^^a^Jie

expected,  the Society&apos;s support was forthcoming, he propos^S^bo announce

the financial assistance on the following Monday.    He wouTW^na^Vrally

make clear,  in accordance with the advice that the Solicito&lt;^&amp; rf&amp;ral had

given H(A), that the money was being made available ex grati^f^^&gt;5 that

the Government expressly disclaimed any liability for the haem^jjfljyl/ia

patients&apos;  infection. /k^Ck

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he proposed that

Vthe White Paper on Primary Health Care,  the text of which had been under

)oiscussion with colleagues, should be published the following Thursday

^tJXcoincide with the publication of the National Health Service and

&apos;Trealcines Bill.    He believed that this would provide the positive

^ca^utyext for some of the Bill&apos;s more controversial provisions,  in the way

ThA^/^Ud been envisaged in previous discussions.

Adult

Training

THE SECR^Aj ? OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he hoped to make a

statemenr^Ehe following week about his proposals for rationalising adult

training, Vroadly on the lines of existing youth training arrangements.

This was a major element in the Government&apos;s policy towards the

long-term unemployed.    Following the statement, an outline of which he

would circulate/^3~Yplleagues that day, he would need to have

consultations w\th Manpower Services Commission prior to the

preparation of a wjyrtl^yaper.

Lobby of

Parliament

by Sikh Human

Rights Group

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEAL^H^ECRETARY said that the Sikh Human Rights

Group were expected to mo&lt;*&lt;j ^aylobby of Parliament that day. This

Group, which was a front or&amp;ajijyS&amp;tion for the International Sikh Youth

Federation, was seeking to etrM^Vthe support of international human

rights groups for the creationXpY,,^^ independent state of Khalistan.

Government supporters should ha^^m^iing to do with the Group. He

understood that the Lord Privy Se&gt;cp/nSii alerted the House of Commons

authorities to the proposed lobby,

Lobby of

Parliament

by Unionist

Supporters

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that there would be a

lobby of Parliament that day by some 200 Unionist supporters.    He had

advised Government supporters to welcome them to Parliament and to

encourage them to participate responsibly in di^ejr&amp;^ion.

The Cabinet -

2.      THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the &gt;&amp;&amp;mp)^yment

figures for October would be published that day.    The seaso\ 2&gt;  \

adjusted total had fallen by about 58,000 since September toOWS

million.    The unadjusted total had fallen by about 119,000 in^hm)

period to 2.751 million.    Unemployment stood at 9.8 per cent or^txp^y^

working population; this was the first occasion since1 1982 that telsvX


rate had fallen below 10 per cent.    Unemployment had fallen by about

|N500,000 since June 1986, which was the largest sustained reduction since

Records had been kept.    Unemployment had fallen in all regions, with the

^k kgest reductions occurring in the West Midlands, Wales and the North

^Nasv,    The reduction in youth unemployment was especially marked, with

\&amp;ja^m loyment among school leavers lower at that time than at any period

s-fn^e^he 1970s.    Unfilled vacancies at job centres stood at 261,000,

whv  sra the highest figure on record.    Moreover, the underlying

posi^^on^jjas even more encouraging than this, since vacancies at job

centr&amp;^^^ounted for only a proportion of the vacancies in the

econonrjt^^&apos;

THE PRIMEmONISTER,  summing up a brief discussion, said that every

effort shoMd be made to publicise these encouraging and welcome

figures.

JMurder of

Darshan Dass

THE HOME SECRETARY Darshan Dass, leader of the Sarhkhand Nanak

Dam, a pro-Indian Gove^fment group, had been murdered at a prayer

meeting in Southall th/^p^e^ious evening.    He had been a controversial

figure in his community^a^a^it should not be assumed at that stage that

there was necessarily a tenf ^ist connection.

The Cabinet -

1.      Took note.

Northern

Ireland

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN MHriffito said that the detonation of

a bomb at the Remembrance Day Parade at\&amp;mi killen on 8 November had

left 11 people dead and more than 60 injoj^eu.    This was an appalling

outrage, which would have resulted in eveovgreater loss of life had it

taken place 10 minutes later, when many more people including children

would have been on the spot.    The expressions of alleged regret by the

Irish Republican Army (IRA) were contemptible; aj* even larger bomb had

been planted at the location of a civilian paraoe an Tullyhommon.

The implications of this outrage were likely to pm/veProfound. There

was evidence that it had significantly weakened suppi&gt; ^or Sinn Fein

and the IRA; senior members of the IRA were said to it as a

catastrophe for them.    Acts of terrorist violence wouSy^rfMsXcease;

indeed the IRA might try soon to mount another in ordeiVto^CTj*tract

attention from the one at Enniskillen.    A forthright pastp^ax^essa8e

was to be read out in all Roman Catholic churches in Ixela^gta*

following Sunday, which would condemn all involvement in orv uraJ\t of

terrorism.    The incident was having a strong effect on the peM&lt; T^wid

Government of the Republic of Ireland, coinciding as it did wrm^e

brutal kidnapping of a Dublin dentist, Mr John O&apos;Grady, and theMy(p^jML

seizure of the Merchant Vessel Eksund while carrying a large ^^\^&gt;v\


consignment of arms supplied by Libya for the IRA.

The Government should take the opportunity to press for greater

yco-operation with the Irish Republic against terrorism and for a change

^Vj*t attitude on the part of those in Northern Ireland who had hitherto

 ^Ke^o willing to tolerate the IRA.    The moving television interview by

\MT^G)ordon Wilson, whose 20-year old daughter had died in the blast, had

tyddpy^ deep impression on a worldwide audience; his eloquent compassion

ai/j^foxteiveness might well have saved lives in dissuading some people in

Nort^f^nVlreland from retaliating by taking the law into their hands.

In dis^riSS^m, it was noted that the mood following the Enniskillen

outrage\i^gJ   not last, so that the Government should move quickly to

take adv?m5age of it.    One possibility would be to try again to persuade

the Garda^^o co-operate more positively with the Northern Ireland

security forces and to take seriously the offer of training in Britain.

THE PRIME MINISTB^Nsumming up the discussion, said that the Cabinet

would wish to ritor^jtheir warm appreciation of the skilful and

dignified manner^3&gt;^  Xf h the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland

had handled this tr^gjAlincident.

The Cabinet -

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONwEAD^WTECAETARY said that the dismissal on

the previous day of Mr Boris Elts/R^rhe head of the Moscow Communist

Party, was a significant success roryC^&amp;e. opposed to the reform

policies of the Secretary General c^^th^Soviet Communist Party,

Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.    Mr Eltsin, wh^f^d&lt;been regarded as a protege of

Mr Gorbachev, had been a vigorous and T^StPppoken advocate of reform and

might have overstepped the mark in callvjg^or change and in criticising

others in the Soviet leadership. \X

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that t/f^^tcome of that

year&apos;s vote at the United Nation&apos;s General Assembiy^rm^^ghanistan had

been satisfactory:  the majority in favour of a Sovie&lt;^wfojjlrawal had

increased. V&apos;/^vs.


Tunis iV&gt;$

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the situation in

*v Tunisia was calm following the removal on 7 November of the President,

)iMr Habib Bourguiba, and his replacement by the Prime Minister, Mr Zinne

Abidine Ben Ali.    British interests were not at risk and the change

y^a^ generally to be welcomed.

Arab Summit

Reference:

CC(87) 31.3

THEVF&lt;03$ l N AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Arab Summit in

Amman C^CS&amp;&apos;o to 11 November had been skilfully handled by King Hussein

of Jordrf^-^^t had been well attended and, Libya apart, unanimity had

been ach\t(ved.    On the Gulf, which had for the first time headed the

agenda,  tfrere had been strong comdemnation of Iran,  in which Syria had

concurred.    It had also been agreed that, while Egypt would continue to

be suspended from membership of the Arab League,  individual states might

resume bilateraJVTKkations with her.    This was an encouraging

development.

Libyan

Support for

[Terrorism

THE FOREIGN AND COMMOI^A^k SECRETARY said that a very substantial

consignment of arms had bee* ^ecovered from the Merchant Vessel Eksund

which had been seized by ^jj^Fytench authorities on 30 October.    This had

been the fifth known Libya^sjnmment of arms to the Irish Republican

Army.    Because the affair wasx3Q(b\judice *n France, it would be

inappropriate for Ministers t^c^&gt;p ftent in detail.    But the episode

provided unequivocal evidence trjx^lj^an support for terrorism and should

be cited in urging other countrias^cC^ake measures against Libya&apos;s

attitude.

Sri Lanka

Reference:

CC(87) 30.4

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY s^d that a bomb outrage in

Colombo on 9 November had caused 32 deaths.    The Indian peacekeeping

force was continuing to make slow headway agianst Tamil guerrillas. The

Sri Lankan Parliament was debating legislation ko^sive limited autonomy

to Tamil areas in accordance with the Indo-Sri r^an^d Accord.    The Sri

Lankan President, Mr Junius Jayewardene, remaiim2 y ^3^jnnined in the face

of a difficult situation; he was grateful for theffJnil^d Kingdom&apos;s moral

and practical support.

Japan

Previous

Reference:

3C(87) 29.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the comp^^ujj^i of the

new Japanese Cabinet under Mr Noboru Takeshita was reasonabH^ ^^\

encouraging.    Both the new Foreign Minister and the Minister^p^Mists

and Telecommunications were proteges of the previous Prime MirK^s-^aV,

Mr Yasuhiro Nakasone, and could be expected to pursue sensible pcflrows.

The latter appointment could be important for Cable and Wireless &gt;^flc^\


chances of securing a share of the Japanese domestic telecommunications

^^J^kdiscussion, it was noted that the new Prime Minister had long

w^refiresented a rural constituency; this did not bode well for future

\^je^rt:iations on agriculture.

Captain

Carson

THE FC^fi^^ AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at the request of the

Bahamian /G0^?rnment, the British Defence Attache in Nassau,

Captain Oraristopher Carson, had been recalled.    His wife had been found

dead in Nassau on 9 October.    The police there suspected foul play and

considered Captain Carson to be the prime suspect.    The prosecuting

authorities in Britain were investigating the matter.

THE SECRETARY OF STAT^^JU DEFENCE said that he had attended the meeting

of the Nuclear Plannin/^&amp; o*hn&gt; of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation

(NATO) in California on^^\Ad^4 November.    Unanimous support had been

expressed for the agreemenL^m*the elimination of intermediate-range

nuclear forces  (INF) being-^w^oAsiated between the United States and the

Soviet Union.    There had be^eNa-^Xa&apos;Cussion of the possible restructuring

of nuclear forces in the wakev^fC^at agreement; difficult decisions

would need to be taken at the^^sVj/^eeting.

iUnited States

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE sa^-J^t he had visited Washington

on 5 and 6 November for discussions witVOfhe^tbers of the United States

Administration and with congressional legfers of both parties.    He had

received a universally warm reception:  tn^contribution of the Royal

Naval Minesweeping force in the Gulf was greatly appreciated, as were

the United Kingdom&apos;s efforts to co-ordinate the activities in the Gulf

of other European naval forces.    Great stress had^Hteen laid on the

importance of the United Kingdom and other NATOf Europe an Governments

expressing their public support for an INF agreem3&gt;i^^^ertain leading

Republicans were hinting that European Governmentsf(wepy opposed and it

was vital that the Government should counter this rmw&amp;ition. This

aspect of the matter could play a role in the decisiofiA^^he United

States Senate in due course on whether to ratify the avMarftent. The

retirement of the United States Secretary of Defense, Mr Oaaajr

Weinberger, was a matter for regret.    He had been a staun^J^^&amp;end of

the United Kingdom.    His nominated successor, Mr Frank Zax\^xAj was

also pro-British but was a less forceful personality. ^-jxv\
