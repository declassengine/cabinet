HOME AFFAIR^V

Industrial

Action by

Postal

Workers

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that the Union

.?^/Communication Workers were demanding reductions in the working week

fi^/frostal workers from 39i to 36i hours for manual workers and from 36i

bo IdjNhours for clerical workers, with no compensatory increases in

pr^ducjfc^vity.    The Post Office management had offered a reduction of one

hour^^jc-jsanual workers, provided this was matched by increased

proddtt5w4ty, but no reduction for clerical workers.    In a recent ballot

of thevwH^n&apos;s membership, 55 per cent had voted in favour of industrial

action,Although this constituted only 45 per cent of those entitled to

vote.    A aelegate conference was to be held that weekend, and local

industrial action could be expected from the following week.    The Post

Office managemen -&gt;would react firmly to this and ensure that, if postal

deliveries wer^^isjrupted, those not working normally would not be paid.

The Government\^n]e--shouId be that, in the event of serious disruption

to postal service^one Post Office monopoly should be suspended, which

was as far as theN@Sj^2^iment could go without new primary legislation.

National

Union of

Mineworkers

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FO^fNHlGY said that Mr Arthur Scargill had

announced his resignation x ^f^sident of the National Union of

Mineworkers and would be se^wrag^re-e lection to that office.    It was

clear that Mr Scargill was h^iro/that the Government would attack his

leadership in the expectation Th  ^bis would strengthen support for him

among members of the Union.    QoH^av^s would wish to avoid responding

in this way. ^^^^

The Cabinet -

1.     Took note.

King&apos;s Cross

Underground

Station Fire

Disaster

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that(Chlle. had been a very

serious fire the previous evening at King&apos;s CrospVUnaVrground Station.

The latest information was that 30 people had die^^prfcluding one

fireman, 19 people had been seriously injured and a^fflWH?er 32 people

were still detained in hospital.    The emergency servZ&amp;s^Xad reacted

superbly in rescuing those who had been trapped and li^fc^ewting the

injured.    It appeared that the fire damage had started op^Jjrfc Piccadilly

line escalators, and the worst affected area was the marfx^laftet hall.

The ceiling panelling in the ticket hall area contained bKfcira^^sbestos

and, as a result of the fire, some asbestos fibres had been^fcfre^sed

into the atmosphere.    It was for this reason that Undergroun^s&gt;Wices

in the King&apos;s Cross area had had to be curtailed that morningXy&amp;tJ&amp;ect


to the agreement of colleagues, he believed it was essential that he

should make a statement on the fire in the House of Commons that

&gt;   afternoon and that he should announce that he would be instituting a

J  formal investigation under the Regulation of Railways Act 1871. He

&quot;Y^roposed that the inquiry should be chaired by a Queen&apos;s Counsel,

^aj^isted by expert assessors.    The Lord Chancellor had been helpful in

^Xat ising on possible chairmen, and he hoped that it might be possible to

Jmpmance the name of the chairman in his statement that afternoon. It

StfouJ^^be wrong to speculate on the causes of the disaster; the important

tlWng/^as for the inquiry to establish the facts as soon as possible.

On general point, colleagues should be aware that any formal

inqurfcV/into a disaster might need to be suspended for a time should it

becomev  *ar that prosecutions were likely to be mounted.

THE PRIME MINISTER said that the Cabinet would wish to place on record

their condolences for those bereaved and injured and their gratitude to

the emergency &amp;j *yices for their courage and skill.    She and the

Secretary of $ ate\ for Transport would be visiting some of the injured

later that mos^ng-j^. The Cabinet agreed that the Secretary of State for

Transport should/paWa a statement in the House of Commons later that day

and that he shouvft^mfltmnce that he would be establishing a formal

investigation, cha^aV^w a Queen&apos;s Counsel assisted by expert

assessors.   The Seci^fe^S\pf State for Transport, in consultation with

the Lord Chancellor awff\ n^Attorney General, should provide colleagues

with a form of words toJtfjzygaed if necessary on the relationship between

an inquiry and possible ^xoseputions.    Some Opposition spokesmen had

claimed that the fire serNfcx3&gt; ^as under-funded, but there had in fact

been increases in fire serT^tf^nwnpower and resources under the present

adminstration. v^^//

The Cabinet - ^^^^

2. Recorded their condole those bereaved and injured in

the fire at King&apos;s Cross Under^ngS&amp;fd Station and their gratitude

for the work of the emergency sa&gt;pvj^ s.

3. Invited the Secretary of Stare for Transport to make a

statement on the disaster in the House of Commons later that day

and to announce that he would establish aformal investigation

under the Regulation of Railways Act 187^~V\

4. Invited the Secretary of State for TnMsppkrt,  in consultation

with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney V^sJK^aS., to provide

colleagues with a form of words on the relat^^rf&amp;riM) between an

inquiry and possible prosecutions.


AFFAIRS &lt;0&gt;

State VisitS-

of the &lt;

president

of Italy

previous

Reference:

CC(87) 31.3

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the unfortunate

^cancellation, at the last minute, of the State Visit to London by the

/{President of Italy, Signor Francesco Cossiga, had been unavoidable: he

?&quot;owd been obliged by constitutional convention to remain in Italy

r^pjplowing the resignation on 14 November of the Italian Prime Minister,

C^S^aWor Giovanni Goria.    President Cossiga had conveyed his personal

Mi^wp-pjaintment to Her Majesty The Queen.    It was expected that the

pr-eyLejy^ Italian Government would shortly be reconstituted.

Falkland

Islands

Previous

Reference:

CC(86) 39.2

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that there had been a small

increase in supjfarr&apos;tyfor the United Kingdom in the vote at the United

Nations General\A*s^ fa&gt;ly on 17 November on an Argentine-inspired

resolution on the ifeflMHand Islands.    114 countries (two less than in

1986) had voted foi^t^^esolution,  five (an increase of one) including

the United Kingdom a^w4^it, and 36 (an increase of two) had

abstained.    The resoluffp^H^\ad been virtually identical with those in

recent years; although ^ft^trad in deceptively mild language, it had made

no mention of the Falkland^^^ksmders&apos;  right to self-determination. In

the debate,  the United Kin^dmmad stated unequivocally its position on

British sovereignty and the\S^w^oment1 s determination to uphold the

rights of the Islanders. (cv^v

The Cabinet - /K^X

Took note.

COMMUNITY

AFFAIRS

Agriculture

4.      THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that it had

been expected that the meeting of the Agriculture Council beginning on

16 November would continue as long as necessary to carry forward

negotiations on the Commission&apos;s proposals for a^r^yiltural stabilisers

ahead of the following week&apos;s Foreign Affairs ctmncvl and the European

Council in December.    In the event,  the meeting iraWJMn suspended on

the third day and would not resume until 23 Novemt\4r_^//Be had made clear

the determination of the United Kingdom to reach an aMfeement and had

spoken out against this delay.    On the substance, the Zr^jJasals put

forward by the Commission and the Danish Presidency, wrg^T^t going as

far as the United Kingdom would like, were on the right lrn^y However,

apart from the United Kingdom, only the Netherlands had s$ jj*&lt; rtvin their

support.    The Mediterranean countries and the Republic of xxeLard had

expressed dissent.    The Federal Republic of Germany had been^JMwcably

opposed.    The French position was less clear cut, but there ws&amp;N^artfence

of Franco/German co-operation.    He had judged it important not^^BA

critical at that stage of proposals put forward by the Presidency/^jrayw

the Commission, so as to encourage them to maintain their posit ion j^^^


they so far had.

^\ln discussion the importance was stressed of ensuring that, if the

^^JWeotiations did not succeed,  the United Kingdom did not receive the

rime. The proposals on the table were a minimum and if others rejected

\kij#m they were not matching up to the needs of Europe.

Economic and

Finance

Council

THE ClCSKgpLLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that a useful communique&apos; had been

issued ^A^the meeting of Finance Ministers of European Community

countrieC^n 16 November following discussion of the current

international financial situation.    He had also taken the opportunity to

have private discussions with the Finance Ministers of France and the

Federal Republic of Germany.    The Commission had presented proposals for

further 1iberalifeaTwon of capital movements.    These were proceeding in

the right direcX^jorotand would now receive detailed study by the Monetary

Committee and ComnVyrTte^a of Central Bank Governors.    Lord Cockfield had

presented the Comra^snAefj s proposals on tax approximation.    These had

been remitted to the^Sram iiic Policy Committee for analysis:    it would

be right to play this N 4y@S&gt;long.    He had underlined the commitments on

zero rates given by tha^@weoriment before the General Election. The

discussion on future finanp^tfgvhad largely followed familiar lines. The

President of the Commissiero^&gt;faa\however expressed the view that

&quot;exceptional circumstances^^s^pjj^sd be confined to currency movements.

5.      THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER saW&gt;JJat the markets were steadier

though still fragile.    The negotiations ^Pfween the United States

Administration and Congress about measure^to reduce the United States

budget deficit had still not been concluded.    However it was hoped that

agreement would be reached shortly.    This was likely to be slightly in

excess of the minimum required by the Gramm-Rudra^S^Vegislation. It

would probably include asset sales, and contain((som4l element of

increased taxation.    Such an outcome would be in^-eh^OT&amp;ance with market

expectations.    The details were still to be workecKca^tf/attd would be the

subject of continuing discussion between the United^^rfyes

Administration and Congress.
