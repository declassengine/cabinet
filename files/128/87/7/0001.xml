THE PRIME MINIST^ft^itfi^that she noted that a meeting of the European

Space Agency would^fcj}$&lt;*/alace the following week.    There might be

considerable Pariiamttfffyinterest.    On his return from the meeting,

the Chancellor of the DtyK^hyvof Lancaster should circulate to her and

other colleagues most c^a*Vi^ concerned, a note of the outcome of the

meeting and the text of anV^&amp;atement he might wish to make.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDCrarfY said that the report of

the Monopolies and Mergers Commission on^rte proposed merger of British

Airways with British Caledonian would be made public the following week.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up a brief discussioo&lt;said that it was not

the Government&apos;s practice to volunteer a statem//t am a report by the

Monopolies and Mergers Commission and it would nsJDyijP^vight to set a

precedent on that occasion.    There was to be a debhrceIn the House of

Commons on 11 November on an Opposition Motion on r^a a dvt, and the

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should cons y^ 6e Secretary

of State for Transport on the timing of the publicatio4^ (VVie

Commission&apos;s report. s\

THE HOME SECRETARY said that Committee Stage in the House of Lords of

ithe Criminal Justice Bill had been completed earlier that week.    He was

giving further consideration to the handling of his proposals for

^arbolishing the prima facie rule in extradition proceedings in the light

&apos;*of\the opposition expressed in the debates and he was in touch with the

^L 5^y President of the Council on this.    The Government had secured

^J^eriitel for a number of proposals which were potentially contentious,

ii\p^ud^n  those on lenient sentences, peremptory challenge of jurors and

the^eVsyp sion of knives in public places. The Bill was therefore in

good s^apg^and he wished to place on record his gratitude to the

Governtfi^^spokesmen and Business Managers in the House of Lords on

achievin&amp;A&gt;t tf3 satisfactory result.

3.      THE FOREIGN ANVl?j5?ft^WEALTH SECRETARY said that he had visited

Egypt from 29 October tftr^^ttovember and Jordan from 1 to 3 November.

The President of Egypt, ^^AH^6ni Mubarak, had been in robust form; he

had expressed determination^S^tackle Egypt&apos;s economic problems. King

Hussein of Jordan had beetC&amp;y^aydifferent mood.    He was disappointed, as

indeed was the Egyptian GovSnuwrfjTO&apos;t, at the attitude of the United States

towards the proposal for an in&lt;^^Ational conference about peace in the

Middle East.    King Hussein saw^frLar^as leaving a worrying degree of

scope for Soviet diplomacy.    Kinr^llu^ein had been very grateful for new

British moves in support of Jorda/^irc^uding a capital aid loan and

more money for scholarships and milL^tf^^training.

The Persian

Gulf

Reference:

C(87) 29.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY sa^ that his recent visit to

Egypt and Jordan had shown that the situation in the Gulf was having a

negative influence on the mood in the Middle East generally.    That was

why King Hussein of Jordan would try, at the Sumprp^meeting of \rab

countries on 8 November, to secure a resolution fin ^ypport of

enforcement of Resolution 598 of the United NatioSfe^Se^ur ity Council,

which had called for an end to hostilities in the c(il_ /J^It had been

clear from his talks in Egypt and Jordan that thereS^y^firustration in

those countries at the lack of unity among the Arab cVur^^Ses, even

among those in the Gulf area itself, about the attitudeV^Rf^bX taken to

the Iran/Iraq war.    In Cairo and Amman, he had pointed out^ijjA

disadvantages of the Soviet proposal of a United Nations n^vjrt^force in

the Gulf.    The efforts of the United Nations Secretary Gene^elyimake

progress towards implementation of Security Council Resolutibr^s^Swere

not going well.    Iran and Iraq had given disappointing respons^s^owihe

Secretary General&apos;s detailed plan for implementation of the Reseflwtffan.


The Secretary General was looking to the permanent members of the

Security Council for help, and the United Kingdom was trying to maintain

&apos;&quot;V^the momentum.

;C(87) 14.3

^^?F^EIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Foreign Minister of

PakLs^ftu^ Mr Yaqub-Khan, had resigned, partly for reasons connected with

his^e&gt;2^nt decision to withdraw his candidature for the post of Security

Generx -^5^the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural

Organis^r^o^(UNESCO).    His resignation was a pity; he had been an

impress rveVrigure, dealing firmly with the Soviet Union over Afghanistan

and contributing to the maintenance of United States confidence in the

Government of Pakistan.

&amp;rms Control

Reference:

CC(87) 28.3

THE FOREIGN AND CO^O^ALTH SECRETARY said that the meeting of Defence

Ministers of the NoVH^^tlantic Treaty Organisation on 3 and 4 November

in California,  from vnip^^ie Secretary of State for Defence had not yet

returned, had consideiNKj^lrtTek consequences of the prospective agreement

between the United States \kn&gt;a&gt; the Soviet Union of the elimination of

intermediate range nuclea^^f Ailes in Europe.    The meeting had affirmed

the support of the Allianc^far) the proposed agreement.    The media had

surprisingly treated this aV-j^^Muige of position by European members of

the Alliance, although these^aS^cpnsistently supported an agreement.

It was to be hoped that the en b !ME&gt;men t by the meeting of the proposed

agreement would influence the UniXerJP&apos;otates Congress when it came to

consider ratification.

Agreement had now been reached betwe ^ i* \ United States and the Soviet

Union on a Summit meeting between the&apos; .ers, which would start on

7 December in Washington.    The proposedt^g^ement on intermediate range

nuclear missiles would be signed.    There\vas a prospect of a further

Summit meeting between them in the first naif of 1988; there were hopes

that an agreement might then be signed on reductions in the strategic

nuclear weapons held by the United States and Soviet Union, but these

hopes might be unrealistic. lit)

Reference:

CC(87) 6.3

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the i^^ |\changes in

the Soviet position regarding a Summit meeting with tha^Owit^d States

were puzzling.    One factor had probably been that the Gene^H &quot;6ecretary

of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Goi^^ney, had

felt constrained by debates that were taking place in the s^jM^p?&apos;\levels

of the Communist Party.    His speech on 2 November on the 70th^V&gt;V^

anniversary of the October Revolution had been more reticent o\j *fe^

history of the Stalin period and on openess (glasnost) in SovieC^l&amp;)&gt;

than might have been expected.    This might be due in part to the (y^ V\


celebratory nature of the occasion.    But there might also be a group in

X the Politburo of the Party which was arguing that change should not take

&apos;&quot;ytolace too rapidly.

State Visit

of the

president of

Italy

TH^F^KIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the President of Italy,

Sign^^P^ancesco Cossiga, would address members of both Houses of

PariiajB^rft at noon on 18 November, during his State Visit to Britain. It

was de^i^ M.e that as many members of the Cabinet as possible should

attend tSii^^ccasion and that other Members of Parliament should be

encourag^yro do so.

United

States

Budget

Deficit

THE CHANCELLOR (fc^TH/ EXCHEQUER said that the markets were still

nervous, with c oi&gt;4?U 5?^&gt;  weakness in share prices and loss of confidence

in the dollar.    DotesfAcally the interest rate reduction on the

previous day had befeirxfeZpful, but institutional buyers were still

biding their time.    Tfie^i^Wv underlying factor in the market situation

was the problem of theMfn^^d States budget deficit.    Although this

problem had existed for aYoxfo time, and some action had been taken in

the previous year to tackpjpj  \ i t had only recently become a market

factor with the build-up oixthp)^yerseas debt of the United States and

rising debt interest.    He waVwolose touch with the United States

Secretary of the Treasury, MrMfai(&gt;ej vBaker, who was at present giving

virtually all his time to disciK^mris. with Congress on reduction of the

deficit.    The composition as weli/ ^Che size of measures to reduce the

deficit would be of significance rn Jfcj  ^narkets.    He was also in touch

with other leading Finance MinisterV:   .^J&amp;t until there was a resolution

of the deficit discussions in WashinO^jj-^tlaere was no point in convening

a wider meeting to take stock of the pTSSS^lan.
