Firearms w&apos;

White Paper\

/^HE HOME SECRETARY said that he proposed to make a statement in the

^Louse of Commons the following week to coincide with the publication of

//KevvWhite Paper on firearms.    He hoped to bring forward a Bill before

^&lt;5br&gt;r^tmas to give effect to the proposals, which would amount to a

wffsi^rable strengthening of the law.    He expected that the police

woi^^J^brwadly welcome his proposals, although both they and the

Opp&amp;sw/oti would press him to go futher in certain areas,  in particular

to br ng/^notguns within the controls in Section 1 of the Firearms Act

1968. \fin the other hand, his proposals on shotguns were seen as severe

in rurar communities and firearms interests had made vigorous

representations against a number of the proposals.    There might

be some difficu4-ti.es with Government supporters.

2.      THE SECRETARY OF S&lt;wlQHOR EMPLOYMENT said that members of the

Civil and Public Servantsv^B^Xiation in his Department had voted by a

narrow majority to take in^ks^r*al action the following day in protest

against the operation of thaNY-&lt;w^h Training Scheme (YTS) within his

Department.    Some sporadic acfYpn^-^ould be expected, concentrated in

London and Scotland.    Clearly vnisAAJuld not affect the Government&apos;s

commitment to press on with the ^ecry^tment of YTS trainees in the

public service.    The record of th^^Juhiic sector in taking on YTS

recruits had been very poor: only S^fiJJywere employed in central

Government and a further 4,000 in th^MJ^mainder of the public service.

It was important that the Government ^ould not be seen to be dragging

its feet at a time when it was pressing^the private sector to increase

its commitment to training.    He would wish to pursue with colleagues how

best to secure an expansion of YTS within the nublic sector.

The Cabinet -

1.      Invited the Secretary of State for Eni^^^pe^it,  in consultation

with the Minister for the Civil Service, to ^eryjl^A^v how best to

secure substantial expansion of the Youth Traim&gt;J&amp;06cheme within

the public sector.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE DUCHY OF LANCASTER said that the Post Office

management had made clear that they would consider reductions in the

S. working week for postal workers only as part of a package involving new

Mproductivity arrangements and revision of the present bonus scheme. The

yjSSion of Communication Workers, whose executive were meeting that day to

&apos;N^preaider their response, were a divided Union with no clear policy on

Sp^rf/matter as yet.    In all probability, the Union would not accept the

ma^agOTtent proposals, and there was therefore a threat of disruption to

posca^eervices.    If matters got that far, the timing of any suspension

of wf^^f^t Office monopoly would be a matter for fine judgment.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that the Nationwide Anglia

Building Society had announced the previous day that it proposed to

invest  600 millLerrr&gt;in private rented housing focussing first on

Glasgow, Liverpc/ol, /Dundee, Newcastle-upon-Tyne and other urban areas.

This demonstrate&lt;C3&gt;^ENthe proposals in the Housing Bill and the

forthcoming HousinaKS^Atland) Bill for deregulating the private rented

sector could be expe-e KWto stimulate massive investment in private

rented housing.    In awaX^Sa, the involvement of a leading building

society gave the lie tivMT^llegation that the regeneration of the

private rented housing sVccXpOwould bring a return of &quot;Rachmanism&quot;.

3.      THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECirefctfOfr said that, at their meeting

in Geneva on 23 and 24 November,  the Urtiw fs*ates Secretary of State,

Mr George Shultz, and the Soviet ForeignV&amp;i^rtster, Mr Eduard

Shevardnadze, had resolved the issues outstanding in the negotiations on

the elimination of ground-based Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces (INF).

This was most welcome.    In particular, agreement had been reached on the

details of the notes to be exchanged between INF baling countries in

Western Europe and the Soviet Union governing in/^ec^on of bases in

these countries.    This was important for British s3to^e^3 nty and

security; under the proposed Treaty,  the bases at Gr^enAam Common and

Molesworth would be liable to inspection over a peribd-^ /l3 years. The

Treaty was likely to be signed on 7 December, at the sZaH) A  the

meeting in Washington between the President of the Uni ted/jfl^i^s,

Mr Ronald Reagan, and the General Secretary of the CommunistrP^ty of

the Soviet Union, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev.    The Basing Country xgpe^ment

between the United States and the five European countries cdrrcapAed

would probably be signed during the Ministerial meeting of the^forto.

Atlantic Council on 11 and 12 December, followed by exchanges cr^rro^p

with the Soviet Union later in the month.    Mr Shultz had stressea^aJ^y

importance of European support for the proposed INF Treapy; this wo/rpry^

a&apos;ssist the prospects for ratification in&apos; the Congress.    The two Foreig^y&apos;A^


Ministers had agreed that the sessions on arras control at the

forthcoming Summit meeting in Washington would focus on the Strategic

Arms Reduction Talks between the United States and the Soviet Union.

^    There were reports of signs of Soviet flexibility on the sub-limits to

tly to categories of nuclear systems, but there were considerable

ficulties over verification.    There would probably be considerable

:ussion of regional problems at the Summit, including Afghanistan,

Persian Gulf and Angola.

ip^d*^p cuss ion,  it was noted that removal of INF would be phased over

rtfre^p^ears.    Missiles would be withdrawn from Molesworth at an early

stw j &lt;SjW subsequently from Greenham Common.    The Soviet Union was

repofyeuAo have declared a higher number of missiles than had been

expecx ei f until the facts were clear,  it would be prudent to refrain

from pcuslicly citing a figure for the number of Soviet missiles that

would be destroyed.

Eastern

Europe

THE FOREIGN AND^fcO^NWEALTH SECRETARY said that there were signs of

growing unease rfl-^jsiern Europe.    Riots were reported to have taken

place in Romania,^wna^^.there were severe food shortages,  10 days

previously.    There y^B^nAunting tension in Poland, where a referendum

was to be held on 29M5ovemer on a package of economic measures which

would include price ria^^Xln Hungary,  the leadership, which had

hitherto moved relative^^fAr in implementing economic reforms, was

clearly concerned at the^wajrtaAat ions of the recent dismissal of

Mr Boris Eltsin from the fe&lt; a^r hip of the Moscow Communist Party.

Yugoslavia continued to expjM^ahce economic difficulties: a package of

strong austerity measures haaySeJnlkproposed, but it was doubtful that

the Government possessed the conea^cn to force them through.    It would

be necessary carefully to monit&amp;c^^Xits in Eastern Europe.

Bangladesh

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONEALTH SECRETARYsa id that a series of strikes and

demonstrations were taking place in Bangladesh.    The President,

Mr Hussain Ershad, had secured a two-thirds Parliamentary majority in

1986 through rigged elections, and oppositii/jigVpups regularly took to

the streets.    The Government had acted firmr^-^j&gt;d-vthe President would

remain in power so long as he continued to havef this) Army&apos; s confidence.

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that, at the meeting of the

Foreign Affairs Council on 23 November, he had drawn attention to the

seizure of arms from the Merchant Vessel Eksund on 30 October, which

&apos;demonstrated the scale of Libyan support for terrorism.    He had stressed

/\J e need for vigorous action and enhanced co-operation on measures to

Vy&amp;vbat terrorism and to exert pressure on Libya.    Both France and the

^V/syh Republic had expressed support.

&gt;rth Sea

THE S^OT^RY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said tht the outcome of the

Second Vufpernational Conference on the Protection of the North Sea, held

in LondoNKunder his chairmanship on 24 and 25 November, had been

satisfactory.    There was to be a 50 per cent reduction in emissions of

dangerous substances into rivers by 1995.    This was most important:

contrary to the/jgrfalic impression that the United Kingdom was the main

culprit, contin/nta). rivers accounted for more than half of riverborne

pollution of tftO^Ki Sea.    Incineration of waste as sea was to cease

by the end of 199ffano there was to be an early end to the dumping of

harmful liquid inaSj&amp;wj^l waste; neither measure would cause the United

Kingdom difficulty.^TT^e^hiited Kingdom would be able to continue

dumping treated sewagfe^n^laee, although the amount of metals was to be

further controlled, anoMjrtintinue tipping inert colliery waste into

the sea off the Durham ca^fcrfeld.    All the United Kingdom&apos;s objectives

in respect of radio-activ^^a^ie had been achieved.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing ^to^J^hort discussion, said that the Cabinet

would wish to congratulate thV^^f^-etary of State for the Environment on

his chairmanship of the Conferen^^i

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR WALES said^^^ie had visited Japan from

15 to 20 November, with the object of encouraging Japanese investment in

Wales.    In the light of the recent budgetary difficulties in the United

States and the fall in the United States stock market, Japanese

interests were contemplating investing more heavily in Western Europe.

The United Kingdom&apos;s standing was high:  there HasHreat respect for the

Prime Minister and admiration for the fimness\sj}c^wrr&gt;by the Chancellor

of the Exchequer in the wake of the United Statesj/ragent financial

difficulties.    There was growing recognition thatv]2&amp;$3a fri ranked with

Tokyo and New York as a major world financial centr^^J4&gt; was important

to capitalise on this,  in the interests of establishit^^Co^uller

relationship between Japan and Europe.    The visit to J^rfJa^ijw the

Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary in January 1988 would ijV^&gt;M&gt; or tan t in

this regard. &lt;xv)

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that the Prime

Minister&apos;s attendance at the postponed Remembrance Parade at

Enniskillen in Northern Ireland on 22 November had been enormously

? appreciated by people of all political persuasions; the event had

OJ^cured widespread television coverage and made a great impact.

/fflLM November, following receipt of intelligence of largescale arms

^pip^nts to the Irish Republic, the authorities there had set in train

thj? rVargest ever search for arms.    To date the sole result had been

the arrest of two prisoners who had escaped from the Maze Prison and the

Aisc^f^^f)of a small number of weapons.    It would be humiliating for the

Irish Oov^Ament if the operation did not produce significant results.

Such a fa&apos;flure would have profound implications, and the United kingdom

would befell placed to bring even greater pressure on the Irish

Government to take effective measures against terrorism.

The Irish Goveirtjasht had decided to support ratification of the European

Convention on feme Suppression of Terrorism, but intended to attach

unsatisfactoryNraA^Ttications which would introduce what amounted to a

prima facie requiwejMt.    For extradition to take place in each case,

the Irish Attorney^feMm^al would have to state that sufficient evidence

existed and a proseciwrojv^was intended in the United Kingdom.    The Irish

Prime Minister, Mr Clra j^^Haughey&gt; believed that a statement on these

aspects by the Attorney G&amp;tf&amp;al in Britian would provide a sufficient

basis for the necessary wa^rtent by the Irish Attorney General. But

the Irish Attorney Genera^AJymLelf thought that the Irish courts would

seek to go deeper into the &lt;p j^rt&amp;ons of evidence and probability of

prosecution.    The system wasVtn r-e\fore likely to go wrong before long.

There would be an arrangement &lt;f$y^Lfcs review after a year, if necessary.

The result of the changes would/b^^Kat arrangements in the Irish

Republic for extradition to the un^el^Kingdom would be worse than

before, and worse in some ways than t^Jj? Republic&apos;s arrangements for

extradition to other European countv e*w^ He proposed to take up one

aspect of the matter again with the TrvrVnJ^oreign Minister, Mr Brian

Lenihan, and would consult the Attornev^Jeneral     He had circulated to

colleagues the draft of a critical publN\ statement to be made by the

Government.

The Prime Minister, summing up a short discussi jr&gt;. said that the

position of the Irish Government was most unsaVisiyctory. The

Government&apos;s public line would have to be crirv &amp;^^\

4.    THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that at its meeting on

23-24 November the Foreign Affairs Council had come close to agreement

^ on a framework regulation covering permitted levels of radioactivity for

/^food stuffs in the event of a nuclear accident.    The Council had agreed

^a\mandate for a trade agreement with the Gulf States.    This provided for

vh,/tV)st favoured nation agreement, with the possibility of more

?^rarpHje aching arrangements at a future stage.    Consideration had been

gprenXto political subjects for the European Council.    Agreement had

beeaor^ached on a proposal to issue a firm and clear statement in

suppop^^of the agreement between the United States and the Soviet Union

on t^i*--g^mination of intermediate-range ground-based nuclear missiles,

as wel^^j^^ short statement on Afghanistan.

Agriculture

THE MINISTER OF^MICULTURE,  FISHERIES AND FOOD said that discussion of

agricultural stabilisers in the Agriculture Council had broken up early

that morning wrtBptft^igreement.    Despite protracted discussions over the

past week including yjo all night sittings, no real momentum had been

achieved.    The Pre**jJe/ycy had sought to indicate that the differences

related only to cerelilp^Kid oilseeds, but in reality they went much

wider.    The Federal of Germany appeared to remain implacably

opposed to an agreement.^Ert^nce had put forward alternative proposals,

the effect of which woul 3$ ^o limit the effectiveness of stabilisers

and to benefit French oil e&lt;y&apos;Interests.    The United Kingdom, the

Netherlands and the Commiss-t^r^h^id stood firm.    The Presidency&apos;s

proposals had been weaker trran^hp e of the Commission, but the

Presidency had at least held TKj^Hhfem.    However, only Portugal had

indicated willingness to settle /rT^f^Vat basis.    The United Kingdom&apos;s

unequivocal stand had, subject tNs expression of concern in relation to

sheepmeat, received support from a&lt;T Duties in debate in the House of

Commons on the previous evening. v^r^^

THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYV^i? that the Commission had been

putting the United Kingdom case and it luid had the best of the argument.

British spokesmen had made clear the areas where progress had been

unsatisfactory.    The difficulty was to persuade others to face up to the

consequences of the necessary reform.    In partip-wl^r it was unclear

whether the Germans had thought through their jbosinion and whether they

would ultimately alter their position.    The prVgya^ s. for a settlement

at the European Council the following month did rf t J)dok promising, but

we should continue to make a determined effort tovaGjS^&apos;e one.

5.      THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that agreement had been

reached between the United States Administration and Congress on

measures to reduce the United States budget deficit shortly before the

deadline set by the Gramm Rudman legislat ion.    They totalled $30 billion

in the first year and $46 billion in the second year, made up of

expenditure cuts (of which a third related to defence) tax increases and

\asset sales.    An early agreement on these lines would have been well

tj^eceived by the markets.    With the combination of delay and total

yfyeductions not much in excess of those required by the Gramm Rudman

/A g&lt;kslation,  the markets had been less impressed.    The United States

^Se^^ary of the Treasury had nevertheless done well to conclude an

agreement, given difficult ies with Republicans as well as Democrats in

th^^ej^tiations.    The position was still precarious.    The agreement had

to DevApuAoved by Congress as a whole and it was by no means clear that

this woj^to be achieved.    Failing agreement,  the Gramm Rudman

arrangements would take effect.    Such an outcome,  if it occurred, would

be seen Dy the markets as additional evidence of failure by the

Administration and would come about against a background of the further

recent weakenLm \pf the dollar.
