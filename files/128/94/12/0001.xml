to sympathy action affecting the accident

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the

Parliamentary debate the previous evening on the

Regulations on new contracts for General Practitioners haJN^v

on the parallel Scottish regulations.   With the long-

important issues involving Hong Kong were likely to

a head within the next few months.   On the first issul

Vietnamese boat people, he had examined the current

situation and had reached the same conclusions as his

predecessors.   It was difficult to avoid a solution which

included an element of non-voluntary repatriation with

appropriate guarantees.   He was keenly aware of the

presentational difficulties.  A decision would be needed

very soon on the timing of the first repatriation, which

was likely to take place after the visit of the Prince of

Wales to Hong Kong from 7 to 13 November, and the Prime

ister&apos;s visit to the United States on 23/24 November,

second issue concerned the pace of democratisation of

political system in Hong Kong.   Work cn this aspect was

 ruing, but was not yet ripe for decision.  On the

^issue, citizenship and nationality, a joint Foreign

xiwealth Office and Home Office team had just

from Hong Kong.   The Heme Secretary and he were

iring a set of measures which would fulfil the

?jmitments made by Ministers.   Although these

issuesX^id not require immediate solutions, he felt it

right to warn colleagues that difficult decisions would be

required before the end of the year.

inconsistent and unacceptable, as Delors prcpreem that a

liberal and market-led framework should be suoa^a^l by a

wholly prescriptive approach. &lt;/



In discussion, it was emphasised that it was most

that all Ministers should speak in identical terms,

least because commentators were scrutinising every

inconsistencies. Although a critique, the Paper was

attack on the Delors ideas: it set out an alternative

approach which required serious consideration.   As had

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that, at the

taken on the Social Charter. He had maintained the United

&apos;s reserve on the substance of the Presidency text

ch presented a nunber of major difficulties. The Charter

&gt;w6uld again be discussed by the Social Affairs Council on

*-venber: before then the Commission would bring forward

tion programme of proposals. This was likely to run

5 40 to 50 pages and would therefore be helpful in

/ ing the argument that the proposed Charter was

^to be simply declaratory. The Charter would again

di $ase?Bd at the European Council on 8 December. Press

THE IDRD !RESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the

Speech had been drawn up in the usual way by the

Speeches and Future Legislation Ccranittee (QL) and

based on the legislative programme which the Cabinet&quot;

approved on 5 October.   The Speech was slightly longer*

usual, reflecting the United Kingdom&apos;s involvement in a

number of significant international developments and the&apos;

very heavy legislative programme for the 1989/90 Session.

It mentioned most of the Bills in the programme and sane

what could be managed.   It wculd be essential for



!leagues to take a very close interest in the preparation

Bills for which they were responsible, and to resist the

.c#nt not be ready for early introduction as hoped,

others had been extended beyond the limits

ori^iuMiy envisaged.   Ihe previous two Sessions had

demorispra ed the importance of making an early start with

majora&amp;ils, and it wculd be vital to ensure that as many

main Bi^ls as possible received a Second Reading before
