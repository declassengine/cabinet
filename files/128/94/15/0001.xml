1. Ihe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Cannons in the following week.



IHE LORD !RESIDENT OF IHE COUNCIL said that there had been a

good response in Parliament and in the media to the legislative

programme announced in the Queen&apos;s Speech on the State Opening

of Parliament.   Although seme press comment had suggested that

the programme was less full than that in the two previous



ions of this Parliament, it remained a heavy one. Moreover,

unusually large number of Bills had early Royal Assent



its attached to them.   It remained important therefore

ist firmly the temptation to add to Bills as they

through Parliament.



In&quot;^brief discussion it was noted that the themes of enlarging

choree, enhancing the quality of life and improving the

protection of the consumer reflected in the Gracious Speech had

been well received.   So too had the Autumn Statement by the



Chancello:

themes were emphasised in constituency

Bills in the programme, that on Human



ryology, which was to be published later

te heated debate on the issues of research

When asked whether amendments about

er xander the Bill, the Secretary of



State for Health baajd&amp;L that the question whether such

2. IHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEAEB^&amp;aid that about 1,200

haemophiliacs in the United Kingdam^ad been infected with human

hnmuno-deficiency virus (HIV) through the use of early

commercial blood products (mainly American) which had been

inadvertently contaminated with the virus ?/^&amp;t of them at a

time when the threat was not appreciated 4(pc$w?ly understood.

This was a tragedy, but it had not been occasioned by negligence

either on the part of the clinicians uwolve^vop^sJ^ the part of

the Government.   Some six hundred of the hae

suing the Department of Health and other

Department was resisting the claim and wculd conf



Nevertheless the position of the haemophiliacs ca

understandably attracted public and Parliamentary

therefore proposed to increase substantially the funds

to the Macfarlane Trust, which had been set up to give



do so.



[confidential!




!confidential]



those haemophiliacs who were in actual financial need because of

their HIV infection.   This would not involve any admission of

negligence or create any difficult precedent.   Sane changes

might be required to the Trust Deed and he would be meeting the

Trustees later that day to put his proposals to them.   A number

of detailed questions concerning, for example, the resourcing of

the arrangements and their impact on the legal aid eligibility

of the haemophiliacs suing his Department remained to be



lved.   He hoped, however, to settle these points in time to

an announcement ty written Parliamentary answer either

that day or shortly thereafter, which if it could not deal

all the details of the proposed arrangement, would at least

what he proposed in broad terms.

Attempts had been made to find a basis upon which detailed

negotiations could take place in the Whitley Council.   The Chief



Executive of the National Health Service

national offic3ers of the Trade Union sid

had proposed a 9 per cent increase in basil

outside London to cover the 18 month period

30 September 1990.   The increase over the

offer would be financed by extending the settl

staff in the London Ambulance Service the

from 10.9 to 12.1 per cent, with 11.8 per cent

ambulance men and women, who were the vast majority

addition, the Chief Executive had proposed an extra

year for staff with paramedical skills, which would

fran new resources.   This would lift the level of

November. He

qualified staff outside London to 14 per cent and add just under

0.5 per cent to this year&apos;s pay bill.   In his view it was right

for these highly skilled people to receive this additional

recognition.



Continuing, IHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEAIIH said that the

established Trade Unions had refused to resume negotiations on

the basis of these proposals.   Ihey had continued to press

licly for an increase this year of over 11 per cent, to

are parity with fifth-year qualified fire-fighters. A

lement cn that basis would not oily have very damaging

!ences for future pay negotiations in the NHS and outside

it was relevant that laboratory and scientific

in the NHS had recently accepted a 6.5 per cent pay

- but would deprive the Service of the true benefit of the

ional resources allocated to it in the Chancellor&apos;s Autumn

He was new minded to have a formal offer cn the



ief Executive&apos;s proposals made to the Association

Personnel (APAP).   This Trade Union,

iliated to the IUC and which had been denied

the Trade Union side, might be disposed to

of the offer to the twenty-five per cent of

claimed to have in its membership. Ihe

ly be extended to members of the other

resumption of normal working.   In his

sing route to an early settlement

allcw the ambulance workers to have

Side&apos;s position.   A difficult

icwever, lay ahead.



IHE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOJTLMWsaid that industrial action

by ambulance workers was spreading rap Scotland.   In seme areas

non-emergency services had been withdrawn.   Ihe Management Side

had made it clear that they were not prepared to pay ambulance

workers in full if the complete range of services was not

available.   This was a reasonable view, whieh^shculd gain

public support.   Ihe Unions had respondedKto^gv^r, by

threatening also to withdraw the accident ara^rMgency

services.   He was in touch with the SecretarJ^voforaate for

Defence about whether the Armed Forces shouldaaStflaiSed on

standby against this possibility.

    CHANCELLCR OF IHE EXCHEQUER said that the trade figures to

be published that day would shew a net deficit for October of  1

V2 billion.   Though not good, this was the best figure since

May and below the  1.7 to  1.8 billion apparently expected by

the market.    It would also help to confirm the credibility of

the forecast of  20 billion for the year as a whole. Export

volumes were growing, being new 10 per cent above their level a

year ago:   and imports were new growing at a lower rate than

/^exports.   But sterling had fallen somewhat since the weekend

^brief discussion, it was noted that an analysis of irtports

which sectors of industry were weak, in many cases

of the perverse policies of past Governments,

tion remained a serious problem, even though the present

rate of 7.3 per cent was better than at any time during the last

THE fRLME MINISTER said that her forthccmA^dQfecussions with

the United States President, Mr George Buaip^-^mp David would

be timely.     President Bush was adopting a p:

approach to the situation in Eastern Europe

need for orderly change.   This approach was ri&lt;

the interests of Britain and the West.   It meant

allies were not likely to be caught off their

United States initiatives.   Western policy took a!

Helsinki agreement, which referred to both European

human rights.   Ihe signatories to the Helsinki Final

committed themselves not to violate the borders of

countries and to accept that any change in the borders could

only be carried out by peaceful means.    Britain was governed in

its policy towards Germany&apos;s borders by the rights and

obligations of the Four Fewer Agreement,   !here could be no

change in Germany&apos;s borders without a peace treaty.   It would

not be in the interests of either East or West to try to

negotiate a treaty at the present time.   If democracy could be

established in Eastern Europe, and ultimately in the Soviet

on, this would in due course open up a vista of new

abilities.    These perceptions were fully shared ty the

States Administration.   But recent remarks by the United

Defense Secretary, Mr Dick Cheney, had not been helpful,

to seme reports, he had spoken about possible

of 5 per cent in defence expenditure over the period

994, on the grounds that the threat from the Warsaw Pact

shed.   It would have been much better if he had

confined himself to stating that cuts might be necessary for the

true reason,^which was the size of the budget deficit.



THE PRIME

the European

President,  

President Mitterrand

number of questions,&apos;

raise the issue of Eu



Ld that she had attended a dinner given for

(EC) Heads of Government by the French

Ltterrand, in Paris an 18 November.

in East Germany, he had made c

just as much importance to deve

The Spanish President, Senor Fell

similar terms, arguing that more

and Hungary.     In her intervention,

questions posed by President Mitterrand.    It would not be right

for EC governments to raise the question of Eurcpean borders,



which must remain off the agenda.   The No

Organisation and the Warsaw Pact should

single most important objective for the W&lt;

establishment of democratic governments and

Europe and the Soviet Union.    Raising the qui

would undermine the President Gorbachev

endanger the prospects for democracy in Eastern

President Mitterrand had agreed, and others had

also added their voices against raising the border

there had been general agreement that every effort must

to enable the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reach

agreement with both Poland and Hungary by the end of the year.

It would not be possible to provide financial help for Poland

without a proper IMF agreement.   Financial help should in

general be dependent on the prior achievement of reed progress

towards democracy: Chancellor Kohl had specifically assented to

this proposition in respect of East Germany.



Continuing, the HUME MINISTER said that she had then turned the

liscussian towards the form of economic and trade co-operation

it the EC should establish with Eastern Europe.   These points

been reflected in her speech at the Lord Mayor&apos;s Banquet on

/ember and in her statements in the House of Commons. The

id^a range of agreements with East European countries



trade agreements, trade and co-operation agreements

nation agreements.   The EC should consider the forms of

it for East European countries which were best adapted to

their particular needs.    President Mitterrand suggested that

seme EastemEuropean countries should be allowed to participate

in EC proawfflmes of which membership was not confined to EC

member stftesJf-Jhis could include EUREKA and ERASMUS. The

Prime MinisQ^Tml suggested that the EC needed to take a clear

decision by 0^ /&amp;&amp; of this year on hew the question of

In a brief discussion, it was pointed out that a further review

would be useful on the provision of food aid to Poland.

Supplies of food were likely to become critical over the winter.

There had been delays in the initial uplift of food aid from

EC.   Polish ports and handling facilities were having

fficulty in coping with the inflcw of meat and other products.

Dr Janusz Onyszkiewcz, the senior adviser to Solidarity,

difficulties.   Although these problems did not yet pose

ical threat to the new Polish government, there was no

for complacency.

for the European Council meeting to be held

4. THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD said that the

Council had reached a decision on changes to the agricultural

structures regulations.   He had had to fight hard, against

strong opposition from the Commissioner Mr Mac Sharry, to

improve the proposed limit per farm for payments an livestock

in hill areas.    The limit would have most impact in the areas

where farming conditions were hardest.   The French Presidency

and certain other Ministers had offered sane support and the

ssion had eventually been somewhat more flexible. The

of livestock within the limit had been more or less



Though less than he would have liked to achieve, this

big improvement on the original proposal.    The Council

so agreed on a one per cent increase in the milk quotas

ect from the current year.    The budgetary cost would be

through cuts elsewhere, but the savings would not take

until the following year.



In a brief discussion it was noted that the limit to payments on

hill lives 0c3\applied to the Community&apos;s contribution to those

payments. UTn^attitude of the Farmers&apos; Unions would depend on

the extentStb^^ph the Government was willing to pay above the

limit at nat\

take the line that sane moves had been made in the United

In a brief discussion, it was noted that tne^donifederatian of

British Industry and other bodies representinhinmjetry fully

supported the Government&apos;s stance:   but they fefi^H&amp;aonly

limited success in mobilising their counterparts/arj^roer Member

protectionist.    A reply to the Prime Minister&apos;s let

President Mitterrand could not be ruled out but it mi
