1.     LORD FRESICENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a group of

Members of Parliament with constituencies in mining areas had

sought to disrupt Government business in the Cannons earlier

that week.   They were principally concerned about the further

progress of a Private Bill, the Associated British Ports (No 2)

Bill.    motion to carry over this Bill to the next

Parliamentary session was due to be debated the following week

and the MPs concerned held responded to the tabling of this by

Axkprolonging proceedings on the Children and Companies Bills,

/^^&lt;^pntrary to the timetable agreed with the Opposition.   As a



^j^sult, a timetable motion on the two Bills would be moved later

day, following questions on the Business Statement. This

provide for proceedings on the Companies Bill to be

1 by 1.00 am the following day and far those on the

. Bill and the Ways and Means Motion on the Football

,.ators Bill to be completed by the end of business on the

following day.   The possibility of the mining group of MPs

deploying^farther disruptive tactics - for example, during

Commons ranstferation of lords amendments on the Local

Governmen^an^ousing Bill -  cculd not be ruled cut, although

the opportumtvHfor this would not arise until after the carry-

real difficulties in providing this service if the ambulance

had to provide a substitute service on a regular basis.   It was

necessary therefore to have in reserve arrangements for using

the armed forces but no alternative agency had either the

equipment or the training needed to provide the full range of

w. ambulance services.   Nevertheless the Secretary of State for

.1th, together with other interested Ministers, must ensure

at adequate contingency plans were made.   It was crucial, if

ationary pay rises in the NHS generally were to be avoided,

Management Side were given full support. Most

_.tly, the Unions should not be allowed to get into a

ition where they could provide a skeleton ambulance service

Continuing, the PRIME MINISTER said that the debate on South

Continuing, the PRIME MINISTER said that there

developments over Namibia.   A number of third

countries were putting forward a resolution in

Nations which would tie the hands of the united Na

Representative, Mr Ahtisaari.    Mr Ahtisaari&apos;s &apos;

of African governments were new worried that the South

that if SWAPO did not obtain such a majority it would fight.

She had pointed out firmly that this attitude bore no relation

to genuine democracy.   Similarly, the report of the

Commonwealth Observers&apos; Group, to which Britain had rightly

decided not to belong, had been very biased.   It had made no

mention of the death camps run by SWAPO in Angola where people

? been tortured.   Although reports of these camps had



1 in the international press, the churches had made no

of them in their recent statements.   Sane of the people

. undergone torture in these camps were now fighting SWAPO

elections.   She had made clear that the Commonwealth

-!!g should not undermine the task of Mr Ahtisaari who had

specifically asked to judge whether the elections had been

properly conducted.

THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE said that, at the meeting of the

Agriculture Council on 23/24 October, the German Minister, with

support from a number of other Member States, had strongly

criticised the decision of the Ccrrmission to determine the

Community&apos;s 1989 cereal harvest at 160.5 million tonnes which,

under the 1988 agreement on agricultural stabilisers, was just

sufficient to trigger an automatic 3 per cent cut in cereals

ort prices for 1990.    This was ironic, since Germany held

icusly been among the Member States pressing for the



don to make the determination at an early stage, when the

of uncertainty was necessarily greater.    Under the 1988

it a further consequence of the harvest exceeding 160

, tonnes shculd be an additional levy on cereals

^v?^ic 1 of 0.3 per cent, but the Commission held proposed that

this shculd be ignored on de minimis grounds, even though the

loss to the Community&apos;s budget would be sane 50 million ECU.
