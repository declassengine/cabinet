1. Ihe Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Cautions in the following week, and of the proposal

that, subject to the progress of business, the House should rise

for the summer adjournment on Friday 28 July until Tuesday 17

October.



SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that in the

week it would be necessary to seek to reverse in the

of Commons an amendment passed in the House of Lords to

Social Security Bill which linked increases in Child Benefit

in Family Credit. Ihe amendment would result in

cant additional expenditure cn Child Benefit - the cost

year&apos;s uprating of benefit would have been  675 million

if the provision held been in force at the time of the

- but reversing it was likely to prove difficult. He

was grateful for the help of the Lords Business Managers in

handling th^SSill, but the difficulties encountered in the House

of LordsfmacWmeant that concessions had had to be made in

relation *SSvaSSb? amendments which were undesirable on policy

grounds, sifc^w^roblems had arisen in the Lords in relation

to seme othe^-^Wernment Bills, which made the satisfactory

the strike nationally. So far there were no reports of

industrial difficulties caused by the strike. Seme 1500 dock

workers had taken voluntary redundancy under the compensation

scheme, which appeared to be working well. On the whole the

port enployers had been successful in putting across the case

for abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme and they continued to

Y OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the situation

caus&amp;l by strike action by members of the National Association

of Local Government Officers (NALGO) was less damaging than

might have Jseen expected. Strike action in the Midlands and

the South ifesSjwas less than it had been the previous week. No

major proB^ems^Jsad been reported with essential services and,

contrary to afaiJ* by NALGO, it appeared that only about half

of NALGO mE9Sb 95)were taking strike action and that this

proportion was



IHE SECRETARY OF STAT

management had met all

for talks  in their

machinery under the auspil

Arbitration Service (ACAS)

talks about pay bargaining

that further talks on that

However, subsequent discussions

National Council had broken down

offered all three rail unions an

pay,  the  increase recommended by



PORT said that British Rail (BR)

way unions on the previous day

about pay and pay negotiating

Advisory Conciliation and

regress had been made in the

and it had been agreed

d take place that day.

jfithin the Railway Staff

Rail management had

of 8.8 per cent on

Railway Staff National



Tribunal (RSNT) in relation to members of the Transport Salaried

Staffs Association (TSSA)  only. This

payable, however,  from the date when

Union of Railwaymen (NUR) and Amalgamated

Engineers and Firemen (ASLEF)  ceased their

action.   The offer was also subject to th

cashless pay and the scaling down of pay suppl

in the South East previously offered by BR. The

representatives had walked out of the talks on h

conditions.    BR had subsequently offered TSSA rep:

payment of the 8.8 per cent pay increase from 10

recognition of the fact that TSSA members had not so

industrial action.    But their offer was otherwise subj

similar conditions on cashless pay and the scaling

for a written statement of the offer made to them, but had

subsequently commented publicly that BR had dishonoured the

RSNT award by attaching conditions to the offer. BR would be

writing to all three unions later that day confirming its

various offers and demanding further talks. Ihe situation could

therefore develop rapidly.



discussion, the following points were made:



The increase in the BR pay offer from 7 per cent to 8.8

cent was a sizeable one.   No additional subsidy would be

liable frcm public funds to meet, the extra cost of this

which would have  to  be  found  from offsetting

ivings, hence the conditions attached to the revised offer.

The supplement for staff in the South East would fall on tap

of the i cseased national pay rate.



m



they had ?

example, to&apos;



Die that BR management had handled the

negotiations badly.    The conditions which

\ed to  their  revised offer appeared, for

taking back seme offers already made.



c.    More serii

in getting its

dispute. This

there   had been

successfully in

the point had not

reasonable for BR&apos;s rev&apos;

those union members, beloi

industrial action, and that

would have to be met by of

increases.



BR management had not so far succeeded

to the public on the issues in

because of a failure to put forward

gement spokesman, partly because

to   marshal   the arguments

gement&apos;s case.   For example,

satisfactorily that it was

fer to treat more generously

the TSSA, who had not taken

in the offer to 8.8%

savings or higher fare



THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the^discussion, said that the

Cabinet were agreed that management&apos;s side of the rail dispute



needed to be presented feu: more skilfully

identify one,  or at most two, credibl

3.        THE  FOREIGN AND OCMMDNWEALIH SECRETARY  said that the

current visit to the United Kingdom of the Prime Minister of

Pakistan, Miss Benazir Bhutto, had been going well and it was to

be hoped that it would be helpful to her in domestic political

terms since democracy in Pakistan was still fragile. During

Miss Bhutto&apos;s meetings with British Ministers the discussions on

d for Pakistan had been satisfactory and there were no major

ateral problems.       Ihe main subject had however been the

tion in Afghanistan.     Miss Bhutto was firm in support of

ghan resistance although inpatient over their political

tence and failure to get rid of the Najibullah regime in

The main problem    remained the continuing lack of

iveness of the interim government and their failures of

communication   with   the   Resistance   leaders   in   the field.

THE FOREIGN AND CCMMONWEAKLH SECRETARY said that the United

States President, Mr George Bush, had catpleted his visit to

Poland and was new in Hungary. His presence had given great

encouragement to democracy. The United States position on

economic assistance was generally close to that of the United

Kingdom. Ihe help he had publicly announced for Poland was

modest - rescheduling of debt due for repayment this year

a sum of $115 million for specific assistance, subject to



ional approved. On the question of Polish debt it was

rtant to maintain pressure for an agreement with the

tional Monetary Fund and for economic reform, and this

to be considered further at the forthexsning Summit of

of State and Government of the seven industrialised

ies in Paris. Recent attempts by the Federal German

Republic to put together a major economic package for Poland

appeared to have failed. President Bush would no doubt also

announce me &amp;jt aid for Hungary during his visit to Budapest

though decBilywere not yet available and the position of the

HungarianNsQygS^was less serious.

savings and Madame Scrivener had not attended the meeting.

However the effective withdrawal of   earlier proposals in this

area had been implicitly conceded by the circulation by the

Commission  of  a note  new headed  Fiscal  Cooperation. The

question hew far member countries might be prepared to   go to

increase measures of cooperation in relation to tax evasion

on this subject in October.    At lunch the Commission

the French Presidency had set out the timetable of work

they envisaged over the next months on Economic and

Union (EMU) to follow up the conclusions of the Madrid

Council.     He had made clear the United Kingdom&apos;s

[tion to develop ideas for alternative models of EMU to

THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the broad p:

Papers published in January had been justif

rights of audience, been seme criticism that



the Green

,the public

khad, on

Paper



proposals would have given the Executive too much

area. He believed that this criticism could be

proposed that barristers qualified by the Bar&apos;s

education and training should have rights of audi!

all courts and tribunals and that the Law Society should

empowered on the face of the statute to declare

qualified to plead in all courts.   This explicit power for



that

He

on



IconfipentiaJ




!confidential!



Law Society would meet the Society&apos;s own representations and

demonstrate that the Government had not weakened in its

determination to make reforms where they were needed. The rules

of the law Society under which they determined qualification for

advocacy would require the concurrence of the Lord Chancellor

and the four Heads of Divisions in the light of advice frcm the

Advisory Committee an Education and Conduct. This

lowed the existing model for judicial approval of the

iety&apos;s rules on advocacy and conduct. The Sub-Ocmmittee cn

ition Policy of the Ministerial Steering Committee cn

Strategy (E(CP)) had broadly endorsed these proposals,

also been concerned that the intention to extend rights

Hence should be stated on the face of the statute. The

redraft of the White Paper attached to C(89) 10 accordingly said,

in paragraph 2.4, that the statute would contain such a

provision y^fetbelieved hcwever that the main emphasis should be

put on thfjmevexplicit pcwer to be given to the Law Society as

soon as tnS^fiSX was passed and it might be that a statement

like that irfjjaraaraph 2.4 would weaken the effect of that

proposal by sftg^Sf/ipg that the extension of rights of audience

lay further

| PONF&gt;0ENTtM}



In discussion, the following were the main points raised:



a.     Paragraph 2.4 of the draft White Paper not only risked

weakening the impact of the decision to give the Law Society

the immediate power to confer rights of advocacy, hut was

unnecessary.    Ihe objectives in paragraph 2.2 were already

sufficient to make the Government&apos;s intentions clear and

?wauld be  put  in the  statute.     Moreover,   the Heads of

.^?bivisian would be bound to take account of the Advisory

*Sj^jfitaimittee&apos;s advice and would be subject to judicial review

^vyM^they did not.     Adding the statement in paragraph 2.4

^^nid reduce the judges&apos;  discretion and might reopen .the

t with them.



b. On the other hand, paragraph 2.4, and especially its

last s^Sfence, was necessary to ensure that intentions

statedffn principle were not frustrated in practice.   It was



not

since

minimal

paragraph

presentatio:

particular to

represented a

THE FRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussi

Cabinet endorsed the lord Chancellor&apos;s p:

three points.    First, as to paragraph 2.4 of th!

Paper, they believed that it was right to put on the

statute a clear statement of the intention to

audience.   The lord Chancellor should, however, in co:

with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and, as

other Ministers  concerned,   reconsider  the drafting

Secondly, he should consider the case for putting a timetable

on consideration by the Advisory Committee and Heads of Division

of proposals to extend rights of audience.   Thirdly, he should

reconsider with  other  interested Ministers the drafting of

paragraph   5.15   of  the  White   Paper   in  the   light   of the

discussion.   The Cabinet agreed that he should then publish the

/desirable that there should be a favourable response to the

6. Hie Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the

Exchequer (C(89)9) on economic prospects and a memorandum by the

Chief Secretary, Treasury, (C(89)8) on the 1989 Public

Expenditure Survey.



CHANCELLOR OF     EXCHEQUER said that economic prospects

not changed fundamentally since the Budget, when the Cabinet

concluded that the defeat of inflation must be the

eminent&apos;s top priority. Such change as there had been served

to reinforce that conclusion. Demand was new expected to be a

little stranger than forecast at Budget time, although the

increase was not in consumption but in investment, where it had

led to pressure in the construction sector in particular. As a

result tf^the higher demand, inflation was also slightly higher

than K S^t at the time of the Budget, with the Retail Price

Index rB^^Dow at 8.3 per cent or 6 per cent if the effect of

mortgage interest rates was removed from the

e growth in demand and inflation also meant that

interest rates were rather higher than

time. The present level of inflation was

the peak, and he expected it to decline

half of the year. The decline would be

the year the RPI might still be at 6 3/4

Against this background, it was essential for political and

economic reasons to retain tight control of public expenditure.



Higher spending would

and the growth of programme expenditi^^i^kexisting plans was

already faster than the projected growth d^Wfce economy. It was

therefore essential to accept the recommendations in the Chief

Secretary&apos;s paper.



    CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that the 1989 Survey was

likely to be exceptionally difficult. Decisions Aready made

had committed an extra  4 billion of spending nexlsb and had

more than exhausted the scope for drawing down

substantial savings on demand-led programmes whicli

the outcome of last year&apos;s Survey would not be

anything like the same scale this year. The use

planning total would make presentation more difficult

make it all the more important to keep a close eye on g&lt;

Government expenditure.   The more general background also

difficult. It was essential to convince the markets that the

Government would continue to follow a prudent policy and give

top priority to the defeat of inflation. And the tax burden was

still higher than it had been when the Government came into

office ten years ago.



Against this background, there had to be very substantial cuts

in the bids which had been made. In total, they would lead to

increase in expenditure which would be quite inconsistent

.th the Government&apos;s objectives and would build up commitments

which would pre-empt the scope for desirable increases in

spending later in the Parliament. Same aspects of the bids

would cause special difficulty. Policy savings would not be

easy to identify and would have to be pursued vigorously where

availjj^^ There had to be an assault on the problem of surplus

sellings



in central Government. The system of cash

bids for higher capital expenditure and their

main influences pushing up running costs. More

decentralisation and flexibility in public sector pay

determination were highly desirable.



d. High interest rates were necessary at present for the

reason given in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s

memorandum. But they were damaging both economically and

politically, and the decisions on expenditure should do

rothing to prolong the period for which they were necessary.



e. A tight fiscal policy was needed to support monetary

policy. Tax reductions next year might not prove to be

desirable especially since they would coincide with the

introduction of the community charge in England and Wales.

Goings further, it could be argued that high interest rates



unlikely to be sufficient to end the overheating

economy.        Retail   demand   had   proved   to be
