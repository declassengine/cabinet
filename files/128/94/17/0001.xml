1. THE ICRD ERESIEENT OF     COUNCIL said that the whole

Cabinet joined in congratulating the Prime Minister on the

outcome of the Conservative Party leadership election earlier

that week.   Ihe result was a recognition of the Government&apos;s

achievements under her leadership over the last 10 years, and

the support which the result had affirmed would sustain and

carry forward those achievements.

Inquiry.   He understood that the C&amp;ositicn front bench

spokesman was likely to take a similar line.   There would be a

free vote at the end of the debate, the outcome of which was

THE PRIME MINISTER said that she had discussed with

eagues most closely concerned the response to be made to the

campaign for increased pensions to be paid to the widows

servicemen killed before 1973.   A number of details remained

considered, including coverage of any proposals and the

possible implications for others, for example the widows of

police officers and other public service employees.   It would be

ind a basis for confining any concession made to

-IHE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEAITH SECRETARY said that the attempts by

the Czech government to form a government acceptable to the

people had not so far succeeded.   Prime Minister Adamec was a

skilful politician but the government would undoubtedly have to

accept further changes.



PRIME MINISTER said that she had attended the meeting of the

i ed States President, Mr George Bush, had given an account of

discussions with the Soviet President, Mr Mikhail Gorbachev,

? their meetings in Malta on 2/3 December,   !here had been

great surprises at Malta.   President Gorbachev had raised the

Continuing, the FRIME MINISTER eiSiO^at President Bush had been

economic and political reform. At the NATO meeting in Brussels,

President Bush had made a formal speech, which had obviously

been carefully drafted at the last mcment^St had contained two

surprises. First, he had spoken of Unitfefl&apos;Suites support for

telephoned her the next day to explain his position, having been

alerted to the way in which the press had interpreted his

remarks.



Continuing, the ERIME MINISTER said that his second point on

further reductions of United States forces was more alarming.

It indicated that defence expenditure was being driven by

budgetary requirements.   Ihe CFE process would take several

?ears to implement.   For example, over 30,000 tanks would need

be destroyed.    It was essential to maintain the NATO defence

r^-ructure.   President Bush, in a carefully drafted formula, had

^etifted that the United States would keep significant numbers of

!iofaA forces and weapons in Europe as long as the NATO Allies

mraed this.    Under the projected CFE agreement United States

forces would be reduced by approximately 30,000 down to a level

of 275,000.   At the Heads of Government lunch, the NATO

Secretary General, Herr Woerner, had urged that no nation should



take uni



action to implement force reductions under a CFE

was right.   Some governments wanted to pocket

knowledge about market economies.   In the light of recent

statements by the united States Defense Secretary, Mr Dick

Cheney, about reductions in defence spending, it was helpful

that the meeting in Brussels had reaffirmed the need to maintain

a stable security framework and to avoid unilateral action.

President Reagan had successfully resisted pressure for defence

cuts.   If President Bush no longer stood out against them, the

pressures would grow.

that while it was possible



to supply Eritrea without needing the co-operation of the

adequate preparation for such a conference, agreed at the Madrid

meeting, had not taken place.    There needed to be prior

discussion of the substance, including the views which had been

set out in the United Kingdom&apos;s paper on the subject. Reports

suggested that Chancellor Kohl had different ideas on procedure.

He favoured setting an end date for the conference and wanted

it also to examine institutional questions such as an increase

in the powers of the European Parliament.    Having made this

position public, it would be less easy for him to retreat frcm

it.    It would, at least, confuse the issue and should make it

ier for the Prime Minister to maintain her position without

press being able to present it as a straight confrontation

the United Kingdom and the other Member States.

results would not emerge for seme time:   public presentation

should emphasise the practical benefits for ordinary people of

Ccmnunity measures of this sort.    Ihe strategy of emphasising

the Single Market at European Councils and directing attention

to the number of measures adopted by successive Presidencies had

been validated.    It was helpful that we had been able to

prevent the Social Charter from assuming a status comparable to

that of the Single Market.    It would be important to stress

diversity and respect for national traditions in order to head

y^/^pff unwelcome parts of the action programme,  !here were

^\^hdications that the United Kingdom paper cn Economic and
