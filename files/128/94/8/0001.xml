1. TOE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the House of lords

would resume sitting on 9 October and the Cannons on 17 October. A

difficult spillover was in prospect, particularly in the House of

Lords, with a number of substantial Government Bills still to

receive Royal Assent.   It had been suggested that some 500 Government

amendments would be tabled to the Local Government and Housing Bill,

which was scheduled to complete its Committee Stage in the Lords on

9-11 October and to begin its Report Stage on 19 October. Cantons

ideration of Lords amendments to the Bill could not be before 6

ember.   Many of the proposed amendments were technical and others

designed to meet commitments entered into during the passage of

ill.   Nevertheless the number of amendments envisaged might

Minister for Local Government the prospects for reducing the number

Parliamercas/^arly in November as possible in view of the heavy

legislatriS^raframme in prospect for that Session.   That progranme

2. TOE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that industrial action by

ambulance drivers had started at midnight, following the rejection by

the National Union of Public Enplcyees (NUPE), after two separate

ballots of its members, of the National Health Service (NHS) Whitley

Council&apos;s 6.5 per cent pay offer.   The handling of the dispute was

potentially difficult, particularly in view of seme settlements

since the offer was node and the public synpathy the ambulance

drivers might attract.   The 6.5 per cent offer was, however,

^consistent with settlements already concluded with other NHS staff in

pay round, including seme groups which had a more compelling

for a higher award than the ambulance drivers.   The nurses had



a 6.8 per cent settlement following the introduction of

new salary structure in 1988.   NUPE&apos;s expectations had no 

risen following the more recent settlements with the railwaymen

with local government staff at 8.8 per cent.   In addition, the

ambulance drivers were seeking to compare their case to that of other

emergency service workers who had received higher pay increases,

particulif^N firemen.   It would be regrettable if the ambulance

drivers (sgcirai a higher settlement than other NHS staff had dene.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FCR NORTHERN IRELAND said that both the

marching season in Northern Ireland and the 20th anniversary of the

deployment of British troops on the streets of Belfast and

Londonderry had passed off more quietly than had been feared. This

heid been due to seme remarkable attrition of terrorist organisations

ty the security forces and lack of enthusiasm for collective action

among members of the republican community.  However, recent

allegations of leaks of information about republican terrorists frcm

of the security forces to protestant paramilitary groups and

affair of Corporal Hastie, combined with the first death in

from the use of plastic baton rounds since March 1986, had

disquiet in the nationalist community and in the Government of

ish Republic, and it was clear that they would lead to a

ficult meeting of the Anglo-Irish Conference the following day.

he and the Secretary of State for Defence had been at pains to

make clear that the rule of law would prevail among the security

forces, andhe would speak robustly in these terms at the Conference.

THE ERIME MINISTER said that any widenoe of wrong doing in the

security forces should be pursued Vigorously.   It was also important

to recall the very great bravery of members of the security forces;

for example, 174 members of the UER had bpon murdered, the great

majority of them off-duty.   She had beer/aipressed during her visit

to the Province both by the increased pr^sge&amp;fcy which she had found

and by the lack of any protest about the AimcHlrish agreement, other

than the absence of Unionist MPs from publis^gwfOts.



%&gt;



THE HCME SECRETARY said that the statistics of dru

drug offenders dealt with in 1988 would be publish(

shewed a 27 per cent increase in the number of sei

drugs.   The quantity of cocaine seized was for the seed

running greater than that of heroin: the quantity of

]CONFIDENTLY



had remained about level.   Ihe number of convicted drug offenders had

risen by 16 per cent to a new record level of 30,500.   It was

particularly encouraging that the number of confiscation orders made

under the Drug Trafficking Offences Act had increased: drug dealers

had been ordered to pay a total of  8.1 million as compared with  1.2

million in 1987.   The statistics showed that the Government was right

in pursuing a vigorous attack on the threat from illicit drugs, which

in total was becoming more serious.



a brief discussion, it was pointed out that a campaign was being

ed in sane British periodicals, including The Economist, in

of legalising the sale of drugs.   This was highly

:ible.    The Heme Secretary had-recently made a speech

this campaign and was preparing further material for

to draw upon.

Archbishop Tutu had tried unsuccessfully to persuade Western

Britain had brought about improvements in the directive but were

which was likely to be approved at the Foreign Affairs Council in

early October.   He had explained the provisions of the present

directive, including the improvements obtained by Britain.



In a brief discussion, it was noted that the directive still

itained protectionist features, since the French Government was

termined to protect the role of the French language.
