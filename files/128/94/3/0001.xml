1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in

the House of Commons in the following week.



    SECRETARY OF STATE PCR     ENVIRONMENT said that he was

grateful to the Lord Privy Seal and to the Captain of the

Gentlemen at Arms far their skilful handling of the Water

Bill, which had completed its passage through the House of

lords earlier that week. Only two amendments had been

carried against the Government: at Cannons ? consideration

lords&apos; amendments on the following Monday and Tuesday,

would be inviting the House to overturn an Opposition

which sought, in effect, to set a deadline of

for the completion of the extremely expensive

of work which would be required to meet the

Community drinking water directive; and

iations were continuing on whether an acceptable

compromise could be reached on the amendment sponsored by

lord Radnpe^which sought to require water undertakers, in

general, /xorocure the approval of landowners before laying

pipes cnV^sijea^Land. It was essential that the Bill should

proceed to (?oyaJ Assent in the following week, as planned,

in order toxtfl&amp;t&amp;in the timetable for flotation.

2. IHE SECRETARY OF

Work Bill had completed

Lords unamended and was ony

Reading in the lords and

Monday.   The regulations to

laid immediately thereafter,

the  Transport   and General

members was likely to be

after the Dock Labour Scheme was



      said that the Dock

Assent on the following

under the Bill would be

t of the ballot of

Union ? s dockworker

Friday 7 July, 4 days

to be abolished. It



was sensible to plan on the basis that strike action would

take place, but if so it would be againej he background

that all port employers would in future u  fqjee to recruit

nan-registered labour and that redundasSy^p&amp;yments for

those registered dock workers who took strideja&amp;Xon would

be put at risk.

the position on industrial action in the economy&apos;ge

could become more difficult oyer the following 2?

the transport unions were threatening a further

stoppage on the following Wednesday on British RaifT

Association were threatening to mount a 24-hour stoppage in

the following week and two such stoppages in the week afteij

that; and there was also the possibility of strike action

by dock workers.   Strike action by all those workers might

coincide in the week beginning 10 July.   These disputes all

involved public sector workers, with the exception of the

protest over the abolition of the Dock Labour Scheme which

nevertheless had a public sector element to it.   A carmen

theme to the disputes was that they were concerned not only

th pay but  also with the modernisation of working

  .practices, on which the private sector had generally made

&lt;&gt;5jhk necessary changes several years previously.

SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the previous

day industrial action by members of the National Union of

RailwaymoH^N/NUR) had resulted in no trains running on

British (BR)   and minimal  services on the London

seme ackiimopai services had been provided, although

traffic   cong9^0on   in   London   had   been considerable.

determined to stand firm

the  NUR  on  pay and

the auspices of the

[on Service.   On London

there were some small



Talks&apos;



productivity were continuing

Advisory, Conciliation and Arbii

Buses, the dispute was about pay/

signs of movement by the union involved, the Transport and

General Workers Union (TGWU). On British Rail there were

disputes about pay and about the^^SXroducticn of

decentralised pay bargaining arrangements ? ^British Rail

management was determined to see the ^. ^. ,  .  ^,

about which there was ample time for negct 1 x*Kas it was

not envisaged that the new arrangements wMdybegin to

operate until November. As regards the BD&amp;g b Rail

dispute cn pay, the right course under

agreed procedures was for the NUR and ASLEF to

grievances to the Railways Staff National Tri

other rail union, the Transport Salaried

Association, had already done, but they had so far

to do this.   British Rail management were mounting an



!confidential]


!confidential!



advertising campaign aimed at persuading NUR and ASIEF

members and the general public that this was the right

course.   In the short term he was considering what furthey

steps could be taken to help commuters: a decision would

have to be made within the next 24 hours on whether to mate

available, at 3 days notice, some 7,000 additional parking

spaces in central London, for example in Royal Parks, with

an equivalent number further out fran where commuters could

be bussed to the centre.     Ihe police had so far, however,

been opposed to such a step on the grounds that provision

^ f extra parking would attract more cars into central

&apos;v^ondon,   so worsening traffic problems.     He would see

&lt;^*jjj^fther more buses could be made available, especially in

, although they were in short supply because of the

rmal demand.    For the longer term, the  Chairman of

Regional Transport had been asked to speed up

cut more London bus routes to competitive tender:

it was noteworthy that there had been no industrial action

so far oa^a y of the 25 per cent of London bus routes which

were alfcpady operated under tender.      It would also be

In discussion the fol



a.    It was becoming

to the general public

commuters, such as

being taken. On the

about   the possibility

problems, either in the

to   London, was



in points were made:



ingly difficult to explain

ial measures to assist

,additional car parks, were

the police&apos;s concern

adding   to traffic

on key approach routes

and might  well be



justified in the light of past experience. The police

were also bound to have in mind the experience of the

day of the Old Bailey and other t^Sfrwrist bombings,

which demonstrated the opportunity ( xiV_^ijxumstanoes

provided to terrorists. One way of pb^roNJj minimising

the traffic problem might be to use\vaw&gt;^dditional

parking spaces for buses rather than cars.



b. Other possible ways of easing probl

staggering working hours and journey

encouraging car sharing, needed to be examined.

c. Since the rail system had shewn that it was

unreliable, there might be a dfcse fear the Government

reviewing the relative priority which it bed given road

and rail within its transport progranme. The Government

had recently announced a major increase in spending cn

roads: it was arguable that the road progranme itself

should be examined to ensure that it gave the right

priority to roads which would help get people to work.

The more that satisfactory alternative means of getting

people to work could be developed, the more British Rail

would risk permanently losing passengers.



d. It was important that employees taking industrial

&quot;7/action should feel the effect on their pay packets. It

/X*Jas unclear whether the striking union members were

\C being affected in this way or whether the tax system



^ operated in seme fashion to cushion the blow.   The point

was worth examining further.



e. /%e entationally, the coverage by the media of the

strix^^j^j^d to be moving in the Government&apos;s favour.



the Official Opposition had no effective

IHE HCME SECRETARY said that there was a continuing series

of protests by members of the Muslin community against Mr

Salman Rushdie&apos;s book  &quot;Satanic Verses&quot;.     This was a

^^difficult  issue  for the Government  since  it was not

?. -//possible   to   meet   the   protestors&apos;   main   demands: in

(tanic Verses^O^rticular, it would not seem right either to extend the



of   blasphemy   to   cover   religions   other than

ianity or to create a new offence of incitement to

_ious  hatred.      Following several  of the protest

^ings, groups of young Muslims, sometimes as many as 200

strong, had resorted to disorder and violence.   He had the

power to ban processions,   on application by the Chief

Constable^aad the local authority,  if serious disorder

could ncnMoyierwise be avoided; and Chief Constables were

empcwerecS^V^^ditpose   conditions   on   meetings   if they

ar icipatem^rlajs disorder, although there was no power

to ban sucir^S$j$ngs.    It would be helpful if colleagues



leaders in their constituencies and

disorder associated with the recent

their cause.

there was now broad international support in particular

Ihe United States had however been consistently unhelpful

on this question.     He had seen the Vietnamese Foreign

^Minister, Mr Nguyen 00 Ihach, on 28 June.   The latter had

resist  repatriation even if they were not actively

While the French Presidency might well carry forward worlj
