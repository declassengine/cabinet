These would show a fall in the seasonally adjusted

had been a fall in the total.   There had been a

internal repression.   At a meeting of the Foreign Affairs

Council in Luxembourg on 12 June Eurcpean Community Foreign

Ministers were agreed in condemning the repression while

stepping short of cutting off economic ties with China,

which could be used as a lever to influence internal

policy.   In China itself, those British citizens who wished

to leave had mostly done so, though a number had chosen to

y on.   Only essential staff now remained in the British

though its visa section would shortly be resuming

business.   The United States had provoked Chinese

by giving refuge in its Embassy in Peking to the

Embassy in London had applied for asylum, and his

casfi^as being considered by the Heme Secretary. Other

simS^r applications were likely and would have to be

considered, including those of students who feared

persecution if they returned to China.    To the extent that

these includej^students on scholarships to which the

British Go^crn^nt contributed funding there would be

Herr Kohl had also condemned the Berlin Weill as a

been generally unexceptionable, with strong references to

the Social Charter amounted to a bid for protectionism on a

major scale.   For example the intention was that if a

Portuguese contractor tendered for work in Germany, his

workers should be paid German rates, thus denying him any

comparative advantage.   The Portuguese authorities might

acquiesce in these provisions on the basis that they would

look for compensation for such provision through structural

istance.   For their part Germany might feel able to go

with the Commission proposal because of the major

fits they in practice enjoyed through access to East

Germany on-costs related to social security and



fits amounted to seme 98 per cent.   A number of

s new being put forward by the Commission, such as

ty leave and treatment of part-time workers, had

been &quot;canvassed in the past.   In resisting such Commission

proposals it had been found helpful in the past to seek to
