THE SECRETARY OF STATE PCR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he

osed to make a statement that afternoon about the sale of

Rover Group to British Aerospace pic (BAe).   report in

morning&apos;s Guardian, referring to a leaked confidential

urn prepared by the Comptroller and Auditor General and

to the National Audit Office (NAD) Report on the Rover

e, had alleged that the Government had concealed frcm

r_an Commission payments of around  38 million to BAe.

. report was due to be discussed by the Public Accounts

Committee (PAC) in closed Session on 4 December, but he believed

it right in the circumstances to volunteer a statement to

Parliament^^Sfe would inform the Chairman of the PAC of his

intentional We wculd also clear his statement with the

Secretary o?^ afee for Health, who, as Chancellor of the Duchy

there was a good possibility that this would encourage Berbers

of other trade unions to do 80.    Meanwhile, the unions in

dispute were attempting to extend their industrial action, with

varying results.   They were meeting that day to consider means

of further escalation,  but overall  it was uncertain what

success they would have.       walk-cut by London Ambulance

Controllers the previous day had gained seme publicity but had

well handled by management.     It was ironic that the

a.oilers - who had since returned to week - had themselves

finally insisted on the introduction of the procedures which

now claimed were  leading to unacceptable delays in

by  police   and  military  vehicles   at emergency

Nevertheless, despite this reassurance, there was considerable

anxiety about United States&apos; intentions. Although Mr Cheney had

said that there would be no fixed agreement at the united

governments had been conveyed to Mr Cheney who had

    &gt;$CRD PRESIDENT OF     COUNCIL said that following

discussions with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the lord

Privy Seed, he had put proposals to the Prime Minister for

increases ir^ttnisteried salaries to accanpany the increase in

Parliamente(&amp; felaries to take effect frcm 1 January 1990.

Under the am^rapts for automatic increases in Parliamentary

salaries, thRj?^pliamerrtary element of Catmcns Ministers&apos;

salaries wcul&lt;T^Kabease by 10.76%, that is  1953. He believed

that the overeay/zparease in the package for Ministerial

salaries must be 0?&amp;^ lower percentage than that, especially

in the light of the c&amp;pfent industrial action in the Ambulance

Service. He proposeK^Bstefore that Ministers should receive

the same overall dfe&amp;wircrease as backbench Members of

Parliament, namely  2595      Cabinet Ministers in the Camions

this wculd represent a ? ? ?^ increase of 4.9% (including the

increase in the Pari iamenGflrw^ement). For Cannons Ministers

as a whole, the average iixx^perojld be 6.2%.



Continuirg, the D3RD FRESIEENf^jir THE COUNCIL said that the

Government were experiencin^^^^iderable difficulty in

recruiting and retaining junior Mumraprs in the House of Lords.

On taking office. Lords Ministersfcffet their eligibility for

the attendance allowance they coula^claim as backbench peers,

unlike their Oatroons counterparts they received no Additional

Cost Allowance. This issue had been looked at a number of times

before, and he proposed to look again a^^jfce arguments for

giving Lords Ministers some form of ackiiti^djrOTuneration. In

the meantime, he proposed that in eKHitioiv^ti^tra general cash

increase of  2594, all Lords Ministers Q&amp;4frs receive an

additional  1000, making  3594 in toted. There^aCKLhave to be

equivalent cash additions for other paid office-rakfera in the

lords, which would mean an overall increase in^fc(Cxfc&gt;rds Pay

Bill of 10.8%. However, he believed that this^^ld be

presented as a sensible restructuring. The overall 4&amp;&amp;G$$e in

the Pay Bill for Lords and Cannons Ministers ccmbi

this basis be 7%. He hoped to be able to

that the increases could be brought into effect on 1 January

In discussion the following main points were raised:



a. An increase in the pay bill for Ministerial salaries of

7% was highly undesirable at a time when ambulance and other

National Health Service workers had been offered a national

increase of 6.5% and inflation was projected to fall by the

end of 1990 to 5 3/4%. Ihe media would inevitably present

the increase in a way intended to damage the Government. It

Ld be presentationally much better to keep the overall

in the Ministerial pay bill to 6.5%.



proposed,  to give, an additional    1000 to Lords

, though fully justified, distorted the position,

increase for Cabinet Ministers was under 5%, well below

the   current   inflation  figure.      lhis   fact  was however

unlikely to be highlighted  in media  reports.      in the

previcuj^ye^r, an increase of just 3% had been portrayed as



a si



m



cash rise.

in return for a firm undertaking to

en to the problem.       separate

date of such a solution would not

in the overall pay bill to 6.5% would be to make an arbitrary

reduction in the cash increase for Cabj/^fe^or edl Ministers.

Awarding Ministers an increase in the (ferj4 mentary element

THE FRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion?

Cabinet entirely endorsed the need for an imp:

remuneration of Lords Ministers.   However, an

of 7% in the Ministerial pay bill was highly undes:
