1. THE ICRD EKESIESNT OF THE COUNCIL said that Parliament would

prorogue the following day.   Ihe successful completion of this

session&apos;s programme was satisfying, although there were a number

of lessons to be learned from the experience of the session

which he asked colleagues to take into account in the handling

of Bills in the new session.   These included avoiding extending

the scope of Bills beyond that originally agreed by QL and

.Cabinet, and avoiding adding to Bills as they went through

^Warliament unless this was strictly necessary to secure their

^^Sgtisfactory passage.   The problems encountered in handling

^baj&amp;ness in the Commons towards the end of the present session

&lt;2iiKKf5wed much to the objections of MPs from mining



ies to the Associated British Ports   (No 2) Bill, but

so raised the whole question of the procedure followed by

Pri^te Bills.   The business managers were consider ing what

steps could be taken to avoid similar difficulties at the start

of the new session, and in the longer term were looking at

whether aijf^C^^qes were needed to Private Bill procedure.

2.     SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEAIHH said that there had been

relatively few developments in the industrial action by

ambulance workers during the previous week.  The Armed Forces,

together with tine police and voluntary services, had been

remarkably successful in providing an accident and emergency

service in London.   There had been no serious problems, and

public and press interest in the dispute had therefore waned.

  remained pessimistic about the prospects of an early

!ttlement to the dispute.   The action was likely to spread over

next few days to the West Midlands and other regions: the

Forces were on standby to be called in there if necessary,

spoken to regional Chairmen to encourage them to react in

way to increased Union action in different

services.   At a press conference the previous day he

?w to move matters forward by indicating that pay talks

could resume if the Unions agreed to operate the 999 emergency

service normally in London and the rest of the country.   He had

also said Jfctjak. local pay additions might be available for

pressure would be greater because we farmers involved had no

means of gaining swift compensation Trom the feed merchants. A

longer term problem lay in deciding whether the animals who had

eaten the contaminated feed could be slaughtered for human

consumption.   Testing for lead in meat wa|/ve^j complicated and

the processes for doing it were only just xaiflj^astablished.

The decision would therefore not be easy to . and could be

3.     PCKEIGN AND OCM-ENWEAITH SECRETARY said that events in

East Germany had moved very rapidly, particularly following the

measures taken to introduce freer travel between East and West

Berlin.   Ihe key question now was whether the East German

government would agree to hold free elections.   Their intentions

were still obscure.   The new Prime Minister, Herr Hans Modrow,

the former Party Secretary in Dresden, had been elected on 13

.November.   He had the reputation of a reformer.   The Party



_ held been brought forward to 15/17 December.   This was

to be a crucially important occasion.   The opposition

were pressing for free elections, but did not want these

place immediately since they were not yet ready. There

The Prime Minister had been in close touch with other

- leaders.   Despite excessive press speculation, allied

governments had reacted steadily and with caution.   This had

emerged clearly at the Western Eurcpean Union Ministerial

meeting 00^3^14 November.    The French President, M. Francois

Mitterrand higa^ organised a meeting of European Community (EC)



er.   It was to be hoped that EC leaders

support and welcome for the changes taking

In discussion, the following points were made:

It was essential to maintain existing institutions,

especially the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Ministers

should not raise the issue of German reunification, which was

not an immediate issue.   Progress had already been achieved

on strengthening the EC&apos;s economic relations with East

European countries.   The EC had signed trade agreements with

Poland and Hungary, and an association agreement with

Yugoslavia.   In due course Poland and Hungary might want to

negotiate association agreements.   Such a development was

y*y\ unlikely to cause major problems for the Soviet leadership.

^V,X03ntinue to take a measured and prudent attitude, there was a

&lt;  j3$^k that President Gorbachev might be swept away. This



cause grave damage to the broader Western objective of

__ing democracy throughout both parts of Europe, and

^ imately frcm the Atlantic through the Soviet Union to the

borders of China.   The EC could not ignore these crucially

important processes of historic change which would have a

profounjJ^S^ect on developments within the Community.

other reforming East European countries would have great

difficulty in practice in implementing the structured

changes necessary to create genuine market economies based on

private enterprise.   This was likely to be a long process.



West Germany had a trade surplus of G5 billon with the

: of the EC in 1988.   Closer economic links between East

West Germany would present a formidable challenge to the

^_y 80 million people this econcmic entity would have a

or distorting effect on EC projects for closer economic

financial unity and the concept of the Single Market.

Ihe EC could not afford to ignore this emerging reality.

The process would also affect the EC&apos;s relations with the

Eurcpean Etee Trade Area (EFTA).   Ihe EC&apos;s import standards

Treasury (C(89)13), on the 1989 Public Expenditure Survey.



THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that at the start of the

bilaterals the bids he had received totalled some  13 billion

for 1990-91, rising to  17 billion and  23 billion for the two

later years.   The Government was already committed to increases



1990-91 of over  4 billion, and there was less scope for

savings than there had been the year before.   The room for

manoeuvre had therefore been limited.   Nevertheless, with the

help of colleagues, he had had a satisfactory round of

bilaterals and had agreed significant reductions in the bids.

THE OiANCELIOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Chief Secretary

was to be congratulated on the skilful conduct of this year&apos;s

Survey, which had been a difficult one from the outset.   In the

as a whole, it had became apparent by July that demand

had continued to grow more quickly than had been expected at

Budget time.   More recent events had confirmed this buoyancy of

demand.   He now expected that, as a result, the current account

deficit for this year would be  20 billion as against the

    CHANCELLOR OF     EXCHEQUER continued that, as to public

expenditure, he proposed to leave the estimate of privatisation

proceeds unchanged at  5 billion a year.   He also proposed to

fix the Reserve at  3 billion,  6 billion and  9 billion in the

three Survey years.   These figures were lower than those fixed

in the last Survey, but the Reserve would no longer have to

accommodate the risk of overruns in self-financed local

uthority expenditure,   ihe result was that the Planning Total

in the three Survey years would be  179 billion,  192 billion

and  203 billion, and general government expenditure  215

billion,  227 billion and  239 billion.   Over the next two years

 5.5 billion and  6.5 billion higher than the figures



in the 1988 Autumn Statement.   These figures were

higher than the markets were expecting, but lcwer than

rate of growth as forecast in last year&apos;s Autumn Statement for

c.    The project of a downturn in private capital

investment was highly unwelcome since other countries were

likely to continue investing at a high level. One

particular concern was that the united Kingdom would fail to

get a proper share of the substantial inward investment into

the European Ocmoounity likely over the next few years. Seme

measures to encourage continued investment might be

considered as part of the Budget strategy.   But the current

prospect was that although capital investment would not

continue to increase during 1990 at the very high level of

this year, it would still show satisfactory growth.



markets would be interested in the prospects for

aggregates.   To retain confidence, it would be

to shew that the long-term trend for them also was

cry.   It was expected that MO would move down



target range of 1-5 per cent this year.   A target

range   (  per cent had been set for next year. Movements

in broad money were difficult to interpret, but there were

signs of^ie#levelling off in its growth.



e.     It woul^l^important in presentation to stress that

prospects fo^u^^onany were still good.   Ihe Opposition

would no doubt ^Eanti that it was entering a recession. The

forecast that RPI inflation would still be at 5 3/4 per cent

in the last quarter of 1990 would also attract criticism.

However, the continued increase expected in exports and

capital investment would j^p to shew the underlying strength
