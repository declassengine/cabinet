1. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Foreign and

Camcnwealth Secretary (C(89)14) seeking approval for a draft

statement which he proposed to make to Parliament the following

day announcing the Government&apos;s decisions on assurances to Hong

Kong.



?IHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the proposals

in his Memorandum were the culmination of lengthy consideration

the Sub-Committee on Hong Kong of the Defence and Oversea

icy Committee.   Ihe essential purpose of the proposed scheme

to persuade Hong Kong residents that they could safely

there and that it was in their interests to do so. The

ittee had concluded that the award of citizenship would

re effective than the award of right of abode in this

, and had therefore approved the former option despite

the disadvantage that it required primary legislation.   A scheme

based on citizenship had the further advantage that it would be



diffj



for a Government of a different complexion to

proposed overall ceiling of 225,000 including

the bottom end of expectations in Hong Kong,

not to bring them to Britain. The Gov

he would also draw attention to similar

other countries. The proposals aimed to strike&apos;

between the needs of Hong Kong and the immigration

the united Kingdom, if contrary to his expectation

recipients of citizenship decided to come to the Ur

at worst the country would have gained a number of

had been selected far their talents dnd experience.  The stakes

were high;   if Hong Kong opinion were not reassured and a crisis

of confidence occurred, there oould be a real risk of a major

refugee influx into the United Kingdom on a far larger scale

than the figures suggested in his Memoranda?.



In discussion, the following main points were made:



a.   Ihe Government had a duty to provide suitable assurances

yy\ for those in Hong Kong, particularly for public servants who

^^^V. because of their past and continuing work might be at risk

Ay under Chinese rule.  Ihis factor of moral responsibility

v ~^d10uld be stressed both in public presentation and to the

s supporters in Parliament.



Citizenship would give recipients a better incentive to

remain in Hong Kong than right of abode, whose benefits

oould be enjoyed only by coming to the United Kingdom. Ihe

latter^sasiirement had sometimes worked to the United



in the past.



c. Ihe

those

would be

Hong Kong in,

going. &lt;^



. in the statement to anchoring in Hong Kong

to be retained there was misleading. It

speak of encouraging them to remain in

likely to be ass

British economy.   It could be

had been short-sighted in not

who wanted to invest here

those who came were

there were already

immigrants.



e.   The ceiling chosen shculd~ (5:ike a balance between the

anxieties of Hong Kong in the wake of events in China

earlier in the year, and the impact of possible substantial

immigration on the united Kingdom and cndcmestic opinion.



f. The beneficiaries selected under

heads of household, and there would be

Kong and in the United Kingdom for the

expressed in those terms.



g. Although the appropriate multiplier for

of household to total beneficiaries including

difficult to quantify, the figure of 3.75 impli

draft statement was probably too low if account

children who might be born after the award of

daughters who might later marry aM bring their husbands to

the United Kingdom, and elderly relatives, none of whoa

oould easily be denied right at abode. This suggested that

unless the total of head of household beneficiaries were

reduced significantly below 60,000, the total number of

beneficiaries including dependants might exceed 225,000,

perhaps by a large margin.   It would be important not to put

to Parliament a mare definite figure than it was possible to

achieve and on these grounds the limit was better expressed

in terms of heads of household.   50,000 heads of household

v^v. was the lowest figure which would carry conviction in Hong

y/y Kong;   although domestic opinion would no doubt prefer a

&lt;^^^cwer total.



^    It was arguable that the Bill should specify a ceiling,

^fyhether in terms of heads of household or inclusive of

dependants, since if this were left to implementing

regulations the latter might not be endorsed by Parliament.



*BE*



important that key public servants who received

should remain at their posts until 1997;



of the scheme would be defeated, and

of the same posts wculd then have to be

included iSrttfe^cheme.   This oould be an argument for

making theiMgSienship effective only from 1997. Against

this, a post-MaNkd2jward of citizenship, even if legally

possible, would^MM^to give reassurance since it could be

more easily recWfl w a future Government.



proposals frcm the

Parliament stemmed frcm a variety

on in principle to any further

likelihood of the scheme

ingness to tamper with

and concern about the

.ty, particularly in the

be correspondingly harder

Government&apos;s supper

Midlands.    An overall

including dependants was hi!

quoted in the press and it



to secure its acceptance.  An indication that the award of



assurances under the scheme would be

years would be helpful in presenting

Government&apos;s supporters.   It would

to hold a proportion of places back f&lt;

sensitive posts near the end of the peri

helpful to state this.   It would also be

obligation to provide assurances in the farm of a right of abode

in the United Kingdom far a limited number of key people in Hong

Kong.  Ihese assurances, if they were to be effective, would

need to take the farm of a citizenship scheme on the lines

proposed in the paper by the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.

Ihe statement to Parliament, which should be made on 20

December, should indicate that a ceiling of 50,000 heads of

household would apply, covering all categories; that the places

would be allocated over a period of years; and that a proportion

f the 50,000 places would be held back far allocation nearer to

97.   The estimate of the total of those eventually entitled to

to the United Kingdom, including dependents, should be

on the best available advice on the multiplier factor,

should also take realistic account of the requirements

had to be satisfied by those seeking to bring elderly



its.   The statement should stress the moral obligation

, on the United Kingdom to provide adequately for those in

Hong Kong whose services were required there in the years to

1997, and^teuld also indicate that implementing legislation

would bef/fntttoduoed at the earliest opportunity.  A revised

statemern^yaaaid be circulated to the Ministers most closely

concerned.

equally discourteous if it learned of the Government response

from the PCA&apos;s report rather than directly fran the Secretary of

State.



THE PRIME MINISTER, sunning   the discussion, said that the

Cabinet recognised the risk of protest if the report was not

published ahead of the statement.   On the other hand, the

Secretary of State for Trade and Industry should not be deprived

the opportunity to make his statement to the best possible

feet.   In consultation with colleagues concerned, the lord

ident of the Council should consider further the timing of

^jS&amp;various statements to be made that day, bearing in mind the

^gg*^ made in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.

There had been no move at all irMfr^faemands made by the

This reflected both the success of tfte tactic  employed by NUPE

to undermine the APAP ballot, and the large number of ncn-

paramedical ly trained staff in the Association to whom the offer

was less attractive than to their trained colleagues.



NHS management had also offered the Unions a Christmas truce,

under which emergency crews wculd receive full pay provided they

operated a normal accident and emergency service within TOO

guidelines.   This offer had been rejected, however. NUPE



to be reducing cover in a number of areas, such as

and pressures wculd grow as Christmas approached,

was a strong possibility that because they did not wish to

over Christmas without pay, ambulance staff wculd find a

to withdraw cover in certain areas.  The Armed Forces

police and voluntary organisations should nevertheless

&gt;le to cope over this period and they wculd be looking to

improve the service they provided even further, for example by

improving arrangements in the operational control at New

THE FOREIGN AND OCMCNWEALIH SECRETARY said that there had been

^^Marge-scale unrest in Romania.   This had been among the

^^^mgarian minority in Transylvania rather than in the capital,

v^^i&amp;harest.   It had focussed on a Protestant pastor, Mr Laszlo

, whom the Romanian authorities had tried to evict. A

of the British Embassy in Bucharest had established that,

, nothing appeared to have happened to Mr Takes.   It was

clear if the unrest would spread but it seemed unlikely to

through the population as a whole.   Ihe disturbances might

mark the beginning of the end far President Oeausescu, although

the end mieg*t take seme time to arrive.  Ihe Soviet Foreign

pressure for the obligatory harmonisation of VAT rates within a

of 14 to 20 per cent,   or alternatively far an obligatory

rate.    Because he had been unable to go along with such

complaints by the Government&apos;s backbench supporters about delays

by Departments in replying to letters from Members. Ministers

in charge of Departments should review their Departments&apos;

performance in this respect, and ensure that arrangements were

designed to minimise delay.   The use of standard letters where

appropriate; effective arrangements far ensuring that sensible

decisions were made about the handling of letters immediately

they were received; and the nomination of a junior Minister with

^Responsibility for overseeing the efficiency of departmental

^^^rangements were all matters to be considered in this context.
