In discussion, the following points were made:



a.    The 9.25 per cent pay settlement for the police

could have an adverse effect on other pay negotiations,

although the job of the police was unique and was

/\^^&gt; 16^1 0*^     their special pay arrangements.



&lt;X/^b.    ihe consequence of any higher pay settlement for
