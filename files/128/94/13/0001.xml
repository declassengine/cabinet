1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the

House of Commons and the House of Lords in the following week.



    LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a debate on the

ambulance dispute would take place later that day under Standing

Order 20.   This would mean the postponement to the following

session of the proposed debate on Parliamentary Pensions. With

exception, the programme of business in both Houses was on

for Parliament to prorogue as planned on 16 November.

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that in July the

Government had announced that the Magnax power stations would

remain in the public sector when the electricity industry was

privatised.   This decision had proved hard to implement, mainly

because National Fewer (NP) had made difficulties about

splitting their staff and might have tried to argue that the

arrangement would not provide enough assurance on safety. The



ision not to privatise Magnox had affected the market&apos;s

perception of nuclear power more generally, and had, in

particular, made it much more difficult for NP to make

satisfactory arrangements for financing the construction of

Pressurised Water Reactors (FWRs).   At the same time, the



of EWR costs had escalated, and it new appeared that

)ty frcm FViR stations would cost more than twice as much

{ frcm fossil fuelled stations.   NP had therefore

they could finance the EWRs only if the Government

Lly all the risks.   Privatisation on this basis



He had therefore concluded that in the

nuclear stations, not just the Magnox

stained in the public sector.   The company

to run them should provide a positive cash

Die return cn assets.



He had also reviewpTtRe nuclear progranme itself.   Flotation of

the electricity industry would not be possible unless the

Government said firmly what its plans were for the IWRs after

Sizewell B.   The case for these stations had rested largely on



grounds of diversity and

competition would now br

mainly gas; the life of

the capacity to burn oil

considerable transfers of

Scotland and France.   He had tfi

Fossil Fuel (*)ligation for the

level which did not require the

stations beyond Sizewell B. The

These decisions were essential if the Government was to achieve

its objective of privatising the electricity industry during

this Parliament.   They would also keep dewn electricity prices,

and would not close the nuclear option for the long term. If

Cabinet agreed, he would announce them in a statemil^ to

Parliament that afternoon.   That statement would

    SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that a decision to

retain all nuclear stations in England in the public sector had

major implications for Scotland, 60% of whose electricity output

came from such stations,   !here were differences between the

position in England and Scotland.   In particular, there were no

plans to construct new nuclear stations in Scotland, and the

existing Scottish reactors were working well.   Nevertheless, the

(Chairman of the two Scottish Electricity Boards had advised him,

and he agreed, that if such a decision was made for England,

there was no practical chance of privatising the Scottish

nuclear stations.   These stations also must therefore remain in

the public sector, and Scottish electricity would have to be

this would not be easy to present.   But it would

Government had already proposed that the nuclear

and should be held by a separate company,



Ltd.   The Government could also point out that

 -nuclear part of the industry would cwn around

capacity and employ 14,000 out of the 16,000

ip between the privatised industry and the

ially on pricing policy, would require

clear, however, that there was a very



strong case for ^hap^ing the capacity of the interconnected

between Scotland a^rSigland from its present level of 700 MW to

its maximum level of 2000 MW.



In discussion the following were the main points made:



a.    It was important

problems of nuclear

privatisation.   On the

to light problems which

hidden while the industry

the cost of de-commissioning

privatisation approached, and

industry still had no firm idea

costs.   The history of nuclear

inefficient the nationalised

nuclear stations.   Industries abroad,



ise in presentation that the

been caused by

privatisation had brought

there but had remained

onalised.   The estimates of

ated dramatically as

clear that those in the

of the prospective

shewed hew



at building

le in Germany



and Belgium, had been successful in building such stations at

reasonable cost and with private finance.   On the other hand,

successive Governments were not immune from criticism for

their handling of the nuclear power programme, and could not

claim that they had been unaware of all the

problems.



b.    The draft statement circulated by the Secre

for Energy did not mention the environmental

nuclear power.   This would be regarded as inconsi

other recent Government statements on environmental

The statement should be amended to include a suitable



SECRET


SECRET



reference.   A useful point to make was that the planned PWRs

would be largely replaced by generation from gas, also an

environmentally attractive fuel.



c.    Imports of nuclear-based electricity frcm France and

Scotland were a source of diversity, although there were

objections to becoming unduly dependent on French imports.

Ihe case for strengthening the interccnnector with Scotland

to the maximum extent was however very strong and this should

be reflected in what was said to Parliament.



d. Ihe Government had invested considerable political

capital in supporting the development of nuclear power.



(er during the next decade the position on fossil fuels

less favourable as oil prices rose and the gas

^became more dependent cn supplies from Norwegian

aPnoe the country withdrew frcm nuclear development

it ccEMmt get back in without great cost and difficulty.

On the^ghS^hand, the proposal by the Secretary of State for

Energy dy^j rule out more nuclear capacity as a long-term

option.   iJrajfctement had to take account also of the

overriding 1 |   achieve electricity privatisation during

this Parlia1ra^p,^al the reference to a review of nuclear

power in 1994 ve^Wfesigned to strike a balance between these

requirements.   Nevertheless, while the constraints were

recognised, it would be desirable for the statement to

include a rather more positive reference to the advantages of

nuclear power.

    PRIME MINISTER summing up the discus^H^ said the Cabinet

agreed the recommendations by the Secrete^ of State for Energy

and the Secretary of State for Scotland.   They should, as

proposed, make statements accordingly to Parliament that

afternoon.   Ihe statements should take account of the points

made in discussion and, in particular, should not Wke out

nuclear power as a long-term option.

of their discussion and invited the Secretaries of

3.     FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the East

German Council of Ministers had resigned on 7 November and the

entire Politburo on 8 November.   The leader of the Socialist

Unity Party, Herr Egan Krenz, was attempting to find a position

where his Party could dig in.   Every day brought new

difficulties.   The Party Secretary for Dresden, Herr Hans

Modrow, had been nominated as Chairman of the Council of

Ministers, effectively Prime Minister, and also brought into the

Politburo.   He had a relatively good reputation as a

ormer.    The crucial factor in the situation was whether the

ership was prepared to give an undertaking to hold free

party elections,   unless the leadership was prepared to

undertaking, they would find it very difficult to

the situation.   It was significant that the

tors in the streets were calling for reform within East

but not reunification with West Germany.   It would be

helpful if the Prime Minister were able to express the British

    FOREIGN AND OCWTOWEAEHH SECRETARY said that British policy

towards Cambodia has been reviewed in the light of changing

circumstances.   He had decided to mate two modifications.

First, British humanitarian aid inside Cambodia would be

increased.   This would be channelled through non-governmental

organizations and organizations such as the united Nations

Children&apos;s Fund (UNICEF) and not direct to the Ehncm Penh

ime.   Britain was offering a further  250,000 to UNICEF for



itarian projects inside Cambodia.   A member of the Bangkok

ssy would visit Thncm Penh soon to report on the situation

hand.   Second, the annual United Nations Resolution of the

ation of South East Asian Nations cn Cambodia, which

and 73 other nations co-sponsored, had been amended to

it of the changes in the situation in Cambodia and to

any implied support for the Khmer Rouge. Britain&apos;s

posiMon on the legal and technical question of Cambodian

representation in the United Nations would not change. Britain

IHE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the Greek

elections cn 5 November had producea^another unsatisfactory

result.   Ihe New Democracy Party were still three seats short of

an overall majority.   Another round of elections in 1990 seemed

almost certain.   Ihe leader of the New DemrcfiyW Party, Mr

Mitsotakis, had been given until later thakd^T-to form a new

government, but his chances of doing so were

failed, the leader of Pasok, Dr Papandreou,

opportunity to try to form a government. It

predict hew the situation would develop, but the

caretaker government of Mr Ioannis Grivas would p&quot;

in office.   Neither New Democracy nor Pasok seemed

constructing a stable majority in the near future.

five approach to economic and monetary union.   There had

substantial discussion, but it had been politely



and the Presidency and Commission had explicitly agreed

would be taken into account in further work. The

llor of the Exchequer would no doubt pursue the matter in

mor^detail at the meeting of the Economic and Finance Council

on 13 November.    He would himself be pressing it during visits

to the Haqj^e-sand Bonn.   Meanwhile, discussion at the Council

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that in the last few days

the industrial action by ambulance workers in London had

worsened, /fetttpq in accordance with guidelines on a work-to-

rule issueifo3y$ jeir union, members of the National Union of

Public Enplq$efeSWjPE) responding to emergency calls were

refusing to qguap^ their radios in accordance with arrangements

introduced scme^rarths previously.   The Union had claimed that

its members were /^J^eclining to answer emergency calls, but

its hidden purpose^tfte^p put pressure on the management of the

Ambulance Service to ^a05 ynue paying at full rate staff who were



nan-emergency service.   Sane 90 per

kby the Ambulance Service annually

&gt;would be wholly unacceptable for

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH continued that he wafe

pessimistic about the chances of an early resoluticnoz*??i

dispute.   The Union was seeking an increase in pay sur

above the level on offer and arrangements for linking

in the pay of ambulance workers to those of other groups

unwilling to contemplate any no strike arrangement.   While he

was not immune to flexible ideas which might help secure a

settlement, the Union&apos;s demands were unrealistic and, if

granted, would have a very damaging effect cn the pay

settlements already achieved with other National Health Service

(NHS) staff, as well as cn wider pay policy objectives.



In discussion, the following points were made -



^^S. a.    While the armed forces were successfully providing a

^^*2 atisfactory accident and emergency service in London at

^X^resent, this was yet to be fully tested.   A single



qrtunate incident could easily raise the temperature of

pute and the public debate about it.   Ihe armed

* could provide up to 500 ambulances throughout the

witry, but these could never substitute entirely for the

usual arrangements. Although it wculd be possible to use

normal AmJjd.anoe Service vehicles with military or police

crews, iVT !uld be difficult to gain access to the vehicles

withoutl^or^a^rrtatian virile ambulance staff remained in

ambulano^^taMons.



b.    Ihe Bemg^oiKMetary had met the Chairman of the Police

Federation th^M&amp;Kfcicus day, who had retracted his earlier

statements in j$&amp; i pf a link between Ambulance Service and

police pay.   NeverM^ess, the police were uneasy about

their continuing 4j^ ly!pment in the dispute.



c.    Public opinion

events occurred which

the NUFE claim was conceded this would push

in the following year&apos;s pay round.   In total,

was new very substantial indeed, although it was

that in the summer the Union had actually

acceptance of management&apos;s 6.5 per cent pay

Sane 95 per cent of NHS staff had already accepted

settlements at about the level presently on offer to NUPE,

most recently including Works Officers.   Seme short term

unpopularity in weathering the dispute was unavoidable, but

it was essential that NUPE&apos;s claim should not be conceded.



e.    Ihe experience of the dispute seemed certain to

accelerate a development already under way in the Ambulance

Service, for exanple in Northumberland, in which the

Ambulance Service focussed on meeting accident and emergency

para-medical needs, and routine non-emergency functions

contracted out to private firms.   1he long-term effect

the dispute might well therefore be a reduction in

ance workers&apos; jobs.



f   While a flexible approach to the settlement of the

dispute was right, care should be taken about any

suggestions for a no strike arrangement with ambulance

workers/^^b^K was knewn to oppose this, but it would anyway

be wron^Jbovtoncede such an arrangement as a consequence of

discreditable working p:

no early end to the dispute in

on hospitals, although it had led to seme beds being blocked

because of difficulties in discharging patients.   A good

deal of use was being made  of hospital^araj and taxis, and

many patients were succeeding in mking^v^iep^cwn way to

were a sign that its earlier action had fail

staff the moment a settlement was reached and it

debate.

IHE ]?RIME MINISTER, sunning up the discussion, said that, while

they recognised the natural tendency of public opinion to

sympathise with the ambulance workers, the Cabinet were agreed

that the NOTE claim could not be conceded without damaging

effects on the pay settlements already reached for other NHS

staff and on the Government&apos;s wider pay policy objectives. It

was clear that NUPE was not prepared to contemplate a binding no

strike arrangement and the implications of any such arrangements

d in any case need very careful consideration. Ihe effect of

Union&apos;s action might well be to reduce jobs in the Ambulance

ice by accelerating developments already in train which were

the service to contract out non-emergency work. Ihe

of State for Health should bear in mind the points

discussion in his further handling of the dispute.
