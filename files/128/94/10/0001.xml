1. THE LORD !RESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that he had already

reported to Cabinet the severe pressure on the legislative

programme for the following Parliamentary session.   It was

essential to begin the fourth session of the present Parliament

as close to the conventional time as possible.   A number of

fresh priority candidates for places in the programme had

emerged since Cabinet had last discussed it, and seme of the

pills in the provisional programme had grown as a result of

licy decisions.   Cabinet had previously agreed that any

itions to the programme should be met by offsetting savings.

Queen&apos;s Speeches and Future Legislation Committee (QL) had

y examined the provisioned programme in order to see

any savings could be found.   The Secretary of State for

and Industry had offered to postpone legislation on Export

Credit and Investment Guarantees and on Computer Misuse to the

1990-91 session: QL had decided that although it would not be



possible

next



These sa?

the Landlor

with a Government Bill on Computer Misuse

the subject could be offered to a Private Member,

ild allow the addition to the programme of a



to licensed tenants the protections of

Act 1954.



More substanti

pressures on th 

therefore rel

(Miscellaneous

Transport (Private F

programme.   While the

prefer to have two



Scott



give one of them priority

of the Scottish law Reform

reform the English legal prof

Highways and Transport (Private

elements - reform of the Public



were, however, required if the acute

were to be relieved.   QL had

luded that the law Reform

(Scotland) Bill and the Highways and

Bill* should also be removed from the

of State for Scotland would

Is in the programme, if forced to

Jje^&amp;aald favour retaining the

JP^rf*^ (Scotland) Bill. Postponement

not judged likely to make

ices Bill, which would

!re difficult. The

) Bill contained two

ities Streetworks Act 1950

proposals for private



the



and provisions to give effect to

financing of roads in the Green Paper &quot;New Roads by New Means&quot;

(Command 698) - of which both were desirafej^. but each was

susbstantial and neither seemed essentiarne^t session.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said

appreciated the pressures facing the busi

proposal to drop one of the two Scottish Bill

provisional programme would have major consti

political implications.   The Scottish Office&apos;s

embraced those of a number of Whitehall Departmeh

the existence of a separate Scottish legal system m

substantial programme of Scottish legislation was

session.   There had for many years been three or more

Bills in the programme.   This year he had accepted that

should only be two Bills but any further reduction in the&quot;



as well as



!confidential!




!confidential



programme would be unacceptable.   The burden on Parliamentary

time frcm Scottish legislation was limited because of the

Scottish Grand and Standing Committee procedures.   It would be

very difficult to explain a failure to legislate on reform of

the Scottish legal profession next session and he could not

agree that legislation on war crimes, for example, should have

priority over the Scottish Bill.   Ihe inclusion of only one



:ish Bill in the programme would also open the way to those

had argued the need for a separate Scottish legislature. So

it had been possible to resist that argument on the basis of

 &apos;s excellent record in dealing with Scottish

it ion, including law reform measures.   That defence would

be available if next session&apos;s programme was reduced

Ly one Scottish Bill.



THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that the Highways and

Transport^^Rvvate Finance) Bill was also of high priority. The

Gcvernmemf&apos;h^ derived great credit, not least among its own

supporte^O^Slw its proposals to introduce private finance into

road buildiw^yRrivate sector confidence&apos; in the Government&apos;s

intentions ahe^g&amp;b faith would be seriously damaged if a Bill



was not

North Relief

basis that the   

required to pursue,

scheme&apos;s opponents

problems.   The street

would also be popular,&apos;



session.   Proposals for the Birmingham

were currently being prepared on the

go ahead.     hybrid Bill would be

yject, which would be exploited by the

itself cause Parliamentary handling

l es provisions of the proposed Bill



In discussion, the folic



a.    Parliamentary deba

Inquiry were to take place

expected to reveal strong

Parliament, to the proposals

subject.   It was certainly



points were made:



report of the War Crimes

autumn.   They could be



both inside and outside

igislation on this

le that legislation on war

crimes should not take priority over other Bills in the

Government programme.   On the other hand, the inquiry report

had said that any legislation should be^qacted quickly and

there were also very strong feelings jmffatybur of

legislation.   While it might not be desttajS^vto give

priority to a War Crimes Bill, it would efedzKicult to

decide definitely to postpone it ahead of^wK^Brliamentary

debates. ^



b.    The constitutional and political argumen

the Secretary of State for Scotland for

Scottish Bills in the programme were very strong,

do so would provide ammunition for nationalist and

critics of the Government.

I



c. Ihe Scottish Enterprise and New Tc*-rs (Scotland) Bill

was effectively two Bills in one.   The Law Reform

(Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill was suitable for

introduction in the House of Lords, but it did not sinply

reform the Scottish legal profession but also included a wide

variety of other law reform measures.   If it were to proceed,

it would certainly be desirable to reduce it considerably

from its present estimated length of sane 50-70 clauses.



d. It was desirable that legislation to reform the Scottish

egal profession should proceed next session along with



islation to reform the English profession.   However, if

Scottish Bill did not proceed, the Government&apos;s

tinuing firm commitment to reform of the Scottish legal

profession would need to be made clear.



was a strong case on resource and other grounds

with the private finance provisions of the

Transport (Private Finance) Bill. The



Relief Road was of critical importance to

Proceeding through a hybrid Bill would

Government supporters.

Failure to deliv!

would itself be

failure to end the

conventional time as

number of amendments to

to remedy drafting defici

through the involvement of

outside Government.



for making other savings in the

the pressures remained intense.



because of these pressures

of Parliament as close to the

Bills which were intended

d be reduced, perhaps

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the

Cabinet recognised the pressures facing

Parliamentary business managers. It

Credit and Investment Guarantees and

not be included in the following session&apos;

the latter should be offered to a Private

should however be made in the programme for

licensed tenants.   Legislation on the detenti

suspects was not now in prospect. Cabinet

to the outcome of the Parliamentary debates in the

legislation on war crimes should be postponed bey!

session.   The Secretary of State for Scotland had ma

case on constitutional and political grounds for the

of two Scottish Bills in the programme: the Law Reform

(Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Bill should therefo:



Bills on Export

should

I



proceed, although the Secretary of State for Scotland should

discuss with the Lord President ways in which it could be

significantly reduced in length.   Ihe Secretary of State for

Transport had also made a strong case for proceeding with the

Highways and Transport (Private Finance) Bill.   In view of the

other pressures on the programme this Bill could not be granted

a place at present.   The private finance provisions of the Bill

iculd however be regarded as first reserve and drafting of



could proceed cn a contingency basis.   Consideration should

be given to whether the provisions on street utilities

be handed to a Private Member.   The Lord President should

whether the number of amendments to the drafting of

Bills could in any way be reduced.



The Cabinet -



vwith approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up

of their discussion and invited the Lord

, the Secretaries of State for Trade and

^and and Transport to proceed accordingly.

numbers of refugees, it would not diminish the pressure to

leave.   There had been demonstrations in Leipzig, Dresden and

other East German cities.   The demonstration in Leipzig on 2

October had been the largest since the 1953 Uprising. These

events provided an uncertain background to President

Gorbachev&apos;s planned visit to the GER on 7 October for the 40th

above their 1989-90 budgets.   In practice, authorities were likely to

sperd above this and the threshold was therefore likely to be higher

than the announced figure.



Continuing, TOE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TOE ENVIRONMENT said that&apos;he

would have liked to have set the threshold as lew as possible so as

to maximise the protection given.   But a lew threshold would have

increased the cost significantly.   He had new agreed with the

^^V\Chancellor of the Exchequer on a threshold of  3 a week for an

^^Nkndividual or pair of individuals.   The cost of a scheme on this

^^asis should be just under  300 million a year in England including

&lt; ^sSnlnistration costs and net of offsetting reductions in benefit



although the estimates could not be precise at this stage,

had assumed that there would need to be a ocmparable scheme in

and that the Secretary of State for Scotland might wish to

deploy a proportionate share of additional resources in Scotland next

year to improve the operation of the community charge there. He

a.    This further measure of help for Caormuni

in addition to the substantial help which the

already agreed to provide in other ways. The

Charge benefit in 1990-91 would be about  500m mo:

rateable value authorities to help them with the transition.

With this new schema of transitional relief the total figure would

be over  1 billion.   Further effort was needed to get public

understanding of the scale of this assistance.   It was not, for

example,, yet fully understood that Community Charge benefit was

paid well above the basic income support level.



b.    It was essential to make it clear in public presentation that

the Government regarded the decision to provide the further

assistance as the end of the matter.   It would be most damaging to

pimply in any way that the Government would or could do more.



/syz.    Ihe details of the scheme must be settled before an

^announcement was made.   Such an announcement would be followed by

questions about exactly hew the scheme would work in practice, and

it was inportant that answers should be available at once.



&quot;1-ion of the new scheme would need great care.   Ihe details
