2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the Dock

rk Bill had received Royal Assent on the previous Monday,

ich was two weeks earlier than had originally been thought

ible.       The   Bill   had   completed   its   passage through

it,  without amendment,   in only three months and he

to record his thanks to the Business Managers on this

ful outcome.    The result of the second ballot of the

rt and General Workers Union (TGWU) dockworker members

was likely to be announced on the following day and it was

almost certain that there would be a majority for strike action.

Strike acti^^y was likely to start almost immediately in the

later that day for

dockworker members



rts: this might well crumble quite quickly in

ports, but it could be expected to be fairly

for example at Tilbury and Liverpool. The

strike action had been delayed until after

been abolished meant that it would be

Industrial THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT said that a



Action in day there had been a one-day strike by members of



the Transport Union of Railwaymen (NUR) on British Rail (BR)



and Other&quot; steppage by members of the NUR and the Amalgamated

Locomotive   Engineers   and   Firemen   (ASIEF)   on   the London

Underground.   There had also been a strike by engineers errployed

by London Buses Ltd, which had, however, only affected about one

half of London Buses&apos; services.   On the same day, the Railways

Staff National  Tribunal   (RSNT)   had heard the  case of the

Transport   Salaried   Staffs&apos;   Association   (TSSA)   against the

   imposition by BR of a 7 per cent pay increase.   The Tribunal&apos;s

decision, which would not be binding, was expected quickly. BR

^//^woped that the Tribunal would support the settlement already

y&lt;r &gt;^Arosed but, if they were to reccranend a moderate increase in

7 per cent award and provided that BR could find off-setting

js, it was possible that its management would be prepared

jlate accepting the finding.    The NUR and ASIEF (the

of whose ballot in favour of a ban on overtime and rest

doing was expected later that day) had declined to take

theii case to the Tribunal and were thereby in breach of a 1956

agreement on pay negotiating machinery in the rail industry. It

was possiKkS^hcwever, that the Tribunal&apos;s decision in the TSSA

case cauie&apos;o&amp;n the way for talks between BR and the other

unions, eif G4pSBy as there were sane signs of resistance among

certain NUR nremjjijlrs to any escalation of the present dispute.

In these circ Sgg^es, he would continue to say, if asked, that

the NUR and A^KaKjAould have gone to the Tribunal, but would

want to reassesi^Wwie light of the Tribunal&apos;s decision and

reaction to it, *new^^to go on pressing that they should do

so.

In discussion, the following points were made -



a.     There were a number of other disputes which

to attract increasing attention.   A one-day strike



2_



{confidential!

of the National Association of Local Government Officers had

been solidly supported in the North, although less so in the

South. A two-day strike was planned in the following week,

with further escalation of the action possible thereafter.

Ihe dispute was between the local authorities and their

employees, and Ministers had expressly been asked not to

comment on it by local authority leaders, who were standing

firm against the union&apos;s demands. However, the industrial

action had led to a number of vulnerable groups, such as the

* lderly, being deprived of local authority services on which

relied, and it was right that this effect of the union&apos;s

  should be made more widely known. If the dispute

a ted, it could have particularly damaging effects on

^it supplies, although contingency arrangements were being

laid against this and publicity for this potential effect of

the dispute would not be helpful. Other current disputes

sales by BR last year were taken into account, ER&apos;s claimed

profit in that year of over  300 million became a current

loss of over  400 million.



THE FREME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that some

sections of the press had suggested that the Government welcomed

^the disputes in the transport sector. This was wholly mistaken,

least given the very substantial sums of money which in

it years had been invested in British Rail and the London

round. Ihe irresponsible actions of the public sector

concerned were driving business away frcm the railways,

putes were not between the Government and the trade

but between the trade unions and management. Ihe

nt&apos;s case, and its sympathy for the travelling public,

must^be presented vigorously. The Government had demonstrated

its commitment to the railway industry by investing substantial

sums in it^Hy was for the management of the industry to manage

its stafff/1ttan the resources available to it.

of a kind which would ensure their support without amounting to

was that he would be able to secure seme working arrangement in

FOREIGN AND OCHMDNWEALIH SECRETARY said there had been a

ess military coup in Sudan on 30 June. The deposed

se leader, Sadiq Al Mahdi, was in hiding. Ihe overall

ion was calm, with evident relief at the departure of the

3 government which had been wholly ineffective. The new

of Lieutenant General Omer Hassan appeared to be pro-

^ian, not looking for support toward Libya. Lieutenant

General Omer Hassan had already made clear that he would make

vigorous efforts to bring an end to the war in south Sudan.

would be iers*  han that which had preceded the coup.

expatriates there in an apparent attempt to demonstrate the

legitimacy of their own Hong Kong credentials. He had explained

at every opportunity during his visit why it was impossible for

the British Government to grant this demand. By the end of his

visit seme of his interlocutors were beginning to acknowledge,

at least in private, that they understood this. But it would be

seme time before the situation in Hong Kong fully settled down

jagain. He had assured people that the Government would respect

views of Hong Kong as to the pace of democratic change in

territory. He had been able to promise that a Bill of

for Hong Kong would be introduced soon. He had made it

that the Government would press China on such issues as

_4ght of the Chinese Government to declare a state of

^ency in Hong Kong under Article 18 of the draft Basic Law

1e question of the stationing of Chinese military forces in

Hong Kong after 1997. He had emphasised the need in seeking to

restore public confidence to build upon the Anglo-Chinese Joint

Declarations^ 1984 and to resume in due course the efforts in

this direfijpioyjpade through the activities of the Joint Liaison
