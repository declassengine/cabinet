the  London Underground  and  on London Buses,

currently two disputes on British Rail, one in pro

following November along lines which the Government had long

urged it to adopt. The three British Rail unions had taken

different positions: the National Union of Railwaymen (NUR) had

secured its member&apos;s support for 24-hour stoppages and a ban on

overtime and rest-day working, though the ballot which

authorised a ban on overtime and rest-day working would expire

1 July unless the union took steps to renew it; the

_iated Society of locomotive Engineers and Firemen (ASIEF)

d be balloting its members later that month on a proposal

a ban on overtime and rest-day working; and the Transport

ed Staffs Association (TSSA) was seeking arbitration from

!way Staff National Tribunal. The overall position on

Rail was confused and uncertain: the management had

to resume talks with the unions and was consulting the

Advisory, Conciliation and Arbitration Service about the next

steps. The NUR was meeting that day in advance of its

conferenc^^ftinning on the following Sunday: there were reports

that it mrant^all a further 24-hour steppage on British Rail in

the follcAeOo^Sbek. On the London Underground, the NUR had

secured thefjsuj ort of its train crew members for 24-hour

stoppages in^arfGrtkrance of the pay claim by drivers of one-

person operate^r^fe^ns and the support of its station staff

industrial action on the railways or on Hondo



In discussion the following main points were mad



a.    The current industrial action by transport

confined to the public sector and this provic

illustration   of   the   benefits   of privatisation

deregulation in the transport area.    The rail wor*

clearly ac ing against their own long-term interest

industrialists would envitably draw the conclusion that



preparing

Lation of



!confidential!




(CONFtDEfrlTfAl)



transport was unreliable and would as a consequence shift to

other forms of transport.



b. Ihe disputes on the railways were focussed in part on

attempts by British Rail to modernise its pay negotiating

machinery and by London Underground to modernise its working

practices. It was very important that those reforms should

proceed and that the unions should not secure an

unacceptably high price for achieving this.



While the travelling public was prepared to tolerate

or two 24-hour stoppages, their mood was likely to

rapidly if the disruption continued. Consideration

d be given to whether any further measures could be

to seek to ease the situation. Consideration should

also be given to the scope for the further contracting out

and deragss^aticn of London bus services.

of privatisation and deregulation in the

would be found by converting an equivalent number of existing

temporary posts. All the new poets would be subject to further

THE SECRETARY OF STATE PGR EMPflfflrt rca said that the Dock Work

Bill had completed its Ccrnmitte* &amp;dge in the House of Lords

unamended: Report Stage was arrange for 28 June. The Bill was

on course to achieve Royal Assent by 3 July. The Judicial

Committee of the House of lords had that week allowed an appeal

by the Transport and General Workers UniarOiTGWU) against the

Court of Appeal&apos; s grant of an injunction t ufy three major port

employers preventing the TGWU from calxtog&lt;3Nstrike of its

Employment Act 1980 to obtain a fresh mandatSe/jfeftdndustrial

action. It was expected to announce a fresh bffi^Vwter that

day, the results of which would probably be avaiT^

July, two days after the Dock Work Bill was

Royal Assent. The union&apos;s biennial conference would&lt;

substantially weakened when the Dock Work Bill became law and

the ports employers were free both to sack registered dock

workers and to hire non-registered labour.



SECRETARY OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that a special conference

local medical committees of the British Medical Association

in London the previous day had decided ty a narrow

to reject the terms of the new contract for General

ti oners    (GPs)    which   he   had   negotiated   with.  EMA

itatives.    Ihe vote reflected both organised opposition

among seme EMA members to any agreement with the Government and

more widespread unease among GPs about the restraints which they



on

In discussion the following points were

Government&apos;s supporters



a. Although cn

b.    On the other hand, there was continuing public

National Health Service (NHS).   There was a good deal



!confidential!




!confidential!



ignorance among doctors as well as the general public about

precisely what those reforms entailed, and much of the

opposition to them stenmed sirtply fran a resistance to

change.



c.    Ihe  case   for  the  reforms  had been  reinforced by

recently published research which drew attention to the wide

variations in standards between different GPs ? services,

unfortunately   the   researchers   had   drawn   the perverse

  ^5ftnclusion that the proposed new contract would worsen the

:ity in standards: in fact, their research illustrated

need for the incentives for which the new contract would

fide   as   a  means  of  ensuring  that  disparities were

reduced.   It would be helpful if the Secretary of State for

Health were to make available to his colleagues a note on

resistance to change from

stewardship of resources was



arguably a case for doing more to promote to

fits of the proposed reforms.    The case

needed to be made out.    In view of the

the medical  profession,   there was no

is ing the doctors themselves, although

to criticism.   It was possible that

would   overplay   their hand,

    EKDME MINISTER, sunning up the discussion, said that the EMA

or the reforms proposed by the Government continued regularly

Health should make available to colleagues a note on the

on ignorance of what was proposed. and fear of any

Ihe official Opposition&apos;s position on the matter was

illogical: on the one hand it complained about the standard of

service in the NHS, on the other it said that the NHS was a
