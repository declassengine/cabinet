1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken

in the House of Cannons in the following week and the wade

beginning Monday 8 January 1990.



IHE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that a number of

Ministers had indicated a wish to make an oral statement

before the House rose far the Christinas adjournment. Ihe

far the following week was, however, tightly

It would be helpful if colleagues could wherever

ible postpone statements until after the Christmas

, or if announcements cculd be made in

five ways.   He would be discussing the need for

statements with those concerned.



In  &amp; brief discussion, it was noted that questions

following statements were increasingly lengthy, with the

result that debates on subsequent business were too often

curtailed/^&amp; was far the Speaker to decide how many



following a statement, and he was known

many backbenchers as possible an

them.   In the interests of shortening

should, as a matter of general

ral statements and responses to

as brief as was reasonably



questions

possible.



The Cabinet -

2. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR KttKSMEOT said that the

unemployment figures far Novernbery  p*l be published later

that day.   They showed a seasaralSv^afrjusted fall in

unemployment of 25,200 to 1.650 mil^an, the lowest level

for over 9 years.  Unemployment had now fallen for 40

consecutive months and was lower than at any time since

October 1980.   Since the 1987 General El

unemployment had fallen by over 1.3 millitf. flbnq term

unemployment continued to fall faster

unemployment and was now at its lowest level

1982.   Over the previous year there had been &quot;kigiifificant

improvements in the employment situation.   The nmra^of

people without jebs had fallen by over 450,000 carand^

with November 1988.   There were still around 600,(0 

vacancies in the economy as a whole.   The unempl

now stood at 5.8%, a reduction of 1.7% over the year.&quot;

regions had seen a reduction in unemployment over the

with the North, Wales and Scotland experiencing the 1

falls.   Figures for the annual increase in average

would also be published later that day.    These were less

encouraging.   The rate of increase of average earnings over

the year had increased by 0.25 per cent to 9.25 per cent.

The increase in unit wage costs in the united Kingdom aver

the year was 6 per cent, which compared unfavourably with

the position in other major countries.   In the Federal

Republic of Germany and the United States, for example, the

equivalent figure was 1 per cent, in Japan minus 1 per

cent, and in France minus 3 per cent.  There was a prospect

of further high wage settlements in the car industry.

(Mr

Ihe Minister of State, Foreign and Commonwealth Office

Maude) had given evidence to the House of Cannons Foreign

Affairs Committee.   He had handled seme hp^S&amp;e questions

with considerable skill.    !here had beerf axeglctable media

criticism of the Government&apos;s action.   Orr^^oSher hand,

articles were now appearing in support of tm^pjfernment&apos;s

position.



In discussion, the following points were made: ^^?^^



a.   !here were now 1,700 Vietnamese immigrants p:

to go back voluntarily.   13,000 had already been

designated as bona fide refugees and were awaiting

settlement.   It was essential to take urgent steps

repatriate the volunteers and to press those

governments who had made commitments to accept refugees

to honour their pledges.  This action should be pursued



[CONFIDENfJAj




!confidential)



without delay, and without waiting far further

repatriation of nonvoluntary returnees.



b.  Although British public opinion found repatriation

distasteful, there was a great deal of support far the

Government&apos;s action.   Criticism frcm the United States

Administration nevertheless could have a damaging

effect.   It was regrettable that the United States

Government had criticised the British Government s

actions over the Vietnamese boat people.    In the past

itain had often been alone in supporting unpopular

lean policies.    The American position on the

trration of immigrants was inconsistent since the

ted States also sent back illegal immigrants,

ted States policy derived in part frcm the

psychological after-effects of the Vietnam war. Ihe

united States Administration could be more helpful in



the Philippine government to establish a

regioi^i clearing centre.   Ihe British Government should



not

had any obli&lt;

South East As:

British interest



rebut American criticism, and should ask

Government in return whether it wculd

 tment to take more refugees.   In view

the United States, Britain no longer

support United States policy in

where it was consistent with



gition was overwhelmingly

Ld be helpful if leading

their support on

Ihe media tended to

_ figures from Hong Kong

Kwglicity given to the

cransSfes not necessarily



d.   Britain had a good case to i&amp;ce on the screening of

refugees.   Criticism of the monitoring process, which

was carried out by the Embassy in Hanoi, was misguided,

!here were only nine families in the fix^repatriation

group and these could easily be monitoral   the

Embassy.   If necessary numbers in the fsBa^C^ould be

increased as the repatriation gathered spt



c. The policy of

popular in Hong

Hong Kong figures

television and in the

choose the few,

who criticised the policy!

conditions in the refugee

unhelpful.



e. Britain made a substantial financial

the United Nations.   Ihe United Nations Ocnmi

Refugees should be pressed to be more helpful

monitoring.



f. Consideration should be given to protesting to

Chinese government about the help which the Chinese

authorities gave to the refugees who crossed the

northern border frcm Vietnam and travelled through

China before setting cut by boat for Hong Kong.

g. Although the present Vietnamese Government was one

of the remaining unreconstructed Ocmnmist

administrations, it should be possible for Britain to

take a robust attitude on aid.  On the other hand it was

important not to encourage the Vietnamese to draw the

moral that, by facilitating the boat people, they could

attract more aid.  Normal development assistance and

reintegration aid to areas where many clandestine



y ?a departures took place were preferable to increased

.X^direct payments to individual returnees.  The Vietnamese

S^^^fovernment had solid economic reasons far not



 ^B 2treating the returned groups of refugees, and this

Ytfoint should continue to be brought heme to them.



h. Vietnam had a population of nearly 66 million. If

the Vietnamese government continued to permit the

clanda^Se emigration of the boat people, and no action

was t^enttv Hong Kong, the flood would increase.  A key

objectra^OKferesent policy was to discourage further

waves of\tjpMfep1nts by sending an appropriate signal to

Hanoi of fJJ^i/iJtish Government&apos;s determination.

the forthcoming meeting of the Fisheries Oouncil

of crucial importance. It wculd determine the total

allowable catch for 1990 and its allocation between

States.   In addition it would have to consider the

agreement with Norway on the amount of catch to be

allocated to Norwegian and Community fisherman in each

other&apos;s waters during 1990.   Because Norwegian fishing

[confidential!


;confidential]



Community waters mainly took place in the latter part of

the calendar year, the Norwegians tended to prolong the

negotiations until very shortly before the year was due to

start, thus leaving Member States very little tine to

assess the position.  Scientific advice was that the fish

stock position was poor and that a significant cut-back in

the catch was needed. Ihe Ocnmission, extraordinarily, were

!reposing a bigger reduction than recommended by their own

ientists.   In addition the deal emerging frcm their



ions with Norway would give Norwegian fishermen an



share of the much lower figures which the

ion proposed for cod and haddock, the two most

species.   This was impossible to defend to

fishermen, !here would be an uncomfortable



debate that day.   He intended to attack the

Commission proposal which he regarded as totally

unreasonable. He could only assume that the Spanish

probably incorrect, of what they had caught in British

waters would then be counted against the British quota.

The Government had taken steps, most recently through the

Merchant Shipping Act, to impose conditions upon

registration, including the need for boats to land their

catches in the United Kingdom, to be crewed by persons

resident here and to pay United Kingdom social security

contributions. Other Member states had similar

arrangements: for example France required a certificate of

competence, which could only be obtained after a course of

instruction in France, ihe need for such conditions was the

more important when fishing had to be cut back in order to

stocks.   The Court judgment had been more helpful

often the case. It established the right of Member

to impose conditions creating a genuine link between

and the country in which it was registered. They

Led out the requirement that a proportion of the crew

reside in the Member State concerned.  But it

that most or all of the other conditions,

including the requirement to land fish in the country of

registration, could be maintained.

The Christmas period was one of peak demand on the Ambulance

Service and with this in mind NHS management was considering

offering a 5 day truce under which ambulance staff wculd receive

full pay if they in turn agreed to provide a normal accident and

emergency service. Such a move would not be without dangers for

management, but it would also pose problems for NUPE who would

find it difficult to justify refusing the offer and might find

it a problem to get their members to return to diminished

s once the truce was over. A truce would have the added

itage of relieving the pressure on the Armed Forces over the

istmas period. On balance he saw advantage in management

such an offer quickly.

tovsattract substantial public support, including financial

contributions to their collections. These might well, however,

reduce after Christmas.    It was essential that the management

In discussion, it was noted that it was of great importance to  

ring fence the decision to pay compensation in this case. Ihe

costs could be high if it came to be seen as a precedent. The

text of the Government response would need to be carefully

considered in the light of this. It could not be denied that

there had been seme errors of administration.



PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that

Cabinet agreed the proposals by the Secretary of State for

and Industry. Ihey agreed in particular that the

should pay compensation and that it would be right in

eminent&apos;s response to be critical of seme aspects of the

Commissioner&apos;s report. They agreed that the
