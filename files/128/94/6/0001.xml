OF STATE FOR     ENVIRONMENT said that, in his

sta^pent on the previous day about the local authority grant

settlement for 1990-91 for England, he had announced revised

transitional safety net arrangements for phasing in the impact

areas in which community charge payers could

up to  25 per adult would be allowed to

llion for authorities with lew ratable

Ihe new grants to law-rated authorises and to London boroughs

and the City had been well received. However, a number of

Conservative backbenchers had criticised the fact that, under



the safety net arrangements, those living

local authorities would effectively be

authorities, and had argued that any

should be met ty the Exchequer.   In fact,

in areas with prudent local authorities were

high-spending  authorities  through the

mechanism: the level of cross-subsidisation waul!

around one-half under the new safety net

because  any  subsidies  would be  denoted separa

1he initial responses to his announcement had virtually ignored

the benefits which the ccrrminity charge would bring, notably the

ending of the present unfair rating system; and they had also

ignored the fact that all the alternative solutions which had

been proposed - including, in particular, the labour Party

proposals for a capital value rate together with a local income

tax - were manifestly less acceptable. In moving frcm the

!resent unfair system to a fair system based on the community

e, it was inevitable that there would be some losers, and

purpose of the new safety net arrangements was to cushion

impact on those who stood to lose. No commitments had been

about the scope of any transitional arrangements beyond

and it would be necessary to give very careful

tion, in the light of reactions to the proposals he had

on the previous day, to the nature of any arrangements

for transitional protection in subsequent years. Some

Conservative Members frcm lew-rated areas, as well as many of

those frcmdJShh-rated areas, would see advantage in having the

shortest rtjfcsifte transitional period.

generate a further round of protests from Members

representing areas where the community charge was expected to

be above  275. Such protests ought, however, to be directed

not at the Government but instead at the local authorities in

question for proposing to spend above the standard spending

assessment.



d.    Ihe expected community charge was new,   for certain

authorities, greatly in excess of the estimates which had

^^Vbeen promulgated in the previews year.    This was mainly

^y^^ttributable to the unwinding of various creative accounting

v&gt;^ ?arqements by the local authorities in question.



In explaining the benefits of the new community charge

it would be helpful to draw comparisons between the

charges imposed by prudent authorities and those imposed ty

profligate authorities in order to demonstrate the scope for

reducin^Bfci bills in high-charge areas.

authorities would retain nearly one-half of the gain in the

first year in which the community charge would be payable.

Uhder the original proposals for the safety net, by contrast,

virtually none of the gains would have acme through in that

year.    It would be important to get across that the whole of

these gains were attributable to the replacement of the present

rating system by the community charge and to emphasize that the

Secretary of State  for the Environment had responded very

itively to the criticisms of the original proposals for the

redundancy and another 2,000 or so were new working normally.

26 ex-Scheme ports were fully open, and 7 partially open. 15

remained closed by strike action: these included some of the

larger ports such as Tilbury, Liverpool and Southampton.

However, dockers at Grimsby and Lnningham had returned to work

the previous day, and there was a steady flow back in other

arts. There had been very little picketing at the ports. The

Workers Delegate Conference of the Transport and General

Union was meeting later that day and the outcome

to be seen. Nevertheless so far the industrial action

ports had been far less sustained and had had less

consequences than had originally seemed likely.

recommended by the Railway StafTYfitjAal Tribunal (RSNT), and

had called a further one-day str6^?the following Wednesday.

The Union argued that the offer dicTnpt deal adequately with the

problem of low pay in the railway industry, but the offer had

been accepted by the Amalgamated Society of locomotive Engineers

and Firemen and the Transport Salaried StdJ&amp;y Association and

Ihe management of the London Underground was meeting the railway

unions later that day when it was likely to make a revised pay

offer of 8.5 per cent, provided that the unions&apos; agreed to enter

into serious negotiations on the Action Stations programme, to

accept new arrangements in respect of driver-only trains and to

end their industrial action, unless a settlement was obtained,

one-day strike on the London Underground would go ahead the

following Wednesday. On London Buses, a pay settlement had been

ched with the drivers and platform staff at 8.4 per cent: the

ineers remained in dispute, but their action was unlikely to

serious difficulties.



*Y OF STATE FOR HEALTH said that the BR offer of 8.8

had serious irrplications for negotiations in the

National Health Service Whitley Council cn pay for ambulance

drivers and a variety of other National Health Service (NHS)

staff. Ancillary workers had already settled at 6.5 per cent

ead to pressure from the

pful results.



In discussion, the following points were made:



a.    It was very important that the 8

did not become the basis  for pay

industries.   Ihe increase in the Retail

new levelled out but the prospects of it

helped by inflationary pay awards which

by BR would feed through to ticket prices.

Monopolies and Mergers Commission would greatly increase

competition in the brewing industry but were not as yet in

effect.



c.    It was   unfortunate that parcels staff employed by the

Royal Mail had been said to have received a pay increase of

10 per cent.    In fact they had had an increase of 7.5 per

cent on basic pay, with an additional 2.25 per cent which was

self-financing and conditional on a number of important gains

/^V%for management  including the  abolition of a number of

,^^?allowances and additional flexibility in regional pay and

&lt;&lt; ^Arking practices.



The tactics of London Underground management in offering

per cent in talks that day without any guarantee that it

vrauld be accepted were unwise.     However,  the management

believed that there was a chance that such an offer would be

wished to avoid pitching their offer too low in

ipitated a walk-cut by the rail unions. The

was subject to acceptance by the unions of

conditions, including that they should call

    HUME MINISTER, summing up^feaiscussion, said that, while

progress had been made in rescayujA a number of industrial

disputes, there were a number of *&amp;Gfers in which the situation

remained difficult, with a prospecurof further disputes emerging

over the caning months. While settlements in all the disputes

were desirable, it was essential that inflationary pay

settlements should be avoided and to

possible must be done to avoid the 8

becoming the basis for settlements in ot

context, a number of reservations had been

that it would be accepted. The Secretary of Sta

ioners (GPs).   He expected a majority of some two to one

acceptance.   In those circumstances, he intended to make

cld^- that the result posed a problem primarily for the EMA&apos;s

negotiators, who had recommended acceptance of the contract,

rather than for him: there seemed to be no sensible basis on

proposed to make on the following Monday announcing the

publication of the report of the War Crimes Inquiry.



IHE HCME

It would be difficult to decide to take

the report and of the fact that almost

countries which had discovered the p:

criminals within their jurisdictions had

steps to allow action to be taken against tfii

believe  that   extradition  of  those accused

represented an acceptable alternative to

that  in  practice  this  would be  likely to

prosecute in individual cases would remain a matter for the

prosecuting authorities.



Nevertheless,  considerable practical problems would follow a

decision to extend the British courts1 jurisdiction as proposed:

it would be difficult to bring any of the cases concerned to a

successful prosecution; sensitive decisions would face the

prosecuting authorities about whether or not to proceed in

ividual cases; and any trials would impose a heavy burden on

courts, about which the lord Chief Justice had expressed

?ations.      The  cost  implications  of  implementing the

:1s recommendations were also likely to be substantial,

1 it was difficult to assess these with any accuracy

they would depend crucially on how many cases came to

l.    Because of the age and infirmity of witnesses and the

fad? that the crimes were committed outside the United Kingdom,

it was likely that provision would have to be made for taking

evidence by- live television link from witnesses abroad, and it

Opposition sides



In discussion the foil



view of these difficulties, he proposed that

.d set cut the  issues of principle and

indicate   that   while   the Government&apos;s

that the  Inquiry&apos;s  advice  should be

[tion introduced,   it wished to hear the

kof Parliament in debates on the report

- were taken.   He anticipated that in

divided both on the Government and the



points were made:



a.    A number of ov

required if particular

already indicated that

to   the   United Kingdom,

legislation was to have p:

avoid making provision, at

Effect it would be hard to

on a limited basis, for

link from abroad.   In seme



cases virtually the whole prosecution case would need to be

conducted by these means which wculd^restrict the normal

scope for cross-examination.



b.    If the recommendations of the re

calls were to be expected from seme

members of the British forces alleged

crimes to be tried, notwithstanding the

courts&apos;   existing  jurisdiction  over such

prisoners of war were also likely to feel

crimes committed in Germany or German-occupied territory,

although there was at present no evidence that any former

Japanese war criminals were new resident in the United

Kingdom.



c.    Although there was a strong case in principle for acting

on the report&apos;s recommendations, the practical difficulties

were very great, as the experience in Canada had shown. In

the circumstances it was important to avoid raising inflated

expectations of action.     It would be preferable for the

yy/^ Government to avoid committing itself to legislation in

V?\^^advance of the report being debated by Parliament. In

&lt;^^^rticular,   it was important that the proposed statement

Id not commit members of the Government to vote in any

cicular way, or constrain other members frcm making up

ir own minds about the merits of the issues, during the

u!ebates on the report.   From this point of view, it might be

better not to say, as the current draft of the statement did,
