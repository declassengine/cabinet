The Prime Minister welcomed the new members of theCabinet.secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in south arabia had deteriorated rapidly within the last few weeks and theFederal Supreme Council had virtually disintegrated. This at leasthad the advantage that our hands were no longer tied by our earliercommitments to the Council. The High Commissioner had broadcast on 5th September a statement that he was ready to enter intoimmediate discussions with the nationalist forces with a view to the recognition of a new South Arabian Government. The immediatereaction to this statement had not been encouraging. But senior officers of the South Arabian Army had now broadcast an order to both the National Liberation Front and the Front for the liberation of Occupied South Yemen to stop fighting and had said that theywould support only those members of both groups who came forward in support of the British Governmenfs call for negotiations. TheUnited Nations Commission had approved our decision to talk tothe nationalists but seemed to resent the fact that it had resulted from our own and not their initiative. The Minister without portfolio (Lord Shackleton) had seen the Commission in Beirut andwas now on his way to see King Feisal of Saudi Arabia. Notunexpectedly, the King (as well as the Ruler of Bahrain) had beenupset by our decision.It was too early to give a considered review of the positionresulting from the Arab Summit meeting at Khartoum. The firstimpression was that there had been a genuine movement among theArab States which were represented towards a more realistic under-standing of the present situation in the Middle East and a recognition that they must seek to achieve their objectives by means other thanwar. It looked as if the United Arab Republic (UAR) might beready not only to change its attitude towards Israel but also perhaps to reopen the Suez Canal. The Arab States also seemed to realise that they had been mistaken in branding the United Kingdom asan aggressor and to wish to restore relations with us. PresidentNasser had let it be known that he would be willing to resume talks with us. The Israeli attitude, on the other hand, to judge by recentpublic statements, seemed to be hardening. He hoped to discuss these problems with the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Eban, on his way through London to New York. Meanwhile it still seemed thatthe best course would be to work for a compromise resolution inthe Security Council.In discussion it was noted that the decision of the Arab summit meeting to resume oil shipments to the West would make our supply position marginally easier. But the essential problem remained oneof transport and not of supply.
The Foreign Secretary said that the referendum in Gibraltar onthe choice between British and Spanish sovereignty was due to beheld on 10th September. Meanwhile the United Nations Committeeof Twenty-four had passed a resolution saying that our decision tohold a referendum contradicted last year&apos;s Resolution of the general assembly and implicitly supporting the Spanish position. on 6th September the Spanish Ambassador had delivered to the ForeignOffice a Note proposing talks, but mentioning the referendum as an obstacle in the way. A reply would be sent when the referendumwas over.Pressure on staff of the Office of the British Charge d&apos;Affairesin Peking had recently been relaxed. We had been able to resumecontact with our Charge d&apos;Affaires and he was now being receivedagain at the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. No grave damageseemed to have resulted from the occupation of the Office by theRed Guards and it was believed that no classified material had falleninto Chinese hands. After the attacks on our Office in Peking andthe disorders in front of the Chinese Embassy in London thepossibility of breaking off relations with the Government of thePeople&apos;s Republic of China had been considered but had been rejected, inter alia, because of the possible repercussions on the british staff in Peking. The Foreign Secretary had sent a letter in relativelyfriendly terms to the Chinese Minister of Foreign Affairs, but no reply had yet been received. The aid of the President of Pakistanhad been enlisted in seeking the evacuation of our staff and their dependants; but no exit permits had yet been granted. Meanwhilepolice surveillance of the Chinese Embassy in London was continuing.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that thesecurity situation in Hong Kong was under firm control. the communists were now turning to bomb outrages and in the fortnightbefore 4th September there had been 700 reports of bombs, of which100 were genuine. This put a heavy strain on the bomb-disposalunits; and proposals had been made for stern action againstpeople found carrying bombs. So-called &quot; mosquito broadsheets&quot;(containing threats of death against leading personalities one ofwhom had since been killed) had also recently appeared; and someof them were being produced in premises owned by ChineseGovernment enterprises. Thought was being given to action to dealwith these new threats, having regard to possible repercussions onthe British staff of the Office of the Charge d&apos;Affaires in Peking.The Ghurkha troops had done excellent work in aiding the civil power: but this was one of the factors leading to further Chinesepressure in Nepal to stop recruitment.Recent clashes between Rhodesian security forces and guerillaseemed to show that the guerilla were increasing their campaign of violence. Meanwhile the leader of the illegal regime, Mr. Smith,had failed to answer the request put to him as a result of the visit by Lord Alport (formerly British High Commissioner to the
Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland), for his views on amend-ments to the draft Constitution drawn up at the meeting onHMS Tiger earlier the previous year: and had insisted on the need to deal first with the problem of the acceptability of the constitution to Rhodesian opinion as a whole, in a manner satisfactory to the illegal regime.In discussion it was noted that Mr. Smith seemed not only to begoing back on what he had said to Lord Alport about the acceptability of the Tiger Constitution but also on his previousacceptance of the Governmenfs Fifth Principle relating to the acceptability of the Constitution to the people of Rhodesia as awhole.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that itwas becoming increasingly unlikely that there would be a clearvictory in Nigeria for either side. Our policy on arms was to supply the Federal Government with reasonable quantities of types similarto those supplied in the past (e.g., rifles) but to refuse sophisticatedweapons (e.g., aircraft, rockets, etc.). When the mid-Western Regionwas occupied by forces of the Eastern Region on 9th August, thispolicy had been reviewed. It had been decided not to stop arms supplies to the Federal Government, since they were the legitimateGovernment and there were some 17,000 British lives at stake inFederal controlled territory. We therefore continued to adhere toour previous policy, which the Government of the Eastern Regionreluctantly accepted. Mr. Arnold Smith, the Secretary-General ofthe Commonwealth Secretariat, had recently written, with ourencouragement, to both General Gowon, Head of the FederalMilitary Government, and to Colonel Ojukwu, the military governor of the Eastern Region, proposing a truce in the landfighting to permit peace talks to be held. General Gowon had rejected this proposal in moderate terms; Colonel Ojukwifs reactionwas not yet known. But the point of view of the Government ofthe Eastern Region was that they could only agree to talks on thebasis that the independence of the Region was recognised: whereas the Federal Government insisted as a prior condition of talks thatit should not be recognised.Mr. Bradshaw, the Premier of St. Kitts-Nevis-Anguilla, was nowin London on a visit. It was hoped to discuss with him the possibleappointment of a United Kingdom Interim Commission to take overthe administration of Anguilla.The Cabinet-Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs.-- secret. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 148) covering a report by officials on Public SectorPrices.
The Prime Minister said that on 27th July the Cabinet had considered proposals for further increases in prices in the public sector and had decided that officials should make a further study,both of the general problem of public sector pricing and of theindividual increases under consideration, and should report to the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy (SEP) during september. It had been agreed that meanwhile there should be noincreases of prices in the public sector. Since that decision, thequestion of public sector prices had been highlighted by public controversy over the introduction of the increases in consumer prices for electricity which had been agreed earlier in the year and this hadbeen taken into account in the meeting of SEP which had taken place the previous day to consider the report by officials. The Committeehad taken a number of decisions of which the Cabinet would wishto be informed. The basic problem facing the Committee had beenhow to finance the substantial long-term capital investment in the nationalised industries in question (save for transport where therewas a special situation of continuing deficit). These investmentsshould serve to improve the efficiency of these industries and of theservices they provided and to keep down the charges made for them:but it would clearly be some time before such large-scale investmentcould be. completed and take effect. Meantime the problem of financing them was a formidable one; the necessary finance could beprovided either through the imposition of higher prices now, or by borrowing from the Government or abroad, which would sooner or later involve increases in taxation with deflationary effects.Moreover the industries concerned were already relying substantiallyupon loan finance; and borrowing abroad in particular presenteddifficult problems. The general view of the Committee had beenthat there was no reason to question the present policy of fixingtarget returns which the nationalised industries should be requiredto achieve on the investment made in them.Against this background the Committee had reached certain conclusions:(a) On the general issue of financing large-scale investment inthe nationalised industries a small committee consisting of theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Tradeand the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs should consider further and report to SEP on the general problem of finance for the nationalised industries.(b) There had also been some feeling that the call on realresources involved in investment programmes of the size of those nowunder consideration, especially if it were considered in the light ofthe severity of the review of social security expenditure which theCabinet had conducted during the summer, called for a comprehensivefactual report on present commitments on capital expenditure in the nationalised industries, for consideration at a further meeting of theCommittee.(c) In the light of the requirements of the Governments policy on prices and incomes and of the need to let it be seen that publicly-owned industries were subject to disciplines comparable to those
with which private industry had to comply, it would be right that all future proposals for major increases in public sector prices shouldbe referred to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI);and that the following specific references to the Board should bemade on the proposals for increases in public sector prices beforethe Cabinet:(d) It had been agreed, on the Minister of Power&apos;s proposal,that the proposed increase in the bulk supply tariff for electricity for1968-69 should be referred to the NBPI and that an immediate announcement to this effect should be made, so that any doubts about the necessity for increases in charges for electricity could be resolved.(e) The proposed increases in London fares by British Rail andthe London Transport Board, and the other proposed increases incountrywide fares and charges set out in Annex D to thememorandum before the Cabinet (C (67) 148), including charges for coal and coke, should be referred to the NBPI; increases in individualcharges not on a countrywide basis need not be so referred.(/) The proposed increase in gas prices should be referred tothe NBPI in terms which would draw attention both to the additionalcosts imposed by events in the Middle East and to the fact thatearnings in the industry were not at present adequate to meet its financial target, but which would not bring into question the fuel policy of the Government.(g) The Committee had also agreed that the NBPI should beasked to develop a small but expert efficiency unit to advise them,in connection with enquiries referred to them concerning the public sector, on the efficiency of the industry or industries under review and on the measures taken by the relevant Departments to check on and improve that efficiency; and, where appropriate, to carryout detailed investigations, if necessary with the help of outsideconsultants.(h) After the Minister of Power had explained the difficulties arising from the present decentralisation of authority to regionalgas and electricity boards, the Committee had invited him to review the structure of the gas and electricity industries, and to report his conclusions to them.(i) The Committee had also invited the Minister of Power toconsider whether further economies might be made by the reductionof uneconomic competition and duplicate services between the gasand electricity industries.The Committee had also taken the view that, in the light of thedifficulties which the financing of the nationalised industriespresented for the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes, itwas important that the announcement of these decisions should be carefully managed, both as to timing and presentation, and had reached the following further conclusions:(/) The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, in consultationwith the Minister of Transport, the Minister of Power, and the
Postmaster-General, should consider the precise timing of the publicannouncements concerning the individual references which it hadbeen decided should now be made to the NBPI; it was important that information concerning these increases should be kept confidential.(k) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider, in thelight of the Committee&apos;s discussion, what amendments might berequired to the Draft White Paper on the Financial and economic objectives of the Nationalised Industries, the timing of its publication and, in particular, whether this should await the outcome of theconsideration of the report to be made by his new group on the financing of the nationalised industries.(/) The Minister of Power should take an immediate opportunityof explaining the reasons for, and the extent of, the recent increases in the consumer prices for electricity, with appropriate reference tothe decision to refer to the bulk supply tariff for electricity to the nbpi and to his review of the structure of the gas and electricity industries; and to include representative examples of the effect ofthe price increases.(m) The Committee had taken note, with approval, that he himself would make an early public statement on the general problemof prices in the nationalised industries in the context of the government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes, including the decisionto refer to the NBPI future proposals for major increases of prices by the nationalised industries.(n) The proposed increases in the prices charged by HMStationery Office for all editions of Parliamentary Debates should be announced and introduced as soon as Parliament reassembles.He would make a further report to the Cabinet after SEP had discussed the items which they had decided merited further study and consideration.In discussion it was emphasised that it was important that theproposed new efficiency audit machinery of the NBPI should not beallowed to impinge on the constitutional position of Ministers inrelation to the Public Boards, for which they had statutoryresponsibilities. It would be wrong for the NBPI to be put in aposition where they might come between a Minister and thepublicly-owned industries for which he was generally responsible,or where they might involve him in questions of detailedadministration within these industries which lay outside his statutoryresponsibilities. On the other hand it was pointed out that nothing in the conclusions reached by SEP could affect the statutory positionof Ministers in regard to the nationalised industries. There was noquestion of giving new authority to the NBPI in this respect, but only of asking them to perform the functions for which they had been set up, namely to investigate and pronounce on problems of prices and incomes which had been referred to them. Moreover, it was important, since the nationalised industries were monopolies, andin view of the severity of the statutory scrutiny to which privatemonopolies might be subjected, that the Government should not seem to subject the publicly-owned monopolies to disciplines lessstringent than those imposed on private monopolies.   In this
Prices andIncomesInducementPayments for teachers inCertainScottishSchools(previous reference:CC (66) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Scotland (C (67) 147) about inducement payments for teachers in certain Scottish schools.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that schools in some ofthe poorer districts in Scotland were seriously hampered by ashortage of staff. A committee under the chairmanship ofDame Jean Roberts had been set up in 1965 to consider means of effecting  a more equitable  distribution of teachers and hadconnection there was no doubt that the reference to the NBPI of proposed increases of prices by nationalised industries would reducethe difficulties which Ministers hitherto had encountered inrestraining increases of prices in private industries and trades.It was also urged that it was important that the new rule for reference of major increases in public sector prices to the NBPIshould not be allowed to increase the delays in reaching decisions affecting the financial position of the nationalised industries; inrecent cases there had been delays of as much as 18 months whichhad seriously hindered their planning of investment. It was howeverpointed out that the delays in question had largely resulted fromthe standstill on prices and wages and the subsequent period of severe restraint on increases of prices and wages, which were nowpast history. The new rule that all major increases of prices in thepublic sector should be referred to the NBPI would eliminate delays in making references to that body, which was now in a position to conduct its investigations at a pace comparable to that of thedepartmental machinery for scrutinising the operations of the nationalised industries.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be prudent to provide for exceptions to the rule that all major increases in public sector prices should be referred to the NBPI, since special casesmight arise in which such reference might not be desirable. On theother hand it was argued that since such cases were by definitionspecial ones, there should be no insuperable difficulty in making an exception for them if the need should arise; and it might also bepossible to make arrangements with the NBPI for special treatmentof cases where this would be appropriate.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in agreement with the conclusions reached by SEP, onwhich action should now go forward. It was important to recall that the increases in prices under consideration would, if approved,go far towards removing the necessity for further increases of thiskind for a considerable period ahead.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement on the conclusions of the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy on the problem of public sector prices.
recommended the payment of an additional allowance of  100 a yearto teachers in schools to be designated as being seriously affected bythe staff shortage. Such designation would be so limited that notmore than 4,000 teachers (10 per cent of the teaching staffs) would receive the additional allowance. At their meeting on 3rd August,the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes had accepted thisproposal in principle and agreed that there should be an immediate announcement of it. They had however taken the view that it shouldnot be implemented except as part of the general revision of the salaries of Scottish teachers which was due from April 1968 on theground that the credibility of the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes would be called into question if special additional payments were offered to certain teachers during the currency of thepresent salary settlement. In his view, however, there werecompelling reasons for introducing the scheme from 1st October,1967, which outweighed any risk of damage to the government&apos;s policy on incomes. It was essential to improve the distribution of teachers and ease the situation in those schools where there was an acute shortage of staff; in March of the present year some 4,500pupils were receiving only part-time education. There was alreadystrong criticism of the Governmenfs failure to take any action onthe Roberts Report, which had been available since April 1966, andthe position had been made more difficult by the extent of the arbitration award on teachers&apos; salaries in England and Wales.Criticism would be strengthened by the agreement which wouldprobably be reached on additional allowances for priority schools in those countries. Furthermore, the Government had declared their intention of incurring additional expenditure on school premises inthe poorer areas; but an improvement in staffing was a more immediate priority than improvements to the buildings themselves.Finally, it must be borne in mind that when the new negotiating machinery on salaries, for which the Remuneration of Teachers(Scotland) Act provided, came into effect in October he would as secretary of State for Scotland cease to hold his present controllingposition in matters of this kind. If action were taken now, he couldintroduce the scheme of inducement payments on his own authority in the form which was most likely to be effective. If there were delay,there could be no assurance that any scheme could be introduced,since the whole issue would be caught up in negotiations for a generalrevision of salaries and any resultant scheme might be more costlyand less effective than that now proposed. In these circumstances the right course was to introduce the proposed scheme of inducementpayments from 1st October.The First Secretary of State said that while the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes had been sympathetic with theproposals in principle, they had not felt able to agree that they shouldbe implemented immediately. They had taken the view that the credibility of the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes wouldbe called into question if they were seen to be offering ad interimspecial additional inducements during the currency of the presentsalary agreement for Scottish teachers.   To take such action
immediately after the end of the period of severe restraint would givethe public impression that continuing restraint was unnecessary.Furthermore, the proposal would inevitably have repercussions bothon the position of teachers in England and Wales and on the pay ofother professional staff.In discussion it was urged that the payment of inducementallowances for reasons of social policy differed from a general increase in salaries and that since the present staff shortage wasprejudicial to the education of a substantial number of children incertain areas of Scotland the proposal for the payment of an inducement allowance should be accepted now. It was, however,the general view of the Cabinet that notwithstanding these considerations they were outweighed by the repercussions whichwould inevitably ensue in other professions and in industry to the damage of the Governmenfs policy in prices,and incomes. the objection arose not from the merits of the proposals in principle but from the proposed timing of their implementation.The following points were also made:(a) The proposal would, on balance, be liable to haveembarrassing repercussions in respect of the pay of teachers inEngland and Wales and while this should not be over-emphasisedit would be preferable on this account that the payment of the allowance should be postponed.(b) The proposal might have repercussions on the pay of thepolice. It had recently been agreed to pay considerably smallerallowances in certain areas to provide additional inducements for recruitment in a number of police forces, where the relative deficiency of staff was much greater than obtained in the Scottish schools inquestion. Furthermore, these allowances were paid at lower ratesin respect of more senior staff and no differential allowance was paid at all to officers of the rank of police Superintendent and above.The Cabinet were, however, informed that the proposed allowance would not be paid to head teachers in Scotland and did not, therefore,conflict in principle with the system of a tapering allowance in respectof the police.(c) The early payment of the allowance, in advance of thenegotiations on salaries in April 1968, was additionally objectionablein view of the rejection in arbitration earlier in the present year of a salary claim by Scottish teachers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet took the view that, while it was acceptable thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland should announce immediatelythat the recommendations of the Roberts Report in respect ofinducement payments for teachers in certain Scottish schools were accepted in principle and that it was proposed to include these aspart of any general settlement on the salaries of Scottish teachersfrom April 1968, they could not accept that the proposal should be implemented immediately because of the damage that would ensueto the policy on prices and incomes.
The Cabinet-Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland, after consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Education and Science and the Secretary of State for economic Affairs, to announce that the government accepted in principle the recommendations of the RobertsCommittee with regard to special inducement payments for teachers in schools in particular areas in Scotland, but thatthose recommendations would not be implemented except as part of a general settlement on the salaries of scottish teachers due from April 1968.ParliamentPowers ofthe House ofLords(previous reference:CC (66) 32ndConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordChancellor (C (67) 145) to which was annexed a report of the ministerial Committee on the Powers of the House of Lords.The Lord Chancellor recalled that the Cabinet had previouslyconcluded that proposals should be worked out for abolishing thepowers of the House of Lords to delay Bills and to reject subordinate legislation, but that the question of the composition of the lords should not be reopened in this connection. On this assumption andafter considering a number of alternatives, the Ministerial Committeetook the view that whereas under the present Parliament Acts apublic Bill could not become law if rejected by the Lords unless itwas passed by the Commons in two successive Sessions with aminimum interval of a year between Second Reading in the commons in the first Session and Third Reading in the next, thoseActs should be amended so as to remove the compulsory minimuminterval of a year. Thus a Bill rejected by the Lords could, ifnecessary, be passed quickly into law by closing the Session and immediately opening a fresh Session in which the Bill would be passed again by the Commons. Further, they considered that the lords&apos; powers to reject subordinate legislation should be abolished,although it would still be open to the Lords to debate such legislationif they chose.However, while the Committee were satisfied that theseproposals were the best they could devise on the assumption thatthe composition of the Lords remained unchanged, the Committeehad also reached the conclusion that such proposals, limited to dealing with the powers of the Lords, would be unsatisfactory in themselves and open to criticism by the Government^ own supportersas well as by the Opposition. In the present state of partyrepresentation in the Lords, the Government were wholly dependenton the co-operation of the Opposition in the Lords in achieving theirlegislative programme. At present this was forthcoming becausethe Lords knew that they existed on sufferance. The disturbance ofthe present good working relations with the Opposition in the Lords,which would flow from any attempt to deal with their powers, would almost certainly result in greater delay to the Governments
programme of legislation as a whole than was likely to result if the lords&apos; powers were left as they were at present. Moreover, to theextent that the proposals involved removing from the Lords theirvaluable scrutinising function over subordinate legislation the effectof the proposals would be retrograde. If legislation to give effect tothese proposals were introduced, the Government would be embarrassed by the amendments which the Opposition wouldcertainly move to reform of the composition of the Lords. It wastherefore the Committee&apos;s view that there was no satisfactory wayof dealing in isolation with the Lords&apos; powers over legislation and,if the Lords&apos; powers only could be dealt with, the Committee advised that no proposals for a change should be introduced in the present parliament.In the light of this conclusion, the Committee were, however, ofthe view that further consideration should now be given to reformingthe composition and functions of the Lords, together with limitationof their powers. These three aspects could not be dissociated andthe issue would almost certainly have to be faced in any event, since it was open to any member of the Lords to introduce a Bill on thismatter. He therefore sought the agreement of the Cabinet that thepossibility of changing the composition and functions of the Houseof Lords, as well as their powers, should now be considered by the ministerial Committee, without prejudice to the question whether legislation to effect such changes should in the event be introduced.The Lord President said that, in the light of the ministerial committee&apos;s report, the effective choice lay between a radical and comprehensive reform of the House of Lords on the one hand and leaving the present situation unchanged on the other. The Lordshad been fully co-operative in passing even controversial legislation,because they knew they existed on sufferance, but there might be some risk to the Governmenfs legislative programme in the last session of the Parliament if the composition and&apos;powers of the Lordswere left unchanged. More generally there was a need for a workingsecond Chamber to relieve the Commons of some of its routinefunctions, in particular of the detailed scrutiny and revision oflegislation, but the functions of the Lords could not be developed inthis way so long as the Government had no effective control through a majority. A general reform of the House of Lords would have thefurther advantage of enabling better use to be made of accommodation and services at Westminster which might be sharedwith the Commons. It was desirable that any legislation whichmight be agreed should be introduced in the new Session; it could notin any event be left until the final Session of the Parliament, since itmight have to be enacted under the Parliament Acts.In discussion there was general agreement that, if the composition of the Lords were not to be changed, it would be undesirable to introduce legislation dealing solely with their powers;and it was pointed out in particular that the proposal to abolish thepower of the Lords to reject subordinate legislation would throwmore work on the House of Commons.
In further discussion it was pointed out that the reform of theHouse of Lords was a matter on which there were strongly held andwidely different views and there would be great difficulty in devisingany scheme for reform which commanded a sufficient measure ofagreement. It might therefore be preferable to leave the presentsituation unchanged since it operated favourably to the Government.The risk to the Governmenfs programme which might arise in thefinal Session could be reduced by avoiding controversial legislation at that time. On the other hand, there was support for the view thatthe case for reform of the Lords justified further examination ofthe possibilities, so that the Cabinet might take a decision on thebasis of positive proposals whether or not to proceed with this reform.It was suggested, however, that the balance of practical advantage to be gained from any alteration of the present system would haveto be carefully weighed. It would, for example, be important, if theco-operation of the Opposition in the Lords were to be forfeited,that the Government should be sure of a sufficient majority to enactits Finance Bills within the time available.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the broad choice lay between a comprehensive reform of the House of Lords and leaving matters as they stood. On balance, they were agreed that the possibilities of comprehensive reform, including changes in the composition and functions of the Lords, should now be examined by the ministerial committee. It would be open to the Cabinet to decide, in the lightof the Ministerial Committee&apos;s proposals, whether or not to proceedwith such reform, but any such decision should be taken beforeThe Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of the new Session was completed.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the ministerial committee on the Powers&apos;&apos;of the House of Lords toconsider proposals for reforming the composition and functions of the House of Lords, in accordance with the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting in thelight of Conclusion (1).Cabinet Office, S.W.1,7th September, 1967.
