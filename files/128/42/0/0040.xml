CC 40 (67)CONFIDENTIALpermanent 1.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 107) by the summer Time j-rome Secretary on the adoption of permanent summer time, towhich was attached a memorandum and a report by officials whichhad previously been considered by the Home Affairs Committee.The Home Secretary said that the Home Affairs Committee had approved by an overwhelming (but not complete) consensus,proposals to introduce summer time permanently by legislationtaking effect in the autumn of 1968, and to extend the statutoryperiod of summer time by order under the existing Summer TimeActs so as to begin on 18th February, 1968. The Secretary of Statefor Scotland, who had not been present at the meeting of theCommittee, had asked that the matter be considered by the Cabinet.Though opinion tended admittedly to be subjective there was little doubt that there had been a shift of opinion in recent years and thatthe majority of organisations which had been consulted in Englandand Wales in the course of a recent review of the subject were nowin favour of the adoption of permanent summer time (or central european Time (CET)). Since the survey of opinion had been conducted before the Government announced their decision to seekmembership of the European Economic Community, it seemedimprobable that the prospect of entry to the Community had had much influence on the result. The Home Affairs Committee had considered but rejected a proposal that the change should be madeexperimentally. An experiment would be unsettling, and it seemedunwise to commit the Government to legislate further at the end ofan experimental period.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that he found the reporton the review of the social and economic aspects of extended summertime appended to C (67) 107 most unconvincing. From enquiries which he had made of the Scottish TUC it appeared that the favourable opinion which they had expressed was based merely onconsultation between the Secretary and the Agricultural Secretary ofthe Transport and General Workers&apos; Union. Public opinion appearedto have been gauged partly by consultation with the organisers ofthe Women&apos;s Royal Voluntary Service and partly by the inclusion in a Gallup poll undertaken for other purposes of questions which hadelicited that, while 45 per cent of those replying favoured the change,only one in 49 knew why, whereas one in three of the 25 per centopposing it were able to give reasons. Whereas there was expectedto be a marginal reduction in the number of road accidents it seemed clear that in the north at any rate insufficient account had been taken of the effect of the greater risk of fog and frost which was likely to result in an increase in accidents, particularly to children on their way to school. The probable cost of the change, including thenecessity to invest an additional  40 million in generating capacity and the additional costs in the agricultural and construction industries,appeared to have been brushed aside. A proposal which affectedevery individual in the country should be more fully consideredbefore a decision was taken.
In discussion it was suggested that in view of the opposition tothe introduction of GET in Scotland, where the inconvenience of a prolonged period of cold and darkness in the mornings would be particularly felt, the change should not be made unless there were clear grounds of national interest for making it. On the other hand it was argued that the public would readily adjust to the change, asthey had to double summer time during the Second World War; thatthere was undoubted advantage in the opportunities for recreationprovided by the extra hour of daylight in the afternoon; and thatbusiness and commercial interests would benefit from the coincidenceof business hours in this country with those in Western Europe.,Moreover the cost, particularly to the agricultural industry, appearedto have been exaggerated and the Central Electricity GeneratingBoard had withdrawn their previous opposition to the proposal, since they now expected to have sufficient generating capacity to meet theadditional demand in the mornings for light and power. In a debate in the House of Lords on the previous day there had been no opposition to the proposal. There might be some advantage from thepoint of view of public &quot;opinion in presenting the change as an experiment; on the other hand this was a subject on which the public would expect the Government to take an early decision and if, in theevent, the change proved unpopular or inconvenient, fresh legislation could be introduced. There would be advantage, however, in considering whether the new time could be called either WestEuropean Time or, to retain the association with Greenwich,Greenwich Summer or Greenwich Daylight Saving Time.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the preponderant opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of theadoption of permanent summer time by legislation taking effect inthe autumn of 1968 and preceded by an order extending the period ofsummer time under the existing legislation so that the change wouldin effect take place from 18th February, 1968. The Home secretary should consider in the light of the discussion whether a title otherthan Central European Time could be adopted and meanwhile should announce the decision in general terms in reply to a parliamentary question on 22nd June.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in C (67) 107 for the introduction ofpermanent summer time by legislation having effect inthe autumn of 1968 and preceded by an Order extendingsummer time in 1968 so as to begin on 18th February.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider, in the light of their discussion, whether some title other than central european Time could be found for permanent summertime.
CC 40 (67)secret. The Minister of Power said that there had been no major change in oil supplies since the Cabinet had last discussed the subject;the Suez Canal was still blocked; Iraq and Libya were not producingoil; and all other Arab States were denying supplies to UnitedKingdom and United States destinations. There had beensuggestions that the Soviet Union might be willing to supply oil tous and this possibility, which raised major questions of policy, wasunder discussion between the Departments concerned; Venezuela had indicated her willingness to supply additional oil but only insubstantial quantities if long-term contracts were made. Despitehostile public statements by the Algerian Government they had recently allowed two tankers to be loaded with liquid methane forthe United Kingdom and a third tanker was expected to be accepted for loading that day.The oil stock situation was reasonably good since, when theemergency had started, we had had 90 days supplies in the countryand a further 10 days in tankers at sea. Preparations for theintroduction of petrol rationing were proceeding, however, and thenecessary ration books and forms would have been issued to regionalcentres by the end of July. Discussions were taking place on how to share the supply and reduce consumption of fuel oil for industry.French obstruction to a declaration by the Organisation for economic Co-operation and Development of a state of emergency inrelation to oil supplies continued; such a declaration was essential if American oil companies were to be able legally to co-operate with european companies in steps to deal with the emergency withoutcontravening American anti-trust legislation. A further meeting ofthe Oil Sub-Committee of the Organisation would be held later that week in an effort to obtain agreement on the declaration of a stateof emergency. There had been increases in the price of oil of about 1 per ton in West Germany, Switzerland and Belgium and increases were being considered in France and the Netherlands. British oil companies had given notice that they might wish to raise oil prices to meet the cost of longer tanker haulage and of higher purchaseprices; if a definite request to raise prices were made, it would haveto be dealt with quickly and without reference to the National Boardon Prices and Incomes. The most difficult aspect of the current situation was not the shortage of supplies but the extra burden onour balance of payments; the present estimate was that, if the presentsituation continued, this might amount to  50 million over six monthsbut this estimate was being re-examined.In discussion, it was agreed that the question of lifting the embargo on the purchase of oil and oil products from the soviet union raised major policy issues which the Cabinet would wish toconsider on the basis of a detailed paper. Although oil from theSoviet Union would be cheaper than other alternatives to middle east supplies, we could not expect to obtain it except on long-term contracts. Our investments in the Middle East were substantial and
important for our balance of payments and very careful consideration would therefore be necessary of the effects on our economic situationand also on our defence and foreign policy of any lifting of thisembargo. Our main aim must be to re-establish as soon as possiblenormal supplies of oil from the Middle East. It was possible thatan outbreak of hostilities in Nigeria might cause a stoppage in supplies but Nigerian oil was more important for the long than forthe short term.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the demand by theGovernment of Libya that we should withdraw our forces stationed in that country. The view was expressed that we should not aim,as we were at present, to retain our forces in Libya in the hopethat the situation there would become calmer and the request fortheir removal be withdrawn, but that instead we should seize theopportunity to withdraw these forces quickly.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet would wish to give further consideration both to the issues that would be involved in any removal of the embargo on thepurchase of oil and oil products from the Soviet Union and to an assessment of the attitudes of the Arab countries on the supply of oil to us. It would be desirable for this consideration to take placeon the basis of memoranda rather than of oral statements, but in themeantime the Cabinet would wish the Minister of Power to make afurther oral statement on the oil supply situation at their first meeting in the following week.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power to make a further statement on the oil supply situation at their first meeting in thefollowing week.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to circulate a memorandum onthe issues that would be involved in the removal of the embargo on the purchase of oil from the Soviet Union.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a memorandumassessing the manner in which the attitudes of arab countries to the supply of oil to this country might develop and the consequences for our economic interests.Town andCountryPlanningDraft WhitePaperCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 106) by theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Secretary of State for Wales, to which was annexed the draft of a White Paper on Town and Country Planning.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that thepurpose of the White Paper, which had been approved in draft bythe Home Affairs Committee, was to announce the legislation whichit was intended to introduce for England and Wales in the coming session of Parliament and for Scotland in the 1968-69 Session. The
CONFIDENTIALlegislation would reduce the delays resulting from the presentprocedures, ensure wider public participation at the formative stage of planning schemes and adapt the planning process to enabledevelopment plans to deal not merely with land use but with thewhole range of relevant social and economic considerations, includingtransport and investment policies. It was proposed that the new type of development plan should continue to be subject to theapproval of the Minister but that the detailed implementation of the plans should be dealt with locally, subject to the power of the Ministerto call a particular plan in for his own consideration, or to requirethe local planning authority to hold a public inquiry. The power todecide minor planning appeals, which at present rested with theMinister, would be delegated to Inspectors, subject to the control ofthe courts in case of error of law or procedure and to the supervision of the Council on Tribunals. The opportunity would be taken to redeem the pledge given in the White Paper on the Land commission that public authorities would be enabled after the confirmation of the compulsory purchase order to use the more rapid vesting procedure for acquiring formal title to the land and to make some further improvements in the protection afforded to buildings of specialhistoric or architectural interest. The proposals would be discussed in detail with interested organisations including the local authority associations and the Council on Tribunals. It had been suggestedduring the discussion of the draft White Paper by the Home AffairsCommittee that either in the White Paper or at the Lobby Conferenceon its publication Ministers should indicate that the Governmentwere considering the adequacy of the public local inquiry as a meansof investigating and reaching conclusions on important schemes ofdevelopment which raised novel issues and might have effects on amore than local scale. He proposed therefore in paragraph 28 ofthe draft White Paper, which already indicated that the Governmentwere considering the methods of controlling development to becarried out by statutory undertakers, to give an indication that theywere also reviewing the treatment of cases that raised wide and novelissues of more than local significance. If the Cabinet approved thedraft he hoped that the White Paper would be published on 28th June.In discussion the following principal points were made (a) The Inspectors to whom delegated powers were to be givenwould be concerned with relatively minor planning appeals dealingwith individual properties and not with questions of more general interest such as the proposal to build a road across ChristchurchMeadow. Their decisions would not be open to question bythe Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration unlessmaladministration were alleged. They would, however, be subjectto the control of the courts on matters of law and procedure.(b) It was a major defect in the existing planning machinery thatthe local inquiry on a particular proposal could not also investigatealternatives to that proposal. A local inquiry was in any eventinappropriate for the investigation of proposals which involved
questions of national policy, such as the site for a third london airport; and means should be sought of reconciling the need for investigation of the wider issues which had to be determined beforeproposals affecting a particular locality could be formulated with theneed for hearing local objections and balancing the considerations involved in a choice among several potential sites. There would be advantage in devoting a separate paragraph of the White Paper toan explanation of the nature of the problem which the Governmentwere seeking to resolve.The First Secretary of State, summing up the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet approved both the proposals for legislation set outin the draft White Paper and the form of the draft itself subject tothe inclusion of a paragraph indicating the nature of the problemraised by proposals of more than local significance, the investigation of which by a purely local inquiry was unsatisfactory. The ministers concerned with the White Paper should prepare such a paragraphin consultation with the Lord Chancellor and the Lord President.If necessary the publication of the White Paper should be delayedfor this purpose, but if those concerned could agree on a newparagraph in time the White Paper should be published on 28th June.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C (67) 106,subject to the addition of a paragraph on the lines indicated in the summing up of their discussion by theFirst Secretary of State.(2) Invited the Ministers responsible for the White Paper to draft the new paragraph in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Lord President of the Council and toarrange if possible for the publication of the White paper on 28th June.confidential. The Minister of Labour said that, in consequence of thedispute over the opening of the new continental freight terminal atStratford, there was a danger of industrial action by railwaymen.The terminal had been blacklisted by the National Union of railwaymen (NUR) in protest at the employment of outside workersConclusions, by the forwarding agents leasing part of the depot and strike callsMinute 7) ^ad \yeQn sent out faQ previous evening to a number of railwaymenat the 21 freight and parcel depots in London. This might result insome damage to food supplies for London. The NUR had the rightto report official disputes to the Minister of Labour, but if they did so he would not propose to use his good offices to attempt conciliation.The opening of the new freight terminal did not cause any redundancyamong railwaymen and there was no justification for the threat ofIndustrialDisputesRailways(previous reference:CC (67) 1st
CONFIDENTIAL 9       8 9CC 40 (67)industrial action. It was essential that the Government should do nothing which might weaken the stand being taken in respect of theStratford terminal by the Board of British Railways.In discussion there was full agreement with the views expressedby the Minister of Labour. It was noted that it might be necessaryfor the Official Committee on Emergencies to meet later in the day to consider action if the dispute should spread to other freight andparcel depots.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof Labour.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to consider whetherarrangements should be made for the Official Committeeon Emergencies to meet to review the situation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th June, 1967.
