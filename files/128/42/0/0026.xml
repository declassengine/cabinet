CC 26 (67)secret the Cabinet resumed their discussion of the approach to Europe.They considered a memorandum by the Prime Minister and theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs (C (67) 60) outlining a numberof alternative courses relating to a decision whether or not to apply for membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.) andwhen to do so.The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister and he had sought to describe in their paper the alternative courses before theCabinet in regard to membership of the e.c. and their respectiveadvantages and disadvantages. The attitude of the FrenchGovernment was crucial to the progress of any application: but the choice of the right tactics should help us to neutralise Frenchopposition. The French would prefer that we did not apply at all,thus saving from the need to express a view on British membership.It was for this reason that they had suggested the alternatives ofassociate membership and of &quot; something new and different&quot;. Butassociate membership would impose on us most of the obligations of membership with few of the rights, while &quot; something new &quot; wasin reality no more than a delaying device on the part of President de gaulle.There were five broad courses before the Government. First,we could decide that we should not apply for membership of theCommunity. Any assessment of this course required a comparison ofthe likely course of events if we joined the Community and if we remained outside; and many of the elements in such a comparisoncould not be quantified. If we decided not to join the e.c. it was most unlikely that we should succeed in joining any alternativeeconomic grouping: in such circumstances we could expect littlesupport from the United States for the formation of an Atlantic free trade Area, even though their view might be different if we appliedto join the e.c. and were then rebuffed. If we failed to seekmembership of the e.c. and remained outside any economicgrouping, it was likely that public opinion and industry would be critical and that private investment would fail to revive.The second course of action was to postpone a decision while we sought further information on the terms which might be availablefor British entry; but it was unlikely that we should learn much more from further discussions. Those e.c. countries which were willingto discuss the prospects for British membership in a constructivespirit had already done so, while the French would use the opportunityto cast doubts on our sincerity and determination. Conversely, thoseEEC countries which most keenly supported our entry would be discouraged and the momentum generated by the tour would bedissipated.The third possibility was to decide in principle that we would apply for membership but to engage in a further period of investigationbefore putting in our application. This course would provide us with little more information than we should be able to secure through thesecond course; and a declaration of intent without an early application
might still be taken as discouraging by our friends in the Community,who were urging us to press ahead quickly. The fourth possibility,which was not described in C (67) 60, was to follow the example ofthe previous Administration and to apply for entry on a conditionalbasis &quot; to see if the conditions we required could be met &quot;. The Sixmight, however, well respond to such an approach by refusing to start negotiations at all on the ground that our approach did not constitute a genuine application: or negotiations might start onlyto break down later in prolonged arguments over detail. Theresponsibility for the failure would then be placed on the UnitedKingdom, and the Government would be accused of having learnednothing from their predecessors&apos; mistakes.The fifth course was to apply now for negotiations for earlymembership of the Community. If this course were followed it wouldbe better to make a new application than to ask for a resumption ofthe negotiations which had broken down in 1963. The timetable oflikely developments both in the United Kingdom and in theCommunity over the next five years argued that we should make anearly application with a view to membership in 1969 or 1970. In1969 the Community would have to negotiate new arrangements both for agricultural finance and for their associated states. We should so time our entry as to be able to influence the revision of these arrangements in our own interests from within the Community.From the point of view of the strength and stability of our domesticeconomy we should not be ready to enter the Community until 1969:but if entry were deferred much beyond that time many of thedynamic effects on the British economy would be lost, United Statesinvestment would turn away from us towards Europe and industrialconfidence here would decline. By 1969-70 we should be in a positionto relax the stern policies we had undertaken in order to restore a healthy economy; and that would be the appropriate time at which toundertake new obligations arising from membership of theCommunity.If it were decided that we should apply now to negotiate for early membership of the Community, our application should bemade before the meeting of Heads of Governments of the Six in lateMay. If this were not done the French would be able to postpone the start of serious negotiations for the greater part of a year: and if negotiations did not begin until 1968 we should not achievemembership until after the renegotiation of Community arrangements in 1969. It was therefore important that we should apply at a very early stage. The appropriate procedure would be to explain toParliament, either in a statement or a White Paper, what the majordifficulties were, but to avoid attaching conditions specifically to our application for membership. We should be able to secure better terms on many issues of importance to us if we negotiated from inside the Community rather than as applicants for membership. On manyof the most difficult points we should find support for our pointof view from present members of the Community: but since weshould get support on different issues from different countries thisbacking would be much more readily available to us if we were alreadymembers. The accession of other new members as well as ourselves
CC 26 (67)would further change  the present voting pattern within theCommunity.   Although our essential interests would have to bedetermined and stated to Parliament in advance, the detailed arrangements which we should be willing to accept should only besettled as the negotiations proceeded.   The case for joining theCommunity could be made both on economic and political grounds.Although it was true that there would be disadvantages as well asadvantages for the economy, particularly in the short term, it was wrong to exaggerate the disadvantages especially since, by doing so,we risked giving the impression to the Six that we would look to themto assist us in our economic difficulties. Any public presentation ofthe arguments should state the economic advantages arising, forexample, from the reduction of tariffs and the added incentive toinvestment.  On the political side, membership of the community would give us far greater opportunities in foreign policy in relationto Western Europe, to Europe as a whole, and to the rest of theworld: the addition of a European connection to our existing links with the United States and the Commonwealth would give usopportunities for political leadership which would not exist if we remained in isolation. Although the e.c. was at present dominated by France, this dominance rested solely on the personality of president de Gaulle, whose eventual departure from the scene would endFrench dominance of the Community and create a vacuum that couldonly be filled, if the e.c. remained as at present constituted, byWestern Germany. There were already signs that the United states was paying increasing regard to Western Germany among herEuropean allies and it seemed probable that, if we failed to pursue ouropportunities for leadership in Europe, Western Germany&apos;s influence on the United States would more and more replace our own. both for economic and political reasons, therefore, the Prime Minister andhe had recommended in their paper that the United Kingdom shouldmake a clear application now to negotiate for early membership ofthe Community; that our essential interests should be set out in astatement to Parliament; but that the Government should notstipulate conditions at the time of their application which would commit them, before negotiations had taken place, on the terms whichthey would be willing to accept at the end of the day.In discussion there was no support for the course of action which involved postponing a decision while we sought information on theterms which might be available for British entry. Differing views were however expressed on the alternative courses of deciding:(i) That we should not now apply for membership of theCommunity.(ii) That we should decide in principle to apply for membershipbut engage in a further period of investigation before putting in our application.(iii) That we should put in an application for membership on aconditional basis.(iv) That we should apply now for negotiations for earlymembership of the Community, while making it clear to Parliament
and the public that we should in negotiation seek amelioration of theCommunity arrangements which would involve special difficulty forus either in the more important cases before entry or in the less important after entry.Some Ministers took the view that we should either not nowapply for entry or that, if the view were taken that politicalexpectations had been so aroused that this course was no longerpracticable, we should nevertheless only decide in principle to applywhile undertaking a further period of investigation or alternativelythat we should only apply on a conditional basis. In support of these views the following main arguments were advanced:(a) The economic and industrial advantages of joining theCommunity, which it had been maintained would in the longer termconsiderably offset the immediate disadvantages to our balance ofpayments, were not only unquantifiable, but had not been proven.In view of the admittedly adverse initial effects on our balance of.payments, the onus of proof in respect of the longer-term advantagesrested with the proponents of this course. The arguments which hadbeen advanced related primarily to the stimulus to industrial investment that would be given by our entry, to the advantages ofa larger market and to the further stimulus of competition which united Kingdom industry would have to meet from Europeanindustry. The stimulus to additional investment might well, however,prove to be illusory in the event. An early application might well befollowed by a year or more of abortive negotiation which would havean immediately depressing effect on our industry. Moreover, if, asthe weight of evidence suggested, the initial effects of joining theCommunity were economically adverse, industrial investment wouldbe still further depressed. We had in any event access to a largemarket both in the United Kingdom and in EFTA, but the industrialadvantage of a large market had been overstressed. Sweden was an outstanding example of a small country which was economicallyhighly successful, e.g., in shipbuilding and steel production, althoughit did not belong to a large integrated market. In certain fields,however, where a large market was admittedly of importance,it was doubtful whether Europe alone provided a sufficient base.In some joint defence projects and in other fields such as spacecommunications, experience showed that it was essential to extend the sphere of collaboration beyond Europe. The relative failure ofsome e.c. initiatives in the technological field, such as Euratom,demonstrated the inadequacy of the European market by itself forsuch purposes. Finally, there was no reason to suppose that additional competition would provide the spur that British industryrequired. The additional competition to which our industry had been subjected in recent years had not resulted in an increase in relativeefficiency, e.g., in motor manufacture.(b) There was particular reason for concern at the restrictions which membership of the e.c. might impose on our policies of regional development. The freedom of capital movement would leave it open to manufacturers who were reluctant to establishfactories in development areas of the United Kingdom to buildfactories on the Continent instead.   No studies of the probable
implications of joining the Community for particular industries or particular regions had been carried out, nor had there been anyadequate study of the structural changes which would be involved forBritish industry. Such information as was available in respect of the weakening of our controls for the direction of industry and also on theeffect on agriculture in Scotland, Wales and Northern England allimplied that entry would be disadvantageous to the interests of thedevelopment areas.(c) Agriculturally there could be no doubt that acceptance of thec.a.p. would have an adverse effect on our balance of payments,whatever arguments there might be about the degree of damage whichwould be caused. The c.a.p. would mean abandoning our presentsystem of agricultural support, which provided security for farmers,and substituting a more competitive system which was less in accord with the Government^ political aims. It was generally admitted that by any objective standard the c.a.p. was a less satisfactory systemthan our own and the deficiencies of the levy system had been widelyemphasised by Ministers in recent public pronouncements. Whateverview we might take of the relative importance of the agricultural industry in the United Kingdom, serious damage to the industry couldnot be justified on any broad view of the national interest.(d) These doubts relating to the industrial and agriculturalimplications of joining the Community, especially in respect of ourregional policies, further emphasised the disadvantages to our balanceof payments which would arise on joining the Community, as hadbeen argued in earlier Cabinet discussion on this aspect. It wassuggested that the additional strain which accession would impose onour balance of payments could be as much as 10 times the net cost ofour oversea defence expenditure. After intense effort by the present administration over a period of two years since coming to office,there had still been in 1966 a deficit on the balance of payments of 200 million and the prospect only of a small surplus in 1967. this had been achieved at the cost of reducing the rate of&quot;growth of the gross national product (GNP) to only 1 per cent. To achieve alarge enough surplus to offset the disadvantages of &quot;entry in terms of balance of payments we should require an annual rate of growth ofthe GNP of 3 per cent and it was by no means certain that we could achieve that rate, despite the present estimate for the ensuing year.Even if we did so, the Government would still not be able to offer the country any hope of relief from this policy of austerity by theearly 1970s. Entry into the Community would on the contrary entail the need to bring about a shift of resources and to reduce personal consumption in order to offset the adverse effects on the balance ofpayments. This continuing policy of austerity would not be acceptable to the country. Nor should we assume that even in the longer term our balance of payments position would be secured bymembership of the Community. It was noteworthy that France andGermany were now in difficulties over their balance of payments.(e) Nor could we assume that accession would increase our export, earnings, since the loss of preferences in EFTA and
Commonwealth markets would outweigh gains resulting from theremoval of e.c. tariffs. Entry would also deprive us of many of ourpresent governmental powers for protecting the balance of payments.We should have to abandon our present exchange control and our power to control imports during balance of payments difficulties.Nor, in view of the assurances which had been given during the tourthat we would not have recourse to aid from the Six, as such, underArticle 108 of the Treaty of Rome in cases where our difficulties on balance of payments resulted from the role of sterling as a reservecurrency, could we gain any worthwhile benefit through additionalco-operation in the monetary field. In broader terms the economic difficulties which our entry would entail would thus tend to make uspolitically dependent on the Six in exchange for our present policy ofdependence on the United States, whereas experience indicated thatthe United States would be a more advantageous ally to us than the eec.(/) Entry into the Community, or even an application to join,would seriously damage our Commonwealth interests. Admittedlyother Commonwealth countries had in recent years diversified theirpattern of trade but, while we had failed to increase our commonwealth trade, its absolute level had not diminished inconsequence. If, however, we were to apply for entry the othermembers of the Commonwealth would naturally intensify thediversification of their trade.(g) In addition to injury to our own trade with theCommonwealth, our entry would cause serious damage to theinterests of other Commonwealth countries. Acceptance of the c.a.p.would mean that our imports from traditional Commonwealthsuppliers would be subject to a levy and we should be givingpreference to imports from e.c. countries. Several of the smallerCommonwealth countries were almost completely dependent on theexport of sugar under the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement and;unless their interests could be adequately safeguarded the effect ontheir economies would be disastrous. Transitional arrangements would not suffice for this purpose. We should not seek to negotiatechanges on behalf of the Commonwealth only after we had made an:application for entry: in that event we should have little bargainingstrength and should be forced to concede points on which pledges hadbeen made by the Government. Although the attitude of other commonwealth countries had in recent years sometimes beenpolitically embarrassing to us, it was still in our interest to maintain asfar as possible the unity of the Commonwealth and our influence init. In addition to the damage which entry into the Community v/ouldcause to this political relationship and to mutual commonwealth trade, acceptance of the freedom of movement of labour within theCommunity would involve discrimination against commonwealth citizens in favour of e.c. nationals, contrary to the Governmenfsdeclared policy.(h) The political advantages of joining the Community had been over-emphasised since we should thereby damage our Commonwealthrelationships and we should still not escape the limitations on our freedom of action imposed by our special relationship with the United
States. While it was admittedly arguable that joining a larger group of nations would enhance our political influence, this would only be significant if the members of the Community were to pursue a singleEuropean foreign policy on which we could exert influence only asa member. But the Six were in fact wholly divided on major issues of foreign policy and we could exert influence upon them at present as effectively as if we were a member of the Community. Nor was itnecessarily the case that the United States would be likely to develop a closer relationship with Western Germany than with ourselves ifwe were not to join the Community; indeed recent developments had led the United States substantially to change their views on thereliability of the Germans as allies.(z) The political effects of joining the Community should not beconsidered wholly or even primarily in terms of our foreign policy.Political and economic considerations could not validly bedifferentiated. The Governments political position in the UnitedKingdom had suffered serious damage through the economic policies which they had been forced to adopt in consequence of the continuation of defence commitments overseas and the restraintsimposed by our special relationship with the United States. the continuation of these policies would seriously damage the positionof the Government in subsequent years.In the light of these considerations some Ministers took the viewthat we should not make any application to join the Community.Others who would in principle have preferred not to apply expressedthe view that this was now politically impracticable because the government&apos;s freedom of action had been circumscribed by the momentum which had been built up and stimulated by Press publicity in favour of entry. In such circumstances, these Ministers suggestedthat the best course would be to delay the initiation of negotiations.Such delay would avoid the imposition of an additional burden onour balance of payments in the years immediately ahead when we might be unable to sustain its burden. Furthermore, it was clear that president de Gaulle would oppose any concessions to British interest which would make entry easier for us. On the most optimisticinterpretation of his attitude his aim was to prolong negotiations fora sufficient time to prevent our membership during his lifetime. nor would he conceivably agree that major policies like those arisingon the c.a.p., where significant concessions were essential to us, couldbe revised in 1969 with ourselves as full members of the Community:rather he would seek to ensure that we accepted before entry whatthe c.a.p. should be after 1969. It seemed unlikely that it would bepossible for us to obtain satisfactory terms as long as President de gaulle remained in power and we should therefore engage in a further period of investigation before putting in a formal application. Thiscourse would be on balance economically advantageous, despite thedepressing effect which it might immediately have on the expectationsof British industry, since, if we entered the e.c. before we had achieved a strong balance of payments, the depressing consequences for our economy would result in both United States and United
Kingdom further investment taking place in Europe rather than in theUnited Kingdom. We should not ignore the advice from certain quarters that an application for membership at the present time wouldbe likely to fail. The tour by the Prime Minister and foreign secretary had shown that the Federal German Government were farless willing to put pressure on the French in respect of our entry than we had previously hoped and it had been the view of the federal german Ministers that we should confine ourselves at present to adeclaration of intent and defer an application. It was only undersubsequent pressure from us that they had modified this view. our partners in EFTA also doubted whether an application in theimmediate future would be successful.It was further suggested that if, despite these considerations, wewere to put in an early application for entry, it was essential that our application should itself be accompanied by a clear statement of theminimum conditions which we would require. This might be interms similar to those used in the Labour Party&apos;s last election manifesto to the effect that essential British and commonwealth interests would have to be safeguarded. If these essential conditions were not made clear in our application we might later find ourselves in the position that it would be too late to withdraw from thenegotiations but that we could not achieve satisfactory conditions. Inparticular this course was necessary to safeguard the pledges whichwe had given in respect of Commonwealth interests. It was an illusionto believe that we should be in a better position to negotiate acceptableterms on the main issues as a member of the Community rather than as a candidate for membership. Once we had entered the Communitywe should lose much of our bargaining power since we should nolonger be able to profit from the fact that the Five at least wished usto become members. A further factor which would strengthen our hands in negotiations if these took place before entry was that industry in Western Germany was anxious to gain access to theEFTA market and this would no longer be a factor we could influenceafter we had joined. In negotiations in the Community we must bearin mind that the basic aim of the Six w,as to maintain a protectiveregime for agriculture and we should thus find a majority of theCommission opposed to us on agricultural issues. If we were to stateour conditions for entry as part of our application, it would be easier for us to withdraw and to justify our position subsequently if we failedto obtain satisfactory terms. The point was also made that, whatevercourse might be adopted, we should defer any application over thefollowing two weeks during which time negotiations in the kennedy round would be at their crucial stage since their success might be jeopardised by the effect of an early application from us.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet proved however to be substantially in favour of making an immediate application for entryunaccompanied by conditions. This course in no way implied thatwe should seek to enter the Community unconditionally. On thecontrary the Government would at the time of their statement thatsuch an application would be made also inform Parliament of theessential interests which we should have to safeguard in the
negotiation. These interests would therefore be made clearly knownnot only to the country, but also to members of the Community.But to state conditions publicly in Parliament was substantiallydifferent from attaching specific conditions to an application for entry.In support of these views the following arguments wereadvanced (/) Even in the short term there were economic advantages to be derived from an application to join the e.c., primarily through the impetus which it would give to industrial investment in view of the expectations of British industry; and we should begin to reap these advantages at the time of our declaration and before the initial impact of the disadvantages, which would only begin at the outset of the transitional period in, say, 1970.(k) In considering the balance of economic advantage anddisadvantage, such disadvantages as would be entailed by entry mustbe balanced not only against the advantages, but also against the disadvantages that would be entailed by our abstaining from joiningany larger economic grouping. These disadvantages must beexpected to increase with time. Recent events had shown that our capacity to plan our economy independently was less than had hitherto been supposed. Pressures upon us had prevented the policy on prices and incomes from being as effective as we would have wished. We had also been unable to control the course of investment by foreign companies as fully as would have been desirable inprinciple, because of the pressure of economic forces. The continental countries were in process of evolving a political organisation whichwould be more suited to modern economic needs and it would be contrary to our interests to stand aside while their decisions were beingtaken. We must not assume that, if we did not secure entry at anearly date, our situation would remain unchanged. The importanceof a larger home market for industrial development would increase.Industry in the Community, because it was based on such a largermarket, would increase its competitive advantage over Britishindustry. It was misleading to adduce Sweden in support of a policyof abstention from any such larger group, since both Governmentand industry in Sweden were in favour of entering the e.c. and their main concern was that we might become a member and Sweden mightfail to do so. Only by becoming part of a larger market could weescape the dilemma that, if industrial firms were to grow to the sizerequired by modern technology, they would through their size acquire a monopolistic position in any one country. Furthermore, in thecoming years the e.c. would be developing standards in such aspectsof industry as commercial law and insurance and our exclusion fromthese and other developments would restrict our economicopportunities.(/) The requirements imposed by the development of moderntechnology for the minimum size of firms able to compete in world markets meant that we ourselves could not compete against theUnited States domination in this field, particularly if we also bore inmind the outflow of scientists and technologists from this country
to the United States and the large resources which their firms were able to deploy. Only in co-operation with Europe could not only we ourselves but also European firms acquire the industrial base whichwould enable Europe as a whole to compete with the United States.It would be important to bear in mind in negotiations that we should bring to the European Community a large and advanced technologicalcapacity which would be a source of strength to Europe if we joined,but equally a grave disadvantage to them if we were excluded and inconsequence came increasingly under the technological domination of United States industry.(m) In considering the advantages and disadvantages for our balance of payments in the short term of joining the Community wecould expect that there would be some adverse effect in the shortterm but this should not be over-emphasised for the reasons whichhad been fully developed in earlier discussion by the Cabinet on this issue and need not be repeated in detail.  In any event and evenon the more adverse calculations, which took no account ofmitigations which we might secure in negotiation, we should bearin mind that the adverse consequences would be recouped over a five-year period by an increase of about one-half of 1 per cent in therate of growth of industrial productivity.   The papers before theCabinet showed that the economic policy which the Government werepursuing was not only necessary but was also the policy best calculated  to meet the requirements imposed by joining theCommunity. Far from entry making it more difficult to pursue thispolicy, it would ease the strain imposed by it because of the stimuluswhich entry would give to industrial investment.  The comparisonwhich had been made between the cost to the balance of payments of entering the e.c. and our oversea defence expenditure was invalid.Inter alia, it rested on the higher of two widely spaced estimates of thetotal cost of entry.   Furthermore, our present national difficultiesresulted from two main causes: a level of defence expenditure overseas disproportionate to our resources and our internationalisolation from large national groupings which increasingly dominatedthe world economy. On this analysis it would be right to save foreign exchange by reducing our oversea defence expenditure and ifnecessary to incur short-term additional foreign exchange expenditurein order to remedy these deficiencies.   We could not howeverquantify even the adverse effects on our balance of payments until we were aware of the conditions which we could negotiate for entry.These could only be ascertained by entering into negotiations. the papers which had been studied by the Cabinet had shown that manyof the regulations made under the Treaty of Rome allowed forderogations in the interests of individual countries and it was reasonable to expect that similar derogations would be made to meet our own particular national interests. If we were to become a memberwe should then be enabled substantially to mitigate the adverse effects on our balance of payments.  Even in the agricultural field the adverse effects of the c.a.p. should not be over-estimated.Producers of cereals would benefit substantially while there was good reason to expect that means could be devised of obtaining assistancefrom the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund for the small
farmers in Scotland, Wales and the North of England whose interest might suffer from other aspects of the c.a.p. If We could negotiatesuch assistance we should not only help the farmers concerned butreduce pro tanto the burden of levy contributions on our balance ofpayments.(n) Even if, despite these considerations, the economic consequences of joining the Community proved to be no more thanevenly balanced, the political advantages of joining were decisive.If we continued in our present position we must recognise that in international politics our influence had markedly declined. Forexample, we had been obliged to adopt United States policies in anumber of fields and even in relation to a former dependency, Guyana;the Soviet Union had been the effective mediator between India and pakistan during the recent conflict in Kashmir; and we had been unableto discharge fully our obligations in respect of Rhodesia. In otherspheres we had to a substantial extent felt bound to follow the policies of the United States; and it would be contrary to the views of a largenumber of the Government^ supporters to be forced to continue inthis position. We must not in any event allow ourselves to becometotally dependent on the United States nor on the other hand could we contemplate aligning our policies with the Soviet bloc: joining the Community was essential if we were to avoid finding ourselvesincreasingly isolated and powerless in world affairs. We must also have regard to the dangers which would arise in Europe if we werenot to become a member of the Community. In that event, andparticularly after the death of President de Gaulle, the community would become increasingly dominated by Western Germany andthere were ample indications of the fears of other European countries of the consequences of such domination, whether or not it was accompanied (to our further disadvantage) by a closer relationship between Western Germany and the United States. In fact if we failedto enter the e.c. there was a serious danger that the community would become increasingly estranged from the United States. Sincethe United States was the only major Power which was committed to the maintenance of the democratic freedoms in which we believed,it was fundamental to our interests to prevent such a development.The e.c. had, despite its diversity, become a group with substantialpower and influence. This had recently been exemplified in thediscussions on international monetary reform and in the kennedy round. If we were to join the Community we could expect to beinfluential in persuading the other members to adopt more liberaland less inward-looking policies. We could hope to gain a new role of political leadership which would provide the political stimulusformerly given by our imperial role. Moreover, United kingdom membership of the e.c. would not represent so much a change ofpolicy as an extension, albeit a significant one, of our presentinvolvement in Europe which was expressed in our membership ofsuch bodies as the Council of Europe, the Western European Union,the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development andthe North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. We had recently made one
minor but significant extension of our commitment to Europe through a decision to accept the right of individual petitions to the EuropeanHuman Rights Commission and Court. In the field of human rightsand in other legal fields we had contributed much to Europeandevelopment and our experience here suggested that so far from having difficulty in acquiring influence we could easily assume a leading, and even dominant, role.(o) It was also suggested that entry into Europe should beregarded as a first step towards ultimate ideal world government.It was further argued that there were strong reasons for making an early application for entry, deriving both from the advantages of doing so and from the disadvantages of delay.   Further bilateral discussions and the accumulation of further factual information couldnot be expected to give the Cabinet any clearer picture of the situationthan they had now. Requests to the Six for such further information would either give an impression of vacillation on our part or would lead to substantive negotiations.  But to ask for further assurancesbefore beginning negotiations would strengthen the hands of thosewho opposed our entry. Indeed, in considering the extent to which the momentum which our approach to Europe had acquired and theconsequences of this for the Governments freedom of action, itshould not be forgotten that the extent of public support andparticularly the extent of opinion in favour of application on the partof the Governments supporters in Parliament had itself contributed to the momentum which had led to the earlier decision that the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary should visit the capitals of the Sixon their tour of investigation.   If we were to enter the e.c. thepresent was a particularly favourable time. There had been a checkin the last few years to the Community&apos;s evolution towards a supra-national form of organisation.   It was important that we should become members of the Community in order to influence its policybefore any advance towards political union was resumed. The recentimprovement in relations between the Council of Ministers and theCommission also made the present time opportune for us to seekentry. The same considerations applied with particular force to theneed to obtain the opportunity of influencing the renegotiation of thec.a.p. when this fell due for review in 1969. There was no case forpostponement on economic grounds since it was impossible to forecastwith any accuracy whether our relative economic strength would be greater in the early 1970s.  Failure to apply now would dismay theFive and our partners in EFTA and would damage our relations withthe United States.  It would be impossible to revive the momentumfor entry some years hence after receiving such a check. Moreover,while admittedly no one could forecast what attitude President de gaulle might adopt, it was relevant not only that influential figures in France opposed to him were in favour of our entry but that theGaullist leaders, who might be expected to prefer that we should make an application during the lifetime of President de Gaulle, because he would be in the best position to rebuff us or to impose stringentconditions, showed on the contrary anxiety lest we should make anearly application for entry. This suggested that they took the view
that the longer we delayed the harder it would be for us to secureentry on acceptable terms. In short, delay would play into the handsof General de Gaulle and his closest supporters.An early application was moreover desirable for negative as wellas for positive reasons. The worst possible outcome for the UnitedKingdom would be for the present uncertainty over our relationship with the e.c. to continue. Public opinion was now largely in favourof application for entry and the Government would only be able toapply the economic policies which would be required if we were tomake a success of a policy of abstaining from any economic groupingif we had first applied for membership of the e.c. and had been rejected. Moreover, once we had made our application we should notbe able to force the pace of negotiations and it was possible that theFrench would seek to prolong them to the point where we found it necessary to discontinue them. If we reached this point it would be important that we should do so in time to make effective ouralternative policies before the end of the present decade.Nor would it be desirable to make an application accompanied byconditions. It was clear from Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome thatto make an application without qualification did not implyunconditional accession to the Treaty. The Treaty itself envisaged that conditions of entry would emerge in the course of discussion ofthe application. Moreover, to make an application accompanied byconditions would inter alia provide the French Government with a ready opportunity for vetoing our application on the ground that itwas not seriously intended and our tactics must be to make a veto bythe French difficult, if not impossible. The best way to do so wouldbe to make our application in the simplest possible form. It wouldbe contrary to normal tactics in any negotiation to demand at the outset as a condition of entering into negotiations the preciseconditions which a negotiator sought to obtain on their conclusion.If in such circumstances our application were to fail, blame for thefailure of such a major governmental initiative would be ascribed byopinion both at home and abroad to the Government; and failure insuch circumstances would leave behind no sense of concerted nationalpurpose which would enable us to carry through effectively the policies which the situation would then require. An application withoutconditions attached did not of course imply that there were not certain minimum conditions which we must negotiate before we could acceptentry nor that there were not other changes which we should seek tonegotiate after entry.Our position in these respects could properly be set out inParliament in the Governmenfs statements in respect of their application. But such a course would be substantially different from our attaching such conditions to our application itself. If this coursewere followed it would be important to distinguish in theannouncement to Parliament between the interests which we should wish to establish before entry and the objectives for which we shouldstrive in negotiations thereafter. The aim should be to keep theformer to a minimum since we would be better placed to secure certain
concessions as a member rather than a candidate. The interests whichwe should have to stipulate before entry might be confined tosafeguarding the position of New Zealand, to suitable arrangementsfor the sugar exports of the smaller Commonwealth countries, whetherdependent or independent, and to suitable transitional periods on other matters. We should so far as possible refrain from givingspecific commitments about the course we would follow in negotiations after entry on other aspects such as the renegotiation ofthe c.a.p. in 1969. An application in these terms would have thefurther advantage that if offered the best choice of avoiding protractednegotiations whichwould be gravely disadvantageous to us.The Prime Minister said that at this stage he would not seek tosum up the discussion. In considering some of the points which hadbeen made we should recognise that so far as our foreign policy was concerned we were not considering the possibility of a Europeorganised on federal lines; what was involved was the degree of influence that we might be able to exert on major decisions of foreignpolicy in the future. Major difficulties and perhaps a period of disorder might occur in France after the death of President de gaulle and disquieting tendencies were discernible in Germany. If we wereinside the e.c. we would be able to exert our influence in theformative stages of policy, whereas outside it we should not be ableto do so and might be forced into closer association with United states policy in the Far East. Similarly, if we were a member of the EECwe could influence developments of Community policy on worldliquidity. So far as the economic aspects were concerned, he had said in public speeches that the case for our entry was not proven, but this statement related explicitly only to the basis of quantifiableinformation available to us at present; this did not take account of changes that we might secure in the course of negotiations. Relationswith the Commonwealth in recent years in economic matters hadbeen disappointing. There had been little attempt on the part ofother Commonwealth countries to look other than to their narrownational interests. In spite of the initiatives we had taken at theMeeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers in 1965 there had beena complete failure to take concerted Commonwealth action, evenin respect of Government purchases. New Zealand and Australiapreferred to purchase American aircraft of types not superior to ourown. Canada had done nothing to redress our adverse trade balancewith her and although she was giving economic aid, especially in the carribbean, she was doing less in proportion to her GNP than we were.In the Far East the policies of Australia and New Zealand were increasingly diverging from our own, with a very strong emphasis ontheir narrow area of interest in South-East Asia.As to future procedure, the Cabinet had already agreed that theirformal decision whether or not to apply for membership should betaken at their next meeting in Downing Street. In the light of thediscussion he would prepare a short draft statement to parliament which the Cabinet could consider on Tuesday, 3rd May, and which,if the Cabinet agreed, he would make shortly thereafter.Consideration of this statement would give the Cabinet the

Before the debate a White Paper should bepublished giving an account of recent events, including the tourby himself and the Foreign Secretary, leading up to the cabinets decision. This White Paper would describe the major issues likelyto arise in the course of negotiations and the safeguards which weshould seek to obtain: it would include the text of his statement tothe House of Commons and a series of annexes which might coversuch subjects as agriculture and the legal and constitutionalimplications of entry into the Community. The draft White paper should be available during the course of the current week; and thebasis of the debate the following week might be a Motion inviting the House to approve the terms of the White Paper. During the whitsun Recess preparations should be made for the publication ofa series of more detailed White Papers, possibly including a furtherpaper on agriculture. The draft booklet on Britain and the EECprepared by the Department of Economic Affairs (attached toC (67) 67) should be further considered but it was possible that itmight not be ready for publication before the Recess.
