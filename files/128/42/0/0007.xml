CC 7 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on Thursday,16th February, the Vote on Account, 1967-68, would be published and would reveal a rate of increase in public expenditure for thatyear in excess of the rate of 4  per cent per annum which theGovernment had set as a limit under the National Plan. The rateof increase could be calculated in a number of ways; but the lowestfigure it was possible to calculate would be 5-3 per cent, and interms of the Estimates for 1967-68 as against those for 1966-67, therate of increase would be 8-6 per cent. These increases were theresult of the collective Ministerial decisions which had been takenabout public expenditure, but they would be bound to attractcriticism; and in view of this, and of the confusion which might arise from different methods of calculating the rate of increase, it wouldbe essential for him to give careful guidance to the Press about theannouncement. He proposed for this purpose to prepare a statementrecalling that the First Secretary of State had announced on10th November a review of our economic planning. In this reviewboth the level and the priorities of public expenditure would ofcourse be considered in the light of the economic and socialobjectives of the Government, including the need to ensure that therate of increase in public expenditure and in other calls on the economy would not outrun the prospective increase in our totalresources: the public expenditure figures should be seen against this background. The statement would also refer to the economies in defence expenditure which the Government were making. It wouldbe desirable to make clear that the Government had decided that public expenditure should be allowed to increase at a faster rate thanthe national income, in pursuance of their policy of enlarging thepublic sector relative to the private sector. Copies of the statement would be circulated to Ministers for use in speeches.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the action proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that after discussion bythe Defence and Oversea Policy Committee further proposals hadbeen put to the Maltese Government on the previous Monday. Theseproposals offered discussions between the two Governments on theeconomic consequences of the reduction of our forces, urged the malta Government to accept our earlier proposal to send a mission of industrialists and conceded that in the context of the economic7876
Soviet Union(previous reference:CC (66) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2)Anglo-SovietTalksdiscussions we would be prepared to consider some re-phasing ofthe rate of reduction of our forces, provided that this was completed within the planned four-year period. This offer was conditional upon the Maltese Government.ceasing the harassment of our forces and proceeding no further with legislation to amend the visiting forces Act, by which they would purport to abrogate the defence agreement. It had been stated on behalf of the Maltese Governmentthat these proposals &quot; did not warrant rejection &quot; but they were still being considered by the Maltese Cabinet. It was known that the maltese Prime Minister was in considerable political difficulty andthe Bill to amend the Visiting Forces Act had now been taken through its committee stage in the Maltese legislature. Nevertheless,there seemed a reasonable prospect that the Maltese Governmentwould, accept discussions on the basis of our proposals.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was beingsuggested in Malta that deliberate action should be taken by the maltese Government to withdraw their sterling balances in order to embarrass us. These balances were very large in relation to thepopulation of Malta and could well be used to assist their economic development. It was unlikely that they could in fact be used in away which would cause us any serious financial concern and weshould not be deterred by this threat from action which we judgeddesirable in the light of our other interests.The Prime Minister said that the current discussions with theSoviet Prime Minister, Mr. Kosygin, had been friendly and constructive. Although Mr. Kosygin had found it politicallynecessary to take an unyielding line in his public speeches, he hadnevertheless gone out of his way to seek to create the impression ofthe restoration of the wartime comradeship between the twocountries; and he was clearly anxious to reach agreement on a constructive communique on the conclusion of the talks. Inparticular he was concerned to increase trade between the twocountries, especially in consumer goods, and to develop technologicalco-operation. A number of international issues, including Vietnamand the prospect of securing agreement to a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, had been discussed, but it was uncertain whether progress could be made on this occasion. We had sought to persuade Mr. Kosygin not to pursue his proposal for aconference on European security, which could not be expected tohave any useful outcome in present circumstances. At the Sovietrequest, the strictest security had been maintained about even the issues that were being discussed and it was important that no reference should be made to these subjects by Ministers on other occasions since otherwise the outcome of the discussions might be fseriously prejudiced.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister, theChancellor of the Exchequer and the commonwealth secretary. .. .
secret. The Cabinet resumed its consideration of a memorandum bythe First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for economic affairs (C (67) 13) on the future of the Governments policy on prices and incomes and considered a further memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (67) 16) on his consultations with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC).The First Secretary of State said that in pursuance of the cabinets decision at its meeting on 7th February, 1967, he had informed the CBI and TUC that the Government proposed that part IV of the Prices and Incomes Act should lapse, that Part ii should then be activated, but that in the Governments viewadditional statutory powers going beyond those in Part II would be needed. It was clear from his consultations that the only course which would meet with approval of the CBI and TUC would be toallow Part IV to lapse and to take no further action. If theGovernment were to confine themselves to activating Part II, therewould be some protest but no serious opposition. If, however, theGovernment were to take additional statutory powers, both the CBIand the TUC would formally oppose them. It was, however,uncertain how strong their opposition would be: his impression wasthat the TUC would not in the event carry its opposition to the pointof seeking to destroy the policy. The Governments decision shouldnot be determined solely by the attitude of the CBI and TUC; publicopinion was also an important factor. If the Government did not take additional powers on the expiry of Part IV, there would be a widespread feeling that their action was inadequate to meet thesituation and that the opportunity created by the measures takensince the previous July to achieve a lasting policy on prices and incomes was being lost. The Government should therefore allowPart IV to lapse, activate Part I! and take additional powers.The minimum powers needed, if selfish minorities were to be prevented from undermining the policy,&apos;were powers to postponeincreases in prices or in pay, wholly or in part, for up to 12 months;to prevent retrospective payment of increases in pay which had been so postponed; and to require reductions of prices for up to 12 monthseven where no increase had been proposed but where the criteriainvolved such reductions. It was for consideration whether12 months was the right maximum period of postponement; the tuc&apos;s reaction to this had appeared to be that they were content to regard 12 months as the Governments initial proposal. Thepower to prevent retrospective payment of increases of wages whichhad been postponed was essential if the policy were to be effective;but it would have to be made clear that to take such a power wouldbe going considerably further than simply strengthening theprovisions of Part II. These additional powers could either beexercised independently by the Government or confined to the enforcement of recommendations by the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI). On balance, the latter course was preferable.It would mean increasing the load on the Board, but the practical
problems which this would create could be overcome. consideration would need to be given to devising safeguards in the exercise of thepowers: it would be possible, for instance, to make them subject to annual renewal by Parliament and to require consultation with the cbi and TUC before renewal was sought; or the Government could also be required to consult similarly before exercising the powers ineach individual case, and to give the parties immediately concernednotice of their intention and an opportunity to make representations.It would probably also be necessary to make provision forindemnifying employers who had entered into contractual obligations to increase pay but who had not fulfilled those obligations becauseof the standstill. If an employer in this position had given due notice to his employees, he would be protected from legal proceedings bySection 30 of the Act; but there were many cases where no formalnotice had been given and in any case Section 30 would lapse inAugust 1967. If no indemnifying provision were introduced, some employers might be at risk of legal proceedings for a period of six years after the event.It had been suggested that the difficulties of enforcing the policy on incomes would be avoided if statutory powers were confined to prices alone. This approach might merit further considerationthough it involved many difficulties.He had told the CBI and TUC that the Government proposedthat there should be a &quot; nil norm &quot; for wage increases during the12 months following July 1967 and that all wage claims during thisperiod would be judged against criteria which would in substancebe the same as those set out in the original White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639). This proposal was unwelcome tothe TUC but they had not reacted strongly.If the policy were to be made acceptable, it would be necessaryin presenting it to emphasise at the same time what was being andwould be done to increase production. It had been suggested in the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion that the Government should offer tothe trade unions an economic strategy which would incorporate a specific rate of economic growth over the coming years, and that thisshould form part of a bargain with the trade unions who would inreturn accept the policy on prices and incomes. The obligations tobe undertaken by the trade unions would however then be clear and definite while the obligations on the part of the Government wouldbe speculative. The Government could not guarantee that aparticular rate of economic growth would be achieved and it would therefore be unwise to do more than state that the Governmentwould do all in their power to promote faster growth. It was also important that the policy on prices and incomes should be seen tobe operating in the context of other policies, the whole being directed towards a more equal distribution of wealth. In this respect,however, the policy on prices and incomes offered only limitedpossibilities and other social and economic policies would be moreimportant.When the Cabinet had reached decisions on the issue of statutory powers, it would be desirable for him to have further consultations with the CBI and TUC before any announcement was made.
The Minister of Labour said that the TUC opposition to additional statutory powers should not be under-estimated. It was likely that the TUC Economic Committee, which was meeting that day, would be unanimous in opposing the Governments proposals and they were likely to seek an early meeting on the subject withthe Prime Minister. The Government should not suppose that thepolicy could be effective if it were opposed by both the CBI and the tuc. While it was true that the TUC could not guarantee thatthey would be able to deal with minority groups of workers whosought increases in breach of the policy, it had to be recognised onthe other hand that the additional statutory powers which the first secretary of State proposed could not in the last resort be enforced.The policy had been successful hitherto because of the loyalty to theGovernment of large sections of the trade union&apos;movement. Butthis had been against the background of acquiescence in the policy on the part of the TUC. If additional powers were taken, theposition would be that unions who opposed the policy in futurewould be doing so with the backing of the TUC and in those circumstances the policy could not possibly be effective. The right course therefore was for the Government not to go beyond theactivation of Part II, but to make it clear that, if the policy on this basis proved, within a short period, to be failing to meet the economicneeds of the country, the Government would then be forced to takewider powers.In discussion, it was argued that, if the Government were to go beyond the delaying powers in Part II, they would in effect be moving towards a system of statutory determination of all wages; this was neither practicable nor desirable. While the trade unions had accepted compulsory powers for a limited period of emergency, therewas no prospect that they would acquiesce in such powers as part ofa permanent policy. Nor should the Governments economic strategy be based on the principles of intervention in and control ofthe detailed working of the economy. It would be more effective to rely on broader measures to adjust the extent of reflation or deflationin the light of current economic trends. Furthermore, experienceelsewhere suggested that high rates of wages were a strong incentive to economic efficiency.On the other hand, it was argued that the present economicsituation justified a policy on prices and incomes on the lines proposed by the First Secretary of State. The basic issue was whether we could achieve reflation and renewed economic growth withoutagain incurring a deficit in our balance of payments. Without an effective policy on prices and incomes, the prospects of achieving this were remote. It was already likely that the average rise in wagesover 1967 would be about 6 per cent, while we could scarcely hope for productivity to increase over the same period by more than 2 or3 per cent. To delay taking statutory powers until the voluntaryoperation of the policy was seen to fail would risk a further major economic crisis. Even if the Government were to take only delayingpowers, they would have to face the opposition of the TUC and inthese circumstances they might reasonably also take the wider powers
proposed by the First Secretary of State, which were the minimum necessary to ensure that the policy would be effective.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) Greater efforts should be made to persuade the TUC to acquiesce in the Governments proposals. The Government coulddeploy a strong argument by saying that the alternative to an effectivepolicy on prices and incomes was a reversion to &quot; stop-go &quot;, and this argument could be reinforced by pointing to the Governmentssuccess in controlling the extent of deflation following the Julyeconomic measures; the increase in unemployment was now coming to an end and the number of unfilled vacancies was rising; the policy on prices and incomes had played an important part in making this possible.(b) The additional statutory powers proposed by the first secretary of State would only ensure the deferment of wagemovements by up to 12 months;, they would not be directed tochanging the pattern of wage movements. A preferable course might be to fix a norm for wage increases in agreement with the tuc and to make provision for increases to particular groups beyondthe norm to be challenged in the courts. Such action in the courtsneed not necessarily be taken by the Government; it might bepossible to envisage other bodies such as consumer organisationsbeing authorised to undertake it. On the other hand, it was urgedthat arrangements of this kind called for powers more extensive thanthose proposed by the First Secretary of State and would thereforebe even less acceptable to the TUC.(c) To have a &quot; nil norm &quot; for the 12 months after July 1967with more liberal criteria for wage increases to particular groups,might well result in large wage settlements. It might be preferable to have a norm of, say, 2 or 3 per cent, with virtually no exceptions.On the other hand it would be difficult to postulate a uniformincrease for all workers nor would this be economically desirable and the TUC had not appeared to be violently opposed to a &quot;nilnorm &quot;. Indeed they appeared to expect that this would be theGovernments policy for the period following severe restraint.(d) If, as the First Secretary of State proposed, the Governmentwere able to exercise their additional, statutory powers only to enforcerecommendations of the NBPI, this would not be adequate to preventminority groups from undermining the policy since it would not be practicable for the NBPI to deal with every proposed increase.(e) A possible course might be for the Government to securethe passage of legislation incorporating powers on the lines of those proposed-by the First Secretary of State, but not to activate thepowers for the time being. If experience then showed that delayingpowers in Part II were inadequate, the wider powers could be broughtinto force without delay before a point of crisis was reached.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of future policy on prices and incomes at a meeting early the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th February, 1967.
