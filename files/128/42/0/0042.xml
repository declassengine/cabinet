SubjectPublic ExpenditureEconomic Outlook to 1972 and Civil Reviews
SECRETPublicExpenditureEconomicOutlook to1972 and GivilReviewsThe Cabinet had before them the following memoranda by theChancellor of the Exchequer:C (67) 97 Public Expenditure:  Civil Reviews: Health and welfare.C (67) 98-Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Social Security.C (67) 99-Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Housing.C(67) 100-Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Education and science.C (67) 101-Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Roads.C (67) 102-Public Expenditure: Areas of Choice.C(67) 103-Public  Expenditure:   Continuation  of ExistingC (67) 104-Public Expenditure.C (67) 105 The Economic Implications of Public Expenditure(covering a note by officials).C (67) 109 The Economic Implications of Public Expenditure,and a Memorandum by the First Secretary of State (C (67) 108) onthe Economic Outlook to 1972.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the voluminousstudies by officials which were now before the Cabinet provided an analysis of the whole range of public expenditure and of the optionsin varying that expenditure which were open to the Government.Great credit was due to the officials concerned for the admirable workwhich they had carried out. The intention of the review was toindicate the bases on which it would be open to the Government toreduce civil expenditure in 1970-71 by between  200 and  300 million,depending on the extent of the saving achieved on defence, in orderto achieve a total saving of  500 million. The papers reviewed thelargest blocks of civil expenditure in order to facilitate decisions onsuch reductions and any change in priorities which the Cabinet might also wish to make. The report of the Medium Term AssessmentCommittee (MTAC) attached to the memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (67) 108) gave a realistic appraisal of the futureof the economy up to 1972. There was competition for the available resources between public investment, private investment, exports and private and public consumption. It was essential that the first priority should be given to exports, and it was important to encouragesome areas of expenditure which were at present somewhat depressed,notably private investment. Provision was essential to meetprogrammes of social expenditure and governmental expenditure insupport of private industry, such as investment in the nationalised industries. Hitherto, in considering priorities between these variousfields, private consumption had been regarded as the residuarylegatee after the needs of other fields of expenditure had been met:the Government were rightly determined to redress the previousbalance between public and private expenditure in order to improve the standard of public services: but the time had now come toconsider the degree of priority which should be accorded to theprivate consumer in his own right.Policies.
On taking office the present Administration had. agreed to plan on a basis of a yearly increase in public expenditure of 4  per cent.This had in practice been exceeded and the yearly rate of increase was now 4 - 7 per cent, while further needs would inevitably continue to arise. Personal consumption, on the other hand, was increasing ata slower rate than over the past decade and it was questionable whether a continuation of this trend would be acceptable to thecountry. In the light of the papers before the Cabinet an important political decision in this respect was required.In their past consideration of public expenditure the Governmenthad not sufficiently refined their assessment of the demands made on resources by various fields of expenditure. Much work still remained to be done in this regard, but the papers before them now drew abroad distinction between three fields: expenditure on goods,expenditure on services and transfer payments. In terms of pressure on demand, expenditure on services involved the highest pressure and transfer payments the lowest.In the light of the situation revealed by these various studies itshould be the Governments aim to reduce the annual increase in public expenditure to a figure slightly less than their original target of 4  per cent by making a reduction of  500 million in the present planned expenditure in 1970-71. This would reduce the annual rateof increase in public expenditure between 1965-66 and 1970-71 to4-1 per cent, and would mean that expenditure in 1970-71 would be 1,120 million higher, in terms of constant prices, than in 1967-68.The studies which were being carried out on the reduction of defence expenditure indicated that it might not be possible to achieve agreater saving than  200 million by 1970-71. To achieve the target of  500 million it would therefore be necessary to effect a reductionof  300 million in civil expenditure. In seeking such a reduction, itwould be necessary for Ministers to look primarily at large blocks of expenditure, though officials should also consider the extent towhich smaller savings could be made in other fields. The political implications of not making a cut of this order would be serious. it seemed improbable that it would be publicly acceptable that private consumption should increase only at the low rate which would thenbe involved. Private investment was expected to increase in 1968 andsuch an increase was important to our future productive capacity.The claims on resources resulting from higher rates of private consumption and of private investment would necessarily entail somerestriction of public expenditure if the necessary resources were tobe available for exports. 1968-69 would be a year of particular difficulty and it would then be necessary on the basis of presentprogrammes substantially to raise the general level of taxation. Anincrease might also be necessary in 1969-70; and these increases would be superimposed on an increasing burden of household ratesand on higher national insurance contributions. It was also necessaryto bear in mind that the steady increase in prices entailed a diminutionin the value of personal tax allowances as long as these remainedconstant in money terms. Even with the reduction of public expenditure which he proposed, some increase in taxation in thisperiod would still be necessary.  In considering the fields in which
reductions would be sought, his colleagues might concentrate onhis memorandum on the Areas of Choice (C (67) 102), covering areport by officials which set out various major fields of expenditure and the implications of reductions in each of them.The First Secretary of State said that the report of the MTACattached to his memorandum (C (67) 108) included an assessment ofthe probable growth of personal consumption on alternative trendsof productivity and alternative levels of public expenditure. Theconsumer would not be content to regard his level of consumption asa residual legatee in the allocation of resources after other requirements had been fully met. Although the predictions in thereport might in some particular respects prove to be over pessimistic,they could not be regarded as being so in total. The Governmenfsefforts to increase productivity should in time lead to a higher rateof growth: but it would be imprudent to plan on the basis that suchhigher rates would be achieved before this could be demonstrated by events. Moreover, it must be borne in mind that the assessment made no allowance for events such as the illegal declaration of independenceby Rhodesia, or the recent conflict in the Middle East. Such events,which must be expected to occur from time to time, almost invariablycaused some damage to our economic position. It must also berecognised that the assessment assumed a reasonable degree of success in the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes.In considering priorities between private and public expenditure,it was also necessary to bear in mind that certain types of public expenditure were important to the future growth of the economy.Furthermore, some were more flexible in operation than others; forexample, expenditure on the social services could be more rapidlyexpanded within a short period than expenditure on roads. If the assumptions in the assessment proved to be over pessimistic, it wouldthen be possible rapidly to expand expenditure on the social services:but other programmes would be inelastic in the short term.The Defence Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had at an earlier stage agreed that we should plan on the basis of changes in ouroversea policy necessary to achieve savings in defence expenditure ofthe order of  200 million by 1970-71 and  300 million by 1975-76.These changes included the assumption that we should have withdrawnour forces and given up our defence facilities in Malaysia and singapore by not later than 1975-76. The studies which had subsequently been carried out had demonstrated that these savings could be achieved on the basis of such changes in our policy.Moreover, the planned saving of  200 million in defence expenditure by 1970-71 included the acceptance on the Defence Budget ofexpenditure, not hitherto carried on that Budget, on the Armed ForcesHousing Loan and also expenditure on the P-1127, which the cabinet had decided should be undertaken for industrial reasons and thefuture of the British aircraft industry and not because it was essential for defence purposes. If allowance were made for the additional expenditure on these two items, it could fairly be claimed that the changes would provide for a saving on defence expenditure of  250SECRET8182a 3
million by 1970-71. The cost of military equipment inevitably roseat a faster rate than the gross national product (GNP) and the attainment of a given level of military capability would thereforeautomatically increase in cost year by year. Yet on the basis of thepresent plans up to 1970-71 the Government would in the six yearsby which they would then have been in office have cut defence expenditure by 5 per cent whereas in the same period governmentalcivil expenditure would increase by 25 per cent. As regards theburden of defence expenditure on the balance of payments, recentstudies had demonstrated that the real cost in foreign exchange was substantially less than had hitherto been supposed. After itspreliminary interdepartmental examination by officials, he would circulate a paper to his colleagues showing the extent to which defence expenditure overseas represented a real burden on the balance ofpayments. As regards the possibility of reducing defence expenditure at an even faster rate, the studies had demonstrated that our overseacommitments could not be reduced at a faster rate than was nowplanned; and that we could not reduce our military capability exceptin step with the reduction of commitments. The plans provided,however, for a reduction by 1975-76 of 80,000 in uniformedpersonnel and of 25 per cent in our military capability.The timetable for the consideration of the papers was inevitablytight. If there were to be a Parliamentary Debate on the issues involved before the Summer Recess, it would be necessary first to publish a White Paper, and its terms would have to be approved bythe Cabinet by the end of the week beginning Monday, 10th July.The studies were now being considered by the Defence and overseas policy Committee and would come before the Cabinet in about 10days&apos; time. It was questionable whether it would be possible to holdmore than two meetings of the Cabinet to consider them and thedraft of the White Paper.In discussion of the economic outlook, it was argued that it wouldbe wrong to accept the assumption underlying the main projectionsin the report by the MTAC that productivity between now and 1972would increase only at the same rate as the trend increase achieved inrecent years. That rate of increase related to a period before the policies of the present Administration directed to increasing industrial efficiency had begun to take effect. To assume that we should notimprove on this was tantamount to asserting that the whole range of these policies would have no material effect in accelerating thegrowth of productivity. On the other hand, it was pointed out thatthe MTAC report did not imply that we could not achieve the higher rate of increase in productivity; the report set out the implications for the economy of the alternative assumptions of a higher and lowerincrease. There was scope for argument on whether the effect of higher productivity would in the initial years entail additional strain on our balance of payments on the lines forecast in the report; but inany event it would be imprudent to assume beforehand, for thepurposes of the review of public expenditure, that we should achieve the higher rate of increase. A high price in economic terms hadalready been paid for such an optimistic assumption in the past; andif we continued to make this assumption and founded on it an
ambitious public expenditure programme, we should find it difficultto retrench at a later stage if our expectations were not fulfilled. if on the other hand we planned on the basis of a more modestachievement, it would always be practicable to adjust public expenditure later, particularly in fields such as social security wherethe programme was flexible, if in the event productivity increasedfaster.It was also argued that the level of unemployment projected in theMTAC report was higher than the Government should contemplate.In addition to human considerations, the continuance ofunemployment at anything approaching the present level wouldmean serious under-utilisation of resources, particularly in the regionswhere unemployment was highest, and we could not afford this. Ifwas the deliberate restraint of demand and the consequent high levelof unemployment which were retarding the growth of the economy,rather than any failure of the Governmenfs policies for increasingindustrial efficiency. The Government should therefore in the nearfuture introduce sufficient reflationary measures to ensure a fullerutilisation of resources. On the other hand, it was argued that, whilethe underlying trend in unemployment was responding more slowlyto the Governmenfs policies than might have been expected, therewere reasonable grounds for believing that the second half of 1967would bring a revival of demand. Public investment would be risingand increases of wages would also be providing a stimulus toconsumer demand. There were already some signs in the construction industry that shortages of skilled labour were developing in some partsof the country. The danger of introducing further reflationarymeasures at the present time was that they would only begin to take effect from the spring of 1968, by which time the economy should inany case again be expanding.In discussion of the implications of the economic outlook for thefuture programme of public expenditure, it was generally accepted that some reduction in the existing programme was necessary.Resources would have to be made available to match the expected recovery in private investment and this inevitably called for some restraint on either public expenditure or personal consumption. The main consideration was to avoid overstimulatingthe economy, with a consequent recurrence of balance of payments difficulties and the need for further deflationary measures. It was,however, also important to allow personal consumption to increase at a tolerable rate. Indeed, any attempt to hold down consumptiontoo severely would be likely to fail since it would stimulate inflationarywage increases. While the Government were committed in the longterm to some shift of resources from private consumption to thesocial services, the prospective rise in the real burden of taxation andother public levies showed that such a shift would take place evenif the growth of public expenditure were held back to the extentproposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Nor could theGovernment afford to ignore the attitude of the ordinary citizen, as aconsumer, towards continued restraint of personal consumption.
Whatever the material facts might be, there was evidence that thepublic now felt strongly that the level of consumption should beincreasing at a faster rate. These considerations pointed to asubstantial reduction in the existing programme of public expenditure.Against this, it was suggested that the papers before the Cabinetshowed that the increase in public expenditure if the existing programme were continued would be mainly concentrated on theyear 1968-69. The increase in that year was expected to be 6-9 percent, but in subsequent years the estimated increase was much lass and by 1971-72 it was expected to be less than the increase in thenational product in that year. Expenditure in 1968-69 would be particularly high due to a number of non-recurrent factors and itwould be logical to treat that year in isolation by temporary measuressuch as the use of the tax regulator, rather than by imposing a general reduction in the programme for that year and subsequent years. Onthe other hand, it was argued that it was illusory to suppose that therate of increase in public expenditure would fall away after 1968-69.Experience showed that estimates of expenditure made some years ahead were invariably exceeded in the event, since new claims on thepublic purse could always be expected to materialise as time wenton; and in relation to the later year in question, the programmes of departmental Ministers were not yet fully developed.In discussion of the size of the reduction which should be sought in the programme of public expenditure to 1970, there was considerable support for a reduction materially less than that of  500million proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. A reductionof that order would mean that the annual increase in public expenditure would in fact be less than the yearly increase of A\ percent which the Government had set as their target in 1965. the argument presented for a reduction as large as  500 million reliedprimarily on the need to allow a faster growth in personal consumptionthan would otherwise be possible. But personal consumption as a proportion of GNP was already higher in this country than in most other industrially developed countries. It could be argued that theneed for basic services such as roads and houses should take priority over an increase in personal consumption. A reduction of  500million was intended to make possible an average annual increase in personal consumption per head of 2-2 per cent. This was approximately the same as the average increase over the past decade.But the growth rate of the economy during that period was higherthan we could expect to achieve between now and 1970, and itwould be more in accordance with the present economic prospect to aim at a growth in personal consumption averaging 2 per cent ayear, which was the rate achieved in the period 1961-66. It shouldbe possible to achieve this consistently with a much smaller reductionin the programme of public expenditure, which, including the cutsin defence expenditure might possibly be of the order of  30O- 350million in 1970-71 and could be achieved without unacceptabledamage to the Governments social objectives.In further discussion, it was strongly argued that it would be wrong to decide the size of an overall reduction in the programme
without regard to the way in which it was distributed among different kinds of expenditure. It would be necessary to consider the effects ofparticular reductions on the pressure of demand and on the demandfor imports. It would also be of the first importance in allocatingreductions to distinguish between expenditure which would itselfmake a contribution to the productive power of the economy andwould thus affect the rate of economic growth which we could achieve and other forms of expenditure. It would be necessary to bearin mind that reductions in the roads programme would have a particularly serious effect in the development areas.It was also relevant in determining the size of the reduction toconsider the means of raising the additional revenue needed tomaintain the pressure of demand at a constant level. It might wellbe that the raising of revenue by means of charges such as road tollswould be more palatable than additional direct taxation. A furtherpossibility meriting examination related to mortgage lending by localauthorities. An increase in the volume of lending to owner-occupierswould mean an increase in saving which would benefit the economy generally. At present, local authority mortgage lending tended tobe treated on the same footing as public expenditure generally, thoughit was more akin in its economic effects to transfer payments than toother forms of expenditure. There might be advantage if it couldbe taken out of the category of public expenditure completely. one way of doing this might be to establish a consortium of localauthorities which would undertake mortgage lending on a considerable scale, raising its funds on the market and not by resort to theExchequer.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed on the need for some reduction in the programme ofpublic expenditure to 1970-71, but at this stage the balance of opinioninclined towards a reduction smaller than the  500 million proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer. However, a decision on the totalsize of the reduction would be affected by the kinds of expenditure which would be reduced. In deciding where reductions should bemade, it would be necessary to consider carefully how far particularblocks of expenditure made a contribution to the productive base ofthe economy. The Chancellor of the Exchequer should consider withthe Ministers most concerned the possibility of raising additional revenue by means of charges, particularly for services of an economiccharacter. He should also consider with the Secretary of State forScotland and the Minister of Housing the feasibility of removinglocal authority mortgage lending from the scope of public expenditure by the establishment of a consortium of local authorities on the lines suggested in discussion. He should report to his colleagues urgentlyon these matters so that account could be taken of them in the currentreview. The Cabinet would resume their consideration of public expenditure at an early date and the Ministerial Steering Committeeon Economic Policy would be giving further consideration to the main issues involved in the light of the views which had been expressed.
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to consider with the Ministers most concerned the feasibility and desirability of raising additional revenue by charges rather than by increases in taxation, as indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion;(ii) to consider with the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment the possibility of establishing a consortium of local authorities to undertakemortgage lending on the lines suggested in discussion;and to report on these issues to his colleagues in the context of the present review.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy toconsider further in the light of the discussion the main issues arising in the review of public expenditure.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion at an early date.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,&apos;27th June, 1967.
