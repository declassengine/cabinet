CC 18(67)OverseaAffairsSouth Arabia(previous reference :CC(67) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he intended to make a statement in the House of Commons that afternoon about the circumstances in which the United NationsMission to South Arabia had broken off discussions in Aden andhad withdrawn from the Colony after publicly expressingresentment at the manner in which they alleged they had been treated by the British authorities. It had clearly been necessary totake stringent precautions to ensure the personal safety of themembers of the Mission; but it was unfortunate that these had apparently given them the impression that they were beingdeliberately prevented from making contact with the local populationor visiting such establishments as they wished to inspect. It was even more regrettable that they had been abruptly refused permissionby the Federal Government to broadcast to the people of south arabia on the grounds that they intended to take this opportunitypublicly to deny the Federal Governments authority in theterritory. Had we been given adequate notice of their applicationto broadcast we could have taken on ourselves the responsibilityfor dealing with this question, since it was essentially a matter of external policy and was therefore reserved for our decision underthe existing arrangements. As it was, the action of the federal government, coupled with the generally hostile attitude of the local inhabitants, had finally convinced the Mission that no useful purpose would be served by their trying to pursue their enquiries in aden.The Mission were at present in Geneva; and efforts were beingmade to persuade them to stop at London on their return journeyto New York in order that we might try to minimise the probablerepercussions of their visit to Aden on future discussions aboutSouth Arabia in the United Nations.Meanwhile, this incident had made it clear that it was essentialto provide a more effective and immediate political presence in aden; and he had therefore arranged, with the approval of the.Prime Minister, for the Minister without Portfolio (Lord Shackleton)to visit the Colony for a period in order to assist the HighCommissioner, to keep a close watch on local developments and toexercise general supervision over the manner in which our intentions as regards the future constitutional advance of South Arabia shouldbe pursued. The Federal Government appeared to be not unwillingin principle to consider our latest proposals; and we need not yetabandon hope that popular opinion in Aden might also beeventually reconciled to them.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s recommendations. It would be necessary to make itclear in any public statement that the security precautions whichhad been adopted in Aden in relation to the United Nations Missionhad been wholly justified; and, if the United Nations neverthelessmaintained their irresponsible criticism of our Administration in the
Colony, we might have to consider offering to transfer to them thewhole task of promoting a constitutional settlement for south arabia and ensuring the subsequent defence of the area against aggression, provided that they were prepared to accept responsibilityfor implementing and enforcing whatever solution they devised.confidential the Budget 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to theCabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in theCabinet Conclusions.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,10th April, 1967.
