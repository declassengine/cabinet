CC 11 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Parliament would rise for the Easter adjournment on Thursday, 23rd March, untilTuesday, 4th April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet would wish to consider the attitude which the Government should adopton a motion which would be before the House of Commons onWednesday, 15th March, proposing that ten shillings should be the basic unit, instead of the pound, for the decimal currency. Aconsiderable campaign had been mounted by advocates of theten shilling unit and it was now being urged on wider grounds thatthe motion before the House should be tested by a free vote. Thereasons which had moved the Cabinet to decide in favour of the pound as the basic unit were, however, still valid and it was questionable whether in these circumstances it would be appropriate for a free vote to be allowed.In discussion it was suggested that, in so far as the issue wastechnical rather than one of policy and also one which arousedconsiderable public interest and feeling, there might be advantage in allowing a free vote. After further discussion it proved however to be the general view that, since this was an important issue onwhich the Government, after full consideration by the Cabinet, had declared their policy, it would not be appropriate to accept that thedecision should be subject to a free vote in the House of Commons.The Cabinet Agreed that a free vote should not be allowed on the motion in the House of Commons the following week on theadoption of ten shillings as the1 unit of the decimal currency.secret. The Prime Minister said that he and the Foreign secretary had now completed their discussions with the Heads of Governmentof the Six member countries of the European Economic Community(e.c.). It was now necessary to consider the procedure whichwould afford the Cabinet the fullest opportunity to consider what steps should be taken next. The issue whether to apply for membership of the e.c., and if so, when and in what manner, was so momentous that the Cabinet must clearly have ample time toconsider and discuss it. It was necessary to avoid on the one handundue haste in coming to a decision and on the other procrastinationwhich (if the decision should be to apply for membership) woulddissipate the momentum and interest achieved by the recent seriesof visits. He proposed, therefore, that the first step should be for himself and the Foreign Secretary to give the Cabinet a full factual7898
account of their recent discussions with the Heads of Governmentof the Six countries. To that end a full paper should be circulatedto the Cabinet, if possible before the week-end of 18th-19th March,setting out the impressions they had gained from their discussions,but making no recommendations. In particular, the main body ofthe paper would set out what they had learned on the issues whichhad concerned the Cabinet in their discussions before the Europeanvisits, and bring out what seemed to be the more serious problems,and what were the possibilities of solving them. The paper shouldalso set out the points of difficulty which had been raised by the six themselves, and in particular their anxieties about the changein the character of the Community which would result if the UnitedKingdom and all or most of her partners in the European free trade Association (EFTA) were to accede to it; and also theiranxieties about the position of sterling in the United kingdom economy. The paper would thus provide a full analysis of the issues which would arise if there were to be a decision to negotiatefor entry to the Community; and there should also be annexed tothe paper a full summary of the discussion which had taken place ineach of the capitals.Before Easter the Cabinet should devote at least a full morning to the discussion of this paper, and if necessary the discussion couldbe continued after Easter. Until the position had been fullyanalysed in this way, it would be wrong to seek to reach a decision;he proposed, therefore, that after Easter and after the discussion ofthe initial paper had been completed, he and the Foreign secretary should circulate a further paper, in the light of. the cabinet discussions, making recommendations on whether negotiations for entry to the e.c. should be started and if so, when and in what manner. A considered decision could thus be reached without undue haste or undue delay.In discussion, it was suggested that it would be helpful if thefirst paper to which the Prime Minister had referred could haveappended to it a full record of the discussions in Paris; and thatduring the period of consideration of the position by Cabinet, itwould especially be desirable to avoid speculation in the Press.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime ministers statement on the procedure to be adopted for considerationof the next steps in the approach to Europe.OverseaAffairsMalta(previous reference :CC (67) 10thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Minister without Portfolio said that by agreement withthe Commonwealth Secretary, on the latter&apos;s return from his touroverseas, he was remaining in charge of the current discussions inLondon with the Maltese delegation on the reduction of our forces there. These discussions had been greatly protracted and it seemed probable that we should have to threaten to bring them to an endif we were to elicit any decision from the Malta Government. The
Prices andIncomesThe Futureof Prices andIncomesPolicy(previous reference :CC (67) 9thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda bythe First Secretary of State and Secretary of State for economic affairs (C (67) 13 and 20) on the future of the policy on prices and incomes. &quot;The First Secretary of State said that since the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, the Prime Minister, with the Minister of Labourand himself, had discussed with the Economic Committee of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) the future of the policy on prices and incomes, but no agreement had been reached on the questionof statutory powers after the expiry of Part IV of the Prices and incomes Act. On 2nd March, the conference of union executivesconvened by the TUC had expressed opposition to the retention ofany statutory powers, but had endorsed the tuc&apos;s own proposalsfor a voluntary incomes policy. This represented a definite gain in view of earlier indications that, if the Government appeared tobe persisting in their intention to seek further statutory powers,even the maintenance of a voluntary policy might be rejected. Itsendorsement was also valuable in that the policy incorporated theproposal for annual discussion between the Government, the7898a 3CC 11 &quot;&quot;(67)real aim of the latter was to delay for two years the start of the run down of our forces. This we could not accept for reasons which would be fully supported by public opinion in the UnitedKingdom. The Maltese delegation had in consequence somewhatshifted their ground and were now pressing us to agree that theundrawn balance of our aid for the first three of the ten yearscovered by the Financial Agreement, which would lapse under theterms of the Agreement, should nevertheless not be lost to them.This was an issue on which the Maltese case would have muchgreater public support and it would be unfortunate if we were forced to break the negotiations on it.In discussion there was general agreement that furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of our acceptingin negotiation that the undrawn balances should be made availableto Malta at some stage during the remaining seven years of theFinancial Agreement.The Cabinet Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of overseas Development, to consider further the desirabilityof our accepting that the undrawn balances under theFinancial Agreement with Malta which had lapsed on theconclusion of the first three years should nevertheless bemade available to Malta at some stage during the currency of the Agreement.
Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the TUC of economic prospects as a basis for settling the norm for wage increases.Decisions were now urgently needed on the norm for increases in incomes and criteria for increases both of prices and of incomes in the period following July 1967; these were even more pressing thandecisions on statutory powers. Claims for wage increases after Julywere now being made and those responsible needed guidance onhandling them. He had proposed in C (67) 13 that for the 12 monthsfollowing July 1967 there should be a nil norm for wage increases,which would mean that no one would become entitled to a wage increase simply because of the passage of time but only if justified by the criteria. The criteria for this period should be broadly thesame as those set out in the original White Paper on Prices and incomes (Cmnd. 2639). But it would be necessary to add a furthercriterion whereby, in considering claims by particular groups ofworkers, account could be taken of whether or not the groupsconcerned had received increases or suffered deferment of increasesduring the standstill and the period of severe restraint; this wouldbe necessary for a temporary period until the anomalies resultingfrom the emergency policy over recent months had been remedied.A nil norm for the period in question would be preferable to a lowpositive norm of, say, 2 per cent. The accumulation of wagedemands during the standstill and the period of severe restraint wouldmake it imprudent to fix any positive norm. Moreover, the TUC,while not welcoming a nil norm, were expecting it and wouldprobably acquiesce.As regards statutory powers, he adhered to his previousrecommendation that the Government should activate Part II onthe expiry of Part IV, extend the maximum period of delay onincreases of prices and wages which was permissible under Part ILand take power to prevent the retrospective payment of increased wages following the imposition of a delay. There should be similardelaying powers in respect of prices and also a power to enforcereductions of prices. These powers should be exercised only if theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) so recommended,though the Government would not be obliged to accept such recommendations.In view of the need for early guidance, the Government should publish before Easter a short White Paper setting out their intentionson norm, criteria and statutory powers for the twelve monthsfollowing July 1967.The White paper in discussion there was general agreement that an early statement on norm and criteria was essential in order to giveguidance to those concerned with wage negotiations.It was also urged that the statement should include some reference to the Governments intentions as regards statutory powers.The absence of any such reference would provoke an adverse reactionabroad and, since many trade unions would shortly be holding their annual conferences, the Government should give a lead if their case on future policy was not to go by default.
On the other hand it was argued that it would be unwise to publish a White Paper before Easter which included a statementof the Governments intentions as regards statutory powers. ThePrime Minister at his meeting with the TUC had made it clear inaccordance with the previous Cabinet decisions that the government did not regard the conference of union executives on 2nd Marchas in any way setting a term to discussions on this issue. He had emphasised that the Government had been careful not to commit themselves publicly to a position directly opposed to that of the tuc. It was significant that the General Secretary of the TUC, inaddressing the conference on 2nd March, had referred to continuingdiscussions with the Government on the future of the policy. Ifthe Government were now to declare in a White Paper their intentions as regards statutory powers, this would harden the resistance of the TUC, reduce the chances of a negotiated agreementfollowing further consultations and encourage trade unions at their annual conferences strongly to oppose the Governments policy.In further discussion, it was suggested that the right coursewould be to publish a White Paper stating the governments intentions as regards norm and criteria, but making only a general reference to statutory powers. The White Paper could state that part IV would not be renewed after its expiry in August 1967, thatin the Governments view the activation of Part II would then benecessary, but that discussions were continuing with the CBI andTUC on the exact form of statutory powers for this period and theway in which they would be operated. The reference would on theone hand have to preserve the Governments freedom eventually to insist (if they so decided in the event) on a power to preventretrospective payment of wage increases and to extend the maximum period of delay, but on the other hand should not commit theGovernment to this course.Norm and criteriaIn discussion on the norm and criteria it was suggested that itwould be preferable to have a low positive norm of, say, 2 per cent for the twelve months following July 1967, rather than a nil norm.A nil norm might result in discrimination against employees in thepublic services and others who would be unable to justify increases under the criteria. Since it would also mean that all claims would have to be judged against the criteria, the load on the NBPIwould be unmanageable. On the other hand, it was argued that a positive norm would inevitably become the minimum increase for allemployees and the unions would invariably seek to negotiateincreases beyond it; the load on the NBPI would not therefore be substantially less, while the average rise in wages would be likely tobe higher than our present economic circumstances warranted. Anil norm coupled with more liberal criteria would represent a moresensible progression from the periods of standstill and severe restraint and would be better received by opinion abroad. Nor would it benecessary with a nil norm to refer all claims to the NBPI, particularly since it would be open to the Government to decide which claims
should be referred. A nil norm should not lead to discrimination against the public services, since the proposed criteria would allowincreases where the pay of particular groups of workers had fallenseriously out of line with the level of remuneration for similar work.This in effect allowed wage increases on the basis of comparability,though it might be necessary to draft the relevant criterion rather more widely than in the original White Paper.There was general agreement that the criteria for the twelvemonths following July 1967 should be broadly those set out in theoriginal White Paper (Cmnd. 2639), with an additional criterionwhich would enable account to be taken of the experience ofparticular groups of workers during the standstill and the periodof severe restraint.Statutory powers in discussion of statutory powers, the following main points were made:(a) The Government should confine themselves to the activationof Part II, the maximum period of delay being extended to sixmonths. The relevant legislation should then be on a permanent basis rather than valid for twelve months only. The TUC mightbe brought to acquiesce in permanent legislation if the scope of thepowers were so limited and we should then avoid the risk ofjeopardising discussions with them on legislation in the field ofindustrial relations following the report of the Royal Commissionon Employers Organisations and Trade Unions. On the other hand,it was urged that to extend the maximum period of delay to sixmonths, which was only two months longer than the maximumpermissable under Part II, would not be worth the criticism whichnew legislation would provoke.(b) The proposal for a power to prevent retrospective paymentof wage increases, which was certain to prove a major irritant tothe TUC, should be dropped. Its importance could easily beoverstated since retrospective payments were not common in private industry. The exercise of such a power might lead to an attemptto enforce statutory sanctions, with all the difficulties which thatinvolved. On the other hand, it was argued that negotiating practice in private industry would be rapidly adapted to conditions ruling atthe time. If the Government had only a delaying power,retrospective payments would be seen as an easy way of defeatingthe exercise of such a power and would therefore become muchmore prevalent and it was urged that it was accordingly essential toretain this proposal.(c) The Government should take power to order the rescindingof price or wage increases which had been implemented without prior notification as required under Part II; the absence of such a power would put a premium on evasion.(d) There was no reason to suppose that the voluntary policy proposed by the TUC would be incompatible with the exercise of statutory powers by the Government. The tuc&apos;s vetting machinerymight on occasion approve particular claims which the Government
thought should be referred to the NBPI; in such cases theGovernment would then exercise their power to enforce a standstillpending a report by the NBPI.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that for the twelve months followingJuly 1967 there should be a nil norm for wage increases and allincreases should be judged against criteria on the lines of those setout in the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639),with an additional criterion which would enable account to betaken of the experience of particular groups of workers during the periods of standstill and severe restraint. The governments intentions in these matters should be announced in a short white paper to be published before Easter. As regards statutory powers,the White Paper should say that Part IV would not be renewedwhen it expired in August 1967, that in the Governmenfs view itwould be necessary to activate Part II but that discussions were continuing with the CBI and the TUC on the form and scope of statutory powers after the expiry of Part IV. Statutory powers should be the subject of continuing consultations with the CBI andTUC after the publication of the White Paper: certain aspects of the government&apos;s proposals on powers were negotiable, but the proposalfor a power to prevent retrospective payment of wage increases should not be abandoned without further reference to the Cabinet.The First Secretary of State and the Minister of Labour should nowhold urgent consultations with the CBI and TUC and in the lightof those discussions the First Secretary of State should circulate adraft White Paper for early consideration by the Cabinet.Publication of the White Paper should be accompanied by astatement in Parliament and appropriate briefing of the Pressincluding the editors of trade union journals. It would be helpful if the First Secretary of State would consider with those of hiscolleagues concerned what could be done to influence theforthcoming annual conferences of trade unions, with the object of ensuring that, even if resolutions were passed in opposition to the government&apos;s proposals, the conferences would nevertheless take account of the fact that consultations on future policy were still continuing between the Government and the TUC.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State, with the Minister ofLabour, to consult further with the CBI and TUC and inthe light of that consultation to circulate a draft white paper on the lines indicated in the Prime Ministefssumming up of their discussion for consideration by theCabinet in time for publication before Easter.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th March, 1967.
