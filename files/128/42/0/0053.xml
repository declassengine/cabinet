The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons, after the Summer Adjournment, in the week beginning Monday, 23rd October. It was expected that parliament would be prorogued on Friday, 27th October and that the new session would open on Tuesday, 31st October.In discussion of the progress in the House of Lords of Mr. Steel&apos;sMedical Termination of Pregnancy Bill, the Cabinet were informedthat the third Reading would be on Monday, 23rd October.
China(previous reference:CC(67) 37thConclusions,Minute 3)BritishHondurasMiddle East:Suez(previous reference:CC(67) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)Reuter&apos;s correspondent in Peking, Mr. Gray, was under housearrest and the only access to him was by telephone through the BritishCharge d&apos;Affaires in Peking. This action by the Chinese Governmentwas probably in retaliation for the detention of certain Chinesejournalists in Hong Kong in consequence of their activities in promoting disorder. Mr. Gray had no exit visa from China and itmight be that charges against him would be trumped up; we hadprotested to the Chinese both in London and in Peking and were considering what action we might take to secure his release, buteffective steps to this end were difficult to devise.Talks had been taking place with the Foreign Minister ofGuatemala on the report of Ambassador Bethuel Webster, who hadbeen nominated by President Johnson at the request of Guatemala,and with our concurrence, to mediate in our long standing dispute with Guatemala about British Honduras. There was alreadyagreement between the two sides on most of the recommendations made by the mediator and it seemed likely that there would be early agreement also on the basis for a settlement of the two outstanding points, which concerned sovereignty and relationships in foreignaffairs and defence. Although it would not be possible for theForeign Minister of Guatemala openly to reach bilateral agreementwith us on the issue of sovereignty, it was expected that he wouldbe able to agree privately on a basis that could then be pressed on both sides by the mediator and subsequently accepted. In this event it should be possible for us to proceed with arrangements for grantingindependence to British Honduras.The prospects for an early re-opening of the Suez Canal weregloomy. Although it was estimated that physical clearance of the canal would only take about two months, it was the main bargaining counter for the United Arab Republic (UAR) in any negotiations that might take place about a Middle East settlement; and they hadlet it be known that the Canal might be closed for six months. It wouldbe prudent for us to take account of the possibility that, even whenthe Canal was re-opened to shipping of other countries, transit byBritish and United States ships might *be denied and that we mightnot be able to use it for up to a year from now. Officials were to study the implications of this for us and the steps that we might take to reduce our dependence on the Canal. The UAR was howeverlosing  8 million a month in foreign exchange while the Canal was closed. The Soviet Government were thought to be unwilling to make good this loss to the UAR and to be pressing her to agree to end the state of belligerency with Israel in return for limited troopwithdrawals from Arab territory. The withdrawal of Israeli forces from the east bank of the Canal would be a key point in any attemptto re-open it. In Israel there was an unresolved conflict between those members of the Government who were prepared to attemptto negotiate with the Arab countries on the basis of a limitedwithdrawal of their troops linked to an ending of the state ofbelligerency and others who favoured making no move at all tonegotiate. The outcome should be known shortly. As regards the crews of British ships trapped in the Canal, arrangements had beenmade for those who wished to leave to do so.
Hong Kong(previous reference:CC(67) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)Nigeria(previous reference:CC(67) 50thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet Took note of the statementsCommonwealth Secretaries.by  the  Foreign   andCONFIDENTIALT^atre ^ 3.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 142) by the censorship     Home Secretary about theatre censorship.The Home Secretary said that the Joint Select Committee onCensorship of the Theatre had recommended that the lord chamberlain&apos;s censorship powers should be abolished and notreplaced by any other pre-censorship provisions; and that stage playsshould be put on the same footing in law as books and otherpublications. The Home Affairs Committee had agreed on 19th Julythat the Government should accept the report. There remained forconsideration a number of questions on the adaptation of the obscene publications Acts for the purpose of the theatre, but this need notinhibit acceptance of the recommendations in principle and he proposed to make an announcement later that day on the lines ofthe draft attached to his memorandum. It was important that the government&apos;s decision should be announced quickly and should befollowed by early legislation because of the difficulty in which theLord Chamberlain found himself in the interim. The lord chamberlain was known to be anxious, pending legislation, to restricthis activities to the protection of the Sovereign and the Royal Familyand to indicate that apart from this he would not exercise practicalcensorship. He and the Attorney-General had, however, in discussion the Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in HongKong had improved, the number of incidents there had declined and morale was now much higher. Two Chinese journalists from the mainland, one of whom had only been in Hong Kong for six weeks,had been imprisoned for terms of two and five years on criminalcharges; other Chinese journalists were detained and were to be triedshortly. The possibility of arranging with the Chinese government an exchange of the two convicted journalists for Mr. Gray, therepresentative of Reuters who was under house arrest in Peking, wasbeing considered.An amphibious landing by Federal Nigerian forces had takenplace and the town of Bonny had been captured together with anumber of troops of the breakaway state of Biafra and large quantitiesof their ammunition. Federal troops were about 35 miles from themain oil refinery in Biafra and were near Port Harcourt. There hadbeen some damage to oil installations although its extent was not known. It now seemed likely that the Federal Government would be successful in its action against Biafra and, in these circumstances, itwould be in our interest for the Shell Company to make payment of oilrevenues to the Federal Government and none to Biafra.
CONFIDENTIALwith the Lord Chamberlain persuaded him that pending legislation it would not be proper for him to announce that he would notdischarge his statutory functions. The Lord Chamberlain had accepted this, subject to an assurance from the Attorney-General thatif plays were presented in defiance of his refusal to approve them,proceedings would be taken.The Prime Minister said that he had thought it right that theCabinet should discuss the report of the Joint Select Committeebecause he was concerned that the complete abolition of pre-censorship would leave the way open to the portrayal of livingpersons on the stage. The portrayal of the Sovereign or of headsof foreign States might cause offence in this country and abroad; and,while no exception could be taken to political satire as such, playsportraying public men for purposes of political advantage or privatemalice might well do harm to the public interest. The present practice of the Lord Chamberlain, who shared his concern, was to prohibit representation of the Sovereign and to give any other personswho might be portrayed an opportunity to see the script and to make representations, in the light of which he decided whether he wouldrequire the modification of the text or refuse to permit the play tobe presented. The position in respect of television was that, although there was no longer a statutory prohibition of the presentation ofliving persons, the control exercised by the Independent television authority (ITA) in matters of taste was in practice used to prevent an acceptable degree of political lampooning of public figures frompassing into their portrayal in a manner plainly motivated by political or personal malice. Lord Hill, the chairman designate of the british broadcasting Corporation (BBC), had assured him that in his (LordHilFs) view the powers vested in the Governors of the BBC were adequate to enable a similar practice to be adopted and that it wouldbe his intention to exercise them in such a manner as to preventwhat he described as &quot; character assassination &quot;. These assuranceswould remove the difficulty which the Home Affairs Committee had felt about prohibiting the portrayal of living persons in the theatrewhen it was not prohibited on television. In neither medium wouldordinary political satire be forbidden; but there should be safeguards against the theatre being used deliberately to discredit or createpolitical hostility towards public figures.In discussion it was suggested that the theatre could be distinguished from television since, unlike television, it did notpenetrate into the home and attendance was optional. Stage playsshould therefore be left to the operation of the ordinary law and thegood taste of the public. On the other hand, the dangers of politicallymotivated representation of living persons were recognised; but itwas pointed out that it would be difficult to replace the censorshipexercised by the Lord Chamberlain with a stricter requirement thatthere should be no representation of living persons on the stage at all;and anything short of this would raise the practical problem ofproviding for an exercise of discretion by some other individual orbody. The problem would require careful consideration in thepreparation of the Bill but in the meantime it might be wise to modify
Prices andIncomesPublic SectorPricesSECRET4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onincreases of prices in the public sector:Memorandum by the First. Secretary of State (C (67) 137),Memorandum by the Minister of PowerPC (67) 139),Memorandum by the Minister of Transport (C (67) 141).The First Secretary of State said that increases of prices in thepublic sector had already been approved this year to bring inadditional revenue of  115 million a year. The proposals for further increases which were now before the Cabinet would bring in about 50 million a year and, in addition, proposed increases in Post Officecharges would raise another  70 million a year. Since he had circulated his paper, British European Airways (BEA) had made anapplication, which was now under consideration by the Air TrafficLicensing Board, for increases in domestic passenger fares and freightCC 53 (67)the proposed announcement of the Governmenfs intentions byomitting, subject to consultation with the Lord Chamberlain, the reference in the second half of the first sentence of the draft to theabolition of his powers and by indicating in the final sentence that&quot; for the time being &quot; rather than &quot; in the meantime &quot; he would continue to discharge his duties under the existing law.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet were in general agreement with the Joint SelectCommittee&apos;s principal recommendation, it was important that asolution should, be found to the problem of the portrayal of livingpersons on the stage. The Home Secretary should examine thiscarefully and put proposals before the Home Affairs Committee, withhis proposals for adapting the Obscene Publications Act to stage plays.In the meantime the Governmenfs intentions could be announced on the lines indicated in their discussion.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to accept the general principle of therecommendations of the Joint Select Committee onCensorship of the Theatre.(2) Invited the Home Secretary:(a) to announce this decision in a written reply to a parliamentary Question on the lines of the draft attached to C (67) 142, amended in the light oftheir discussion and of further consultation with theLord Chamberlain;(b) to consider how provision could be made to deal withthe problems of the presentation of living persons on the stage and to bring proposals before theHome Affairs Committee.
rates. The total of these increases, if implemented, would representa most serious threat to the future of the policy on prices and incomes and the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomesconsidered that it was essential to examine the situation as a whole.We should not abandon existing general principles for settling prices in the public sector of industry; but it must be recognised that, ifprices of essential services were increased over the next few monthson the scale proposed, there would be intolerable pressures on thepolicy on prices and incomes, which was now largely a matter of voluntary restraint but was too an essential part of the Governmentseconomic strategy.  Such increases would risk non-co-operation on wages by the trade unions, who would argue that their members could not be expected to exercise restraint in the face of substantial increases in the prices of essential services, and from private industry,who would not only be faced with increased costs but would alsomeasure the extent of their own restraint in increasing prices against that exercised by the nationalised industries.   Machinery should therefore be established, after examination by officials, to review theefforts made by nationalised industries to improve their efficiency and productivity a process for which there was large scope witha view to minimising future increases of prices.  It would, however,take some time to establish this machinery and meanwhile noincreases should be approved until Ministers had been satisfied by further evidence that increases in costs could not be absorbed by increased productivity. To allow time for the examination of further evidence, the financial targets of the industries concerned should beset aside to the extent necessary to accommodate a delay of up to threemonths in implementing the proposals for increases of prices. Futureproposals for increases put to the Prices and Incomes Committeeshould be accompanied by a draft of the public announcement whichit was intended to make, which should include a full statement ofwhat the industry concerned had done to reduce its costs.  Thefinancial return set as the target of the gas industry should be temporarily reduced to admit a correspondingly smaller increase in charges.  This was in any event desirable in view of the prospectof cheaper gas supplies in the 1970s.The Minister of Power said that the prices for gas and electricitywere inseparably connected. Against his own judgment, he hadwithin the last two months accepted the collective Ministerial viewthat there should be an increase of 10 per cent in electricity charges in order to reduce the extent to which the industry would need to borrow from the Government for its future investment. His present proposals for increases in gas prices were a direct result of theincreased electricity charges and were intended to equalise competition between the two industries. Nevertheless, if the Cabinet took theview, in the light of the consequences of the policy on prices and incomes, that the existing financial target for the gas industry shouldbe maintained, so giving an increase of 5\ per cent instead of 1\ percent in prices, this would be acceptable. But it would be unrealistic to look to dramatic improvements in productivity which would permitreductions in prices over the next few years. The gas industry had
8207bimproved its productivity by 5 per cent per annum over the last5 years and was fully alive to the need to continue its efforts toimprove its efficiency. Every Gas Board was already using theservices of management consultants.The Minister of Transport said that she recognised theconsequences for the policy on prices and incomes of the concentration over the next few months of substantial increases inthe prices of a number of basic services. However, following the cabinet&apos;s recent conclusions on public expenditure, she was under an obligation to make a contribution to its reduction by securing areduction in the railway deficit of  30 million by 1970-71. Anypostponement of the increases for which British Railways and theLondon Transport Board were now seeking authority would preventthe achievement of such a reduction in the railway deficit. TheLondon Transport Board would, in any event, require further financial assistance from the Government before the end of the year in addition to that already provided by the Transport Finances Act.As for the proposed investigation into efficiency, the Joint steering group report had provided an excellent and up-to-date efficiencyaudit on British Railways; and substantial manpower reductions were continuing. Yet further investigations into efficiency at present would yield no practical results. The issue was whether financial orthodoxyor the policy on prices and incomes should have priority at the presenttime.In discussion the following points were made:(a) If the nationalised industries were not required to obtain,wherever they could, a commercial return on their assets, the result would be a Government subsidy for the consumption of their products. This would inevitably lead to an artificial inflation of demand on the public sector and a consequent artificial inflation of investment in the nationalised industries. Moreover it was sociallyregressive to subsidise from taxation consumers with widely differinglevels of income. At the same time undue control of prices in those industries would tend to depress wages in the public sector, somaking more difficult the recruitment and retention of staff of the requisite quality, while the absence of a clear commercial target would seriously weaken the efficiency of management. Public ownershipshould not be equated with running industries at a loss. Nor were some at least of the proposals for deferment of increases, e.g., inrespect of the railways, compatible with the conclusions of theCabinet the previous week on public expenditure. Delays in respectof London Transport would cost  800,000 a month and jeopardisesavings by British Railways of  2 million to  3 million by the end of1967.(b) For industries in the public sector like the Post Office, whichwere able at least to cover their costs, the fundamental question was how much of their investment programme should be financed fromtheir own revenue and how much by borrowing. If, for example,the Post Office were able to borrow 65 per cent instead of 50 per
cent of their cash requirements for future capital investment theywould not need to increase their charges for the present. the nationalised industries were being expected to maintain or increase their financial targets, by increased prices, at a time when the profits of private industry were being substantially reduced: financial targets were being applied too inflexibly. On the other hand the international monetary Fund in a recent report on the United Kingdom economicsituation had commented that the nationalised industries were not as a whole generating a sufficiently large proportion of their cashrequirements for investment.(c) In the course of the Cabinefs discussion of public expenditure, the case for making charges for, for example, some ofthe welfare services had been balanced against the need for theincreased taxation which would otherwise be required. The samearguments were valid in weighing increases in prices by nationalised industries against financing more of their investment or of theirdeficits by the Government. It was suggested that, on the whole,the general public preferred increases in taxation to increases in theprices of basic services. On the other hand it was argued that no good case could be made for requiring rural taxpayers, for example,to subsidise the fares of urban commuters, or the rest of the UnitedKingdom to subsidise London public transport.(d) The future of the policy on prices and incomes as a whole would be seriously jeopardised if all the proposed increases weresanctioned now. If the policy on prices and incomes were to fall,the Governmenfs economic strategy, which was based on theassumption of its reasonable success, would have to be fundamentallyre-examined. It was necessary to consider therefore what cost mightbe justified to secure such a degree of success. It should moreoverbe borne in mind that rising prices would be accompanied in thecoming winter by rising unemployment and that the effects of theMiddle East crisis on the country&apos;s balance of payments had restrictedthe Governmenfs room for economic manoeuvre.(e) It was suggested that the rise which had previously beenagreed in electricity prices had been excessive and that this rise wasin consequence no argument for making the same mistake with gasprices. On the other hand it was urged that unless gas and electricityprices were kept in line a rational fuel policy was impossible.Moreover, the gas industry, which was now additionally affected bythe effects of the Middle East crisis, would be in deficit without animmediate increase in prices.In further discussion the view was widely expressed that while there were cogent arguments for agreeing to the increases in prices which were now in question, there had been inadequate time forthe Cabinet to reach a considered view on this balance of advantage and on all the consequences both for the nationalised industries andfor the policy on prices and incomes. There would be advantage ifthere could be further study by officials of all the aspects, in the lightof which Ministers could, on their return in September, takeconsidered decisions.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th July, 1967.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet took the view that decisions, both on the general approach to these problems and on the individual cases of proposed increases of price now before them, should be deferred in order togive time for fuller study. Officials should prepare, for a meetingof the Ministerial Steering Committee on Economic Policy (SEP)during September, to which the Ministers of Departments responsiblefor nationalised industries should be invited, a study dealing fully with (i) the general principles involved, including those governing the fixing of prices and of financial targets for the nationalised industries in relation to:the most efficient conduct and development of those industries;the implications for the Exchequer; andthe policy on prices and incomes;(ii) the application of these principles to the individual casesof increases of prices awaiting decision; and(iii) the best method of public presentation of such increases as might be sanctioned.The study should also examine the effects on the Exchequer ofdelaying any of the increases now under consideration as well as of changes temporary or permanent in the financial targets set forthe industries concerned. Finally, it should consider the desirabilityof establishing, and publicly announcing, machinery on the lines suggested by the First Secretary of State to promote increased efficiency and reductions in costs in nationalised industries.Meanwhile, there should be no increases of prices in the public sectorbefore the meeting of SEP.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers concerned, to arrange for the preparation by the beginningof September of a study on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister.
