ParliamentCC 45 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.MedicalTermination ofPregnancy Bill(previous reference:CC (67) 35thConclusions,Minute 4)secret the Lord President said that, despite the provision of additionaltime by the Government for the debate of Mr. Steel&apos;s MedicalTermination of Pregnancy Bill, the House of Commons had failedto reach a conclusion on it. It was for consideration whether further Parliamentary time should be provided by the Governmentto enable the House to reach a decision on the Bill before the summer Recess. It was clear from the amount of support whichthe Bill received that if it failed in this Session it would be revivedin subsequent Sessions until the House reached a decision and fromthe point of view of Parliamentary business there was therefore astrong argument in favour of allowing finality to be reached this time. Furthermore, it was arguable that, in the case of a Bill whichattracted this degree of support, time should as a matter of principlebe provided to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion. In thesecircumstances the balance of advantage appeared to lie in providingfurther limited time for debate on the Bill.In discussion it was urged that for the Government to allowyet further time for this Bill would be taken by the public as implying a degree of governmental support for it. The cabinet had not debated the Bill on merits and in view of its highly controversial nature it would be unfortunate if without such discussion the Government were publicly assumed to have taken adecision to support it. It was, however, the general view that thequestion of governmental support was neither at issue nor would beseen to be implied. The basic principle was that of enablingParliament to reach a conclusion on a measure which attracted sucha wide measure of support. The Governments neutrality on the merits of the Bill could be demonstrated, more particularly if in theevent some Ministers were to vote in favour of the Bill and someagainst it. In these circumstances, further Parliamentary time shouldbe allowed and it was indeed questionable whether it should not bemade clear, in order to forestall further filibustering, that theadditional time woukLnot be limited, but would be sufficient toenable Parliament to reach a decision one way or another. this could be achieved by making it clear that the debate could continueover the night of Thursday, 13th July and throughout the followingFriday (or indeed Saturday) if necessary. This course was, however,open to the objection that it would involve the sacrifice ofGovernment business on the Friday and though on this occasion the business in question was only of minor importance, its sacrificemight be taken as prejudicing the Governments neutrality on thesubstance of the Bill.In further discussion it was urged that consideration should begiven to the possibility of changes in Parliamentary procedure which would provide better opportunity for Parliament to reach
conclusions on Bills of this nature. This might involve theappointment of a Standing Committee for the preparation oflegislation. This and other suggestions could well be considered bythe Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that further Parliamentary time should be providedby the Government for the Termination of PregnancyBill, on the basis that this time was allowed solely inorder to enable Parliament to reach a conclusion on aBill which had attracted considerable Parliamentarysupport.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to consider in thelight of the discussion the extent to which the statementof the Governments intention to provide furtherParliamentary time for this purpose should indicate thatthe time would be limited.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange forthe Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary procedure to consider, in the light of their discussion, Parliamentaryarrangements for facilitating Private Members&apos; Bills.OverseaAffairsMiddle Eastand the UnitedNationsAssembly(previous reference:CC(67) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET.2. The Foreign Secretary said that the resolution on theMiddle East introduced in the Special Session of the United nations general Assembly by the non-aligned nations had achieved only abare majority of the total votes cast, substantially short of thetwo-thirds majority which was necessary to give it effect. Thealternative resolution sponsored by the Latin American nations,which was acceptable to us in its broad sense though not in all itsdetails, had just failed to achieve a two-thirds majority. The onlyresolutions which had been passed were one limited tohumanitarian considerations and one in respect of the status of jerusalem. Attempts were now being made to achieve a consensuson a resolution which would balance a recall for the withdrawal ofIsraeli forces on the one hand with the need on the other for agreement on conditions which would make possible the continuedsecurity of Israel and a peaceful settlement in the Middle East. Ifsuch a resolution could be achieved it would be worthwhile theSpecial Session of the General Assembly continuing, but if theseattempts failed in the course of the next two days or so, it might be preferable for the Special Session to come to an end and for theissue to be taken back to the Security Council. The UnitedKingdom vote had been cast in favour of the Latin Americanresolution, but a great effort had been made both in New Yorkand in all the capitals concerned to minimise the effect of that vote on Arab opinion and it appeared that these efforts had been largelysuccessful.The Permanent United Kingdom Representative at the united nations and Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Caradon)deserved great credit for his achievement in maintaining British
Approach toEuropeDraft OpeningStatement tothe ministerial council of theWesternEuropeanUnion(previous reference:CC (67) 44thConclusions)Congo(previous reference:CC(65)3rdConclusions,Minute 2)South Arabia(previous reference:CC (67) 41stConclusions,Minute 3)interests during the highly charged atmosphere of the recent debates in the General Assembly.In discussion the question was raised of the prospect of re-opening the Suez Canal, particularly in view of the effect of itscontinued closure on our own balance of payments. The cabinet were informed that at the present time it did not appear practicable for us to take any specific action to achieve the re-opening of the canal, but a relaxation of tension in the Middle East, to which our efforts were primarily directed, might then open the way for a specific approach on this issue.The Foreign Secretary said that his statement to the ministerial council of the Western European Union (WEU) at The Hague on tuesday, 4th July, about the United Kingdom&apos;s applications for membership of the European Communities had been very well received. Our friends on the Council had been agreeably surprisedby its European tone and had responded with firm declarations of support. The representative of France, M. Bettencourt, had spokenin friendly terms in stating his Governmenfs position, though in the session the following morning he had, perhaps after instructionsovernight from Paris, objected to the statement being regarded as having the status of an official document of the european communities. But copies of it had been asked for in their speechesresponding to the statement on Tuesday afternoon, 4th July, by herr Brandt, the Chairman of the Ministerial Council of theCommunity, and by M. Rey, the President of the unified Commission,who had made a particularly helpful speech, including a referenceto the usefulness of the statement in the Commission^ task ofgiving an opinion on the British application. In replying to the speeches made in response to his statement, he himself had saidthat he was formally conveying the text of his statement to theChairman of the Ministerial Council and the President of theCommission and had done so. M. Luns, the Chairman of the ministerial Council of the WEU, had ruled in,reply to the Frenchobjection in the session of Wednesday morning, 5th July, that the six were seized of the statement and that it was impossible to denythat it had become a document of the European Communities orto prevent any country from submitting documents to them, as indeed often happened.The Foreign Secretary said that renewed hostilities had brokenout in the Congo but the situation was highly confused: we were seeking to obtain clearer information. Meanwhile, it appeared thatfew if any of the foreign mercenaries involved were British, norwere British subjects otherwise specifically concerned.The Foreign Secretary said that British forces had planned andtimed their operation to regain control of the Crater area of thetown of Aden with great care and skill. They had re-occupied thearea without provoking mutiny or open opposition by the armedArab police, who were now co-operating with our forces in maintaining control.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 39thConclusions,Minute 2)&apos;Zambia(previous reference:CC (67) 43rdConclusions,Minute 2)The Commonwealth Secretary said that Shell/BP had givento Colonel Ojukwu, the military Governor of the Eastern region of Nigeria, which had recently declared its independence, a letterof intent, by which they undertook to make an advance paymentOf royalties in respect of oil shipments. This had provokedMajbr-General Gowon, the Head of the Federal Military Governmentof Nigeria, to institute a complete blockade of the Eastern region and no oil was now being shipped in consequence. We had advisedShell/BP not to make a payment, but it was understandable thatthey had felt constrained to do so, under protest, in view of thethreats to their installations and to the safety of their staff in nigeria. Major-General Gowon had requested the United StatesGovernment and ourselves to provide arms for the Federal forces.We had refused the request to ourselves, save that we were considering the possibility of providing anti-aircraft guns. TheMinister of State for Commonwealth Affairs was flying to Nigeriathat day and would make every effort to obtain agreement that oilshipments should be resumed.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had previously taken the view that Mr. Simbule, the Zambian HighCommissioner designate in the United Kingdom, should be askedto give a formal expression of regret in respect of his derogatorystatements about this country before he could be accepted as HighCommissioner. Mr. Simbule had subsequently expressed regret athis statement in terms which sufficiently met our requirements andhe would now be accepted as High Commissioner.The Cabinet (1) Took  noteby   the  Foreign  andof  the  statementsCommonwealth Secretaries.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to convey to the Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs (Lord Caradon) an expression of their appreciation of the work which he had carriedout during the current debates on the Middle East in theUnited Nations General Assembly.Defence(previous reference:CC (67) 34thConclusions)Draft WhitePaperSECRET*3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the defence secretary (C (67) 117) covering a draft White Paper on Defence,by the Lord President of the Council (C (67) 116) on defencewithdrawals and by the Commonwealth Secretary (C (67) 119) onconsultations with Allied Governments on Far East defence. they also had before them notes by the Secretary of the Cabinet coveringmemoranda on defence and the balance of payments (C (67) 121),aid and the balance of payments (C (67) 120) and the defence expenditure studies (C (67) 118).* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET
The Defence Secretary said that the background to thedecisions of policy to be announced in the White Paper before theCabinet was very different from that of the earlier Defence Review.Then it had been possible to find  300 million out of the saving of  400 million (at 1964 prices) in the defence expenditure for1969-70 involved by the plans of the previous Administrationmainly by obtaining better value for money, leaving somethingunder  100 million to be saved by changes in policy and commitments and in the size of the forces following the end of confrontation with Indonesia. There was now no further scope for savings without cutting the capability of the forces and theproposals before the Cabinet to reduce defence expenditure in1970-71 by a further  200 million, rising by 1975-76 to  300 million,would have to come entirely from reductions in our military capability, with consequent reductions in our commitments and changes in our oversea policy.Over the decade 1965-75 the uniformed strengths of the forces would on these proposals have declined by 110,000, consisting of80,000 in the strength of the British forces themselves and 30,000Gurkhas and local forces; and civilian backing for the forces wouldhave dropped by a total of 100,000, 45,000 of which was in UnitedKingdom manpower and 55,000 in locally engaged personnel. By1975-76 the Royal Navy would cease to have any aircraft carriersand there would have been a reduction of 20 per cent in its numberof ships, which would also, on average, be smaller. The army would have lost 25 per cent of its major units and there would havebeen a reduction of 35 per cent in the frontline strength of combat aircraft of the Royal Air Force. Overall, the volunteer regularstrength of the three Services would have dropped by 20 per cent and, after allowing for wastage, between 19,000 and 25,000 officersand men would be made redundant. It would be very apparentto the Services that they were making big sacrifices. Civilianemployment as well as uniformed manpower and equipment was affected.About two-thirds of the reduction in expenditure now beingproposed would flow directly from a decision to withdraw from singapore and Malaysia; by 1975 we were planning also to have withdrawn from the Persian Gulf, and apart from Hong Kong,which was being considered separately, and certain staging posts,we should then have no forces permanently stationed abroadoutside Europe; we should however retain the ability to dischargeour responsibilities for the defence of our remaining dependent territories, to British communities abroad and to make a contributionto peace-keeping. We should not decide now whether the naval andamphibious element of the military capability that it was proposed should be available for use in the Far East after we had withdrawnfrom Singapore/Malaysia should be based on locally providedfacilities in Australia, or possibly Singapore, or on this country;but, in any event, these forces would be part of those earmarked for assignment to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)
and not additional to them. If we were to be able to justify these reductions in the size of our forces and changes in their deployment,it was essential that the tasks of the forces should be reduced instep with them; in particular it would be necessary to scale downprogressively our force declarations under the South-East AsiaTreaty Organisation (SEATO) and to change drastically the scale and timing of the military assistance that we would provide toMalaysia and Singapore.Defence expenditure would fall from 7 per cent of the gross national Product (GNP) under the previous Administration to5 per cent and, by 1975, it was estimated that the level would beabout  800 million less than under the plans of the previous administration; between 1964-65 and 1970-71 we should have cutdefence expenditure by 5 per cent while, even with the reductionsproposed to the Cabinet by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, civil expenditure would have risen by 25 per cent. Although theproposed saving of  200 million in defence expenditure was lower than had been hoped for when the defence expenditure studieswere initiated, it was still the higher figure of the range of savingwhich the Cabinet had envisaged when they last considered thematter. This had been achieved despite the fact that there wouldbe a peak in expenditure on equipment about the end of thisdecade; allowance was also included for  40 million on the.Harrier (P-1127) aircraft which had been included in the programme for non-military reasons,  13 million of expenditure hithertofinanced outside the defence budget for service housing and 2 million on account of the decision taken on political grounds to delay our rundown in Malta. If allowance was made for these items the saving in the defence programme in 1970-71 was about 255 million and if it were decided not to replace the Anglo-Frenchvariable geometry aircraft project with another involving expenditureon research and development in that year a further  17 million couldbe saved. The gross stationing costs of our forces overseas would fall from  252 million currently, to  191 million in 1970-71 and 130 million in 1975-76. This made&apos; no allowance for variousforeign exchange receipts that could be set against the gross figures and, although the detailed calculations were to be discussed furtherby the Ministers concerned, it could be claimed that by 1975-76the oversea costs in the defence budget would not be significant forour balance of payments. This in no way suggested however thatthe savings were not important or that it was not right on other grounds to plan for the force withdrawals that were proposed.The Lord President said that, although he recognised that the policies that had emerged from the defence expenditure studies were less inadequate than those which had resulted from the earlierDefence Review, the new proposals would not stand the test of time.It had been his understanding that it would be open to the Cabineton this occasion to adopt more radical proposals than those beforethem, but it appeared to be claimed that in consulting our Allies wehad already committed ourselves too far to allow of this.Nevertheless it would not be credible either in this country or
abroad to announce a plan to withdraw slowly from the middle and Far East over a period of eight to ten years, during which time our military strength would steadily and obviously diminish.Events would overtake us and we should be forced to withdrawmore quickly; it would therefore be better to decide now on a plan for as rapid a withdrawal as possible. Recent events in theMiddle East had shown that our military presence there was an embarrassment to our friends in the area and harmful to our political and oil interests; we should withdraw from the areaquickly and from Cyprus also as soon as we could. As regardsthe Far East, there were special considerations affecting HongKong and strong social and political arguments for a withdrawal from Singapore carefully calculated to maintain political stabilitythere. We should, not commit ourselves to maintain large and expensive amphibious and air forces in the Far East after 1970;it would be wrong, particularly in view of recent events in the middle east, for us to have as part of our role the provision ofsophisticated forces which the local Governments could not afford.There should be a study of a revised timetable envisaging completeevacuation of the mainland within five years. Our attitude to aid for Singapore and Malaysia should not be that we had a responsibility for making good the damage to the economies of thesetwo countries which the withdrawal of our forces would cause,since this would involve us in heavy and increasing expenditureon aid; instead we should adopt the principle that we wereprepared to pay somewhat higher amounts of aid if the Governmentsconcerned co-operated with us in a rapid withdrawal of our forces and that these would be reduced if the rundown went more slowly.In discussion there was some support for the view that weshould plan to withdraw more rapidly from the Middle and Far Eastthan was envisaged in the proposals before the Cabinet and makethe additional saving of some  100 million in defence expenditure by 1970-71 that it was estimated would result from this. It was argued that, since;we had declared our intention to withdraw, weshould effectively have destroyed any influence based on military strength in the areas concerned. The general view was howeverin favour of the proposals outlined by the Defence Secretary:to plan on the basis of a faster withdrawal would not be realistic.There was general acceptance that if, as might happen, eventsmade it possible for us to withdraw more rapidly we should welcome it; but the Cabinet had agreed that consultations with our allies should take place on the basis of obtaining theiracquiescence in plans to reduce our force levels in Singapore byabout half by 1970-71 and to withdraw from Singapore and malaysia by 1975-76. Our Allies had accepted the plan for 1970-71but were much concerned at our proposal for final withdrawal andin particular unanimously opposed to any announcement of a date for that withdrawal. On this ground alone, we could not nowcontemplate going back to our Allies with proposals for an earlierfinal withdrawal.   In any event, on practical grounds also we
could not usefully plan for an earlier withdrawal, particularly from Singapore where employment was very heavily dependenton the presence of British forces; if in present circumstances we were to withdraw substantially more rapidly than was proposed the decline in confidence and the extent of local unemployment which would inevitably be involved would result in economic and social chaos. We would be faced with the collapse of the present government in Singapore, on whom we were relying to enable us to&apos;.make an orderly withdrawal, the lives of British civilians mightwell be heavily at risk and we should probably lose some 700 million of British assets in the Far East.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the advantages and disadvantages of including in the Defence White Paperspecific dates for our withdrawal from the Middle and Far East.As regards the Middle East there was general agreement that nodate should be given. Withdrawal from this area did not involve serious logistic problems for the forces, nor lengthy planning and preperation such as were involved in the Far East. There wastherefore no requirement to take a decision on withdrawal untilevents made it in accord with our interests to do so; and sucha decision could be supplemented quickly. As regards the far east it was argued that in view both of the strongly expressedviews of our Allies and of the desirability of leaving ourselvesroom for manoeuvre it would be better not to publish any date for withdrawal. On the other hand it was strongly urged that unless a date was indicated our position would be open to damagingmisconstruction, the basis of our planning and consequently the achievement in practice of these savings would progressively beeroded, nor could we publish the financial and manpower savingsthat were to be made by 1975. On balance there was agreement that we should announce in the forthcoming Defence White paper that we were planning to withdraw from Singapore and Malaysiain the middle 1970s.The Cabinet then turned to discussion of the text of the draft white Paper.A number of amendments were agreed and the following main points were made.Paragraph 2The final sentence should be re-ordered to deal first with thepolitical aspect.Paragraph 4The final sentence should be amended to avoid any implication that new defence arrangements in Europe were involved if weshould enter the European Economic Community.,Paragraph 8Further consideration should be given by the Foreign Secretary,the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Defence Secretary to theterms of the reference to the offset costs of our forces in Germany.
Paragraph 10The Defence Secretary should consider, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, whether the final sentence might be redrafted to lay greater emphasis on the extent to which our influence in the world would depend on our economic strength.Paragraph 11The middle section should be revised to remove any implication that it committed us to maintain a continuing presence in the far east, as distinct from a military capability for use there.Paragraph 13The Cabinet were informed that, although the King of Libyahad requested us to leave our bases there, it appeared that thiswas mainly a gesture of Arab solidarity; and we were not at present being pressed to withdraw. It would not necessarily accord withour interests to do so.Paragraph 15Further consideration would be given by the Defence Secretaryto the reference to the Commonwealth Brigade, in consultation withthe Commonwealth Secretary.Paragraph 24The Defence Secretary said that he was considering the additionof an annex to the White Paper listing the infantry battalions thatwould be disbanded as a result of the proposed cut in the strengthof the Army.Paragraphs 25 and 26The Defence Secretary said that the types of aircraft requiredby the Royal Air Force between now and 1975 were not dependenton the point between 1970 and 1975 at which we withdrew fromtha Far East, nor had the defence expenditure studies altered theroles of the RAF as distinct from the types and numbers of aircraftrequired to carry these out. The case for proceeding with thedevelopment of an aircraft similar to the Anglo-French variablegeometry aircraft had however been much weakened by the reductionin our role East of Suez. He would redraft paragraph 26 of theWhite Paper on the lines of the statement that he had made inParliament on the previous day.Paragraph 28The Cabinet were informed that a reduction world wide of25 per cent in the supporting services of the forces was planned; itwould probably be necessary to close one dockyard in this country.Paragraph 37The presentation of the figures of costs and savings would be revised in consultation between the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the Defence Secretary.
Paragraph 40The reference to our role in the maintenance of peace shouldbe revised, or suitably transposed to paragraph 41, after consultation between the Foreign, Commonwealth and Defence Secretaries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft Defence White Paper, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion, to further consultation by theDefence Secretary with the Ministers concerned in respect ofparticular passages which it had been agreed to amend and to such further changes of a purely drafting nature as the Defence secretary might subsequently wish to make. The defence expenditure studieshad involved an immense amount of work, on the outcome of whichthe Defence Secretary was to be congratulated.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Defence Secretary to amend the draft of theWhite Paper on the lines agreed in discussion, inconsultation as necessary with the Ministers concerned.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved the draft of the defence white Paper attached to C (67) 117.(3) Invited the Defence Secretary, in consultation with theForeign and Commonwealth Secretaries, the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Lord President of the Council,to arrange for its publication.secret. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the public expenditure programme to 1970-71. They had before them thefollowing memoranda by the Chancellor of the Exchequer:C (67) 97 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Health andWelfareC (67) 98 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Social SecurityC (67) 99 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: HousingC (67) 100 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Education andScienceC (67) 101 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: RoadsC (67) 102 Public Expenditure: Areas of ChoiceC (67)  103 Public Expenditure:   Continuation of ExistingPoliciesC (67) 104-Public ExpenditureC (67) 105 The Economic Implications of Public Expenditure(covering a note by officials)C (67) 109 The Economic Implications of Public expenditure and a Memorandum by the First Secretary of State (C (67) 108) onthe Economic Outlook to 1972.In discussion support was expressed for the argument advanced in the Cabinefs previous discussion that the reduction to be sought in the total progi-amme of public expenditure for 1970-71 should bePublicExpenditureEconomicOutlook to1972 and civil Reviews(previous reference:CC (67) 42ndConclusions)
in the region of  300- 350 million rather than the  500 million which had been proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.  Itwas argued that the Governmenfs basic policy involved a transferof resources from private consumption to the public sector; yet someof the main social programmes such as those for education and health were expanding more slowly than had been envisaged in theNational Plan and any further slowing down of these programmes would be unacceptable.   A reduction of  300- 350 million would imply over the period to 1970-71 an average annual increase in personal consumption per head of 2 per cent as compared with anaverage increase of 2-2 per cent which would be possible if areduction of  500 million were secured; the lower reduction wouldalso imply an increase in taxation.  But these consequences wouldbe more acceptable to the public and to the governments supporters than damaging reductions in provision for the social services, which would have a direct impact on the ordinary citizenand would in many fields bear heavily on people of modest means.The yield of existing rates of taxation would rise automatically asthe national income rose, particularly if tax allowances were heldat their present levels; but in any case some increase in rates oftaxation would be tolerable, bearing in mind that the country was by no means over-taxed compared with other comparable countries.A major difficulty confronting the Government arose from the exceptionally steep increase in public expenditure which was expected in 1968-69, although to the extent that some slack in the economy persisted during that year a substantial rise in public expenditure would have beneficial effects.  But it would be wrong to impose reductions in expenditure affecting the whole period to1970-71 on a scale which was related primarily to the special difficulties in 1968-69. With many categories of capital expenditurein the public sector, once reductions were imposed it would not be practicable, because of the inflexible nature of the programmesconcerned, to restore them before 1970-71, if the general economicsituation should warrant this: any subsequent upward revision ofpublic expenditure could only be effected by increasing other kinds of programme which could be quickly adjusted, such as the provisionof cash benefits, and this would itself involve a switch of expenditure from investment to consumption which had not been planned andmight not be desirable.On the other hand, it was argued that it would be unwise to seek a reduction in the programme for 1970-71 of less than 500 million. The Government had already made dramaticprogress in expanding the social services, as could be demonstratedby comparing the record during their first three years of office withthe record during the three preceding years. But the point had now been reached where some action was needed to maintain areasonable balance between further expansion of these services,involving higher taxes, and the growth of personal consumption.The proposal for a reduction of  500 million was in no way aproposal for a standstill in the growth of public expenditure and
public services. Even with such a reduction, the burden of taxes and other public levies would still increase substantially: householdrates were expected to increase by an average of 5 per cent perannum up to 197Q; besides the increase in national insurance contributions in October 1967 there would have to be a further increase before 1970: there were also bound to be increases duringthis period in the prices charged by the nationalised industries,including fares and fuel costs. There was growing resistance, notonly among the higher income groups but also among people ofmodest means, to making further inroads on disposable incomes,and there was evidence of a considerable shift of opinion among the government&apos;s supporters in.favour of a more moderate increase inthe social services coupled with some relief from taxation. Areduction in the programme of only  300- 350 million would leaveinsufficient margin against unforeseen contingencies and would entailincreases in rates of taxation, certainly in 1969-70 and possibly in1968-69, on a scale which would alienate wide sections of the public.The right course therefore was to plan for a reduction of 500 million and if our economic progress warranted it subsequently to expand spending programmes, rather than to risk incurring theconsequences of a rate of spending that was currently excessive andto hope to be able to reduce spending when those consequencesmaterialised. It was true that any subsequent easement wouldhave to be concentrated on those programmes which could be adjusted quickly, but increases in social security benefits, whichwere the main item in this category, would themselves involve some increase in personal consumption and thus help to redress thebalance with the demands of the public sector.In further discussion it was suggested that, in determining the size of reduction in the programme of public expenditure whichshould be sought, account should be taken of the investment programmes of the nationalised industries. While these programmes were to a large extent directly relevant to increasing the productive potential of the economy, this could be argued equally in relationto some elements of public expenditure&apos;as conventionally defined.The Cabinet were informed, however, that a searching scrutiny ofthe nationalised industries&apos; programmes was now proceeding, thatit was clear that a reduction in these programmes of the order of 100 million could probably be secured by 1970-71 and that this had been taken into account in the considerations which had ledup to the proposal for a reduction in the programme of public expenditure (excluding expenditure by the nationalised industries) of 500 million. It was also suggested that the discussion had made clear that a decision on the total reduction to be made in public expenditure as between a cut of some  500 million and one of some 300- 350 million could not be made without consideration ofthe constituent elements of the reductions, since in many cases therelative weight to be attached to the political, economic and socialfactors involved needed to be assessed for each item separately.It was not possible to make any decisive overall assessment of priorities.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that afterthe Cabinefs general discussion of the considerations affecting theorder of magnitude of the reduction in the programme of public expenditure at which we should aim, there was general agreement that it was necessary to have a clearer idea of the reductions which might be secured in particular fields before a decision couldbe taken on the size of the reduction in total. The ministerial steering Committee on Economic Policy had been consideringpossible reductions in particular fields, but this would in no wayprejudice the Cabinefs final decision. The Chancellor of theExchequer should now circulate a memorandum to the Cabinetmaking proposals for specific adjustments in the programme up to1970-71, on the basis of which it should be possible for the Cabinetto take their decisions during the next two weeks.
