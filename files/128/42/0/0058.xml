to Europe(previous reference:CC(67) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)secret oversea Affairs 2. The Foreign Secretary said that consideration by theThe Approach European Economic Community (e.c.) of our application for membership was now moving to a further, and perhaps critical, stage;and it would be right to give some consideration to what our tacticsshould be. The Ministerial Council of the e.c. had now received theOpinion on our application which they had requested the Commissionto provide. Their discussion of it at the Ministerial Council on 2nd/3rd October had been purely formal; but they would be givingsubstantive consideration to it at the next meeting on 24th/25thOctober. The Commission^ Opinion, which was an unanimous one,was for the most part helpful to us and recommended that there shouldbe early negotiations on our application. It contained, however, acritical section, which had been much publicised, on the economicand financial position of the United Kingdom, which reflected manyof the points which the French President had taken in resisting ourclaims for membership. This section of the Commission^ report,however, whilst raising serious problems as to the compatibility ofour present economic and financial position with membership ofthe Community, did not go so far as to say that these problems mademembership impossible; and the general recommendation in favourof early negotiations was, like the economic and financial section,agreed to unanimously by all the Commissioners.A further factor to be taken into account was that the french president had taken an unusual initiative in sending for HMAmbassador in Paris for an interview on Thursday, 5th October, andin bringing forward the time of the interview from the evening to the morning. This was the more interesting in that the President was no8465a 2CONFIDENTIALLord Attlee 1.   The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish at their first meeting since the death of Lord Attlee on 8th October to record their sense of the outstanding services which he had rendered to thecountry and to the Labour Movement, and their sympathy with themembers of his family in their loss. He proposed that he should sendan appropriate message to the late Lord Attlee&apos;s family on behalf ofthe Cabinet and arrange for flowers to be sent to the funeral in the government&apos;s name.The funeral, later that day, would be private; but members ofthe Cabinet would have an opportunity to pay their own tribute toLord Attlee on the occasion of the Memorial Service and theinterment of his ashes in Westminster Abbey on 7th November.The Cabinet (1) Concurred in the Prime Ministers reference to the late LordAttlee&apos;s services.(2) Endorsed the proposal that a message of sympathy should besent to the late Lord Attlee&apos;s family, and that flowersshould be sent in the Governmenfs name to his funeral.
doubt aware of the debate on European policy which was takingplace at that time at the Annual Conference of the Labour Party atScarborough. It was difficult, however, to see what his objective hadbeen in seeking this interview, since, whilst disclaiming any hostility to the United Kingdom, he had said nothing that was new, andnothing that was helpful, and certainly nothing to indicate that he intended to exercise an early veto on our application.The next occasion which it was possible to use to further our application was the meeting of Western European Union (WEU) inLondon on 12th/13th October. For reasons unconnected with our application, however, all the Foreign Ministers of the WEU Powers,except Dr. Luns of the Netherlands and M. Gregoire of Luxembourg,would be unable to attend the meeting by reason of absence abroad.In view of the clear risk that this situation might be publiclymisrepresented as a rebuff to the United Kingdom, he had advisedDr. Luns that in all the circumstances it might be wiser to arrange forthe meeting to be held at a rather lower level. There were in any event other considerations which suggested that it would not havebeen right to make the WEU meeting a major occasion for pressingour claim for membership and early negotiations to that end.The next two occasions which might be used for this purpose would come together, namely the visit of the Federal german chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, to London on 23rd/25th October, and themeeting of the Ministerial Council of the e.c. on 24th/25th October,at which the Federal German Republic would be represented by theForeign Minister, Herr Brandt, with the German Economic Minister,Dr. Schiller, in the chair. The Federal German Chancellor, whose attitude would be a key factor in this situation, would arrive inLondon just before the Ministerial meeting and it was of greatimportance to make the most of this opportunity, Much would depend on the outcome of the Ministerial Council; and he had arranged for appropriate contingency planning to take place to covervarious possible eventualities (including the exercise of a French vetoat that meeting, although this was perhaps unlikely), with the generalobjective that we should be able to maintain initiative and momentumin pursuit of our application.In discussion the question was raised whether it was wise to takethe line in public statements that we should continue to pursue our application for membership, however long resistance to it might bemaintained; or, in rebutting French propaganda about the &quot; Anglo-Saxons &quot;, to write down our relationship with the United States ofAmerica, an attitude which might be open to interpretation as beingpositively anti-American. On the other hand the statements whichhad been made recently on both these questions were not different in substance from statements made by members of the Government onearlier occasions. Thus, the statement that &quot; we would not take&apos; No &apos; for an answer &quot; to our application for membership of the EEChad been used repeatedly and was a correct description of our attitudeover the past year or more: it was important, so far as possible, tomaintain this attitude in relation to the French Government. Asregards our relationship with the United States, recent statements,
although over-emphasised by certain sections of the Press, wereconsistent with the position which we had always maintained on thissubject. The United States Administration were in no doubt aboutthe relationship between the two countries and would not be moved by tendentious Press treatment of it. It would be advantageous, as acorrective to such Press treatment, for the text of the statement inquestion to be circulated for the information of the Cabinet.It was also urged that it was important, especially in the context of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO), to avoid givingthe impression that we were unduly responsive to French pressure to change our position, in the hope of easing our entry into theCommunity. On the other hand it was pointed out that the membersof the Community were also members of NATO and that france was the only one whose adherence to it was less than wholehearted.The French President had been warned that his pursuit of an anti-American line might, in the circumstances just described, produce the opposite result to that which he intended; but it was clear that whilst he recognised the importance which his colleagues placed ontheir North Atlantic relationships, he did not allow himself to be inany way deflected by this.In further discussion it was suggested that it was disquieting thatthe critical section of the Commission^ Opinion on our applicationfor membership, concerning the alleged disequilibrium in the British economy, was unanimously approved; still more so the suggestioncontained in it that we should concert with the Community, as partof any negotiations with them, the measures that should be taken to remedy that disequilibrium. It would be important to know more of what might underlie this suggestion, especially as it appeared tohave some effect on opinion in the United Kingdom. There were two ways of looking at the problem of sterling and of the stability of theBritish economy, namely what measures we should take to restorestability if we were on our own and what measures we should take as members or potential members of the e.c.. If our economic andfinancial position was to be a central feature of the negotiations, itwould be important to know in advance to what position we should fall back if, as the Commission^ report suggested, we came underpressure to withdraw from our present line. It was pointed out,however, that this particular section of the Commission^ opinion was very probably of French origin; and, whilst it had beenunanimously approved by the other Commissioners, this could wellbe the price paid for securing unanimous agreement to the crucialrecommendation that there should be early negotiations. Whilst we ourselves had not, of course, referred to these problems in thestatement supporting our application, we had recognised that theywould inevitably be brought into the negotiations and had expressedwillingness to consider any questions which the Six wished to raisewith us. The Commission^ Opinion was not that organisation^last word, nor had it been accepted by the other members of theCommunity; and it was clear that the other major problems to whichwe. had referred in the statement made in July at WEU on our
application would have to be the subject of negotiations, whereas itwas possible that from their nature, the questions raised in theeconomic and financial section of the Commission^ report might have at least in part to be dealt with separately. It would not in any event be in our interest to highlight still further, or to manifest concern about, the prominence given to our economic and financial position inthe Commission^ Opinion or to draw attention to the part the french were thought to have played on this. Indeed, it was of greatimportance to avoid anything which might magnify or give credenceto sensational reports appearing in the Press about our economic position and what we might do to strengthen it.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the statement by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the circulation to the Cabinet of the text of the recentstatement considered in their discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that the Security Council of theUnited Nations might meet within the next few days to discuss theMiddle East situation. There was a growing hope that the moderateArab States would accept a balanced resolution providing not only for Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territory but also for recognition by the Arab States of israels right to exist. But theattitude of Israel was still uncertain.In discussion attention was drawn to the importance of using allpossible means to bring home to Israel that the Middle East crisis,and particularly the closure of the Suez Canal, was costing our balanceof payments about  20 million a month, and that this was bound to affect our policy in the Middle East. India too was sufferingseverely. If Israel appeared to be responsible for prolonging the crisis, she would risk being isolated. It should be emphasised thather own best interests lay in bringing the crisis to an end.The Prime Minister said that there had recently been speculationin the Press that the Commonwealth Secretary was about to beginfurther negotiations with the illegal regime in Rhodesia. Thisspeculation had come at a time when the Commonwealth secretary was considering details of his forthcoming tour of Africa and wasunder pressure from the Governor to visit Rhodesia. The fact wasthat there had been no sign in recent weeks of any movement towards a settlement on the part of the illegal regime. On the contrary, therewere indications that the illegal regime were calling in question theGovernments six principles. The Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee would shortly be considering the position.The Commonwealth Secretary said that we had withdrawn our representatives from Enugu, the capital of the Eastern Region, whichwas now effectively in the hands of Federal Government forces. only about 100 United Kingdom nationals out of 3,500 now remained inthe Eastern Region, and these had been strongly advised to go to the neighbouring State of Cameroun. Meanwhile, we were doing everything possible to persuade the Federal Government, on the basis
secret parliament 3.  The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord President ofTheQueerfs    the Council (C (67) 155) to which was annexed the draft of the speech on the   Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation of Parliament.Prorogation ofParliament In discussion a number of amendments were agreed and thefollowing points were made (a) The proposed reference to Hong Kong suggested that theGovernment^ attitude was purely passive. The passage should indicate that the Government &quot; supported &quot; the people of HongKong.(b) There should be a reference in the paragraph on Rhodesia tothe multiracial principles approved by Parliament.The Cabinet Subject to the textual amendments agreed in discussion,approved the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech appended toC(67) 155.parliament the Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliamentSECRET4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C (67) 156) to which was annexed the draft of the queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament.In discussion a number of amendments were agreed and thefollowing points were made (a) The reference to Rhodesia should be in the same terms asthat in The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Prorogation.(b) It was proposed to include in the legislative programme forthe coming Session a Bill enabling the Government to take actionagainst dumping, in accordance with the code agreed in the kennedy round of trade negotiations. This would replace a Bill on employment agencies, which the Minister of Labour did not now wish to be included. A reference to legislation on dumping should therefore be included in the Speech.(c) It was desirable to separate the proposed legislation onmisleading trade descriptions, which was already in draft and couldbe introduced quickly in the House of Lords, from that on retail trade agreements with which it had no real connection. Since, however,the legislative programme was already over-full, a separate Retailof their victories, to negotiate from strength and in the hope of avoiding massacres. We had had a favourable response from theFederal Government, but there had so far been no response from theauthorities of the Eastern Region.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary, thePrime Minister and the Commonwealth Secretary.
Trade Agreement Bill should be relegated to the Reserve List and considered in relation to other Bills already in that list. TheGovernment should not, therefore, be committed to legislate onrestrictive trade agreements by a reference in the Speech.(d) The proposals for legislation on the social work services inScotland had not been approved in principle, but were expected to beconsidered by the appropriate Ministerial Committee before the text of the Speech was submitted to The Queen.(e) Since it was now proposed that provisions on appeals againstimmigration control should not be included in the Race relations bill but introduced separately, an Immigration Appeals Bill shouldbe added to the Reserve List, but should not be mentioned in the speech.(/) The draft now contained no explicit reference to the aircraft industry or the financing of the Concord project, since the necessary powers would be taken in the Industrial Expansion Bill. the government&apos;s intentions in this regard could be made clear in thecourse of the Debate on the Address.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Governmenfs intention to introduce legislation authorising measures against dumping shouldbe mentioned in the Opening Speech.(2) Subject to the amendments agreed in discussion, approved the draft Speech annexed to C (67) 156.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th October, 1967.
