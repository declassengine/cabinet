approach to EuropeFactualQuestionsby Ministers(previous reference:CC(67) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the approach to europe. They had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 65) covering answers prepared by officials to factualquestions which had been raised by Ministers.The Prime Minister said that the purpose of the first part ofthis meeting of the Cabinet, at which exceptionally someDepartmental officials were present, was to enable any furtherfactual information which Ministers wished to obtain to be provided,either by the other Ministers concerned or by their officials. Thequestions might either seek amplification of the answers provided in the paper before them, or relate to other issues of fact relatingto the approach to Europe.(i) Effect on retail prices of individual foodstuffsThe request was made for a full list of the actual rises in retail prices of individual foodstuffs in the United Kingdom likely tofollow on adoption of the common agricultural policy (c.a.p.).In answer it was stated that it was not possible to give preciseestimates of changes in the levels of retail prices for variousfoodstuffs here if the United Kingdom were to accept the c.a.p. asit stood. There were no common retail prices in the european economic Community (e.c.), allowance had to be made for asubstantial range in processors&apos;, distributors&apos; and retailers&apos; mark-up and the price levels quoted in the e.c. countries related to standards and qualities of products which were not necessarily the same asthose generally marketed in this country. Estimates had however been made of ranges of possible retail price levels for the mostimportant food items broadly comparable to the range of price increases for food generally of 10 to 14 per cent. These, with current retail prices in the United Kingdom for purposes of comparison, were detailed in C (67) 65.In discussion the question was raised of the position of value-added tax (TVA) in the Community as it affected foodstuffs.It was stated that the farming community in the e.c. were liableto TVA on their production and that in general at the retail stageTVA was levied at the rate of 5 per cent on foodstuffs. TheNetherlands however was an exception in that TVA was not leviedon food in that country. She had not been granted a specificexemption since it was open to any member of the Community to exempt food from TVA. The information about retail food pricesprovided for the Cabinet took no account of the effect of TVA.(ii) Value-added taxIn further discussion about the TVA, the Cabinet were reminded that Community policy was directed towards the removalof fiscal differences and by implication the taxation carried byfinished commodities would have to be uniform as between membersof the e.c..  At the present time there was no uniformity of rates;
and although the Six had agreed on the system to be introduced by member countries by 1st January, 1970, they had not yet agreedwhether, or when, the rates of taxation should be harmonised andat what level, nor on the question of coverage. There was little difference between the economic effects of purchase tax and TVAalthough the latter had one advantage in that it could be spreadover a wide range of goods and hence offered a wider base oftaxation. TVA was however considerably more expensive to administer than was purchase tax. The whole question of TVA wascurrently being considered by a Working Party under thechairmanship of the Chief Secretary, Treasury.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that a TVA would be likely to produce more revenue thandid purchase tax, and hence afford the opportunity for tax reliefelsewhere or for higher governmental expenditure on social benefits.If the United Kingdom were to enter the Community, we shouldhave a voice in the settlement of the question of TVA. In viewof its importance for the United Kingdom it would be desirable for the Cabinet to be supplied with further information on thesubject.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for anote on value-added tax in the e.c. to be circulated fordiscussion at their meeting on the following day.(iii) Effects of entry on the exchequer could any assessment be made of the net effect on theExchequer of joining the e.c., e.g., taking account of such items astariff revenue, Community taxation measures and all other relevant factors?The answer was that it was impossible to give any overallestimate. There would be savings in respect of agricultural supportbut there would probably be a net loss of tariff revenue overall andthere would be expenditure, some of it additional, on subscriptionsto Community institutions and funds. But a major factor in thetotal revenue would be the effects of our discontinuing purchase tax and adopting the e.c. system of TVA. This represented an area of the greatest uncertainty. It was impossible to quantifythe various elements of cost to the Exchequer or to assess the yield of TVA without knowing the rates and the coverage. All that could be done to answer the question was to identify the variouselements within the total Exchequer picture and these were set outin C (67) 65.In discussion the question was asked to what extent any netExchequer surplus resulting from a reduction of Exchequer support for agriculture would be available for other purposes relatedparticularly to mitigating the effect of higher food prices. The reply was that since it was the aim of the Community to introduceuniform food prices as an element in their policy of securingequality   in   the   terms   of  industrial   competition,  the  direct
subsidisation of food prices would clearly not be permissible. Onthe other hand, there was complete freedom within the Six regardingsocial security policy and the general current level of social security benefits was higher in the e.c. than in the United Kingdom. Wewould be free to provide assistance by such means as family endowment, increased retirement pensions and housing subsidies.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it would be our objective, if we were to seek entry to the eec, to secure a reduction in our liability for agricultural leviesunder the present financial regulations of the c.a.p. which, it shouldbe remembered, were due for renegotiation before the beginningof 1970.(iv) Statistical workWhat progress had been made with statistical work (includingdetails and methods) undertaken by Departments on e.c. problems ?The answer given was that, in relation to the effect of entry into Europe on our balance of payments, particulars were given inthe report on balance of payments which had been circulated tothe Cabinet under cover of C (67) 61. Statistical material on someother aspects of entry into the e.c. was contained in answers toother factual questions put by Ministers. In general, the central statistical Office had maintained regular contact with Commissionstatisticians on publicly available statistics and statistical techniques,but had not been asked to undertake any work specifically inconnection with possible United Kingdom entry into the e.c..(v) Effects on Commonwealth immigrantsWould accession to the Community involve any alterations inthe present position by which Commonwealth immigrants could,after five years&apos; residence in the United Kingdom, apply as of right for United Kingdom citizenship by registration?The answer given was that, under the basic e.c. regulations as they stood at present, accession would not require any alteration in our policy in this respect, though it was impossible to say whetherthe e.c. would wish to call our present arrangements into questionif we joined.In discussion the following points were made (a) As noted in earlier Cabinet discussions, the main problem for our immigration policies presented by e.c. membership wouldbe that we should be required to treat immigrant workers fromEEC countries more favourably than immigrants from the rest ofthe Commonwealth under our present policy. In practice thiswould affect New Commonwealth countries more than the old commonwealth but we should not on this account need to reducethe present quota of Commonwealth immigrants.(b) As indicated in paragraph 27 of C (67) 58, it was not clearhow far the nationals of the oversea dependencies of e.c. member countries had any right of free movement within the e.c.; this
might eventually have to be determined by the Commission or bythe European Court of Justice. It appeared, for example, thatAlgerians who had settled in France did not have a right to free movement, at least unless they had obtained full French nationality.It was confirmed that a country did not obtain any privilege inrespect of free movement by virtue of association with theCommunity, since this status gave privileges in respect of trade;thus, for example, Nigerian citizens had no advantage over other non-e.c. nationals in respect of freedom of movement. It was true that many nationals of associated States such as Greece and turkey had entered the e.c. as immigrant workers; but this wasnot under the provisions of the e.c. for free movement of labour.(c) It was not known how many Commonwealth immigrantsof five years&apos; standing had taken advantage of their right to obtainUnited Kingdom citizenship, but it was thought that most of the immigrants of the past 15 years had not done so, since UnitedKingdom citizenship had up to the present conferred no practicaladvantage. The existence of this large number of potential UnitedKingdom citizens could, however, be a bargaining counter in negotiations with the e.c. countries, even taking into account thecountervailing possibility that Algerian immigrants possessing fullFrench nationality might have a corresponding right to enter thiscountry for employment. Moreover, the children born in thiscountry of Commonwealth immigrants possessed United Kingdomcitizenship by birth; thus, from the early 1970s there would be an increasing number of United Kingdom citizens of new commonwealth origin with full rights of free movement within the eec if we joined.(vi) Total of balance of payments costWhat was the extreme range of total United Kingdom balanceof payments costs consequent upon entry into the e.c. and was it,even at the lowest estimate, consistent in the short term with the recovery and strengthening of the economy?In answer it was stated that C (67) 61, which the Cabinet wereto consider as the next item of their agenda, set out the considerations involved. The following supplementary points were made (d) The economic case for our entry into the e.c. rested onthe increase in the productivity of British industry which it was said would result. But the supporting arguments, which appearedto be primarily the increase in productive investment which might follow from the general attitude of British industrialists, the opportunities presented by a larger market and the spur of competition were all factors which it was impossible to quantify.(e) The recent report by British motor manufacturers estimatedthat they would sustain initial losses (some  17 million) consequent upon United Kingdom entry into the Community. They believed,however, that these short-term effects would be more than offset by the gain in the longer term. Moreover their assessment had reached the conclusion that the long-term prospects for the motor industry in a situation of United Kingdom economic isolation would
SECRET ...    7 HiCC 24 (67)be disastrous. They had sufficient confidence in the effects of entry to be undertaking investment now in anticipation of securing asubstantial share of the increased market.(/) It was impossible to assume entry to the Community in theabsence of any possibility of securing relief from the presenteffects on us of the c.a.p., and quantifications of the effect of entryon the balance of payments made on that assumption must be excessive in that respect.(g) Since taking office the Government had effected a majorimprovement in crude terms in our balance of payments from a deficit of some  800 million to a modest surplus this year. Whilstthis improvement was due in part to certain temporary measures,e.g., restrictions on capital movements, it must involve some switchof resources and certainly reflected an underlying continuedimprovement in our export position.The Prime Minister said that it would be best for the cabinet&apos;s substantive discussion of the effects of entry into the EECon our economy and balance of payments to be based on their consideration of the memorandum on this subject (C (67) 61) whichwas the next item on their agenda.(vii) The Community^ pragmatic methods of workingCould factual examples be given, relating to fields of particular interest to the United Kingdom, of ways in which the Community&apos;smethods of operation were in practice more pragmatic and empiricalthan the Treaty of Rome would suggest?The answer pointed to the large extent to which the e.c. andEuratom Treaties (by comparison with the earlier Treaty on theEuropean Coal and Steel Community (ECSC)) left power in thehands of the Council of Ministers, and to the present proposal toamalgamate the executives of the three Communities, as examples of the Communities&apos; readiness to modify their institutionsempirically in line with changing needs. The Treaties themselves,and the regulations and directives made under them, included manyspecial provisions making exceptions in favour of one or moremember countries (examples were given in Annex C to C (67) 65).It was not in the interests of the Community as a whole to override the special interests of any member country and at no time had a majority vote been taken against the important interests ofany member State; instead, agreement had been reachedunanimously and the necessary concessions made either inregulations or by derogation from them. Furthermore, in a numberof cases there was tacit acceptance of breaches of the Treaty and regulations by some or all member countries.In discussion, the following points were made (h) It was likely that many of the concessions and derogationsat present allowed would prove to be temporary to cover an interim period until a single market for particular commodities hadbeen established or a common e.c. policy worked out. An example
was the &quot; duty quotas &quot; which enabled members to import at lower rates of duty items where Community production fell short of consumption.(i) It was questioned whether we should be able to maintain our policy of aid to particular regions of the country, e.g., by the regional differentiation in the selective employment tax (SET)recently proposed, and if so, whether the continuation of these policies would be by right under the Treaty and subordinateregulations or on sufferance only. In reply, attention was drawn to the success of Belgium in securing the concurrence of the otherEEC countries in a scheme of regional state aids which went beyondaid for economic reasons by including, on political grounds, regionsthat were economically prosperous (Annex C, paragraphs 16 and 17).We had to accept that our regional aid policies might come underquestion by the Commission; we should counter vigorously any suggestions that we should radically change our present and possible future schemes; and we should not assume that, on its merits, theproposed regional SET was incompatible with the Treaty orsubordinate instruments. Even if it were thought to be so, the many comparable breaches by other e.c. member countries wouldsupply us with a strong countervailing argument to justify itscontinuation (should we decide to adopt it).(/&apos;) There would undoubtedly be difficulty in securingamendments of the Treaty itself. However, the Treaty was in verybroad terms and most of the specific requirements which might give us difficulty were contained in regulations and directives, whichcould be more easily called into question and amended. We could,moreover, draw comfort from the trend in the Community to takeprogressively greater account of national interests, particularly sincethe 1965-66 crisis in the Community precipitated by France whichhad led to the so-called Luxembourg Agreement.(k) Too much should not be made in practice of the activitiesof the Commission in scrutinising and pronouncing on the validity of actions of member countries. The Commission staff was smallin relation to its theoretical range of activity and in practice muchof the administration of the Common Market was in the hands ofnational Governments.. The &quot; unofficial derogations&quot; mentionedin the memorandum were in effect breaches of e.c. requirementscommitted by and in member countries but not reported to, orpronounced on by, the Commission. Some of these were on alarge scale and went further than we should expect to wish to go.Examples were the French Governments grant of interest-freeloans to the French steel industry and the Dutch practice of using the threat of higher gas prices to compel electricity undertakings to hold down charges to firms in development areas.(I) In the field of textiles, the aids granted by individual member countries were under examination and proposals forharmonisation might be made in due course (Annex C, paragraph 23).However, we gave no aid to the United Kingdom textile industryexcept through the quota system: in this country, as in the eec countries, the long-term quota system approved by the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) operated and it was the quota rather than the e.c. common external tariff which gaveprotection against low-cost producers. e.c. countries had lowerquotas for imports from low-cost countries than we had, and weshould seek to persuade them to raise their quotas nearer to thelevel of our own.In further general discussion, a distinction was drawn betweenthe c.a.p. and other aspects of e.c. policy. The c.a.p. had been developed to a stage where it was difficult to obtain substantial changes in the policy or derogations (whether official or unofficial)from it. Our best hope lay in negotiating some modifications of theapplication of the c.a.p. to the United Kingdom in advance of entry and thereafter in seeking to influence, as an e.c. member, thefuture direction of the policy. Hence the advantage to us inentering the e.c. before the 1969 negotiations on new agriculturalfinancing arrangements; and hence the French desire to finalisethese arrangements before our membership took effect. other fields of e.c. policy were less developed and our best course mightbe to keep the negotiations before entry on these aspects to aminimum and to seek for ourselves after entry the same flexibility in interpreting the policies as present e.c. members allowedthemselves. In these fields the indications were that, particularly inrecent years, a member country could secure its own interests if itdefended them vigorously and, if necessary, stubbornly. all member countries were in some degree in breach of the Treaty andits instruments.(viii) Production grants and farm improvement grants the question was asked, with particular reference to hill farmsin Wales, how far, if our present system of production grants hadto be dismantled, we could continue with our present range of farm improvement grants.The answer given was that, subject to any mitigations of thec.a.p. that we might obtain, we should be obliged to discontinuegrants which in effect subsidised the cost of production of particular commodities. Grants for farm improvements such as agriculturalroads, or to bring about improvements in farm structure, wouldprobably be compatible with the c.a.p. The position of grants forwinter keep was doubtful. It was possible that some grants, inparticular those to bring about the amalgamation of farms, would attract payments from the e.c. Guidance and Guarantee Fund.(ix) Government procurementHow far would our present policies of favouring UnitedKingdom industry in respect of Government contracts needmodification? It was assumed, for example, that the policy of grants to industry through the Industrial Reorganisation corporation would be compatible with e.c. regulations; but should we be ableto continue the present discrimination amounting to 25 per centin favour of native United Kingdom computer firms?
In reply, it was pointed out that there was no e.c. policy inrespect of Government procurement. It was widely recognised thatrestrictions on tariff discrimination (e.g., the GATT) did not apply in this field and we could assume from the practice of the eec countries that we should remain free to place governmental contractswhere we chose. In any event, our present 25 per centdiscrimination in respect of computers operated against some foreignfirms manufacturing in the United Kingdom as well as againstimported computers and so could not be represented asstraightforward discrimination against foreign firms ,The Cabinet having concluded their enquiries relating to furtherfactual information, Departmental officials then withdrew.approach to EuropeEffect of entry intothe e.c. onUnitedKingdombalance ofpayments(previous reference:CC (67) 23rdConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C (67) 61), to which was attached a report by officials and economic advisers on the effect of entry into the european economic Community (e.c.) on the United Kingdom balance ofpayments, together with a covering note by a group of permanent secretaries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the studies whichhad been carried out by officials showed that it was impossible toquantify with any degree of accuracy the total effect on our balanceof payments if we were to enter the Community. It was, however,clear that the immediate effect would be disadvantageous and serious.The conclusion of officials, with which he agreed, was however thatthe effect would be manageable and therefore that the course of joining the Community was one which it v/ould be reasonable forthe Government to take if it were considered that the advantages in other respects made this course desirable. If we were to join the Community, we should have to maintain the Government^current economic objectives and policies, but it might be thatcertain structural weaknesses in our economy would initiallyprevent us from taking full advantage - of entry. Our need tomaintain exchange control was not a source of strength, butstemmed from our economic weakness; and such control wouldhave to be maintained for some time. It was, however, impossibleto calculate whether we should be enabled to abandon our exchange control more quickly if we were to join the Community than ifwe were not to do so. If we were to join the Community we should need to make an additional economic effort in order to meet the impact over a short period of some 5 to 6 years, but the impetuswhich joining might be expected to give to industrial investment and economic growth should enable us to offset these initial effects,at least in part, even in this initial period.In discussion it was argued that, while it must be accepted that it was impossible to quantify exactly the consequences for our balance of payments if we were to join the Community, it was essential to seek to do so as far as possible in order to provide
a basis for the Governmenfs decision. At the least, these calculationswere an essential guide to the minimum terms which we could accept in negotiation. The report by officials should be taken as showing the order of magnitude of the adverse consequences whichwould be involved if we were to join the Community, particularlythrough higher food prices, the rise in the cost of living aridtherefore in wages and industrial costs, through the imposition oflevies under the common agricultural policy (c.a.p.) and through a net outflow of capital. It should also be borne in mind that theseconsequences were additional to our present burdens and wouldbe permanent; a transitional period would not result in theirdisappearance, but would only mask their effects in the short run.World food prices would not necessarily rise to such an extent that the prices which we would have to pay if we did not join theCommunity would be no less than those we should pay as members.It was uncertain whether such a rise would take place and, even ifit were to do so, there was no good reason to expect that the priceof food products in the e.c. would not rise comparably from theirpresent level.Admittedly, we should, if we were to join, expect to increase our exports to the e.c., but this increase would be offset, and perhaps more than offset, by the fall in our exports to othercountries which would inevitably be involved through the disappearance of our preferences in the Commonwealth and theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA). It had been argued that we should obtain economic advantages on joining theCommunity through being part of a much larger home market,but this argument had been overstressed and it could well bemaintained that those comparatively few industries which benefitedfrom a larger home market could equally benefit from existing arrangements, e.g., in respect of collaboration in development of aircraft, such as we had already undertaken with France. Moreover,even if there were to be an initial impetus to industrial investmentif we joined the Community, as the recent report of the confederation of British Industry suggested, additional investmentdid not necessarily lead to an increase in exports and the balanceof economic advantage to be expected did not suggest that theincrease in investment would be sustained over a long period.Even if it were accepted in the light of these facts that the adverseconsequences to our balance of payments, if we joined theCommunity, would be manageable, it nevertheless remained thatthere would be no economic advantage in doing so if we were toaccept the c.a.p. It was questionable whether it was necessary forus to accept that policy, but should we be forced to do so as aresult of joining there would be an additional burden on our balance of payments which would involve continuing economicstagnation. If it were argued that there were political advantages injoining, it should be borne in mind that the additional cost to our balance of payments was far greater than the small savings whichwe had achieved in our oversea expenditure by measures such as
the withdrawal of troops from Germany, which had caused great political damage to our foreign relations. In short, joining theCommunity would be a bad economic bargain and would involveconstraint on our economic and social policies which we should seek to avoid.It was argued on the other hand that it was dangerous in considering the Governmenfs decision to treat the necessarilyspeculative estimates of the effects on the balance of payments as if these were ascertained facts. Moreover, the estimates in thepaper prepared by officials were all based on the most pessimisticassumptions in the various fields concerned and also assumed thatwe should accept in full the existing Community regulations, if wewere to enter. Furthermore, the estimates must be compared withthe possible consequences for our balance of payments if we wereto abstain from joining any larger economic group. In considering these consequences, it was important to bear in mind that there wasa steady erosion, which must be expected to continue, of our commonwealth preferences and that we could not expect thatEFTA would remain in being indefinitely if we were to abandon the prospect of joining the Community. If we were to refrain fromseeking to join the Community now, that decision would in practiceprove to be permanent and the disadvantages of our isolation would increase with time. Whether we were to join the Community ornot, we needed to strengthen our present economic policies and toincrease the rate of growth of our industrial efficiency. Theattitude of industry gave good reason to expect that the expectedimpetus to investment would begin shortly after the Government^announcement that we were seeking to join the Community and thisimpetus should increase throughout the transitional period.Increased investment could reasonably be expected to lead to increased productivity and therefore to increased competitivenessin exports. The initial burden on our balance of payments whichmust be assumed, even if it could not be quantified, did not, evenon the more pessimistic assumptions, amount to more than a transfer of resources of the order of  100 million a year for five years. Our economy was not at present stagnant, as had beenalleged, and the rate of growth of the gross national product (g.n.p.)in the following year was estimated to be 3 per cent. Consequentlyover the five year period this burden amounted in total only to a half of the estimated increase in the g.n.p. over one year and thewhole effect could be offset if our rate of growth could be increased from 3 per cent to 3-3 per cent a year. The immediatedisadvantages of joining the Community must be seen in proportionand in relation to the long-term economic advantages.In further discussion differing views were expressed on the timing of any decision to join the Community if this proved to bethe course the Government decided to adopt. While there was general agreement that it would be unacceptable that the initialimpact on our economy of joining the Community should begin to take effect in the course of the next eighteen months to two years,it was argued that the necessary course of negotiations and
ratification of the agreement in any event ruled out this course. Itwas further argued, however, that it would be advantageous if wewere to delay joining the Community until the early 1970s. In thatperiod we could reasonably expect that the Governments present policies would result in the strengthening of the economy, so enablingit better to take the initial strain of joining the Community.Furthermore, the fact that the structure of the Community now appeared to be more favourable to our interests than it had been at the time of the earlier negotiations in 1961-63 suggested thatdelay might lead to further favourable developments. At the later date, other changes in Europe might improve our prospect of negotiating more favourable terms than it now seemed likely thatwe should be able to obtain.On the other hand, it was urged that delay would be to our disadvantage in that Community arrangements which were atpresent flexible must be expected to become more rigid. If wewere members of the Community we should be enabled to influence the course of development, whereas if we were not members it seemed probable that Community policies would harden in a form which might make our entry later less acceptable and harder tonegotiate.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would resume their discussion at the meetings at Chequers the following day. It mightbe convenient if they were to begin by considering the papercirculated by the Secretary of State for Scotland on ScottishAgriculture and the Common Market (C (67) 64) before resumingtheir discussion on the balance of payments. The Cabinet mightthereafter turn to consideration of the papers circulated by theForeign Secretary (C (67) 68) and the Commonwealth Secretary(C (67) 66) on the attitude of foreign countries and commonwealth countries respectively towards our seeking to join the Community.At this stage the Foreign Secretary might also report to the Cabinetthe outcome of the meeting the previous day of the ministerial council of EFTA. The Cabinet might then turn to discuss thepaper which had been circulated by himself *and the foreign secretary (C (67) 60) on the alternative courses which could befollowed in respect of the approach to Europe. Thereafter, or inthe course of their discussion of this paper, the Cabinet would wishto range over the whole field of the issues arising on the approach to Europe in assessing the balance of advantages and disadvantages.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement in respect ofthe procedure for their meeting on the following day and agreed to resume their discussion accordingly.Cabinet Office, S.W.129th April, 1967.
