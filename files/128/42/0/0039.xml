Parliament(previous reference:CC(67) 29thConclusions,Minute 1)CC 39 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that a Motion opposing theGovernments decision to establish a third airport for the Londonregion at Stansted had been signed by 260 Members of parliament and public opposition to the decision was mounting. The EssexCounty Council had issued a writ claiming declarations against the implementation of the decision. The issue of this writ did not legallydebar the Government from making an Order to implement thedecision in respect of Stansted, but there would in thesecircumstances be political advantage in deferring such action, andthe consequential debate, until Parliament resumed in October.In discussion there was general agreement with this proposal.It was, however, urged that it would be important not to base thedecision to postpone the debate solely on the fact that a writ hadbeen issued, since this might be taken as a precedent which wouldenable the Governments action in other cases to be frustrated by individuals or bodies of less standing. The statement of theGovernments decision to postpone the debate should pay regardto the standing of the Essex County Council and the widercircumstances. Furthermore, it would be important that in the intervening period the Governments case in respect of the decisionto establish the airfield at Stansted should not go by default andthe Ministers concerned should ensure that full publicity was givento the considerations which had led the Government to that decision.Oversea AffairsGibraltar(previous reference:CC(67) 38thConclusions,Minute 1)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the making of an Order in respect of theestablishment at Stansted of the third London airportshould be delayed until October.(2) Invited the Lord. President, of the Council to consider, inconsultation with the President of ,the Board of Trade,the Minister of Housing and Local Government and the attorney-General, and in the light of the discussion, theterms in which this postponement should be announced.(3) Invited the President of the. Board of Trade and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to consider the means by which greater publicity could be given to the considerations which had led the Government to decide that the third airport for the London region should beat Stansted.secret. The Foreign Secretary said that, as expected, the talks whichhad been taking place with Spain in Madrid, about the restrictionson aviation which the Spanish Government had proclaimed in theair space near Gibraltar, had broken down. The way was thereforeopen to us to take the issue back to the International Civil AviationOrganisation and the presentation of our case was being prepared
Meeting of theCouncil of theNorth AtlanticTreatyOrganisation(previous reference:CC(66) 67thConclusions,Minute 2)Hong Kong(previous reference:CC(67) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2)in consultation with the Law Officers; in due course we might seekrecourse to the International Court of Justice at The Hague on the issues between ourselves and Spain. The Spanish Government hadbeen informed of our intention to carry out a referendum in Gibraltarenabling the inhabitants to choose between British and Spanishsovereignty and our Permanent Representative at the United Nations,Lord Caradon, had informed the United Nations Secretary-General,U Thant, of our plans. So far there had been no reaction from theSpanish Government to the announcement of this referendum butthey might well decide to take further action against Gibraltar;proposals would be brought before Ministers in the near futureindicating what retaliation would be open to us should they do so.The Foreign Secretary said that at the meeting in Luxembourgon the previous two days of the Council of the North Atlantic treaty organisation he had discussed with other members the situation inthe Middle East: he would report the outcome of these discussions on the next item of the Cabinefs agenda. He had also discussed withthe French Foreign Minister, M. Couve de Murville, our applicationto join the European Economic Community (e.c.). M. de Murvillehad taken the line that the member Governments of the e.c. andthe Commission itself would require a series of meetings at which to discuss our application amongst themselves and would not therefore be in a position to have any joint discussions with theUnited Kingdom until the autumn. He had made it clear in reply that we regarded such a delay as unreasonable and that we wishedto start such discussions before August. The Five were now taking a much firmer line, both in public and in private, in respect of theFrench obstructiveness in considering our application. The only other item of importance was that the United States Secretary ofState, Mr. Rusk, had informed him that the United States and Sovietdelegates at Geneva had agreed, ad referendum to their respective governments, on the draft text of a Treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, which they would table for wider discussion. Therewere alternative texts of some passages and there was as yet noagreed passage on nuclear safeguards, but nevertheless this positionrepresented a considerable advance on the part of the SovietGovernment, whose attitude might well have been affected by their concern at the situation in the Middle East. The text of the treaty would no doubt now be subject to difficult negotiations with othercountries concerned.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in HongKong was still uneasy and there were widespread rumours of furtherstrikes and other disturbances. There was some evidence that theCommunist leaders in Hong Kong were no longer wholly in controlof the situation. The Government of the People&apos;s Republic of china were urging the Hong Kong Communists to await a call to action,but this might mean either that the Chinese Government intendedto bring further pressure to bear upon us or alternatively that theywere seeking a relaxation of the present tension. The Governor of hong Kong, who had been ill, had been due to go on leave beforethe disturbances.  He had delayed his departure when they broke
Nigeria(previous reference:CC(67) 37thConclusions,Minute 3)out and his firm and skilful handling of the recent troubles hadbeen responsible for keeping the situation under control, but he would shortly have to take his deferred leave if there were not to be aserious risk to his health.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was some indication that the Federal Government of Nigeria might refuse toagree that oil royalties should be paid by the oil company into asuspense account pending the clarification of the situation in respectof the declaration of independence by the Government of the EasternRegion. It was not yet clear whether this would lead to delay inshipments of oil.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.Middle East(previous reference:CC(67) 38thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that our posts in Arab countries were reporting concern at the effects there of our efforts before therecent hostilities in the Middle East to secure the right of innocentpassage through the Straits of Tiran and of the lie that Britishand United States aircraft had assisted Israel to achieve her victory over the Arab air forces. It seemed that aircraft had been detectedby radar in Jordan flying in over the Mediterranean (instead of fromthe direction of Israel) and had been assumed to be British ar american although they were in fact Israeli; there were indications that Government sources in some Arab countries did not believe the allegations but they were facing difficult local situations and werenot free to say this openly. Our objective must be to re-establishgood relations with the Arab States as far and as quickly as wecould and, in the first instance, an examination was being made ofwhat we could do to help Jordan and to assist the refugees. Itappeared that the Suez Canal was blocked, although the nature and extent of the blockage was not known nor indeed who had causedit; Israel had hitherto refused to co-operate in attempts to clarifythe situation but now appeared willing to do so. It did not seem likely that our ships in the Canal would be able to leave at least until there had been a meeting of the United Nations general assembly, but they had sufficient food and water and messages from them were permitted.The Soviet Union had failed to obtain sufficient support to securethe adoption in the United Nations Security Council of tworesolutions directed against Israel and she had now sought a special meeting of the General Assembly; this was a complete reversal ofher attitude on all previous occasions on the use of this procedure in the United Nations, when she had been strongly opposed to suchspecial meetings.   It seemed probable that there would be simple
majority among member countries of the United Nations that wasnecessary before a special meeting could be convened and that itwould take place early the following week. There were indications that the Soviet Union might be represented at the meeting byMr. Kosygin or Mr. Gromyko and that the Foreign Ministers ofother countries might attend; in this event he himself proposed toattend the meeting on behalf of the United Kingdom. Although itwas unlikely that the meeting itself would be other than an occasion for propaganda, it would provide valuable opportunities for discussionwith representatives of Arab and Commonwealth countries on theimmediate steps required towards a settlement in the Middle Eastand on such matters as the refugee problem. He had discussed thegeneral situation with other members at the meeting on the previoustwo days of the Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Minister of Power said that the oil situation in the middle east was changing continuously and it was impossible to forecast howit would develop in the short run. At present the Suez Canal andthe Levant pipelines were closed and production in Iraq, Libya andBahrain had stopped; oil production had restarted in Kuwait andSaudi Arabia and exports were continuing from Abu Dhabi, Qatarand Algeria; no Arab State was permitting the export of oil to UnitedKingdom or United States destinations. Continuation of this situation would mean a reduction of 28 per cent in oil supplies to western Europe and a reduction during the first three months of25 days in our 91 days&apos; oil stocks, on the assumption that other european countries were willing to share the shortage equally with us even though there was no restriction on oil supplies to them.The United States Government had declared a state of emergencywhich was necessary under her anti-trust legislation to enable UnitedStates oil companies to co-operate in taking all necessary steps todeal with the oil situation. French obstruction had, however, sofar prevented effective action in the Organisation for economic co-operation and Development, despite the attitude of the othermembers and particularly of the Netherlands.Although the oil supply situation was not as serious as had seemed possible a few days earlier, the continuation even of thepresent situation would mean a heavy additional burden on our balance of payments amounting perhaps to  50 million over a six-month period. There was also cause for concern about the long-term effects of recent events in the Middle East on the position ofour oil companies there and particularly about their concessions inIraq, in which Italian and Japanese companies were showing interest.In view of the uncertain prospect, preparations for the introductionof petrol rationing were continuing.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the effect of action by Iraq to prevent the passage of tankers from Abadan through herterritorial waters was less serious than had at first been thought, butthat it seemed unlikely that supplies from Iran could be substantially increased immediately. Our main problem as regards oil supplieslay in the fact that, although Arab Governments might themselveswish to resume oil supplies to us, or to connive at our receiving
Social ServicesUprating of social security benefits(previous reference:CC(67) 28thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in the previousNovember the Cabinet had agreed, in the light of the forecasts then made of likely increases in prices and earnings, that the leadingnational insurance benefit rate for a single person should be increasedby 10s. Subsequently, in view of the smaller increases in prices and earnings which had actually occurred and were in prospect, hehad proposed a proportionate reduction in the increase of benefit, andthe Cabinet had agreed that the increase in the leading rate shouldbe limited to 9s., other rates being increased proportionately. It now appeared likely, however, that there would be a rather larger increase in prices in particular the increase in electricity pricesmight have a disproportionate effect on pensioners&apos; expenditure andin these circumstances it would be difficult to defend an increasein the national insurance rate of less than 10s. While an increaseof 10s. would, as compared with the 9s. previously agreed, resultin a direct extra cost to the Exchequer of some  6^ million a year, thiswould be offset for the next two years if, as he proposed, thethe employers&apos; contribution were increased t^o produce an equivalentincrease in the income of the National Insurance Fund, which wouldenable Exchequer borrowing to be correspondingly reduced. Thetotal increase in the contribution of employers and employees wouldrespectively be of the order of 2s. 3d. and 2s., instead of 2s. andIs. lid.In discussion the point was made that the increase of 9s. in thenational insurance benefit rate previously agreed would still suffice to cover the greater increase in prices now assumed. On the otherhand, there was general agreement that an increase in the benefitrate of no more than 9s. would now be difficult to defend. Theprevious Act increasing national insurance benefits and contributionsprovided a precedent for increasing the employers&apos; contribution morethan the employees&apos;.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the forthcoming National Insurance Bill should provide for an increase in the leading national insurance benefit ratethem, popular pressure stimulated by the United Arab Republicmight make it difficult for them to do this. Our aim must continueto be to seek to improve our relations with the Arab States and wemust be seen publicly to be opposed to any extreme proposals whichIsrael might put forward following her victory. We must also do all that we could to assist in the relief of the suffering in the middle east that had resulted from the fighting.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Power.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to make regular reports tothe Cabinet about the situation in respect of oil supplies.
for a single person of 10s. a week on the footing that the employers&apos;contribution would be increased to 2s. 3d. so as to enable theadditional cost to the Exchequer to be offset for the next two years.The Cabinet-CD Agreed that the forthcoming National Insurance Bill should provide for an increase of 10s. a week in the standard rate of national insurance benefit for a single person.(2) Invited the Minister of Social Security, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to determine theappropriate increases in the rates of contribution inaccordance with the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion, and any necessary consequential adjustments in other rates of benefit.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 96) by theLord President of the Council to which was annexed a proposedlegislative programme for 1967-68.The Lord President said that the programme in Annex A ofhis paper had been generally approved by the Future legislation committee and was brought before the Cabinet for provisional approval at this stage in order to provide a firm basis for preparatory work on the selected Bills. The Cabinet would have a further opportunity to consider the programme in the autumn in the context of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. It waspossible that time would have to be found either in 1967-68 or inthe succeeding Session for legislation arising out of our entry intothe European Economic Community and on this as well as on more general grounds it was important that Departments should pushahead with the preparation of their Bills and in particular shouldhave as many as possible ready for introduction at the beginning ofthe Session, since to have a good supply of Bills ready at that point would greatly simplify the management of the programme. Annex Bto C (67) 96 contained a provisional outline of the programme for later Sessions. No decision on this was required at present and hewould continue to discuss long-term plans with departmental ministers with a view to distributing major measures through theremaining Sessions of the Parliament so that some attractive measures would remain for the end of the period and others could beforeshadowed in White Papers.In discussion the following points were made (a) Commonwealth Telegraphs might become essential.(b) A Coal (Borrowing Powers) Bill would be required before christmas.(c) Post Office (Status) should be added to the Bills expected tobe ready at the beginning of the Session.LegislativeProgramme1967-68
id) If proposals for an Industrial Expansion Bill now before theEconomic Policy Committee were approved it might be possible forthe Minister of Technology to deal with certain projects by order and to avoid the necessity for separate Bills on Concord Production,Aircraft Industry Finance and Beagle Aircraft.(e) Vehicle Registration would be ready by the beginning of thenext Session and Channel Tunnel, to which it was an alternative,seemed unlikely to be required during the Session except possibly inthe form of a short and uncontroversial interim measure.(/) A National Insurance (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill to dealwith certain anomalies in existing legislation might become necessary and should be added to the Reserve list. So also should a Bill on oil Pollution which might be required as a result of the report ofthe Sub-Committee of the Select Committee on Science and technology.(g) The Minister of Transport was anxious that PortsReorganisation Bill should be brought forward to 1968-69; but thisraised the question of the most advantageous spacing of the variousBills which the Minister wished to introduce during the remainder of the Parliament and the Lord President would discuss the timetablewith her.(h) The list of Bills for Private Members included one on Gypsiesbut legislation of a more far reaching kind might be required onthis: the Minister of Housing and Local Government was in correspondence with the Minister without Portfolio. An AirPollution Bill, on which the assistance of Government draftsmen hadbeen promised to Mr. Bob Edwards, mp, should be added to thePrivate Members List. The British Nationality Bill might also prove to be unsuitable for a Private Member but the possibility of takingit in the Second Reading Committee should be considered.The Prime Minister, summing up, said that, subject to the points made in discussion and to further examination in the autumn, theCabinet approved the legislative programme for 1967-68 circulated with C (67) 96. The Lord President should continue to keep the timing of major proposals for subsequent Sessions under review inconsultation with the Ministers concerned: plans should be discussed on the assumption that the Parliament would run its full term. Thelegislation required in the forthcoming Sessions was likely to impose a heavy burden of work on Parliamentary Counsel and it was important that Ministers should make themselves personallyresponsible for seeing that adequate time was allowed for draftingat all stages. Decisions on policy should be sought well in advance and drafting instructions given quickly thereafter: an outlinedelivered promptly was more useful than detailed instructions givenlate. Last minute changes, either in the programme or in individualBills, should be avoided and Departments should remember that parliamentary Counsel were responsible not only for drafting Bills, butfor advising on a wide range of legislative, Parliamentary, procedural
and allied questions. He proposed to circulate a memorandum tobring these points to the attention of all Ministers concerned with legislation.The Cabinet-(1) Approved, subject to the points made in discussion, thelegislative programme for 1967-68 set out in Annex Ato C (67) 96.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Ministers concerned, to continue to keep underreview the timing of major measures for future Sessions.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would circulate to ministers concerned with legislation a memorandum onthe responsibilities of Parliamentary Counsel on the lines indicated in his summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th June, 1967.
