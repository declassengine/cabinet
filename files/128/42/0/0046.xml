The Foreign Secretary said that after considerable dissensionin the Security Council it had been unanimously agreed that observersfrom the United Nations Truce Supervision Organisation should besent to the Suez Canal and the Gaza Strip. The observers would not constitute a military force, but there would be a substantial number ofthem and it was hoped that their presence would prevent furtheroutbreaks of fighting and help to produce a more favourable climatefor the re-opening of the Canal. Attempts were being made toorganise a meeting of Heads of Arab States in Cairo and much would turn on the outcome. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia was seeking to resume oil supplies to the United States and ourselves and in a numberof respects the atmosphere in the Middle East showed some improvement. In these circumstances, we should refrain from taking any major initiative for the time being.The British charter aircraft carrying Mr. Tshombe, the exiledCongolese leader, on a private journey had been taken over by forceand brought down in Algeria, where all the crew as well as mr. Tshombe himself had been imprisoned. We had sought to make contact with the British pilots through the Swiss Embassy, which represented our interests while we were not in diplomatic relationswith Algeria and we had also sought the good offices of France. Itappeared that the French approach might be successful and therewas reason to hope that we should be able to make contact with the pilots during the course of the week.The course of events in the Congo was still highly uncertainthough it now seemed clear that the outbreak of violence resulted froma mutiny by some of the mercenaries and was not instigated by any foreign Power or organisation. We were seeking to bring together for evacuation all British subjects in the Eastern province of the congo, but they were widely scattered and it was difficult to do so.Meanwhile we had no information that any British subjects had suffered harm.The French Foreign Minister, M. Couve de Murville, had takenan uncompromising position in discussions in the European economic community about our application to join the European Communities.The Five had, however, been robust in supporting the opening of negotiations on our application. The meeting had adjourned and ithad been agreed that the Commission itself should produce a reportfor the consideration of the Ministerial Council in early September.We had arranged with M. Rey, the President of the Commission, tokeep in contact at official level in order to seek to influence theCommission^ report on lines favourable to our application. Therewould be no formal meetings, but our Ambassador to the e.c. would hold a series of lunches at which there could be informal discussions between one or two members of the Official Committee on the approach to Europe and representatives of the Commission. Itwould of course be clear that there was no question of negotiations atthis stage.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the following weekhe would be meeting the Finance Ministers of the Six. In discussions with them he would take the view, with particular reference tocriticisms by the French Government of the impediment posed by theposition of sterling to our joining the Communities, that we saw no ideological difficulty in discussing the future of the sterling area and the sterling reserves. We recognised that there would be considerable advantage in securing a different relationship between our assets and our liabilities, whether by some long-term funding ofthe sterling balances or in other ways. Although it must be borne inmind that some countries at least had stated specifically that theydid not wish their sterling balances to be repaid in currentcircumstances, he would make it clear in the discussions that we hadno intention of adopting a rigid position on these issues.In discussion it was argued that it would be preferable not tohave contacts with the Commission at official level at the present stage and until United Kingdom Ministers had completed their discussions and taken decisions on the outstanding points relating tothe aims we should seek to achieve in negotiation. It was also suggested that the Governmenfs interest as a whole would not be adequately represented unless officials of the main Departmentsconcerned were to take part in the informal talks in Brussels. It was,however, the general view that it would be contrary to our interestsfor discussions to be known to be taking place in Brussels between aBritish official delegation of some size on the one hand and theCommission on the other. This might indeed produce the impression that negotiations had been started. On the other hand, it was alsothe general view that it was greatly to our interest to maintain informalcontacts with the Commission in an effort to influence their report onthe lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet on balance agreed that arrangements should be madefor one or two members of the Official Committee on the approach to Europe to visit Brussels during the summer from time to time forinformal talks with members of the European Economic Commission,in order to explain and answer questions on the Governmenfsapplication to join the European Communities. Those officials would of course not be free to go beyond the White Paper approved by theCabinet (Cmnd. 3345), containing the text of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sspeech at the meeting of the Western European Union the previousweek. Notes would be taken of all discussions of this kind with theCommission and it would be open to Departments and to ministers to seek further discussion of any items of difficulty arising from the notes of discussions or in the light of the periodical reports of the officials concerned.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that there should be informal discussions between united Kingdom officials and members of the european economic Commission in respect of our application tojoin the European Communities on the lines indicated bythe Prime Minister in his summing up of the discussion.
The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal Council of theGovernment of South Arabia had agreed that one of their members,Mr. Bayoomi, should be nominated as Prime Minister designateunder the new Constitution. Mr. Bayoomi was now seeking to forma government in which the three main nationalist parties in south arabia might take part as well as representatives of the FederalRulers. Discussions were also taking place elsewhere with one ortwo leading representatives of some of these parties in an endeavourto persuade them to participate.The Commonwealth Secretary said that our further discussions with the Nigerians about the export of oil had failed to achieveagreement that the blockade imposed by the naval forces of theFederal Military Government should be lifted. Hostilities had nowbroken out between the Federal Forces and the forces of the EasternRegion, which had declared its independence as the Republic of Biafra.Both sides claimed initial success but no reliable information on thecourse of the fighting was available; and heavy rains had begun, soinhibiting further military movements. The evacuation of Britishwomen and children from the Eastern Region had been completed,but there were still some 2,000 British subjects in this region who hadelected to stay. We were seeking to avoid a commitment to either side in the hostilities and, though we had supplied arms to the FederalMilitary Government in respect of orders which had been acceptedbefore recent events, we had not agreed to meet a further request from them for further substantial supplies of arms. Our current assessmentwas that if hostilities continued the Federal Military Forces might eventually be victorious, but only after a considerable time.Meanwhile, the so-called Republic of Biafra had received no supportor recognition by any other country in Africa and it might well suffer from serious internal dissension if the Federal Military Forcesachieved any initial success. In these circumstances, our best interestslay in seeking to maintain neutrality between the conflicting claims of the Federal Military Government and the Government of theEastern Region.The Cabinet (2) Took   note   of  the   statements   by  the   Foreign   and commonwealth Secretaries.The Commonwealth Secretary reported on the position in HongKong. His statement and the Cabinefs discussion and conclusions reached were recorded separately.*The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the report by officials should be circulated to Ministers as quickly as possible. He would consider what arrangements should be madeto enable the Ministers primarily concerned to keep the situation under constant review and to take immediate decisions as eventsmight require.* The record was only distributed to The Queen, the Prime Minister and those ministers who had to take action on the conclusions. The record is kept in theSecretary&apos;s Standard File.
The Cabinet-Took note that the Prime Minister would consider what action should be taken to facilitate collective Ministerialconsideration of the situation in Hong Kong and inparticular to consider urgently the report now being prepared by officials on the action which should be taken if our position in Hong Kong became untenable.Middle EastArab attitude and BritishEconomicInterests in theMiddle East(previous reference:CC(67) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the foreign secretary on Arab Attitudes and British Economic Interests in theMiddle East (C (67) 123).The Foreign Secretary said that our large interests in the arab states in the Middle East limited narrowly our freedom of action inthe area generally; we were heavily dependent on Arab oil and onfreedom of passage through the Suez Canal, we had large export markets in these countries; and they held large sterling balances.Despite the fact that we had not been involved in the recent conflictwe faced great difficulty in attempting to preserve these interests; ifwe were to do so, it was essential that we should re-establish good relations with the Arab States or at least that there should not be acommon front against us on the part of both the moderate and therevolutionary governments in the Arab world. There was little thatwe ourselves could now do to influence the way in which events moved in the Middle East. Apart from the attitude of the Arab Statesthemselves, and in particular the future of President Nasser of theUnited Arab Republic (UAR) which was difficult to predict, the mainfactor in the situation would be the extent to which the Soviet union would be willing to look beyond her short-term tactical aim of re-establishing her credit with the Arabs and to recognise the need to agree with the United States on terms for a settlement which couldbe pressed on both Israel and the Arab States. Israel must be expectedto pursue a firm policy and refuse to make, substantial concessionswithout peace negotiations or acceptance of her right to exist. Amongthe Arab States the hope lay in a willingness and ability on the part ofthe more moderate governments to take a greater account of their economic interests as time passed. A decline in the position of president Nasser would facilitate this and reduce the likelihood thatthe moderate governments would be prevented by popular pressure,stimulated by UAR propaganda, from adopting a more reasonable attitude.Any settlement of the Middle East situation would necessarily beunpalatable in some respects to both the Arab countries and to Israel.Since we could not expect to have more than a marginal influence on its terms and since our position was highly vulnerable, we should seek to disengage ourselves so far as possible from it. But we must recognise that public feeling in this country on the merits of theArab /Israeli dispute and the need to play our part in the united nations limited our freedom of action. We had continued to supplyarms and spare parts to Israel during the recent conflict to fulfil
The Oil supply situation andthe UnitedKingdom(previous reference:CC(67) 43rdConclusions,Minute 3,confidential annex)The Cabinet-(1) Took note of C (67) 123.The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the Minister of power on the Oil Supply Situation and the United Kingdom(C(67) 126).The Minister of Power said that the interruptions in oil suppliesas a result of the Middle East conflict had reduced supplies to western europe by about 30 per cent in June; in July the shortfall would notbe far short of this but it should reduce to 10 to 15 per cent in august and revert to about the normal level in September. This wouldbe achieved, despite the closing of the Suez Canal and the ban on oil supplies to ourselves and the United States from the arab countries, by rerouting supplies from other sources to us and byobtaining larger supplies from Venezuela and the United States. Thisrerouting, together with the long haul round the Cape owing to the closure of the Suez Canal, had led to a shortage of tankers and it was this, not a shortage of supplies, that was the main problem. Therecent stoppage of supplies from Nigeria was now adding to theexisting orders and were continuing to do so. Although no formalapproaches had yet been made, it was understood that Israel wouldbe seeking replacements for the tanks that she had lost during thefighting and that, in view of the French attitude, she wasreconsidering her source of supply for military aircraft (which she had previously obtained from France).In discussion there was general agreement that, in view of oue independence on oil supplies from the Arab States, there was no realalternative for us to the policy proposed by the Foreign Secretary,although we had to recognise that, however careful we might be in maintaining a neutral attitude, we could not expect to receive credit for it. It might be however that the meeting currently taking place between Arab leaders in Cairo would lead to disillusion with theextreme policies of President Nasser, which had led to the recentdefeat of the Arabs, and thus open the way to a reasonable settlement in the Middle East. The view was expressed that recent events in theMiddle East had illustrated clearly that our military presence therewas of no value to our economic interests and that this presenceshould be withdrawn as quickly as possible; and that these eventscast doubt also on the wisdom of allowing a decline in the output of oil in Iran in order to permit a growth of output in Saudi Arabia.As regards the longer term there was general agreement thatwe should re-examine our dependence on Middle East oil, havingregard to the limitations which this dependence placed on ouroversea policy and to the fact that on three occasions in the last 10years interference with supplies had put our industry at risk. In thatre-examination we must however also have in mind the great advantage we obtained from the cheapness of Middle East oil andthat the large investments that we had in the area were of greatimportance to industry and to our balance of payments.
problem, but Iranian production had been increased by 20 per cent and a small, though useful, output from Oman should provide about10 per cent of our supplies by the middle of September. A recentassessment by the Oil Industry Emergency Committee of the prospective stock situation over the next three months showed that by the end of September our stocks were likely to decline from 11-3weeks to 7-2 weeks&apos; supplies. When stocks dropped below 7 to 8weeks, these were difficulties of local supply and with particularproducts; and the situation in September would become difficult asthe total stock then would be 6  million tons below what was normalfor that time of year. The supply of naphtha, which was a vitalfeedstock for the chemical and gas industries and which was in short supply world-wide even before the present crisis, was a particular difficulty. Nevertheless the prospective situation was not such as tocall for petrol rationing on supply grounds though regard had alsoto be paid to the adverse effects of the situation on our balance ofpayments.The possibility of obtaining supplies of oil or products fromthe Soviet Union and Rumania was being investigated and we mightbe able to purchase 40,000 tons of oil products, including 20,000 tonsof naphtha, from the Soviet Union through a third party; but it wasnot as yet clear that either country in fact had substantial amounts of oil available for sale. Any arrangements that were made for supplies from Rumania would have to take account of the large compensation claims which were outstanding against the Government of thatcountry in respect of the expropriation of foreign oil companies,including Shell. As regards supplies from other sources, despite the alleged surplus of oil in various countries and the fact that it waswell-known that we were willing to purchase supplies, no offers hadbeen made.In discussion there was general agreement that we should seek to obtain oil and those oil products that we needed from the soviet union and Rumania. Such purchases would, for the present at anyrate, have to be arranged without publicity and, as regards Rumania,the question of the compensation claims outstanding against hershould be left aside in any arrangements made for supplies duringthe present crisis; and it would have to be made clear that in doing so, we did not thereby create a precedent or abandon our claims. Itmight be that, as a result of the meeting of the Heads of the arab states currently taking place in Cairo, supplies to us from some ofthem would be resumed, though if this were attempted there might besabotage of pipelines and installations. Officials were carrying out a fresh examination of the effect on the balance of payments of the interruption of our oil supplies and of its relevance to the stocksituation and to the need for petrol rationing.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that inpresent circumstances the Cabinet would find it helpful to have a weekly report by the Minister of Power on the oil supply situation.A full examination was needed, in the light of the current crisis, ofthe implications for the longer term both of our dependence on oil ingeneral and of the extent to which we could avoid depending as
Space Policy(previous reference:CC(66) 59thConclusions,Minute 2)EuropeanConferenceon SatelliteCommunicationsCONFIDENTIAL3. The Foreign Secretary recalled that in November 1966 the ministerial Committee on Science and Technology had agreed thatthe Government should not participate in the proposed technologicalprogramme of the European Conference on Satellite Communications(GETS), but that in principle the United Kingdom national programme on space technology (involving the development of black ARROW) should be approved. The Cabinet had subsequently agreed that the BLACK ARROW programme shouldcontinue through 1967-68, subject to an evaluation during the courseof that year of its priority in relation to other research anddevelopment projects. Ministers had subsequently agreed that weshould defer the public announcement of the Governmenfs decision not to participate in the CETS programme, in view of current politicalcircumstances, and that we should accept the continuation of certain further technical studies. At their meeting the previous week todiscuss the attitude which the Government should adopt at theforthcoming Conference in Rome on a European space policy, atwhich decisions would be sought on the future of the CETSprogramme, the Ministerial Committee had agreed on balance thatwe should then make it clear that we would not participate in that further programme, and that we should explain to our allies ourdoubts about the desirability of the project on economic and technological grounds and our difficulties about the question of our entry into the European Communities remained unsettled. On this basis, we would confine ourselves at the Rome meeting to proposingan objective study of the costs and benefits of potential european space programmes. Since the Committee had met, it had emergedthat it was not essential to take a decision on the future CETSprogramme at the Rome meeting, but that we could keep the CETSdesign team for the project in being for a further period, up to the endof this year, in order to participate in a technical study, at a cost tothe United Kingdom of only  17,500. Since an announcement at the rome meeting of a decision not to participate further in the CETSprogramme would undoubtedly seriously damage our relations withheavily as at present on particular areas for our oil supplies. As a first step the Minister of Power should discuss with the first secretary of State how best to arrange for Ministerial considerationof the work that had already been done by officials on this problem.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (67) 126.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to discuss with the first secretary of State the arrangements for Ministerialconsideration of the work which had been done by officials on the implications of our dependence on oil and on particular sources of oil supply.
our closest supporters in the Six, it would be particularly inopportunein relation to our application to join the European Communities.In these circumstances, he had consulted the Chancellor of theExchequer and they had agreed that, subject to the cabinet&apos;s approval, the United Kingdom Delegation should agree at the Romemeeting to a technical study by the CETS design team on this basis,provided that it was made clear that no further commitment was involved.In discussion it was suggested that the postponement of anannouncement of a decision not to participate in the CETSprogramme for the development of communication satellites wouldnot ease the political embarrassment which would inevitably arise inmaking such an announcement at a later date. At that stage it might reasonably be hoped that we would then be engaged in negotiations in respect of our entry into the Communities and it would no doubt be urged again on grounds of our foreign policy that we should notwithdraw from participation in the programme. It was, however,the general view that at that stage the political difficulties of withdrawl would be substantially less than at the present time, when our application was still being considered by the Six and we hadnot yet entered into negotiations. In these circumstances there was general agreement with the course proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet Agreed that, while the Governments decision not toparticipate in a further CETS programme for thedevelopment of communications satellites should bemaintained, on the lines previously agreed by the ministerial committee on Science and Technology, the announcementof such a decision should be postponed and that we should agree to participate, at a cost to the United Kingdom of 17,500, in a technical study by the design team for theCETS project which would last up to about the end of 1967.transport policy: RoadHaulageProposals for revision of theCarriers&apos;licensing system(previous reference:CC (66) 34thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofTransport (C (67) 122) and by the President of the Board of Trade(C (67) 127) on the revision of the present road haulage carriers&apos;licensing system.The Prime Minister said that it might not be possible to completeconsideration of this item of their agenda since a number of membersof the Cabinet would shortly have to leave to attend the memorial service for the former Secretary of the Cabinet, Lord Normanbrook.In that case the Cabinet would resume their discussion on Thursday,13th July.The Minister of Transport said that reform of the presentcarriers&apos; licensing system was an essential part of the Government^transport policy. In the White Paper on Transport Policy(Cmnd. 3057), published in 1966, the Government had accepted theview that the present system of licensing for goods vehicles was
ineffective for purposes of improving road safety and co-ordinatingtransport resources and had stated that it was necessary to devise licensing system which would be &quot; an effective instrument of a modern,national freight policy&quot;. The proposals contained in hermemorandum were designed to carry this into effect. She hadreceived representations from the Trades Union Congress (TUC)for re-establishment of the British Transport Commission to operatepublic transport and also to exercise licensing functions in relationto privately-operated road transport. The TUC had emphasised thatthe present licensing system had led to a proliferation of road vehicleoperators carrying their own goods in their own vehicles (&quot;own-account &quot; operators) and that there was no economic justification forthis. It would, however, be unacceptable for a body such as theBritish Transport Commission to have the function of licensing its competitors. Instead she proposed to institute a licensing system which would represent a considerable degree of liberalisation ascompared with the present system. Of the 1,500,000 vehicles subjectto licensing under the present system, her proposals would completelyexempt some 900,000.She proposed that there should be two types of licensing control.The first would be a quality control applying to all vehicles ofunladen weight of 30 cwts. or over, of which there were 600,000.Operators of such vehicles would have to satisfy a number ofstringent tests before they were granted a licence. The tests wouldrelate to the applicants ability to provide adequate maintenancefacilities for his vehicles and to keep proper control over their loadsand the hours worked by their drivers and to the financial resourcesof the applicant, which would have to be commensurate with his proposed scale of operation. The applicant would also have to holda new type of personal licence (a &quot; transport managers &quot; licence)entitling him to manage a transport undertaking? or would have to employ the holder of such a licence in a position of responsibility.When these proposals had been discussed by the ministerial committee on Economic Policy, some doubts had been expressed about the feasibility of assessing an applicants financial resources and prospective business. It had been suggested that it might be preferable for quality licences to be granted automatically on application, butto be subject to revocation in case of subsequent offences againstroad safety provisions or other malpractices. It would, however, be contrary to the Governmenfs general policy on road safety to allowon the roads vehicles which might well be dangerous, on the basis that licences could be revoked only after offences had been committed.She was satisfied that there would be no serious difficulty for the licensing authorities in making a proper assessment of an applicantsfinancial standing.. The inquiries which would be necessary for thispurpose were similar to inquiries about the reliability and efficiency of applicants for licences which were already made under the existing system. She proposed, however, that licensing authorities shouldnot be obliged to make such inquiries in every case: in some cases there would be no need for inquiries and licensing authorities
CONFIDENTIALwould have discretion to omit them. A different approach to qualitylicensing had been suggested by the Transport and General WorkersUnion, who had proposed that no licence should be granted to an applicant who operated less than a specified number of vehicles.This, however, would be too arbitrary. Her proposals would be effective in upholding proper operating standards in the industryand in protecting public safety. They would be welcomed by theindustry and were in line with present practice in a number of countries in the European Economic Community.The second type of control could be described as quantitylicensing. The object here would be to secure the diversion fromroad to rail, and in particular to the new freightliner services, ofall traffic which could be more economically carried in this way.Quantity licensing would apply to vehicles of over 5 tons unladen weight which were engaged either on hauls of 100 miles or on shorterhauls of certain types of bulk cargo such as coal which were especiallysuitable for carriage by rail. A total of 70,000 vehicles would beaffected, of which 30,000 were operated on own-account; thiscontrasted with a total of 180,000 vehicles subject to quantitylicensing under the existing system. Where an operator of vehicles in these categories applied for a quantity licence, the applicationwould be open to objection by railway operators on the ground thatthey could offer a service which was equally satisfactory in terms ofspeed, cost and reliability. A licence would only be granted if theapplicant could satisfy the licensing authority that any such objection was invalid. The British Railways Board estimated that there were some 30 million tons of traffic carried annually on the roads whichwere suitable for diversion to freightliner services. If all this trafficcould be diverted to rail, the railway deficit would be reduced bysome  14 million. The Board estimated that they would be able tosecure about half of this traffic by ordinary promotional methods,but because of the long-standing prejudice against the railways on thepart of many firms, a licensing system would be necessary if theywere to secure the remainder. The controversial feature of theproposals was their&apos; extension to own-account operators. Theseoperators, however, were responsible for about one-third of the trafficsuitable for diversion to rail. If they were excluded from the licensingprovisions, this would lead to an uneconomic increase in the use ofown-account vehicles and to under-use of rail capacity.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion on Thursday, 13th July.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th July, 1967.
