Approach toEuropeVisit to Headsof Governmentof the EuropeanEconomicCommunity(previous reference:CC(67) 3rdConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that the visit which the PrimeMinister and he had just paid to Brussels had shown that the BelgianGovernment, like the Italian Government, wanted to see the UnitedKingdom as a member of the European Economic Community (e.c.)but that they could not be relied on to support us effectively in theevent of strong French opposition. The Belgian Foreign Minister,M. Harmel, though well disposed to us, had of late shown sometendency to promote ideas for the political development of the EECwhich could complicate our position; it was to be hoped that asa result of the discussions these risks had now been reduced. it became increasingly clear with each discussion that the major problem, in the event of our deciding to apply for membership ofthe e.c., might well be the disturbance which our accession wouldinvolve to the various arrangements which the Community had withso much difficulty agreed amongst themselves and therefore to the present intimate relationship and cohesion of the Six. Inthis connection the common agricultural policy had, of course, beena major subject of discussion, and he had again stated that, whilethe policy need not necessarily in itself be an obstacle to our entry,it did raise a number of problems for us of varying degrees whichcould not entirely be solved by means of transitional periods. ThePrime Minister had again dealt with the anxieties which had been expressed about the risks which the sterling balances might entailfor the Community in the event of our entry.The most useful and encouraging part of the visit to Brussels,however, had been the working lunch with the Commission; thePresident, Herr Hallstein, had been absent by reasons of illness,but the atmosphere had been particularly friendly. One of the vice--Presidents, M. Mansholt, had gone out of his way to expressto his fellow Commissioners, on the basis of a carefully documentedcase with detailed figures, how inequitable and indeed absurd it wouldbe to apply the present financial regulations and price levels of thecommon agricultural policy after our accession. He had gone onto say that the Community would have to start thinking in 1968about the re-negotiation of the financial arrangements which was due to take place in 1970, and that it would be important in these discussions to make no firm decisions which would prejudice the entry of the United Kingdom. The Commission had also been askedwhether they regarded the application for membership we had madein 1961 as still valid, or whether we should need to make a newapplication; they had not, however, given thought to this.confidential parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;sstatement.Oversea AffairsIraq(previous reference:CC(67) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4)Sierra LeoneMalta(previous reference:CC (67) 4thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the dispute which he had reported to the Cabinet the previous week over the level of payments by the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPC) to the Governments of Syriaand of Iraq had not developed as seriously as had then been feared.The Iraq Government had not, at least as yet, nationalised thecompany, while the Syrian Government for their part were taking a somewhat less obstructive line. He had seen the representativesof the oil companies which formed the IPC and had urged themto be somewhat more forthcoming in their response to the demandsof the two Governments in question.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs (Mrs. Hart)said that the Prime Minister of Sierra Leone, Sir Albert Margai, had informed our High Commissioner that he feared there might be amilitary coup d&apos;etat in Sierra Leone, but there had been no further developments as yet.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs (Mrs. Hart)said that the position in Malta had been discussed earlier that morningby the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.   It had been agreednot to pursue the suggestion put forward the previous day that inorder to provide a politically acceptable opportunity for the maltese government to withdraw their contention that we were in breach of our obligations under the Defence Agreement, the North atlantic treaty Organisation should be asked to give an opinion on whetherthe proposed reduction of our forces in Malta in any way impairedour ability to defend the Island, and therefore ran counter to our commitment under the Agreement.   While the suggestion offeredsome possible advantage in relation to the immediate situation, ithad certain longer term risks both for the extent of our militaryundertakings in Malta and still more in the precedent it might set,!so enabling other Governments to find means of obstructing the!reduction of our forces in other overseas theatres.   It was, however,necessary to devise some alternative proposal which might enablethe Maltese Government to withdraw from their present position.Otherwise their continued harassment of our forces there might make our early total withdrawal inevitable, with serious consequences both for Malta and for our own interests.   It had therefore been agreedto propose a visit by a small group of prominent industrialists toadvise on the ways in which the development of Malta could more rapidly be pursued, so alleviating the economic consequences of thereduction of our forces.   It had also been arranged that in view ofthe current situation our newly appointed High Commissioner in malta should take up his appointment forthwith.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs.
CC 5 (67)confidential. The Minister of Housing and Local Government recalled that the Cabinet in a previous discussion on housing policy had askedto be informed of the outcome of his discussions with the Chancellorof the Exchequer on means to encourage private house building.Buying and selling private houses was now becoming easier becauseof the flow of funds into the building societies and this wouldstimulate private house building. As for bank credit for housing,the banks were willing and ready to meet all normal demands for credit from credit-worthy customers in the field of house building,including bridging loans for all types of house purchase. Theexisting guidance on priorities for bank lending would be interpreted in this way. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would be makinga Written Answer to that effect on Friday, 3rd February.The Cabinet Took note, with appoval, of the statement by the Ministerof Housing and Local Government.secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First Secretaryof State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 13) andby the Minister of Labour (C (67) 14) on the future of theGovernments policy on prices and incomes.The First Secretary of State said that there were broadly threeissues to be considered: the long-term policy on prices and incomes,the policy to be adopted for the period immediately following July1967; and what should be said in the immediate future in the consultations which he would be having with the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) and the Trades Union Congress (TUC).In framing future policy the main emphasis should be laid onthe achievement of stability in prices: this was both essential to public acceptance of the policy and directly relevant to our economicneeds. The CBI had suggested that reasonable stability could beachieved simply by a return to the voluntary system as it was before july 1966. This would however be inadequate: neither competitionnor pressure from consumers could be relied on to restrain prices and bring about reductions of prices and the extent to which the cbi could influence its members in this matter was limited. It would therefore be necessary for the Government to continue thearrangements for the notification of proposed increases of prices and for the general surveillance of prices and. their reference to theNational Board of Prices and Incomes (NBPI) where appropriate.It would riot be practicable for the Government to supervise thewhole range in detail, but it would be essential to retain controlover selected prices which were of particular economic significance.7862
The question of what statutory powers were necessary to achieve this could best be considered together with the question of statutory powers over incomes.He had considered whether it would be possible to avoid inthe future the concepts of a norm and of criteria for increases in incomes; but it would continue to be necessary for the Governmentto form a view on the total increase in the wage bill that wascompatible with our economic policies and on the relative size of wage increases which could be permitted for various groups. Thisinevitably involved the fixing of a norm and the formulation ofcriteria. The Government should hold consultations periodicallywith the CBI and TUC to seek an agreed norm for wage increaseswherever possible. However, for the twelve months following30th June, 1967, the right course would be to make it clear that allwage increases must be justified by reference to the criteria: therewould thus for this period be a &quot; nil norm &quot;, but there would bea return to the more liberal criteria of the orginal White Paper on prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639). Close consultation withthe CBI and TUC would be necessary, not only for determining the criteria and the norm for each year, but also to deal with particular difficulties in their operation.Once a norm had been fixed and criteria had been formulated,there would be the problem of ensuring that wage settlementsconformed to them. It had been proposed that the Governmentshould seek to ensure this by arranging for officials to attendsignificant wage negotiations, but this was not practicable. Whikit was necessary for the Government to keep in touch with wage negotiations, this should be effected through various types oiconsultation, more or less informal, the exact nature of which mighbe determined in the light of the extensive experience of the minister)of Labour in this field.There was finally the question whether, when Part IV of thePrices and Incomes Act expired in August 1967, the Governmentshould seek further powers.  One possible course would be simply to activate Part II of the Act, which would enable the Governmentto impose a delay on wage settlements or movements of pricespending investigation by the NBPI.   More extensive powers would however be needed.   The TUC on the other hand took the viewthat it should not be assumed beforehand that a purely voluntarypolicy would fail, nor should its failure be made more likely by theintroduction of statutory powers; if a voluntary policy did not Isucceed in securing wage restraint, it would then be necessary for!the Government to introduce deflationary measures, but this would Ibe preferable to an attempt to introduce compulsion into incomesIpolicy.   The objection to accepting the tuc&apos;s argument was thatgwe could not afford to wait and see whether a voluntary policy would succeed.   Because of the implementation of existing agreements for wage increases, together with new settlements which were likely tobe reached during the second half of 1967, it was already likely that the index of hourly wage rates would rise by at least 6 per cent over the whole of 1967.   We would thus be presented with a seriously

The objection to accepting the tuc&apos;s argument was that flwe could not afford to wait and see whether a voluntary policy would  Isucceed.   Because of the implementation of existing agreements for  Iwage increases, together with new settlements which were likely to  Ibe reached during the second half of 1967, it was already likely  Ithat the index of hourly wage rates would rise by at least 6 per cent Iover the whole of 1967.   We would thus be presented with a serious I
threat of inflation soon after the expiry of Part IV and in this situation it would be necessary for the Government to be armed with permanentstatutory powers going beyond those in Part II. These might takevarious forms: it might be desirable to lengthen the maximum period of delay on increases in prices and wages which could be imposed under Part II, to take power to prevent the payment ofretrospective increases of wages after a delay had been imposed, andto direct that the implementation of a particular increase in wages orprices should be phased. It should be recognised that, while powersof this nature might take the form of amendments to Part II, theywould in substance be akin to the present powers in Part IV. the exact nature of extended powers on these lines required further thought.The TUC argued that the policy on prices and incomes shouldbe deliberately used as an instrument of social change, to bring abouta society where incomes depended on work done and where therewas a reasonable relationship between work and rewards. He agreed with this contention to the extent that the policy should be in accord with other policies designed to produce a juster distribution of incomes: but this could only be brought about over a long period and fiscal policies and improved social security provision would bemore important instruments for achieving this than the policy on incomes.The Minister of Labour said that the TUC were to hold aconference of the executives of trade unions on 2nd March to discussfuture policy on prices and incomes. It was essential that theGovernment should clarify their intentions and communicate themto the TUC before that conference. The success of the policyhitherto had been due to the loyalty towards the Government oftrade union leaders, but it was doubtful if we could continue to rely on this for a policy which involved compulsion. There was nodoubt that the TUC would reject any proposals for further statutory powers. If we attempted to take such powers, we would forfeit their co-operation and without this the policy could not be effective. to seek statutory powers to determine wages would place a grave strain on the links between the Government and the trade unions and onthe Governments support in Parliament. It would also be widelyregarded as a breach of faith since repeated assurances had beengiven that the temporary powers of compulsion in Part IV wouldnot be continued; he had himself frequently relied on such assurancesin order to secure the co-operation of the unions in administering the policy so far. The better course would therefore be to activatePart II before the expiry of Part IV, and to explore with the TUCwhether any strengthening of Part II might be acceptable. the incomes policy had already produced remarkable progress towards a situation where the CBI and the TUC could effectively controltheir members; it was particularly significant that the TUC were now inviting constituent unions to surrender some of their autonomyand to vest it in the General Council of the TUC.   It was also
satisfactory that closer co-operation between the CBI and TUC was now developing. This progress should not be put at risk by insisting on further statutory powers.In discussion, there was general agreement that Part IV of theAct should be allowed to lapse in August 1967 and that, if newpowers were to be taken, whether by the activation of Part II orotherwise, these should be operative by then: if a gap were tobe allowed between the expiry of Part IV and the coming into forceof new powers, this would be regarded both at home and abroadas an abdication by the Government of their responsibilities.In considering the extent of those powers, it was argued thatit would be unwise for the Government to go further than theactivation of Part II. There had been strong opposition to thepassage of the present Act even before the addition of Part IV ata later stage of its consideration, and the latter had only beenaccepted because of the economic crisis. There were signs that the cbi and TUC were prepared to develop more effective control over their members and that we might be able to make further progress towards a system of the central determination of wages on the Swedishmodel. Any attempt to take wider statutory powers would prejudicefurther progress in this direction. It would be dangerous to rely on legal provisions to make the policy on prices and incomes effectivesince the sanctions in respect of incomes could not in the last resortbe enforced. As regards prices, the delaying power in Part IIrepresented an effective means of restraint and to seek further powers would put in jeopardy the co-operation of employers which was essential to the continued surveillance of prices on the present basis.The right course therefore was for the Government to activatePart II before the expiry of Part IV, but not to go beyond this.If the policy on this basis could be shown not to be succeeding, theGovernment would then be on stronger ground in introducing new legislation.Against this, it was argued that we could not afford to waitand see whether a policy buttressed only by Part II would succeed.It was already clear that we should be faced by a flood of wage claims after the end of the period of severe restraint. The powers in Part II to delay wage increases for up to four months were inadequate to meet this situation. Moreover, these powers were intended to impose a delay solely for the purpose of facilitatinginvestigation by the NBPI and it would provoke strong oppositionif they were to be used to secure delay for its own sake. In theeconomic crisis of the previous July, the Government had been forcedto take statutory powers at the last moment, but they could not affordon a second occasion to leave remedial action so late. If increases in wages and prices led to another economic crisis, this, apart fromother grave consequences, would again require measures which would entail a restriction of economic growth and further reduce the chances of producing a policy on incomes acceptable to the trade unions.The success of the policy hitherto had been due not only to theco-operation of the unions but even more to the strong support of
public opinion, particularly in measures taken to deal with sectionalinterests, and the effects of the economic measures of the previousJuly. The - possibility that wider statutory powers would not be acceptable to the TUC should not deter the Government from takingthem, and there was more readiness to accept a firm policy in thecountry as a whole than there was on the part of the TUC. TheGovernment were responsible for national solvency and the interestsof the nation as a whole and should take the powers necessaryto carry out that responsibility. It was essential that these shouldbe adequate to prevent minority groups from wrecking the policy,and a simple extension of the period of delay which could be imposedunder Part II would not be sufficient for this purpose. It wouldalso be necessary to take power to prevent retrospective paymentsfollowing the imposition of a period of delay, and possibly to direct that a particular wage increase should be paid only in instalmentsat defined intervals. Similar powers would be needed in relationto prices; these would have the advantage that they would preventemployers from assuming that increases of wages could always be offset by increased prices and would thus stiffen the resistance ofemployers to excessive wage claims. It was suggested that therewould be more chance of the TUC accepting additional statutory powers if the Government could offer in exchange the prospect ofan economic strategy which would ensure steady economic growthover the coming years.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theimmediate issue was the line to be taken in consultation with the cbi and TUC in the immediate future. The Cabinet agreed thatthey should be told that Part IV would be allowed to expire inAugust 1967, that the Government proposed to activate Part II before,or immediately upon, the expiry of Part IV, but that the Governmentbelieved that the powers in Part II were inadequate to ensure thatthe policy on prices and incomes would be effective in meeting thecountry&apos;s economic needs. Powers both wider and different in substance would be needed, on the lines suggested in discussion.It would not however be acceptable if the powers were so extensiveas merely to replace in another form the existing powers in Part IV,since this would expose the Government to a charge of a breach of faith in the light of their commitment not to extend that Partbeyond August. The form which the further powers might takewould therefore require further consideration, but the need for them should be made clear to the CBI and TUC. The First Secretaryof State should explore how far the CBI and TUC could be broughtto acquiesce in the activation of Part II and the taking of furtherstatutory powers on these lines. He should then circulate a paper for consideration by the Cabinet in the following week reporting theresults of his consultations and setting out, in the light of these, his proposals as to the nature and form of the additional powers whichmight be sought. The Cabinet would then be in a position to takea decision on the question of statutory powers and to complete its consideration of the other issues raised in C (67) 13.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the First Secretary of State (i) to proceed in his consultations with the CBI and TUCon the lines indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up of their discussion;(ii) in the light of these consultations, to put proposals to the Cabinet in the following week on the nature and&apos; form of additional statutory powers whichmight be sought.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on C (67) 13 at their meeting in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd February, 1967.
