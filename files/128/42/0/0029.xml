The ThirdLondonAirportDraft white paper(previous reference:CC(67) 20thConclusions,Minute 3)8153SECRET1. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the President of theBoard of Trade and the Minister of Housing and Local Government(C (67) 75) on the third London airport and by the President of theBoard of Trade (C (67) 76) on the possibility of constructing a superairport at Sheppey to replace the Heathrow airport and obviate theneed for further London airports. The Cabinet also had before thema note by the President of the Board of Trade and the Minister of housing and Local Government (C (67) 50) to which was annexed adraft White Paper on the third London airport.The President of the Board of Trade recalled that, in earlierCabinet discussion, doubts had been expressed on the need for a newmajor airport for London in relation to the possibility of developing the existing airports at Heathrow and Gatwick and on the suitability of Stansted as the site for the new airport, in comparison particularly with a site on the Thames estuary. There was a long history ofinquiries into this problem going back to 1962. A public inquiry intothe Stansted site had reported in May 1966. Following this, an interdepartmental working group of officials had conducted a thorough examination of possible alternatives to Stansted and theirreport of November 1966 was appended to C (67) 75. The working group had concluded that the Stansted site was preferable to any ofthe other possibilities. With the Minister of Housing he had subsequently examined these further and they had concluded thatthere was no practicable alternative to Stansted. While it would havebeen desirable to site a new major airport away from the South Eastaltogether, this was not possible since 80 per cent of the passengersusing the existing London airports were travelling to destinations inthis region.Some 15 million passengers annually now used the existingairports and this figure was increasing by about 1^ million each year.Existing facilities at Gatwick provided spare capacity adequate for about one year&apos;s growth in traffic. Extensions to runway facilities at Heathrow and Gatwick could so increase the combined capacityof both airports as to enable them to handle an additional 5 millionpassengers, representing 3-4 years&apos; expected growth in traffic. Theexisting airports could handle a further increase in traffic if measures were taken to spread peaks of traffic and if larger aircraft were introduced. These measures, combined with the extension of runwayfacilities, might postpone the time by which a third airport was neededuntil 1974, or 1976 at the latest. It was accordingly not necessary todecide now to begin construction of a third airport, but it was important to reach a decision on the site without delay in order that negotiations might begin with the airlines on the planning necessaryto effect an eventual transfer of traffic and in order that other urgentconsequential planning decisions relating to this area might now betaken.As regards the choice of site, the most attractive alternative toStansted was a site at Silverstone n ?ar Northampton, but this wouldinvolve the closure of eight military airfields in the Midlands at a cost
of  50-100 million. If a decision could have been taken on Silverstonein the previous decade, military planning could have been adaptedaccordingly;&quot; but Silverstone was not in present circumstances a practicable alternative.The next alternative in order of preference would be a site on the isle of Sheppey. The nature of the terrain would however involveextra construction costs amounting to some  15 million, the closureand re-siting of the firing range at Shoeburyness at a cost of  25million, and heavy investment totalling some  40 million on theimprovement of rail access. The total cost of a third airport atSheppey would be in the region of  130 million, which was  80-90million more than the cost of siting it at Stansted. Even withimproved access, the journey from Sheppey to London would stilltake longer than from Stansted to London. It would also meanrestricting the use of Southend airport, which was now the fourthlargest in the country. It had been urged that the problem of noisewould be considerably less at Sheppey than at Stansted, but this could easily be overstated. While noise from aircraft landing atSheppey would occur over the sea, it was noise from take-off which represented the more acute problem and this would affect populated areas: there was in fact little to choose between Stansted and Sheppeyin this respect. Publicity had recently been given to the idea of constructing a super airport at Sheppey which would both replaceHeathrow and eliminate the need for a fourth airport. This, however,was unlikely to be practicable and would, if practicable, be extremelyexpensive; nor could a project of this size be completed in time to dealwith the overflow of traffic from Heathrow and Gatwick.Consideration had also been given to alternative sites on the thames estuary at Cliffe and Foulness; but at the former there was insufficient room to provide a major airport and there would be difficulties of air traffic control in relation to Heathrow, while a site atFoulness would involve an unacceptably long journey time to Londonand would be likely to cost about twice as much as an airport at stansted for much the same reasons as applied in the case of Sheppey.Further possibilities which had been considered were Padworth(south-west of Reading) and Luton, but the first would involve too much interference with traffic at Heathrow and with military flying,while the nature of the terrain ruled out the second.The Stansted site on the other hand was preferable from the pointof view of air traffic control, would be the cheapest and the nearest toLondon. The noise problem would be no worse than at the alternativesites and in terms of noise level and numbers of people affected wouldbe only one-twentieth of the noise problem at Heathrow.A decision was now needed urgently to enable the local planning authorities, the British Airports Authority, the airlines and transport authorities to proceed with future planning. Moreover, further delay would mean that we should run the risk of losing our lead in civilaviation in Europe to the French. The Government should thereforeannounce a decision to site the third airport at Stansted and should publish a White Paper in the terms of the draft annexed to C (67) 75.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that butfor the additional cost arising from the effect on military airfields, a
site at Silverstone would have been preferable to Stansted, since thelatter would mean the loss of a considerable acreage of good agricultural land and, as it was likely to involve the creation of a newtown with a population of some 100,000 in what was now relativelyunspoilt country, it would be bad regional planning. However, therewas now no practicable alternative to Stansted. It would be important to ensure that planning for a fourth major airport shouldbe put in hand in good time so that the Government would not be similarly circumscribed in choosing a site.In discussion, it was urged that the case against siting a thirdairport anywhere in the South East was very strong and that thesituation did not require an immediate decision by the Government.Technological developments in air transport might radically alterairport requirements over the coming years and developments insurface transport might greatly affect the problems of access to thevarious possible sites. On the other hand, it was argued that all thefacts were now available to the Government and there was nothing tobe gained by further delay: on the contrary, if a decision werepostponed, the local planning authorities and other bodies concerned would be placed in serious difficulty, other urgent developmentswould be delayed and the Government would incur severe criticism.In further discussion, there was general recognition that the effective choice lay between Stansted and Sheppey. It was argued that the case for Sheppey merited further consideration. This wouldbe the most desirable site if the Government were prepared to meetthe extra cost involved. The Sheppey area was on the wholeunattractive country, while the Stansted site was in one of the fewrelatively unspoilt areas within reach of the metropolis. Whiletake-off noise from an airport at Sheppey would affect populated areas, these would be relatively confined: the noise from aircraftlanding was a more serious problem since it affected much wider areas and Sheppey had an important advantage in this respect because it wasa coastal site. While the improvement of rail links to Sheppey wouldbe costly, some development of these links would be required in anycase and the necessary improvements would be valuable not onlyin, relation-to the airport but also in relieving congestion generally in the South East. It was, however, questionable whether a rail linkwas essential: many major airports abroad had only road links.On the other hand, there was wide support for a decision infavour of the Stansted site. An airport at Stansted would by nomeans completely destroy the amenities of the area, provided that theaccompanying housing development was properly planned. The factthat the journey time from Stansted to London would be shorter than for any site on the Thames estuary was of major importance: it waspointless to reduce flying times by the introduction of advanced types of aircraft if surface journeys to and from airports were to becomelonger. If the third airport were sited too far from London, therewas a danger that airlines would increasingly use Continental airports.It would not be possible to avoid the heavy costs of improving rail
links to Sheppey since complete reliance on road links would causeunacceptable congestion.The following main points were also made (a) If it were decided to site the third airport at Stansted, theGovernment should not be committed at this stage to the creation ofa new town in the area to accommodate the additional population.The creation of a new town would mean greater inroads into good agricultural land than the expansion of existing towns such as BishopsStortford and Harlow. On the other hand, it was pointed out that itwould be necessary to accommodate some 100,000 additional people as a result of the siting of the airport at Stansted and it would be essential to avoid unplanned and sporadic housing developments.While it would be desirable to accommodate as many as possible ofthe incoming population by expansion of existing towns, it was unlikely to be possible to absorb the whole number in this way. Thecreation of a new town might therefore be unavoidable, though itwould be desirable to keep it to the minimum size.(b) Planning for a fourth major airport should be put in handin good time in order to avoid a recurrence of the difficulties whichthe Government faced in siting the third airport. It was highly desirable that a fourth airport should be sited away from the SouthEast, and the future growth in the number of incoming air passengerstravelling to destinations in other parts of the country should make this possible. In considering possible sites for a fourth airport, full weight should be given to the implications for regional policy: it waspossible, for example, that major airport facilities could be developedat Swansea; there was also a need to develop more international air services to and from airports in Scotland. The concept of a singlelarge airport at a central site, with feeder services in different partsof the country, might merit consideration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in determining the site for a third London airport, the Governmentfaced a choice of evils. While there were considerable reservations about the choice of Stansted, the Cabinet agreed on balance thatthere was no practicable alternative. The decision to site the thirdairport at Stansted should be announced in Parliament either before or immediately after the Whitsun Recess and a White Paper in theterms of the draft annexed to C (67) 50 should subsequently bepublished. The President of the Board of Trade should consult withthe Lord President on the timing of the announcement and publication.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the third London airport should be sited at stansted.(2) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C (67) 50.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, to arrange foran early announcement of the Government^ decision inParliament and for the subsequent publication of theWhite Paper.

The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary of State(C (67) 77) to which was attached a draft White Paper about publicpurchasing and industrial efficiency.The First Secretary of State said that the draft White Paper hadbeen considered by the National Economic Development Council, the confederation of British Industry and the British National ExportCouncil (BNEC). These consultations had not led to any changes of substance in the Governments proposals, but some editorial changeshad been made to meet their suggestions. Work to implement theproposals in the draft was already in hand and it was highly desirablethat the White Paper should be published before the national productivity Conference and the BNEC Conference on publicpurchasing and exports, both of which would take place before themiddle of June.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper attached to C (67) 77.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, to arrange for its early publication.3. The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had previouslyconsidered the difficulties which might arise if the Select Committeeof the House of Commons on Agriculture pursued its proposal to seekleave of absence from the House in order to visit the european economic Commission. It now seemed probable that this proposal could be averted, since M. Mansholt, Vice-President of theCommission concerned with agricultural matters, would shortly be visiting London and, arrangements might be made for him to meetthe Select Committee as well as Ministers. The Select Committee on science and Technology had, however, now expressed a wish to payvisits to Euratom and to the United States and the Government hadbeen urged on behalf of the Select Committee to put down a Motionseeking leave for the Committee to be absent from the House toenable them to do so. Such a proposal was open to considerableobjection in that the visit to Euratom would imply a wider extensionof the activities of Select Committees than had originally been intendedand because it would, like the earlier proposal of the Select Committeeon Agriculture, risk embarrassing subsequent negotiations in respectof the Governments application to join the European Communities(if the proposal to make such an application were approved byParliament). The visit to the United States was open to objectionbecause of the considerable cost involved.The Lord President said that in pursuance of the Cabinetsconclusions at an earlier meeting (CC (67) 19th Conclusions,Minute 2) he would shortly be seeing the Chairmen of the SpecialistCommittees and of the Select Committee on Nationalised industries to discuss the practice which Ministers proposed to follow in givingevidence before them. It might be appropriate for him to takeadvantage of this meeting to explain the difficulties which would be
involved for the Government by the visits which had been proposed,though it would not be desirable that the Government shoulddiscourage all oversea visits by Select Committees.In discussion it was suggested that there would be advantage in having a separate Vote to meet the cost of Select Committees, bothin respect of their travel overseas and to meet other expenses such asthe appointment of research workers to assist them. This would sparethe Government the invidious task of having to oversee theexpenditure of Select Committees in detail and avoid the possibility that the Government might in doing so appear to discriminate between them. It might also impose a rather more effective constrainton total expenditure. On the other hand, it was pointed out that sucha procedure would not give the Government an effective right to intervene on individual issues where a proposal by the committee might involve embarrassment to the Governmenfs position, such asthat which would have been caused by the visit of the SelectCommittee on Agriculture to Brussels for discussions with theEuropean Economic Commission.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should not put down a Motionseeking leave for the Committee to be absent from the House ofCommons to pay the oversea visits in question. The Lord Presidentin his forthcoming discussion with the Chairmen of the select committees should explain to them the difficulties which theGovernment foresaw in respect of the proposed visits to Brussels andthe United States and should urge the Chairmen to discuss thosedifficulties with the Foreign Secretary in respect of the embarrassmentwhich would be caused to the Governmenfs foreign relations andwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer in respect of the cost involved.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President of the Council to discuss with the chairmen of Select Committees the difficulties arising fromthe visits which had been proposed, on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.Approach to europe(previous reference:CC(67) 27thConclusions)4. The Cabinet considered the attitude which the Governmentshould adopt towards the proposal which had been put forward inthe Parliamentary Labour Party that there should be a free vote onthe Motion to approve the Governmenfs proposal to apply to join the European Communities. There was general agreement that onan issue of policy of such major importance it would be politically and constitutionally inappropriate to allow a free vote.The Cabinet Agreed that a free vote should not be allowed on the votethe following day in the House of Commons on the Motionto approve the Governmenfs proposal to make anapplication to join the European Communities.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th May, 1967.
