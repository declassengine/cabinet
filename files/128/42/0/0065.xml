EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC(67) 64thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Home Secretary suggested that it would be useful forthe Cabinet to have a general discussion in the near future about theeconomic situation.The Prime Minister said that he had in mind to arrange such a discussion shortly and would consult the Chancellor of the Exchequerabout timing.Rhodesia(previous reference:CC(67) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Prime Minister.secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the course of his visit to Africa he had seen eight African Heads of Government inaddition to the South African Foreign Minister, Dr. Muller, andMr. Ian Smith. To the African leaders he had explained that while we maintained our refusal to negotiate a settlement of the Rhodesianproblem at the expense of the African population, we could not contemplate the use of force or an escalation of economic sanctionswhich might lead to economic confrontation between the UnitedKingdom and South Africa. He had on the whole found a realisticunderstanding of our position. But some African leaders still feared that we might be willing to sacrifice the interests of the 4 millionRhodesian Africans. Distrust of our policy was particularly strongin Zambia. In Tanzania he had met President Nyerere and had theimpression that he was actively looking for an opportunity to resumerelations.He had explained to Dr. Muller the strong feelings which hadbeen aroused in the United Kingdom by the despatch of SouthAfrican security forces to Rhodesia. Dr. Muller had indicated that the South African Government would be happy to withdrawthese forces if they had reason to believe that there would be nofurther infiltration of terrorists from Zambia. Dr. Muller had saidthat South Africa regarded it as in her interests to promote asettlement of the Rhodesian problem before the illegal regimedeclared a republic, and would if necessary be ready to bring pressure to bear on the illegal regime to that end; but he had been unwilling togo into further detail.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had spent nearly10 hours in Salisbury with Mr. Smith. As a result it was clear thatthe terms of the proposed constitution were now the main obstacle to a settlement and not the arrangements for a return to legality.The illegal regime wished to make four main changes in theconstitution as provisionally agreed between the Prime Minister andMr. Smith on HMS Tiger: (i) the abolition of cross voting, which inthe opinion of Mr. Smith would add five years to the period before majority rule; (ii) the restriction of African membership of the Senateto Chiefs, which would mean that elected Africans would not beable to command a blocking quarter in the legislature to preventretrogressive amendment of the constitution; (iii) a reduction in the8612
number of &quot;B&quot; Roll seats from 17 to 15 and an increase in thenumber of &quot; A &quot; Roll seats from 33 to 35; and (iv) omission of theright of appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Councilagainst amendments of the constitution.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had made clear toMr. Smith that, far from showing the kind of substantial change thatwould enable us to commend a settlement to Parliament and to theCommonwealth, the effect of these changes was to derogate fromthe agreement reached on HMS Tiger and to aggravate the difficultiesof a settlement. Nevertheless, he had agreed with Mr. Smith that neither would say anything in public to suggest that the talks had broken down. He had therefore been surprised at the attack on theUnited Kingdom Government in Mr. Smith&apos;s speech on 11th Novern-ber. It was a clear breach of their agreement. His general conclusion was that Mr. Smith would like a settlement; that he recognised that sanctions would have the effect of preventingRhodesia&apos;s economic growth; but that he relied on South Africa and portugal to see Rhodesia through her economic difficulties; and thathe was not prepared to accept a settlement which did not providefor indefinite European control. Nevertheless, the commonwealth secretary was not in favour of an immediate announcement of a-break. This would lead to the resignation of the Governor. Weneeded, moreover, to explore further with the South african government how far they were prepared to go in promoting asettlement.In discussion the view was expressed that the constitutional changes proposed by Mr. Smith and his speech on 11th Novemberhad radically transformed the situation and made it impossible forus to continue negotiating with him. There might be advantage inmaking this clear in the statement which the commonwealth secretary was to make in the House of Commons that afternoon. Onthe other hand it was argued that the circumstances in which a breaktook place needed careful thought. We might be open to criticism if we broke off negotiations before it was clear we had explored allalternative possibilities; and it was important that the governor should not resign in circumstances where the responsibility could belaid on us.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that weneeded time to consider our future policy. This should first bediscussed by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee. Theclarification which Mr. Smith had given to the commonwealth secretary of the changes that he wished to see in the &quot; TigerConstitution &quot; meant that he was repudiating points that he had previously accepted. This weakened his position tactically and improved our own, particularly in relation to those in this country who favoured reaching a settlement with the illegal regime, since mr. Smith was pressing for a constitution for Rhodesia inconsistent with the principles established by successive British Governments.In his forthcoming statement in the House of Commons theCommonwealth Secretary should make it clear that Mr. Smith hadretreated from the Tiger constitutional arrangements; he should not,SFCRFT
however, finally close the door to further exchanges but should takethe line that we were now considering all aspects of our policy towards Rhodesia in the light of the new situation.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary in making his statement in the House of Commons to be guided by thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion.TransportPolicyThe Transportof Freight:Draft white paper(previous reference :CC(67) 64thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Minister of Transport (C (67) 174) to which was annexed adraft White Paper on the Transport of Freight.The Minister of Transport recalled that on 9th November theCabinet had broken off their consideration of the draft White paper in order to enable outstanding points to be resolved between departments. This had now been done. She wished to propose asmall number of amendments, of which those arising out of thediscussions since the Cabinefs previous meeting were acceptable tothe Ministers concerned. The points which had been raised by theMinistry of Agriculture did not affect the drafting of the White paper or the Transport Bill, but related to the provisions of subordinate legislation under the Bill.In discussion of the draft White Paper certain drafting amendments were approved and the following principal points weremade:(a) It would be desirable to expand the reference at the.end ofparagraph 67 to charges which other European countries proposedto apply to the use of heavier goods vehicles. This might possibly be done by inserting a separate paragraph which would incorporate the substance of the present Appendix 3 to the draft. There should then be a new Appendix 3 giving fuller details of developments on road haulage charges in European countries. The wording of thenew material should be agreed with the Treasury.(b) At the end of paragraph 71, there should be added the words&quot; and accepts the principle that competition between coastal shipping and the railways must be fair &quot;.(c) The last two sentences in paragraph 78 should be deletedand the following substituted:&quot; It is the Governmenfs intention that the greater efficiency in the provision of freight services which will flow from thecreation of the NFC should enable resources to be madeavailable for, among other things, such improvements in staffconditions, including progress at a reasonable rate towardscommon conditions of service for those on comparable work within the new organisation.&quot;
(d) The Secretary of State for Scotland should be consulted, inview of his special responsibility, on appointments due to be madeshortly in the nationalised transport industry.In further discussion, the Secretary of State for Scotland said thathe was concerned about the effect of the proposed wear-and-tearcharge on heavy lorries on the remoter parts of Scotland, for example the Highlands and Islands, which were especially dependent on road transport and had no alternative rail facilities. It was undesirable to place an additional burden on transport costs in those areas. Itwould considerably ease the position if the charge were to be confined to goods vehicles of over 5 tons unladen weight, instead of over 3 tons as proposed in the draft White Paper.It was pointed out, however, that the proposal for a wear-and-tear charge on heavy lorries followed from a decision taken by theCabinet in the course of their review of public expenditure earlier in the year. If the charge were confined to goods vehicles of over  tons, it would fall on only some 100,000 vehicles as compared with350,000 if it applied to all vehicles over 3 tons; in thesecircumstances if the charge were to produce the amount of revenueenvisaged in the review of public expenditure, the rate would haveto be raised to an unacceptable level and this would be particularlydamaging to industry in Scotland, which depended heavily on long distance road haulage. There was general agreement that it wouldnot be practicable to introduce different rates of charge in respect ofdifferent areas, and that the charge should be applied to all goods vehicles of over 3 tons unladen weight as proposed in the draft white paper. However, the charge might have disproportionate effects onthe cost of living in remote areas which were especially dependent on road transport. A full assessment of its effects on such areas was needed, in the light of which consideration should be given tomitigating its impact on the cost of living in those areas by other measures of regional policy; an increase in the amount of subsidy to shipping services in the Scottish Islands was one possibility.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the draft White Paper subject to the amendmentsagreed in discussion and any further drafting amendments whichthe Minister of Transport might think desirable. The Minister ofTransport should now arrange, in consultation with the lord president, for the publication of the White Paper either in the present week or the week beginning 20th November. While the proposal in the White Paper for the wear-and-tear charge on road vehiclesshould stand, further consideration should be given to measures to mitigate its impact on certain areas, on the lines proposed in discussion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theLord President, to arrange for early publication of theWhite Paper on Transport of Freight, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.
&quot;7   438CC 65 (67)(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toarrange for the Ministerial Committee on EnvironmentalPlanning to consider what measures might be taken to mitigate the impact of the proposed wear-and-tear charge on heavy goods vehicles in areas especially dependent on road transport, taking account of the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th November, 1967.
