IndustrialDisputesDocks(previous reference:CC (67) 62ndConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Minister of Labour said that there were disturbingfeatures about the situation in the London docks, and there was some risk that the strike there might spread. He had seenrepresentatives of the port employers&apos; organisation, who were anxiouslest they should not be able to restrain some of their members who wished- to dismiss men on unofficial strike. The employers had sent a letter to each docker individually explaining the issues in dispute,but this might well not be effective in securing a return to work, andif on Monday the men did not return and some were dismissed therewas an undoubted risk that the strike would spread. There was also some restiveness among employers who were employing men, forexample lightermen, for whom there was no work, and he had been warned that if they ceased to do so the lightermen&apos;s union mightdeclare an official strike. Meanwhile the Transport and general works&apos; Union had revived their claim for  17 a week fall-back pay for dockers in London. If this claim were conceded there would becorresponding demands from other ports, with grave consequences tothe prices and incomes policy. If, however, it were not conceded therewas a possibility that the Transport and General Workers&apos; union would call an official strike in an attempt to regain the Union&apos;authority with the men. He would keep the situation under review,but for the present there did not appear to be any action which hecould usefully take.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.Oversea AffairsNigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Minister of Stale for Commonwealth Affairs said thatthe talks in. London between representatives of the federal government of Nigeria and of the Eastern Region under the auspices of the Commonwealth Secretariat had run into difficulties. TheFederal representatives had returned to Lagos. The Eastern Regionrepresentatives had gone to Paris. The Commonwealth Secretariatwere continuing their efforts to bring the two sides together; but itwas doubtful whether there could be another meeting before thefollowing week. The Federal Government had agreed to accept in mid-November the visit of a consultative mission of African Headsof State appointed by the Organisation of African Unity in September.Meanwhile, arrangements were being made for emergency action to restore the flow of oil as soon as the oilfields and the installationscame into the hands of the Federal Government.CONFIDENTIAL 3CC 63 (67)confidential parliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of State for commonwealth Affairs.SECRETMiddle East 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignResumption of Secretary (C (67) 172) on the resumption of diplomatic relations withthe United Arab Republic (UAR).diplomatic relations withthe United arab republic(previous reference:CC (67) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)The Foreign Secretary said that the United Arab Republic was still the most influential Arab State and was certain to remain so.She could now be counted among the moderates. Her attitude wouldbe crucial to a satisfactory Middle East settlement and to there opening of the Suez Canal. It was therefore in our interests to resume diplomatic relations so that we could exert influence there.On 21st October Sir Harold Beeley had been able to reach agreementwith President Nasser that diplomatic relations at Ambassadoriallevel should be restored in the first half of December. The UAR had made no attempt to extract concessions from us; and there was noquestion of our offering aid. Although it would probably be difficult,in view of the UAR&apos;s economic situation, to secure the repayment ofthe UAR&apos;s existing debts to us, it should be possible at least to resume normal trading on the basis that the UAR&apos;s net indebtednessto us was not increased. The UAR Government seemed anxiousto improve relations. They had already agreed to the resumptionof overflights by British aircraft to Aden; and they seemed to beusing their influence to persuade the two South Arabian nationalistgroups, the National Liberation Front and the Front for the liberation of Occupied South Yemen, to reach agreement on the formation ofa government for South Arabia. The resumption of diplomatic relations would not be opposed by Israel. This had been indicated by the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Eban, and also more recentlyby the Israeli Defence Minister, General Dayan, in a Press conferenceat which he had said that an improvement in relations between ourselves and Egypt would be helpful for Israel too. It was proposedtherefore that we should resume diplomatic relations with the UARearly in December.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals. Attention was drawn to the possibility thatthe UAR&apos;s current oil shortage might be exploited to persuade her to reopen the Suez Canal. As a result of the recent Israelbombardment of the oil refinery at Suez the UAR had lost 75 percent of her total oil supplies and was left with only four weeks&apos;stocks. The UAR had proposed that Egyptian crude oil should beprocessed in the Aden refinery and the products brought by tankerto the UAR. British Petroleum and Shell were now negotiating withthe UAR to supply oil on a commercial basis. A Mobil Oil Companytanker of British registration had recently carried oil to Alexandria.This was the first breach in the ban on British ships entering UARports. There was an international demand, in which even the Soviet
Union seemed to share, for the reopening of the Canal. It was argued that even if the Canal were reopened, Israel might obstructshipping unless Israeli ships were allowed to pass through. The UARmight nevertheless be wise to reopen the Canal and leave Israel, if she wished, to take the blame for stopping ships. There were alreadyindications that the UAR were beginning to think about the problems involved in the reopening of the Canal and that the work of clearing the Canal, once started, would now take a matter of weeks and notmonths. Nevertheless, the UAR probably still hoped to use thecontinued closure of the Canal as a means of securing an acceptableMiddle East settlement in the United Nations. There was now areasonable prospect that agreement might be reached in the next week or so in New York on a balanced resolution providing for Israeliwithdrawal from occupied territory, for recognition by the Arab Statesof israels right to exist, and for the appointment of a representativeof the Secretary-General of the United Nations to go to the middle east. Once such a resolution had been passed and negotiationsstarted between the two sides through the medium of the Secretary-General&apos;s representative, the first practical steps might be expectedto be the withdrawal of Israeli forces from the Suez Canal and there opening of the Canal. If things went well, it was not impossible that the Canal might be reopened early in the new year. Even if no agreement were reached in the United Nations, the UAR&apos;s own economic difficulties might still oblige her to reopen the Canal.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The UAR&apos;s proposal to use the Aden refinery would give heran interest in working for an early settlement and the establishmentof a stable regime in South Arabia.(b) A test of the UAR&apos;s intentions would be whether Cairo Radiocontinued to attack us and especially our position in the persian gulf. The UAR authorities had denied that attacks on us were continuing: but Cairo broadcasts were being monitored so that appropriate representations could if necessary be made.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal to resume fulldiplomatic relations with the UAR in the first half of December.It was important to continue our efforts to secure the early reopening of the Suez Canal. The UAR&apos;s urgent need for oil supplies and thecurrent negotiations with British Petroleum and Shell might afford an opening which could be exploited to this end. The proposal touse the Aden refinery could also be used to engage UAR interest inthe future stability of South Arabia.The Cabinet-Approved C (67) 172.SECRET8509 a 3
CONFIDENTIALLegislation 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordAge of Majority chancellor (C (67) 164) on the age of majority.The Lord Chancellor said that the Committee on the Age of majority, under the chairmanship of Mr. Justice Latey, had, withhis approval, dealt with most of the branches of the law which madespecial provision in regard to persons under 21, apart from the criminal law, and the franchise, which was under consideration bythe Speaker&apos;s Conference, and the related question of jury service.On the question whether the age of full legal capacity should bereduced below 21, the Latey Committee were divided. The majorityrecommended the reduction to 18 for all purposes: a minority oftwo recommended that the requirement of parental consent tomarriage and the wardship jurisdiction of the Chancery division should continue to 21, and that people under that age should beable to claim relief from harsh or oppressive contracts to which theyhad become parties. There was unanimous agreement that peopleover 18 should be able to acquire a legal estate in land and to dispose of their property by will, and on a number of minor recommendations,particularly in regard to minors under 18. The recommendations ofthe majority were based on evidence from a number of bodies,including the British Medical Association and the Chancery judges,that young people now matured earlier both physically andintellectually, that the large majority of them were capable of managing their own affairs at 18, and that it could be harmful to withhold responsibility from people who were fit to bear it. TheHome Affairs Committee had agreed with the recommendations ofthe majority of the Latey Committee, but had suggested that it wouldbe useful to arrange for the Report to be debated in Parliament, anda debate had been arranged in the House of Lords on 22ndNovember. The Government would be expected to state their views in that debate, and he did not think that to do so would prejudge the question of the voting age on which the Speakers conference was expected to report before long. There were a number of minorissues arising out of the Latey Report which he proposed to ask theLaw Commission to consider, and others which could be moreconveniently considered in the context of legislation on guardianship,children, and the powers of the magistrates&apos; courts. Proposals on boyentrants to the Armed Forces, and the fiscal aspects of the Report,were still under consideration, but, subject to this, he proposed thatthe necessary legislative provisions to implement the Latey report should be included in a Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) Billto be introduced in the current Session.The First Secretary of State said that the Home AffairsCommittee had taken the view that the proposals ought to besubmitted to the Cabinet, since, if the age of full legal capacity were reduced to 18, it would be difficult to resist the conclusion that the voting age should be similarly reduced. The Committee had beenunanimously in favour of accepting the recommendations of themajority of the Latey Committee on the age of consent to marriage and on wardship, but had discussed at some length the question
whether people of 18 were sufficiently experienced to resist pressure to enter into oppressive contracts. They had concluded that this type of experience was not necessarily acquired by the age of 21and that the appropriate way of dealing with the problem was toimprove the protection of consumers generally.In discussion it was suggested that there was force in thearguments advanced by the minority of the Latey Committee againstreducing the age at which young people could marry without parentalconsent. In Scotland, where parental consent to marriage was unnecessary, the divorce rate among young people was substantially higher than in England and Wales. The instability of teenagemarriages might be increased when the school leaving age was put upin 1970. Whereas 30 years ago young people had had seven yearsof adult life after leaving school before they were considered fit to contract a marriage without parental consent, reduction of the age to 18 combined with the raising of the school leaving age would reduce this interval to two years, which was not long enough todevelop the experience necessary before entering into a lifelongmarriage. It was argued, on the other hand, that it was not clear that where consent to early marriage was at present refused theconsequences for those concerned were any better than if they hadbeen allowed to marry. Public opinion was strongly in favour ofaccording more rights to the young, and experience in Scotland didnot suggest that a general lowering of the age of legal capacity to 18would have harmful effects.There was support for the view that, whatever the merits of theLatey Committee&apos;s proposals, to accept them could not avoidprejudging the question of the appropriate age for the franchise. Itwould be preferable to delay a decision until the Report had beendebated in the House of Commons, and there was reason to think thatthe Speakers Conference would welcome an opportunity to considerthe views of the House on the Report before reaching their ownconclusions on the age of voting. A debate might be arranged on a motion to take note of the Report, and the Government spokesmancould say that while the Government were sympathetic to theproposals of the majority of the Latey Committee they would wishto consider the views of the House before coming to a decision. Thequestion of the voting age was a separate issue on which it would be useful for the Cabinet to consider a memorandum in due course.In further discussion the following principal points were made:(a) It would be relevant, in considering the voting age, to remember that, since, in accordance with the recommendations ofthe Committee on Jury Service (the Morris Committee), eligibility forjury service was to be related to that for the franchise, a reductionin the voting age would automatically produce a further reduction inthe average age of juries which would already have been reduced bythe abandonment of the householder qualification.
(b) Under income tax law if a parent settled money on a minorthe income was treated as the income of the parent. Consequentlylowering the age of majority could involve a substantial loss ofrevenue. It might be possible to offset the loss to some extent by areduction in child tax allowances, but the problem would need furtherconsideration.(c) A reduction in the age of majority might also have unfortunate consequences for the Government^ policy on prices and incomes, since there might well be pressure for the payment of adultwages to youths of 18, or at least to those who had completed theirapprenticeship. A large number of wage agreements would beaffected and it had not been possible to estimate the potential increasein the wages bill, but it might be of the order of  100 million a year.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were, on balance, in favour of the. proposals of the majorityof the Latey Committee, but that they should reach final decision inthe light of debates in both Houses of Parliament and of furtherconsideration of the voting age and of possible repercussions on thewages of young people under 21. Both these matters should be examined by the Home Affairs Committee before they were brought back to the Cabinet. In the meantime the Government spokesmenin the debates should say that the Government were broadly in sympathy with the recommendations of the majority of the LateyCommittee, and indicate that the Government would wish to hear the views of Parliament, particularly on the detailed recommendations,before reaching their own decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President (i) in consultation with the Chief Whip, to arrange a debate in the House of Commons on a Motion totake note of the Report of the Committee on theAge of Majority;(ii) to bring before the Home Affairs Committee amemorandum on the age of voting.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Minister of Labour, to bring before the Home AffairsCommittee a memorandum on the probable effect, in thelight of experience in Scotland, of a reduction in the ageof majority on the wages of young persons between 18and 21.(3) Agreed that the Government spokesmen in the debates on theReport of the Committee on the Age of Majority should adopt the position indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.
ParliamentBroadcasting ofParliamentaryBusiness:Experiment inClosed CircuitRadio(previous reference:CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C (67) 171) proposing an experiment in the broadcastingof Parliamentary business on closed circuit radio.The Lord President recalled that in the previous Session theHouse of Commons had rejected by a single vote the proposal fora combined experiment in radio and television coverage of House ofCommons debates which had been recommended by the SelectCommittee and approved by the Cabinet. The rewiring of themicrophone system in the House of Commons for the purposes of theofficial reporters now provided an opportunity for reopening theissue and for proposing an experiment in closed circuit sound radio.He proposed that the experiment should take the form of broadcasting the proceedings of the House to a number of points where Members,but not the public, could listen to them. The BBC would supply asmall staff which would prepare experimental national and regionalprogrammes, including a version of &quot; To-day in Parliament&quot; withlive extracts from speeches. These experimental programmes wouldbe played back each night in rooms where Members could listen tothem, but they would not be available to the general public. after a fortnight or three weeks the House might be asked to decide whetherthe service should be made permanent and available to the public.The BBC had, however, made it clear to him that they would need to conduct a technical test of the existing microphone installations in the House before they could be sure that these installations would produce a realistic representation of a live broadcast. They had also told him that, whatever might be done for experimental purposes,they would not favour transforming &quot;To-day in Parliament&quot; intoa programme consisting mainly of recorded extracts, and that it waspossible that they might create another programme on Radio 3 whichwould contain recorded extracts. Further the BBC themselves would hope to be allowed to appraise the results of the experiment before final decisions were taken. The Opposition parties would supportan experiment on the lines proposed. A decision about televisingthe proceedings of the House could be taken at leisure and in thelight of the experiment that would be conducted in the House ofLords in February 1968.In discussion the following main points were made:(a) If the arrangements for broadcasting the proceedings live ona closed circuit were continued after the experiment, there might be advantage in enabling members of the public who were waiting for admission to the Public Gallery to listen in. It was pointed out,however, that there was at present no room that could be madeavailable for this purpose.(h) It would be necessary before proceedings of the House couldbe publicly broadcast, to consider the problems of law and parliamentary privilege which might arise. The Select committees of the House of Lords and of the House of Commons which had considered the question of broadcasting and televising proceedings
CONFIDENTIALof Parliament, had both drawn attention to the unsatisfactory stateof the law in this respect. It was desirable that the matter should bereferred for early consideration by a Joint Select Committee so thatif the House decided that proceedings should be broadcast the decision could be implemented with the minimum of delay.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer should be consulted at anearly stage if there were any question of the cost of the service falling on the House of Commons vote.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, subjectto confirmation by the BBC that the proposed experiment wastechnically feasible, and to the point made at (c) of their discussion,the Cabinet approved C (67) 171. It should further be proposed toParliament that a Joint Select Committee should be set up to considerthe questions of law and privilege which would arise from broadcasting the proceedings of the House.The Cabinet (1) Subject to confirmation by the BBC of the technical feasibility of the proposed experiment and to the point made at (c)of their discussion, approved C (67) 171.(2) Invited the Lord President, in consultation with the LordChancellor and the Lord Privy Seal, to propose theappointment of a Joint Select Committee to considerthe questions of law and privilege that would arise frombroadcasting the proceedings of Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd November, 1967.
