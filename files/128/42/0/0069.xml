Cabinet(previous reference:CC (67) 58thConclusions,Minute 1)Tribute toMr. JamesCallaghanCC 69 (67)confidential. The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to payable warm tribute to Mr. James Callaghan for the services which hehad rendered as Chancellor of the Exchequer. For more than threeyears he had carried the heavy burden of that office with dignity and distinction. They extended their good wishes to him in hisnew office as Home Secretary, and to Mr. Roy Jenkins in that of chancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet Concurred in the Prime Minister^ tribute.ParliamentDevaluation(previous reference:CC (67) 68thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that Ministers who had public speakingengagements for the week-end were likely to be questioned on thestatement in that morning&apos;s Guardian about conditions attached tothe loan obtained from the International Monetary Fund (IMF);and it would be desirable to give them some guidance.The Home Secretary said that the statement of the policy and intentions of the Government, which, as Chancellor of theExchequer, he had sent to the IMF in support of our applicationfor a standby loan, had said that so far as could be seen at presentthe Governments internal borrowing was unlikely to exceed 1,000 million. The particulars given to the IMF of the measureswhich the Government proposed to take had already been disclosed to the House of Commons in his statement of 20th November. Thepublic did not, however, appreciate the extent to which any countryapplying for a standby loan was subject to scrutiny by the IMF, andit might help to procure a clearer understanding of the situation ifthe communication to the IMF were published.In discussion it was pointed out that the statement to the IMFset out no more than an estimate of the extent of the restrictions which the Government would need to apply in any event. It wasnot a binding document, and it would be open to them, if circumstances or policy changed, to discuss the situation further withthe IMF. It would not be desirable, however, to indicate thispublicly.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be useful if the Chancellor of the Exchequer made a brief statement to the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party in thefollowing week, and that consideration should be given to thepublication of the statement of intentions sent to the IMF. In themeantime an appropriate addition should be made to the brief ondevaluation provided for Ministers.
The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer (i) to arrange for an addition to be made to the brief ondevaluation provided for Ministers to enable them to dealwith questions about conditions attached to the loan fromthe International Monetary Fund;(ii) to consider the desirability of publishing the text of thestatement of the policy and intentions of the Governmentsent to the International Monetary Fund in support ofthe application for a loan.secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that Turkey and Greecehad been on the brink of war several times in the last week. Thelatest news was however encouraging. President Johnson&apos;s special representative, Mr. Cyrus Vance, had succeeded in obtaining theagreement of the Turkish and Greek Governments to the terms ofa settlement to which he had then sought the agreement of the cyprus Government. The Prime Minister had sent a message to president Makarios urging him to accept the proposals andMr. Vance had now left Cyprus for the United States satisfied withthe agreement he had reached. Its precise terms were not yet known.The Foreign Secretary said that the withdrawal of our forces from Aden had been successfully completed on 29th November. Onthe same day the Minister without Portfolio, Lord Shackleton, had concluded in Geneva an agreement with the National LiberationFront on the transfer of sovereignty. In this agreement we had undertaken to continue negotiations on the subject of aid after theindependence of the new State of the People&apos;s Republic of southern yemen and meanwhile to provide financial assistance for a periodof six months at the rate agreed with the former federal government of South Arabia. Together with outstanding militaryorders this would amount to  12 million, for the six months. Thisarrangement had been necessary in order to avoid a breakdown ofthe negotiations in Geneva before our forces had withdrawn from south Arabia and also to safeguard our considerable commercial interests, including the Aden Refinery with its earnings of between 5 million and  10 million a year.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the commonwealth secretary and the Foreign Secretary.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Foreign Affairs (C (67) 187) on the Approach to Europe.The Foreign Secretary said that in his memorandum setting outthe alternative courses which the Government might pursue in thesituation following the statements by the French President (President
CC 69 (67)de Gaulle) at his Press conference on Monday, 27th November, hehad not sought to examine the position which would arise if theconsideration in December by the Ministerial Council of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.) of our application resultedin the imposition of another French veto. It would be premature to reach conclusions about this latter situation until the results ofthe eec&apos;s consideration of our application were known. Meantime,the tactical handling of the immediate situation following the french president^ Press conference was important, and the second paragraph of his memorandum set out the four alternative courses open to the Government. His own choice was the second of these alternatives, namely to urge the Five, in consultations with theirrepresentatives prior to the meeting of the Ministerial Council ofthe e.c. on 18th-19th December, to insist on fixing a date in Januaryfor the opening of negotiations, and so to force an issue with theFrench either at that meeting or at a further meeting early in January,Despite what the French President had said at his Press conference,it would be a mistake to take it for granted that the French were infact prepared formally to veto the opening of negotiations with uson our application for membership of the e.c.; and it was important for us to see that this uncertainty was resolved, and for two main reasons.First, to hold firm the position of the Five who had all beenscandalised, but in varying degrees, by the French President^statements at his Press conference.  The Italian Minister for Tradeand Commerce (Signor Colombo) was particularly incensed, and had attended the meeting of Benelux Ministers on this question theprevious day to ensure that a sufficiently firm line was taken; andwas following through with a similar visit to Bonn. It was clear that signor Colombo recognised that whilst he did not of course wantan open conflict with the French in December, the line he felt it essential to pursue would in fact involve precisely, that. The meetingof the Benelux Ministers had issued a firm statement recordingtheir view that negotiations with Britain on our application for membership of the Community should start without delay.   TheForeign Minister of Luxembourg, M. Gregoire, would be visitingLondon the following day, 1st December, and the Foreign Ministerof the Netherlands, M. Luns, in the early part of next week. Therewould also be an opportunity for him to consult privately with theForeign Ministers of the Five at the meeting of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO) in the following week.   In these consultations he would need not so much to urge the Five to attack the French position, but to ensure that the Five were themselvesunder no illusion that we were wavering in our application, or were pressing it less vigorously than they were prepared to do. Whilst theGerman Federal Government was as incensed with the attitude of theFrench as its partners, their stance was less firm because of thedifference of views between the Federal Chancellor, Herr Kiesinger,and his Foreign Minister, Herr Brandt: the latter however had issued
a firm statement in Bonn the previous day, 29th November, favouringimmediate negotiation between Britain and the Community. If wewere in any way to let the Five feel that we were prepared to toleratemuch further delay, in answering our application, the waverersamongst them would be encouraged to seek alternatives to earlynegotiations for full membership, and notably to explore thepossibilities of associate membership, although it was clear fromthe French Presidents Press conference that no such alternative hadbeen formulated. It was therefore in his view essential that we shouldconvince the Five that we stood firmly by our application and soughtimmediate negotiations on it, and would wish them at the meetingof the e.c. Ministerial Council to press this issue to a decision.The second reason for maintaining strong support of our application was the political situation at home. In response tostatements as hostile and as malicious as those made about Britainby the French President at his Press conference, it was essential forthe credibility and the standing of the Government to insist on our right under the Treaty of Rome to early negotiations for full membership. The longer uncertainty as to the fate of our applicationpersisted, the greater would be the damage to the standing of theGovernment; and if the delay persisted for some months, the supportof our friends abroad and public opinion at home would be lost.The Cabinet should however know that the President of the Boardof Trade, who could not be present because he was representingHer Majesty&apos;s Government at the Ministerial meeting of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD)in Paris, did not wholly share his views. The President felt that weshould say to the Five that we hoped that they would be able to settleour application at their meeting in December, but that we should not press them to do so if they felt this unwise; and that in general weshould not press the Five to courses involving extreme conflict withthe French and possible disruption of the Community. He himselfhowever considered that it was important to resolve the uncertaintiessurrounding our application for membership at an early date, andthat in so doing we should not in any way prejudice our position indeed it was clear that we could not let these uncertainties persistindefinitely, possibly until the French President had left the scene.Public opinion would expect the Government to insist on an earlyclarification of the position, and subject to the outcome of the consultations he would be holding with the Five, we should pressthem to insist that a decision about negotiations on our applicationfor full membership should be made by the e.c. as a whole not later than the early part of January.The Secretary of State for Defence said that while he strongly supported the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal to proceed as outlined in paragraph 2(b) of the memorandum in order to force the issueat an early date, we should recognise that this course was not withoutits risks. The biggest risk perhaps was that, although president de Gaulle clearly wished to finish the matter now, we could not besure that he would not be pressed into agreeing to start some sort
of negotiations in January which might either drag on interminablyor end eventually in a veto: we must not lay ourselves open to a third humiliation of this kind. It was imperative therefore that weshould make clear to the Five not only that we wished negotiations to start early in the new year but also that any such negotiations mustoffer the prospect of a satisfactory conclusion in a reasonable spaceof time. Meanwhile, we should prepare for the situation whichwould face us in January if it were then clear that there would beno negotiations. He himself doubted whether there were viablealternative international groupings we might join other than the eec, though the possibilities of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area(NAFTA) might perhaps merit further consideration. However therewere three contingency studies which were now urgently required inthe light of the probability that membership of the e.c. would notbe open to us for some considerable time:(i) An examination of the extent to which we would be freeover say the next three years to change our policies political, economic and military to our own advantage,where hitherto we had been inhibited by the need to avoiddisturbing France and other members of the Community.(ii) An examination, in a sense somewhat contrary to that proposed an (i) above, of areas such as technology where, despite exclusion from the Community, we might still find it advantageous to act in ways which would maintain and develop good relations with the Five or withthe Community as a whole.(iii) An examination of alternative forms of wider relationships between  Western  European  States  other than  theextension of membership of the e.c. to individual countries of EFTA; including inter alia the possibility ofa collective relationship between EFTA and the e.c. suchas had been considered earlier.He said that the results of the studies he had proposed above shouldbe ready in good time for the Government to decide its attitude andfuture policy if it became clear early in the new year that there wouldbe no negotiations.In discussion there was agreement with the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal that an early termination of the uncertainty of our position vis-a-vis the e.c. must be sought, on the lines of paragraph 2 (b) ofC (67) 187. The following points were made:(a) There were many reasons for ending the present uncertainty as soon as possible. Industry needed to know whether or not to plan on the basis of our exclusion from the Community for some years atleast. Our EFTA partners needed to know where they stood: andwe needed to consider as a matter of urgency both the future of efta itself and of relations between EFTA and the e.c.. Australiaand other Commonwealth countries, whose preferences were sovaluable to us, should also know the position as soon as possible.Unless   the   present   uncertainty  were   removed   by   prompt
confrontation on the lines proposed by the Foreign Secretary weshould lose some of the new export opportunities which had nowbeen provided by devaluation. If we were to be excluded, theGovernment and industry must be in a position as soon as possibleto adapt their industrial policies and export plans accordingly.(b) It was suggested that there might be some advantage in accepting President de Gaulle&apos;s declaration at his Press conferencethis week for what it was-a veto rather than press on withprocedures under the Treaty of Rome which would lead us nowhere.There were dangers in continuing with what appeared to the british public to be a humiliating exercise. On the other hand, it was urgedthat our friends among the Five would regard such a capitulation atthis juncture as a betrayal which would destroy our standing inEurope for some time to come. Moreover it would amount to a recognition by the United Kingdom that President de Gaulle had theright to speak for the Community as a whole and it would alsoshake the conviction of the Five, which had only recently fully developed, that our enthusiasm for Europe was genuine. We should therefore encourage the Five to bring the issue to a head as soon aspossible, on the lines recommended by the Foreign Secretary,although we should recognise that there would be dangers in pushingthe Five to such a confrontation if, as seemed most unlikely atpresent, they were disinclined for it. It was suggested that there hadnot been the same emotional reaction at home to the PresidentsPress conference on this occasion as had occurred in 1963 and thiswas in part due to the Governmenfs careful conduct of the approach to Europe; it was no humiliation to demand our rights, as we nowproposed to do under Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome.(c) It seemed most unlikely that France would pursue heranti-American and other belligerent policies to a point where theUnited States Government would seriously consider groupings suchas the North American Free Trade Area or the Five would considerbreaking up the Community, though they might well go far to delay and inhibit its development. Thus the United Kingdom could not reasonably expect to forge links with either Europe or the UnitedStates for some time. Although it still remained the case that weshould in the long term be better off within than outside theCommunity, nevertheless we now had competitive advantages, as aresult of devaluation, which we should use to the full. our immediate aim should be to look to our own interests. No onehowever could now foresee the consequences of President de Gaulle&apos;recent actions for the future of the Community or indeed on world affairs generally: they might be far-reaching.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the proposals contained in paragraph 2(b) ofthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum. While there should be nopetulance, we no longer needed to trim our policies and declarationsto avoid giving grounds for offence to President de Gaulle. TheFrench President himself had imposed heavy additional strains onthe Community by his recent threat to devalue the French franc in
transport policy(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 5)PassengerTransportand Traffic:Draft WhitePaperSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (67) 185) to which was attached a draft White paper on Passenger Transport and Traffic.The Minister of Transport said that the policies set out in thedraft White Paper had been approved by the appropriate ministerial committees. The main features of these policies were theestablishment of Passenger Transport Authorities (PTAs) to beresponsible for planning, and in part providing, the public transportline with the sterling devaluation; by raising the gold scare and bypursuing even more blatantly anti-American policies; and byrequesting authority to impose unilateral import quotas on importsof domestic electrical appliances from Italy.So far as our own application for membership was concerned,the French President had blatantly abused the unanimity rule withthe purpose of causing the Community to act in breach of their obligations, under Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome, to negotiate with any European State applying to join. The Dutch and otherGovernments in the Community might now reasonably take the stand that as the French Government had abused the unanimity ruleto make Article 237 inoperative, they proposed to do the same, forexample in relation to the re-negotiation of the agricultural financeprovisions, which were due in 1969 and also required unanimous agreement, unless the British were by then admitted. While theFrench President would not change his opinions it was notinconceivable that he might be brought to realise that his obstructionof the will of the rest of the Community would not pay. Meanwhile,it was refreshing to find that the Italian and Benelux governments had reacted most robustly, although the Federal GermanGovernment and particularly the Chancellor, Dr. Kiesinger, seemedreluctant fully to face up to French intransigence. The UnitedKingdom must meanwhile turn its attention wholeheartedly to strengthening its own position by its own efforts and look to its national interests.Officials should now provide a study of the consequences of ourexclusion from the Community for our future economic, military andother policies on the lines suggested by the Secretary of State for defence and elaborated in discussion. This study should cover,inter alia, agricultural policies; defence, including NATO, WEU,and the offset arrangements for the British Army of the Rhine, aswell as defence procurement; and United Kingdom relations withEFTA and EFTA relations with e.c..The Cabinet-(1) Approved the conclusion reached in C (67) 187.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for thepreparation of a report on the lines indicated in his summing up.
required in the conurbations; the public acquisition of virtually allthe main network of bus services; the creation of a National bus company (NBC) to run the nationally-owned bus services in Englandand Wales; the introduction of grants for capital investment in public transport and for the support of bus services in remote country areas,together with an increase in the existing grant paid to operators of bus services as a refund of part of the fuel duty; the extension of thepowers of local authorities in the field of traffic management and in arranging concessions for travel on local buses for old people; andthe revision of regulations affecting the hours of work of bus andcoach drivers.The White Paper also envisaged the establishment of a separate scottish Transport Board to be responsible for bus and local shipping services in Scotland, in pursuance of a decision to that effect by the ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy. She wished to draw the attention of her colleagues to the consequences which would follow if the Cabinet confirmed this decision. The TransportHolding Company (THC) had not known of the proposal to set upa separate Scottish Transport Board when they had approached herwith the proposal to acquire on a voluntary basis the interests of theBritish Electric Traction Group (BET) which represented the lastremaining major block of privately-held bus companies. The THCregarded this purchase as defensible on commercial grounds in orderto bring all the major bus companies under single control. However,they regarded the transfer of the main Scottish bus interests to aseparate statutory body as so damaging to the strength of theproposed NBC that they had insisted, despite her attempts to persuade them to the contrary, that if the Government pursued thiscourse they would proceed with the purchase of BET only if she gave them a formal direction to do so. She had power to issue such a direction, though it had never been used before on a major matter.In order to ensure that the acquisition of the BET went ahead withthe necessary speed, having regard to the timetable for publicationof the White Paper and the introduction of the Transport Bill, ithad been necessary for her, with the authority of the ministerial committee on Industrial Policy, to give an undertaking to the THCthat, if the Government decided to establish a separate Scottish transport Board, she would issue a direction for the acquisition ofthe BET.The issue of a direction would necessarily become public andwould expose the Government to the charge that they had overriddenthe commercial judgment of the THC because of political considerations. The alternative would be to abandon the proposalfor an independent Scottish Transport Board and to provide for theNBC to take over the main Scottish bus interests. This would not mean any change of substance from the present position, since theScottish Bus Group which at present operated the main Scottishservices outside the cities was a subsidiary of the THC, thoughoperating under its own name; if the NBC took over the Scottishservices, it would similarly operate through a subsidiary which would
be a distinct entity. The THC believed that to preserve a singleorganisation operating over the whole of Great Britain would bringgreat benefits resulting from unified management. It might bepossible to meet the presentational problems which would arise fromabandoning the proposal for a separate Scottish Transport Board ifsuch a Board were to be established as a subsidiary of the NBC and made responsible to the Secretary of State for Scotland in matters such as investment programmes which affected Scotland only. Sheproposed that the wording of the relevant passages in the White paper should be sufficiently imprecise to avoid committing the Governmentto the establishment of an independent Scottish Board at the present stage.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that when this issue was considered by the Ministerial Committee on industrial policy, the general view had been that the case for a separate Scottish transport Board was very strong and the arguments brought against it by the THC were unconvincing. The Committee saw no reason why a separate Scottish Board should adversely affect the quality of management; the THC at present exercised little direct controlover its Scottish subsidiary, and it was difficult to see why the THCattached such importance to this issue.The Secretary of State for Scotland said there was every reasonon historical and geographical grounds for a separate organisation to operate bus and shipping services in Scotland. It would be wrong for the White Paper to be indeterminate in this matter since theGovernment would probably then have to concede a separate Scottishorganisation under pressure from the interests concerned and would gain no credit for doing so. He had himself discussed the problem with the Chairman of the THC, who had admitted that his objectionsto a separate Scottish Board were &quot; intangible &quot;. A separate board would raise no difficulty as regards wage negotiations, which were already conducted separately in Scotland. It was wrong to suppose that the incorporation of the Scottish bus interests in the NBC would do anything to protect the Ministers concerned from sectionalpressures. The argument that by establishing a separate Board weshould forfeit the benefits of unified management could be adequatelymet by arranging a degree of common membership of the Boardof the NBC and the Scottish Transport Board; it might, for instance,be possible to appoint the Chairman of the NBC as Deputy Chairmanof the Scottish Transport Board. It was misleading to equate theNBC with the THC since the former would be concerned with directmanagement over a much narrower field of operations than thatcovered by the THC. It would be completely unacceptable to scottish opinion for local transport services to be run by an organisation based in London. The Cabinet should thereforeconfirm the decision of the Ministerial Committee on industrial policy in favour of a separate Scottish Transport Board.
In discussion there was general agreement that the case hadbeen made out for the establishment of a separate Scottish transport board and that accordingly a direction covering the acquisition ofthe BET should be issued to the THC. The Government would beon strong ground in defending such a direction: they were notchallenging the commercial judgment of the THC on the broad issueof acquiring the remaining bus interests that were still in privatehands, but were only overruling the THC on the specific issue of aseparate organisation for Scotland. To take a stand on this would command wide support not only in Scotland but among all those sections of opinion which favoured greater decentralisation in theconduct of public affairs.In discussion of the draft White Paper the following amendments were agreed:(a) A sentence should be added in Chapter III to make it clearthat the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales would beresponsible for the setting up of PTAs in those countries.(b) In paragraph 18 of Chapter VII, the White Paper should saythat the scheme for grants towards the purchase of new buses would apply to buses delivered from a date to be fixed in the autumn of1968, and not specifically from. 1st October, 1968, since some flexibility in this matter would be desirable.(c) In view of the need to keep down the level of public expenditure in 1968-69, the date of the increase in the grant paidto operators of stage bus services as part refund of fuel duty shouldbe 1st January, 1969, instead of 1st April, 1968, and paragraph 23 of chapter VII should be amended accordingly.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet approved the draft White Paper subject to the amendmentsagreed in discussion and to any further drafting amendments whichthe Minister of Transport thought desirable. The Cabinet confirmed the decision to establish a separate Scottish Transport Board and agreed to the issue of a direction to,the THC in respect of theacquisition of BET. The Minister of Transport should now arrangefor publication of the White Paper, preferably on Tuesday,5th December, and the timing should be so arranged as to securethe fullest publicity, particularly in the evening papers. It mightbe desirable for the Secretaries of State for Scotland and wales to be associated with publication of the White Paper, and thereshould be further consultation as to the best means of doing this.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport (i) in consultation with the Lord President, to arrange for thepublication of the White Paper on Passenger transport and Traffic, amended in the light of their discussion, asindicated in the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up;(ii) to consult with the Secretaries of State for Scotland andWales as to the means by which they might be associatedwith the publication of the White Paper;
Agriculture6.   The  FinancialCONFIDENTIALreported  that theSecretary,   Treasury,D?sOetasef&quot;m0UthMinisterial Committee on Commercial Policy had agreed on theImports ofCarcass Meat(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 1)previous day to recommend a temporary ban on the importation ofcarcass meat and offal from countries where foot-and-mouth diseasewas endemic. The ban would thus not apply to Australia, NewZealand, North America and the Republic of Ireland. TheCommittee had agreed that the ban should be subject to fiveconditions:(i) It should be made clear that the reason for the ban was theneed to minimise the risk of a further primary infection.(ii) The ban would be imposed on all supplier countries wherefoot-and-mouth disease was endemic, and should also include the Falkland Islands so as to avoid giving offencein Argentina.(iii) The ban should continue until the epidemic had beenbrought under control, subject to review in three months&apos;time.(iv) The ban should be based, so far as possible and subjectto any necessary legal sanctions, on the voluntary-operation of the importers and suppliers, which shouldbe sought by the Minister of Agriculture in this countryand through our Ambassadors and High Commissionersoverseas.(v) There should be an urgent review of the safeguards againstthe introduction of the disease by imports of meat.The Minister of Agriculture said that there had so far been1,292 outbreaks of the disease, and the veterinary staff were working under great pressure. They were making use of veterinary students and of volunteers from overseas, but a major primary infectionin a new area would overwhelm their resources and could provedisastrous. He had met the representatives of the meat traders whowere willing to operate a voluntary ban, and had reason to hope thatsuch a ban would be acceptable in Argentina.In discussion there was general agreement with therecommendations of the Commercial Policy Committee. Thetemporary voluntary arrangements proposed could be expected to obviate the risks to our export trade with the supplier countrieswhich might have resulted from a ban which they would believe tobe permanent. It was suggested that the seriousness of the outbreakhad raised the question whether we were right in adhering to thepolicy of slaughter, and it would be valuable not only to examineour safeguards against importation of the disease, but to re-examinethe problem of how to handle it.   Our Ambassador in Argentina,(iii) to issue a direction to the Transport Holding company to acquire the interests of the British Electric TractionGroup.
in reporting offers of help from there, had suggested that it mightbe valuable to establish a body including Argentinian experts toexamine the scientific aspects of the problem.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the proposals of the Commercial PolicyCommittee. It would be useful when the present outbreak had beenbrought under control to undertake a wider examination not only of the safeguards against the importation of the disease, but of themeans of combating it, including the policy of slaughter. In thisconnection our Ambassador^ suggestion that experts from Argentinashould be included in the studies was worth following up. For thepresent, meat in transit would be put straight into cold store, and ifit seemed likely that any would be held up as a result of a strike in the docks the ship in question might have to be diverted elsewhere.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendations of the Commercial PolicyCommittee for a temporary ban based on voluntary agreement on the importation of carcass meat from countries where foot-and-mouth disease was endemic.(2) Invited   the   Foreign   Secretary,   in   consultation   with. the Commonwealth Secretary, to seek the voluntary agreement of the overseas Governments concerned to temporary restrictions on their meat exports.(3) Invited.the Minister of Agriculture (a) to take any further action necessary to secure theco-operation of the meat trade in this country inthe ban;(b) to consider the desirability of associating Argentinianexperts with the study of safeguards against theimportation of infection;(c) to  bring before the  Cabinet in  due course amemorandum on his review of measures to preventand combat the disease, including a review of thepolicy of slaughter.IndustrialDisputesRailways(previous reference:CC (67) 62ndConclusions,Minute 1)confidential . The Minister of Labour reported that the dispute betweenthe British Railways Board (BRB) and the Association of locomotive engineers and Firemen (ASLEF) arose from the settlement reached in the recent dispute between the BRB and the National Union of railwaymen (NUR) about the duties of guards. It had beenpart of the agreement which ended the latter dispute that, as a contribution to increased productivity, brake vans should no longer be used on freight trains and that the guard should instead be carried in the rear cab of the locomotive. ASLEF objected to this on thegrounds that it was contrary both to the agreement on manningreached in 1965 and to the requirements of safety. Despite theobjections  of the union he had  referred the first point to
Mr. Jack Scamp, who, in September 1965, had at his requestadjudicated between the BRB and the unions about the interpretation of the 1965 agreement. Mr. Scamp had seen the representatives ofboth sides and reported that there was no conflict between theagreement that guards should be carried in the rear cabs oflocomotives and the manning agreement of 1965. He had alsoconsulted the Chief Inspecting Officer of Railways of the Ministryof Transport, who had confirmed that there was no conflict withsafety requirements.The Minister of Labour said that in his view the dispute involved a matter of principle on which there was no possibility of compromise. The elimination of the brake van, which had been abandoned some time ago on the Continent, was symbolic of the drive for higher productivity. Moreover, to give way to ASLEFwould destroy the basis of the agreement with the NUR. he therefore proposed to make a statement in the House of Commonslater that day explaining the issues involved and emphasising theGovernments intention to stand firm. It was possible that ASLEFwould give way at the last minute, but if they did not it wouldbe necessary to proclaim a state of emergency in order thatrestrictions on the use of road transport could be suspended.In discussion it was suggested that it should be made clear toASLEF that their action might endanger the Governments transport policy, which depended on the diversion of suitable traffic from road to rail. If the Government could not be sure that traffic so divertedwould be handled quickly, it might be necessary to defer theappointed day for the operation of the quantitative licensing system to be introduced by the Transport Bill. It was suggested, however,that to make such a statement in public, for example on the SecondReading of the Transport Bill, might throw doubt on the basis ofthe transport policy and it would be preferable to make the point to ASLEF privately and before they took action.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in viewof the need to take advantage of the devaluation of sterling toincrease the country&apos;s exports we could not afford to tolerate strikes,and the nature of this particular dispute provided a suitable occasion for demonstrating the Governments intention to take a firm line.The Minister of Labour should indicate the governments determination in his statement in the House of Commons and should consider how to convey to ASLEF the risk that if they persistedtheir action might endanger the Governments policy of divertingtraffic from road transport to rail. The Ministerial Committee on emergencies should consider the situation before the week-end.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andthe Prime Minister^ summing up.(2) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the ministerial committee on Emergencies to meet on the following day.
The Minister of Labour said that the British Air Line Pilots&apos;Association (BALPA) had for some time been operating a work-to-rule intended to compel the British Overseas Airways Corporation(BOAC) to negotiate with them direct on a pay and productivityagreement; the Corporation were prepared to negotiate only throughthe national joint council for the industry, from which BALPA hadresigned. BALPA had now notified BOAC that the pilots wouldstrike from midnight on 8th December if their demands were not met.The Corporation had responded to this by threatening to close downits operations completely if the pilots went on strike. The situation was delicate and he would shortly be seeing BALPA. The latestdevelopment, however, was that apparently the Corporation intendedto send a letter to each of their pilots asking them not to strike inaccordance with BALPA&apos;s instructions but to continue to report for duty normally after 8th December. It would be a serious matter fora nationalised industry to seek to break an official strike in thisway, and he would discuss urgently with Board of Trade Ministerswhat could be done to dissuade the Corporation from this step.The Cabinet Took note, with approval of the statement by the Ministerof Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th November, 1967.
