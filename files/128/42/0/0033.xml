CC 33 (67)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in the middle east remained extremely grave. Israel had so far been persuadednot to take military action and Mr. EshkoFs Government remained in power despite the challenge from those favouring pre-emptiveaction. The key to the situation lay in convincing Israel that theGreat Powers were seeking a solution to the crisis which wouldenable shipping to have the right of innocent passage to the port ofEilat, since this was essential to the economy of Israel and indeed,because of oil supplies, to her continuing existence. There was no prospect at the moment of Four-Power talks taking place as proposedby the French Government; the Soviet Government were unwilling to participate in such talks but, while wishing to be seen as the friend of the Arab States, they had indicated to him that they were anxiousto avoid war breaking out in the Middle East. Meanwhile, it seemed that in the United Nations discussions would continue for some timeand that it was unlikely that even a holding resolution urging restraint on both Israel and the United Arab Republic (UAR) and proposing a moratorium on the enforcement by the UAR of a blockade wouldbe carried. It was not clear precisely what assurances PresidentJohnson had given to the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Eban, on thelatter&apos;s visit to Washington, although it seemed likely that theGovernment of Israel had publicly overstated these for domesticpolitical purposes.Any course that we might choose to adopt in this crisis, includingtaking no action at all, held risks for us. We should continue tostrive for a holding resolution in the Security Council and to work towards a negotiated solution to the crisis. It would not in his view be possible to revert to a situation in which the UAR exercised norights over shipping passing through the Straits of Tiran; equallyunless Israel could be guaranteed the right of innocent passage by shipping to the port of Eilat, this would mean capitulation and would therefore be unacceptable to her. A compromise might take theform of the UAR having a measure of control and inspection ofsuch shipping in respect of strategic supplies but with the types of cargo which were allowed to pass freely so defined as to include oil in particular. We should seek to provide the background against which such a settlement would be negotiated, by canvassing support for an international declaration in favour of the right of innocentpassage through the Straits of Tiran; and continue with contingencyplans to enforce this if all else failed. This was essential if action inthe United Nations were to have a chance of success and if Israelwere to be deterred from pre-emptive military action. We shouldnot know, until consultations with other countries had been initiated,what support there would be for such international action, althoughCanada and the Netherlands had indicated their support and it seemed likely that Norway and Sweden would do so. It seemed likely that France would support a holding resolution in the security council and a declaration in favour of the right of innocent passage through the Straits of Tiran but that she would not be prepared to8159
canvass support for this. Only a short time was available in which to complete such action effectively since a continuation of the present uncertainty might entail such a deterioration in Israel&apos;s military(though not economic) position that she would be forced to take military action to preserve her existence.In discussion it was urged that the changes which had now taken place in military dispositions by the Arab countries andparticularly by the UAR represented a permanent change in thebalance of power in the Middle East, to the disadvantage of Israel,which both she and the Western Powers would have to accept,although we must seek to ensure that this change did not lead to afurther series of Arab victories which would endanger IsraelVexistence. While we should seek a negotiated settlement whichwould give ships carrying Israeli supplies and goods the right of innocent passage through the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqabaand should seek to achieve an international declaration (preferably in the United Nations Security Council, or failing that by aconsiderable number of maritime countries) of the freedom of navigation in these waters, it would be unwise for the UnitedKingdom to be seen to be taking the lead even in organising such adeclaration. Whatever our sympathies with Israel might be, our economic interests lay primarily in the Arab countries; in particularwe were heavily dependent on their oil. Bearing in mind both these interests and our wider interests in avoiding an international conflictin this area as elsewhere, it was therefore of crucial importance to us that we should avoid either participation in a solely or primarilyAnglo-American force to assert effectively the freedom of navigationin the Gulf of Aqaba, or even taking the lead in seeking to organisea fully multilateral force for this purpose. If one were organised we might play some part in it but it seemed doubtful whether in factsuch a force could be established. Furthermore, the position in international law did not appear to be free from doubt. It couldwell be argued that the situation in respect of the freedom of navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba was comparable with that in respectof the Suez Canal and we had acquiesced for a number of years inthe Canal being closed to Israeli shipping or supplies for Israel. Itwas doubtful whether we should seek to enforce in respect of theGulf of Aqaba rights which we had failed to assert in respect of the canal over so long a period. Nor was it essential to British interests to restore the right of innocent passage in the Straits and the Gulf.On the other hand, it was argued that we had a major interestin seeking a negotiated settlement which fully safeguarded the rightof innocent passage for Israeli goods and supplies in the Gulf, thoughit might prove to be acceptable that such a settlement should includethe maintenance of Egyptian forces at Sharm es Shaikh and an egyptian right to control the passage of strategic goods to Israel,provided that the definition of strategic goods clearly and specificallyexcluded oil. On the broadest view of our interests, it was important to us to maintain the freedom of navigation and the rights of innocentpassage in international waterways and it was clear that in international law the Straits of Tiran and the Gulf of Aqaba were inthis category.  Nor had the UAR a valid claim to belligerent rights
which would override that freedom of navigation. Moreover,although there could be no question of our seeking the overthrow of president Nasser, which would be contrary to our interests, Britishinterests in South Arabia and in the Persian Gulf and our widerposition in the Middle East would suffer further damage if it were seen that the President had been wholly successful in his recent movesand had thereby put at risk the continued existence of Israel. nor should we ignore the strengthening of Soviet influence on the middle east which would be involved. Above all, it was of major importanceto our interests to avoid an international conflict arising from theMiddle East and it seemed certain that this would develop unlessIsrael were in the near future to receive firm and satisfactory assurances relating to the rights of innocent passage in the Gulf ofAqaba. We must seek the restoration of some form of a united nations presence in this area, even though it would be impracticable to re-establish the United Nations Emergency Force. Withoutsatisfactory assurances in respect of the Gulf the present israeli government might be overthrown and Israel would have no option but to go to war, since otherwise her future existence would be at risk. In particular, her geographical situation was such that she could not afford to risk a pre-emptive strike by the Egyptian AirForce. In these circumstances, it was argued that an internationaldeclaration in respect of the Gulf of Aqaba was essential to thepreservation of the peace and that the assertion of such a right of innocent passage must be effective. Such a declaration would bethe basis for any further international action and might require theestablishment of a multilateral naval force to make it effective. Sucha force should not be solely Anglo-American nor should it be seen to derive solely from an Anglo-American initiative (particularlyhaving regard to our application to join the European economic community) but there was reason to hope that at least some othermaritime nations would be prepared to. commit forces to it, evenalthough their ships might not be able to arrive on the scene in thenear future. There could be no hope of obtaining agreement on aninternational declaration and on establishing such a force unless wewere to play a leading part in seeking agreement to the declaration and unless we were in a position to consult other nations about the praticability of establishing a viable multilateral force on the lines which were contemplated. We should therefore take action on thelines proposed in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper, on the understandingthat discussions relating to the international force represented at thisstage only planning for contingencies and that no commitment wouldbe undertaken without further reference to the Cabinet. Moreoverin order to restrain a pre-emptive strike by the Israelis in thecircumstances in which they were now placed it would be of crucial importance that it should be known that such discussions were takingplace about an international commitment to the assertion of the rightof innocent passage in the Gulf of Aqaba. While it should be made clear that such discussions were not based on an Anglo-Americaninitiative, our statement should not be so narrowly confined that itfailed to carry conviction with the Israelis.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that our objectives were to prevent Israel from taking pre-emptive action andto seek a negotiated settlement to the crisis in the Middle East throughthe United Nations or by other means. We should continue to urgerestraint on Israel and, if necessary, on the United States also: andwe should seek to establish precisely what assurances Israel hadreceived from President Johnson during the recent visit to Washingtonof Mr. Eban, the Israeli Foreign Minister. The Foreign secretary should be authorised to canvass the widest possible support for adeclaration to assert the right of innocent passage for shippingthrough the Straits of Tiran and in the Gulf of Aqaba and we must accept that, in this aspect of the matter, we could not avoid to someextent taking the lead, though we should seek to associate othercountries, particularly France and Canada, with the canvassing.Concurrently, planning should continue and international discussionstake place with the aim of establishing what were the prospects ofconstituting a viable force on a wide international basis to enforcethis right of innocent passage, it being made clear both in ourapproaches to other countries and in Parliament that such planningwas on a contingency basis only. Discussions relating to such a force would have to include consideration of deterrent forces in theEastern Mediterranean. Meanwhile we should continue our efforts in the Security Council.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.SECRETAffahT 2&apos;   The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in hong Kong had eased considerably since the previous meeting ofong ong . the Cabinet. It appeared that the local Communist leaders wereavoiding direct clashes with the police and although they had had some success in inciting strikes and intimidating labour, the situationin general was considerably more stable. Great credit was due tothe Governor and to the Hong Kong police for the way in whichthey had handled the situation and the arrival of HMS Bulwarkhad helped to revive confidence. There was furthermore some indication that the mainland Communist leaders were concerned atthe mishandling of the situation by the local Hong Kong Communists.Nevertheless, the situation was still uneasy.The Foreign Secretary said that the United kingdom representative in Shanghai had been very roughly handled by theChinese and had in effect been expelled, although technically ourMission there had not been closed. We were in a weak position to retaliate. Although he had considered seeking the agreement of hiscolleagues to the expulsion from the United Kingdom of the NewChina News Agency, this act might lead to further retaliation inChina and it did not therefore appear to be desirable at present.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)Zambia(previous reference:CC (67) 28thConclusions,Minute 3)South Africa(previous reference:CC (66) 13thConclusions,Minute 2)The Commonwealth Secretary said that Colonel Gowon, theHead of the Military Federal Government in Nigeria, had recently announced a decision by that Government to set up 12 constituentStates. That morning, however, Colonel Ojukwu, the Head of theGovernment of the Eastern Region, had announced the independence of that Region, and, although there was some internal threat to hisposition it seemed likely that he would maintain full control. Thewhole situation in Nigeria was therefore highly uncertain and it wasimpossible at this stage to assess how it might develop. our immediate interests lay in the security of British subjects in Nigeriaand in our oil supplies. Plans had been made for the evacuation ofBritish subjects if necessary, but there had so far been no threat totheir safety. We should also shortly have to consider whether toagree to the payment of oil royalties to the Government of the EasternRegion, or whether they should continue to be paid to the federal government.The Commonwealth Secretary recalled that Mr. Simbule, the&apos;High Commissioner designate for Zambia in the United Kingdom,had (when he was in Tanzania) made a vicious attack on this countrysince the agrement to his appointment had been signed. We hadprotested at Mr. Simbule&apos;s speech and had sought an explanation ofit, but he had since repeated it and without our agreement he had arrived in the United Kingdom the previous day. On his (theCommonwealth Secretary&apos;s) instructions Mr. Simbule had not had any official reception at the airport and we should for the time beingrefuse to receive him. He would also advise The Queen thatMr. Simbule should not be received at Buckingham Palace. Weshould, meanwhile, seek to obtain from President Kaunda a retractionof Mr. Simbule&apos;s offensive statement, but unless we received such aretraction Mr. Simbule would not be acceptable as HighCommissioner.The Prime Minister said that arrangements had been made forcertain Royal Navy ships to visit Cape Town in the near future. Thisvisit would no doubt give rise to considerable criticism among theGovernment supporters in Parliament and more widely in the countryand the Cabinet would wish to consider in such circumstances whetherthe visit should take place. It was, however, relevant to their decision that we had succeeded in achieving, as part of the programme of visits, arrangements for multi-racial entertainment which would bea considerable advance on the attitude which had hitherto beenadopted by the South African Administration.The Foreign Secretary said that, as part of the arrangements which had been made with the South African Government for thereduction of our naval presence at Simonstown, we had agreed thatRoyal Navy ships should pay visits to South Africa from time to time.It was greatly in our interest to maintain the naval facilities whichwe were at present accorded and the continuation of such visits was essential to that end. Coloured members of the crews would haveto conform on shore with local apartheid legislation but we had succeeded in negotiating that not only local British people, but also
the South African Navy and the Cape Town municipality would arrange multi-racial entertainment for the crews. We should notjeopardise these arrangements by announcing them prematurely but our achievement represented a considerable advance on the position which had hitherto prevailed in South Africa.In discussion it was suggested that as long as coloured membersof the crews of our ships would be subject to local apartheiddiscrimination when on shore it would be contrary to theGovernments policy to permit the visits to take place; and theyshould therefore be cancelled, though we might announce that theyhad been deferred because of the situation in the Middle East. Therewas, however, general agreement that the visits should take place as planned, both because of our need to maintain the naval facilities atSimonstown, which would for example be of great importance to us if we were to take part in a multilateral naval force in the Gulf ofAqaba, and because of the advance which had been achieved throughensuring multi-racial entertainment for the crews by South Africanauthorities.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.(2) Agreed that the visit of Royal Navy ships to South africa should take place as planned.(3) Invited the Defence Secretary, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, to consider in the light of their discussion the form and timing of any public statement about the arrangements which had been made for themulti-racial entertainment of the crews.Cabinet Office, S. W. 1,30th May, 1967.
