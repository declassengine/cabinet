The Prime Minister said that members of the Cabinet would now have seen the communique which had been issued on theconclusion of the visit to this country by the Soviet Prime Minister,Mr. Kosygin, during the previous week. The atmosphere of the visithad been markedly cordial; and it had undoubtedly strengthenedthe relations between the Soviet Union and ourselves.A considerable part of the discussions had centred on the conflictin Vietnam; and we had taken advantage of the opportunity to try to ascertain whether some contact could be established between theUnited States and North Vietnamese Governments. There had appeared to be some prospect of success in this attempt at one stage;but in the end it had failed and the United States bombing of north vietnam had now started again. A major consideration in thisdecision by the United States Government had been the fact thatduring the recent truce for the four days of the Vietnamese NewYear there had been exceptionally large movements of troops and supplies from North Vietnam into South Vietnam to reinforce theViet Cong; and a continuation of the pause in the bombing for any considerable period after the end of the truce would undoubtedly have resulted in a further change in the military situation to the substantial disadvantage of the South Vietnamese and United states forces.But, despite the disappointment of the hopes which we hadentertained during the week, we should not now move to a positionof dissociating ourselves from the United States bombing, since weshould otherwise lose our present influence with the United states administration, the value of which had been clearly apparent duringthe discussions with Mr. Kosygin in the previous week. We should therefore seek to maintain the position which we had now created,whereby we could hope to have the goodwill of the Soviet, as wellas the United States Government, when next an opportunity forending the hostilities occurred; and in the interim, while notdissociating ourselves from the United States, we should make itclear that we understood the position of the Government in Hanoi.As regards Europe the exchanges with Mr. Kosygin had touched on the possibility of reciprocal troop reductions by the member countries of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and of theSoviet bloc; but no progress had been made. On the other handMr. Kosygin had not sought to raise political difficulties in relationto our approach to the European Economic Community; and hehad welcomed in principle our policy of seeking to ease tension between Eastern and Western Europe.In discussion it was suggested that public opinion in the UnitedKingdom might react adversely to the resumption of United Statesbombing in Vietnam and that, if it were a prelude to a furtherescalation of the conflict, there would be liable to be strong pressure for us to dissociate ourselves from the United States policy in this regard.

But there hadbeen no response from the North Vietnamese Government on anyof these occasions; and it was understandable that the heavyreinforcement of the Viet Cong during the latest pause had led theUnited States Government to the view that they could not accepta further deterioration in the military situation as long as there wasno sign of a positive reaction from the Government in Hanoi. in considering the extent of Soviet influence in Hanoi, it must be borne in mind that North Viet-Nam was dependent on Chinese support inso far as military supplies from the Soviet Union had to pass throughChina.The Minister without Portfolio said that a reply had now beenreceived from the Maltese Prime Minister, Dr. Borg Olivier, to our proposals for discussions on the economic consequences of thereduction of our forces in Malta and the possibility of reducing therate of that reduction within the planned four-year period. Dr.Olivier had put forward four conditions which must be satisfiedbefore such talks could begin. These were not acceptable to us intheir present form, more especially those relating to the need to govern the rate of reduction by the rate of absorption of redundant labourthrough industrial expansion and to the possibility of our providingfurther development aid. In our reply we had sought to reach amore acceptable basis on which the talks could begin.The Prime Minister said that a key aspect of the forthcoming visit to be paid by the Foreign Secretary and himself to Bonn wouldbe to ascertain the extent to which the Federal German Governmentwould give support for our joining the European Economic community in the face of opposition by the French Government. Although itwas clear that the Germans would welcome our joining theCommunity, it seemed doubtful whether they would be prepared topress their support against the French. At the present time theywould probably attach greater importance to the maintenance ofthe recently re-established cordiality of their relationship with theFrench Government, though they might later become somewhatdisillusioned by French actions. We should be in a better positionto judge in the light of this and of other visits whether or not weshould seek to join the Community and if so what the timing of any approach should be.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theMinister without Portfolio.
secret. The Cabinet resumed consideration of memoranda by theFirst Secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (67) 13 and 16) on the future of the Governments policy on prices and incomes.(Ffie First Secretary of State said that his further consultations with representatives of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) showed that they adhered to the view that a policy on incomes operated ona voluntary basis through the tuc&apos;s own vetting machinery wouldbe more effective than a policy which incorporated statutory powers,to which they remained opposed. Their attitude stemmed in part from the desire to strengthen the authority of the TUC over its constituent unions. They believed that even a declaration of theGovernments intention to take statutory powers in certaincontingencies, or the existence of reserve powers, would prejudice the success of a voluntary policy; this might suggest however thatthe support to be expected for such a policy could not be very strong.He had put the view to the TUC that we should be faced with acritical economic situation following the end of the period of severe restraint, because of the damming back of a large number of wage claims, as well as substantial increases taking effect on the result ofpostponed commitments. If the situation had been less critical, theGovernment might well have been prepared to allow the policy toproceed on a voluntary basis. Given the economic situation,however, the Governments view was that we could not moveimmediately from the present situation, where wide statutory powers were in force, to a purely voluntary system. He had accordingly suggested to the TUC that the Government should take wider powersthan those contained in Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act, but should only activate them if it were to become clear that the policy on a voluntary basis, reinforced by the activation of Part II, was provinginadequate. He had made it clear that the Government were anxious that the policy should succeed on a voluntary basis and that theactivation of wider powers would therefore not be necessary. Hehad further suggested that if the Government took wider powers,even though they would not necessarily be activated, they shouldbe subject to annual renewal. The TUC however still took the viewthat this would represent an expression by the Government of lackof confidence in the ability of the TUC to operate an effective policy on incomes. While they would probably accept the activation ofPart II together with wider powers over prices, they were not preparedto acquiesce in wider powers over incomes. Their position was thatthe Government should allow the policy to operate on a voluntary basis since it would always be open to them to seek wider powersif in the event the voluntary policy were to fail; in his view,however, it would not be acceptable to contemplate introducing new legislation, possibly involving the recall of Parliament, in thesecircumstances: such action could have grave economic consequencesand serious repercussions on international confidence in sterling.
The choice before the Government was therefore either to confine themselves to activating Part II, which would probablycommand the acquiescence of the Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and TUC but which would be inadequate to meet the situation;or to take the minimum powers necessary to ensure the effectiveness of the policy. -These would consist of powers to postpone increases in prices or in pay, wholly or in part, for up to 12 months (though a shorter period of six or nine months might be acceptable), toprevent retrospective payments of pay increases which had been sopostponed and to require reductions of prices in appropriate cases.The exercise of these powers could be limited to the enforcement of recommendations by the National Board for Prices and Incomes(NBPI) and they could come into force only when activated by theappropriate Parliamentary procedure.In discussion, it was argued that if the Government were to adhere to the position that powers going beyond Part II must betaken on the expiry of Part IV, even though they might not immediately be activated, this would be regarded as a breach of the undertakings given by the Government that they would not continuepowers of the nature of those given by Part IV after the expiry ofthat Part. To adhere to this course would inevitably result in theconference of trade union executives to be held on 2nd Marchdeclaring complete opposition to the Governments policy. the tuc would then be on record as opposing the Government andthis would create a situation in which not only would the wider powers be unenforceable, but even the co-operation necessary to operate Part II would not be forthcoming. The result might thenbe a reversion to the completely unregulated system of collective bargaining which obtained before the standstill. If this were to happen, the Government would politically then have no option butto take wider powers and to bring them into force. These powers would however be essentially the same as those in Part IV and thelatter had only been operated successfully because of TUCacquiescence and the support of moderate trade union elements.Because of this support, the Government had not so far had toattempt to enforce the sanctions in Part IV, but they could expect to be faced with this situation under any new powers, in which event the sanctions would prove to be unenforceable. The choicwas not therefore simply between the policy being achieved bvoluntary methods or through the compulsions of statutory powers:without voluntary support, those powers would be ineffectiveVoluntary support for the policy was thus essential in any evenand the measures the Government adopted must be devised withithe limits necessary to achieve such support.

If the Governmentwere to insist on taking wider powers, this would be a definitive moveaway from the evolution of our present collective bargaining systemtowards central determination of wages on the Swedish model andwould entail grave damage to the acquisition by the TUC of wider powers in relation to individual trade unions: the Governmentsobject should rather be to encourage the present developments inthat direction.   The effective surveillance of movements of pricesalso depended on a continuance of the present degree of co-operation
from employers and this might not be forthcoming if the Governmentwere to take powers going beyond those in Part II, which were alreadyextensive in relation to prices. The right course therefore was forthe Government to activate Part II, with a possible extension of themaximum period of delay on increases of prices and wages, but notto go beyond this.On the other hand, it was argued that the powers in Part IIwould be quite inadequate to prevent serious inflation during 1967.Some 12^ million workers would be due for increases of wages duringthe year under existing commitments which had been deferredduring the standstill and the period of severe restraint. This in itself would mean an increase of 6 per cent in the index of hourly wage rates over the year as a whole and further wage settlement couldbe expected to entail a further increase above that figure. It wasalso necessary to seek powers beyond those in Part II in relationto prices; in particular, it would be necessary to have power torequire reductions of prices in appropriate cases if the policy ofsharing the benefits of increased productivity between the workers concerned and the consumer were to be effective. As regards theline to be taken in further consultations with the TUC, if theGovernment were at this stage to put forward compromise proposalsfalling short of the measures which in their view were necessary todeal with the situation, this would make it impossible to revert ata later stage to more far-reaching proposals, particularly if the TUChad obtained acceptance of the policy at the conference of union executives in March on the basis of compromise proposals. If wetold the TUC at this stage that we intended to take wider powers,an adverse reaction at the March conference would not necessarilyrepresent the tuc&apos;s final view. It would still be open to theGovernment to deploy further efforts to gain their acquiescence inthe period between the March conference and the expiry of thepresent compulsory powers. There would be a further opportunityof bringing pressure to bear on the TUC before their Annual congress in the autumn. If the Government were to maintain an unyieldingline at this stage, this would in fact retain their subsequent freedomof manoeuvre and although there would admittedly be some political difficulty in the Government later being seen to have changed their declared policy, it would in practice still be possible at a later stage to come forward with less far-reaching proposals if they should seem desirable. The Government had not yet brought their full influence to bear on the TUC and its effect should not be under-estimated.It would however be important to make it clear to the TUC thatthe Governments objective in the long term was a policy on incomesoperated on a voluntary basis by the TUC and the CBI: theGovernment had no desire to determine wages under statutory powers is a permanent policy. But while the Government did not doubt the good faith of the TUC, it had to be recognised that the effective operation of a voluntary policy in present circumstancespresented grave difficulties.

But while the Government did not doubt the good faith of the TUC, it had to be recognised that the effective operation of a voluntary policy in present circumstancespresented grave difficulties.   It was therefore essential that the
Government should have reserve powers as an insurance against thepossible breakdown of a voluntary policy, since the Governmentcarried the ultimate responsibility for the economy.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) There was general agreement that, if powers going beyond those in Part II were to be taken, it would be preferable that theyshould be valid for one year only. While this would involve considerable political and Parliamentary difficulty if thereafter theyhad to be renewed, this would still on balance be the preferablecourse since it would emphasise that, it was not the Governmentslong-term aim to rely on statutory powers and that they wished toproceed by continuing consultation. From this point of view sucha course would also be preferable to powers which were permanentthough subject to annual renewal by Parliament.(b) It was suggested that there were strong objections to fixing a &quot; nil norm &quot; for the 12 months following July, 1967. During this time considerable numbers of workers would have had no increasein pay for over a year and prices would have risen in the meantime.The Government would be risking complete failure if they attempted to restrict wage increases too severely. If a norm had to be fixed,it would be better to have a norm of say 2 per cent, recognising thatwage &quot; drift&quot; would in practice mean that the average increase in wages would exceed the norm. There would however be advantages in moving away from the concept of a percentage norm andsubstituting the concept of a national dividend expressed in termsof a global sum of money available in each year for distribution in increased wages and salaries. The amount might be determined bythe Government in consultation with the two sides of industry,possibly using the National Economic Development Council for thispurpose. The concept of a national dividend would havepresentational advantages over that of a percentage norm but, moreimportant, it would strengthen the hand of the Government andthe TUC in resisting excessive wage claims by particular groups since it would be clear under such a system that, if disproportionate gainswere made by one section, this could only be at the expense of others. Consultations with industry on the national dividend shouldbe accompanied by the provision by the Government of the fullest possible information about economic prospects.(c) In an editorial article in his union journal, Lord Cooper, theGeneral Secretary of the National Union of General and MunicipalWorkers, had recently proposed that, while the TUC should be primarily responsible for operating the incomes policy, it would nevertheless be necessary for the Government to have reserve powers.It might be possible to make use of Lord Cooper&apos;s views in the further consultations with the TUC.(d) It was suggested that, if the Government were to take wider powers only if a policy on a voluntary basis broke down, the objection that there would not be adequate time for the necessary legislation to be passed could be met by using the existing powers in Part II to delay further wage increases until the further powers
had been secured. It was pointed out however that the powers inPart II only made delay possible in cases where there had been a reference to the NBPI.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not yet in a position to take final decisions on the futureof the policy on prices and incomes and in particular on the questionof statutory powers. It was agreed that the minimum action whichshould be taken for the period immediately following the end of severe restraint was the activation of Part II of the Act, possibly with some extension of the maximum period of delay which couldbe imposed on increases in prices and wages. It was also agreedthat, if wider powers were taken on the expiry of Part IV, it wouldbe preferable that they should be taken for a period of one yearonly, with the Government reserving the right to introduce new legislation renewing the powers in the same or in somewhat amendedform, rather than making the powers in the first instance subjectto annual renewal. Differing views had however been expressed onthe question whether wider powers should be taken on the expiry of Part IV, to be activated as the situation might later require, orwhether there should be no question of taking such powers unless and until a policy on a voluntary basis (reinforced by the activationof Part II) could be shown to be proving inadequate. For purposesof further consultations with the TUC before the conference of tradeunion executives on 2nd March, the Cabinet felt on balance that,if we were to put forward a compromise solution which fell short of the proposals by the First Secretary of State for additional powers,this would make it extremely difficult, if not impossible, to revertat a later stage to those proposals. On the other hand, if wemaintained in the further consultations the position that theGovernment regarded as essential reserve powers going beyond thosein Part II, this need not rule out a compromise at a later stage; theFirst Secretary of State should therefore adhere to this line inhis further consultations. He should however stress that theGovernments aim was a policy on a voluntary basis operated bythe TUC and the CBI and that the Government would do all intheir power to ensure that a policy on this basis would succeed; itwould be useful if guidance to the Press in this sense could bearranged. The First Secretary should however tell the TUC that,recognising the great difficulties they faced in making a voluntarypolicy effective, the Government believed it to be essential to takereserve powers, valid for one year only and to be activated only ifthe need arose, as an insurance against the possible failure of a voluntary policy to ensure the necessary degree of restraint. TheFirst Secretary of State should also canvass with the TUC the concept of the Government formulating, in consultation with the two sides of industry, a national dividend to be expressed as a global sum ofmoney available in each year for increases in wages and salaries,the detailed allocation of which would be a matter for the tuc and the CBI to settle, subject to the claims of workers not coveredby those organisations, e.g., teachers and those in the public service.
Such a concept would take the place of the fixing of a percentagenorm for increases of wages. The First Secretary of State should report the results of his consultations to the Cabinet in time toenable them to consider the issues further before the conference oftrade union executives on 2nd March. Meanwhile, work should beput in hand on the drafting of the legislation which would be neededif it were decided to seek wider powers on the expiry of Part IV.It was important that the fact that such preparatory work was being done should not become publicly known. It was equally important that complete confidence should be preserved in relation to the cabinets discussions on the whole issue.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State (1) To pursue his consultations with the TUC and CBI andto report further to the Cabinet as indicated in thePrime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) To arrange, in consultation with the Lord President ofthe Council, for appropriate guidance to be issued tothe Press on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(3) To arrange for work to be put in hand on the drafting of the legislation which would be needed if it were decided to seek wider powers on the expiry of Part IV&apos;    of the Prices and Incomes Act.AgricultureFarm price review(previous reference:CC(66) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the minister without Portfolio (C (67) 18) about the Farm Price Review.The Minister without Portfolio said that the ministerial committee on Agricultural Policy had been unable to reach agreement on certain aspects of the limits to which the Government should beprepared to go in negotiations on the forthcoming Farm price review. The disagreement related to the increase which should be offered in the guaranteed price for milk, and the related subsidies inrespect of beef, and to the guaranteed price for pigs.The Government were committed to the selective expansion programme for agriculture set out in the National Plan; and whilethe programme did not set targets for particular commodities weshould not achieve it without a substantial increase in beef production,two-thirds of which came from the dairy herd, and in pig production.Additional incentives were needed. It was, however, necessary first to consider the total size of the award in relation to Exchequer costs and the Governments policy on prices and incomes. The agriculture ministers had proposed a total award of  35 million, while theeconomic Ministers would support recommendations implying atotal award in the range of  15-18 million. In his view an awardlying between the figures, in the region of  25 million, was necessary.As regards milk, the smallest increase consistent with obtaining our objective would be l-^d. a gallon in the guaranteed price to the
farmer. This would involve maintaining the retail price at lOd. apint until the end of January 1968, and then increasing it to lO^d.for the remaining two months of the milk year. Other proposals put forward in this context by the Agriculture Ministers for increasedsubsidies relating to beef were justified. In total these proposals would involve the award on beef and milk amounting to  244 million.As regards pigs, the Ministerial Committee had agreed that the&quot; middle band &quot; should be increased and that the mechanism of theguarantee should be so altered that the progressive fall in the guaranteed price as the number of forecast certifications rose beyondthe &quot; middle band&quot; should be made steeper and conversely the progressive rise in the guarantee as certifications fell below that bandshould also be made steeper. The effect of this would be to increasethe returns to pig breeders over the present levels as long ascertifications remained (as at present) below the &quot; middle band &quot;.This increase would total some  2 million, but would not technicallybe included in the total value of the award. In these circumstances,an increase of 6d. a score in the guaranteed price would be adequatein relation to Great Britain, but would bear hardly on NorthernIreland farmers, who depended heavily on pig production; an increaseof 9d. a score was therefore recommended. We should not, however,give the assurance recommended by the Agriculture Ministers tomaintain guaranteed price levels for a period of three years in a commodity as liable to fluctuation in supply as pig meat; the assuranceshould cover only the 1968 Review.In order to keep the total award within the limit he proposed,the guaranteed price of potatoes should be raised by only 5s. a toninstead of the 10s. which had previously been agreed, so saving just over 1 million. There was also general agreement that some reduction could be made in the fertiliser subsidy without loss of farmingefficiency and this should be set at  4 million, irrespective of whetherthe National Board for Prices and Incomes recommended an increasein the price of fertilisers following their examination of the casecurrently before them. On the basis of these proposals the awardfor the 1967 Review would amount to  25-25 million, plus  2 million as a result of the change in respect of pig meat, which could notbe reckoned as part of the award. Of this total,  13-75 million would fall upon the Exchequer and  13-5 million upon consumersof milk.The Minister of Agriculture said that net farming output had fallen both in the present year and in the previous year and netfarm income was static. The rise in productivity had fallen froman earlier rate of 6 per cent a year to 4 per cent in the previous year. The basic problem was lack of confidence in the governments intention to achieve the selective expansion programme and it wascritical on this occasion to make an award which would restore the confidence of the farming community. In these circumstances,we should make a total award of  35 million. This should include an increase of 2d. a gallon on milk, since the previous increases of id. a gallon had proved inadequate to achieve the necessary rate
of expansion. A three-year guarantee in respect of the guaranteed price of pig meat was also necessary to restore confidence.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that the import saving whichwould be achieved by expansion of beef production in accordancewith the selective expansion programme would be some  54 million.Of that we could confidently reckon that  27 million would beachieved in any event. In order to achieve the further  27 million the proposals of the Agriculture Ministers involved expenditure of 29 million. If the total award were considered in relation to thefive earlier years (disregarding the 1964 award, which immediatelypreceded the General Election) and to the minimum figure which&quot;could be granted under the Agriculture Act, the previous five years had averaged an award of  17 million above the minimum. Theproposals of the Minister without Portfolio envisaged an award of 49 million above the minimum: the Treasury proposal would amount to  39 million above it. As regards incomes, while the total income of the farming community had been constant the previous year, the number of farmers had fallen and income per farmer had increased by some 5 per cent. The proposals of the Minister without portfolio involved an increase in income per farmer of some 11-14per cent and the Treasury proposals an increase of 6-9 per cent.Basically the problem was admittedly one of lack of confidence, butthis was not peculiar to the farming community and confidencewould be restored with the general revival of industrial confidencefollowing the measures which the Government had undertaken inorder to achieve this. In these circumstances an increase of 9d. ascore of the guaranteed price of pig meat was acceptable providedthat an equivalent reduction were made in the fertiliser subsidy.There should, however, be no increase in the subsidy in respect of beef cows, since the previous increase had not yet had time to take effect. The increase in the price of milk should be limited to thatwhich could be granted without involving an increase in the retail price beyond lOd. a pint.In discussion concern was expressed at the proposal to increasethe retail price of milk, both because of its consequences for theGovernments policy on prices and incomes and because of the effecton our relations with Commonwealth producers of milk products.It was also suggested that the increase in individual farm incomeswhich would be involved by the proposals was excessive. It was however pointed out that the figures were not comparable with similarfigures for increases in wages, since the income of farmers also hadto enable them to make the necessary provision for further capital investment.In further discussion there was general agreement with theproposals put forward by the Minister without Portfolio, on theunderstanding that these would represent the limit to which theGovernment would be prepared to go in negotiations.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C (67) 18 on the limits to which the Agriculture Ministers should go in negotiations on the current years&apos; Farm Price Review.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14 th February, 1967.
