parliament the TorreyCanyon(previous reference:CC(67) 16thConclusions,Minute 1)CC 17 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. They also discussed the terms of a Motion for debate in the House of Commons on thewreck of the Torrey Canyon and the possibility that a SelectCommittee of the House of Commons might be appointed to enquire into certain aspects of the disaster. There was general agreement that it would be inappropriate for a Select Committee to be appointed for this purpose alone, since this might give the appearance of aninquest being carried out on the action which the Government hadtaken, whereas the important issue was to consider what measures and precautions should be taken to provide safeguards against futuredisasters of this nature. It would therefore be preferable for theexisting Select Committee on Science and Technology to be invitedto examine these aspects in due course, after the work at presentin hand in the two Ministerial Committees, with their supportingOfficial and Scientific Committees, had been brought nearerconclusion.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to consider with the Secretaryof State for Defence and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government, in the light of their discussion, theterms of the draft motion to be tabled in the House ofCommons on the Torrey Canyon.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Minister without Portfolio, to consider inviting the Select Committee of the House of Commons on science and Technology to consider the measures whichshould be taken to guard against or deal with any futuredisasters like that which had been caused by the wreckof the Torrey Canyon.Cabinet(previous reference:CC(67) 1stConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Prime Minister recalled that he had circulated theprevious September a procedural memorandum (C (P) (66) 8) invitingMinisters to restrict travel abroad as far as possible and, when they found it necessary to make journeys overseas, to take the minimumnumber of officials with them. There had recently been someoccasions when our delegations to conferences overseas seemed tohave been unduly large and Ministers should seek to ensure that on future occasions they were accompanied by the smallest possible number of advisers.There was a further related issue to which he would invite theattention of Ministers. This was the growing tendency fordepartmental representation at meetings of the main Whitehallcommittees for Departments to be represented by two, three or evenfour spokesmen.   While allowance must be made for those cases
where several divisions within a Department had a major interestin the subject under discussion, the result in general was both wastefuland inefficient and the tendency should be reversed. It should beregarded as a Departments duty to maintain such necessaryco-ordination as to enable it to be adequately represented atinterdepartmental meetings by one, or at the most two spokesmen.He would consider how these issues could best be pursued.In discussion there was general recognition of the need to restrict the size of delegations to conferences. The suggestion was made thatthere would, in particular, be advantage if one Minister were in chargeof each delegation and consequently responsible for restricting its total size, even although he might need to be accompanied by other ministers. There was also agreement on the need to avoid attendance at committee meetings by several representatives of any one department.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement on the need to restrict the size of United Kingdomdelegations on overseas visits and to restrict the number of departmental representatives at meetings of committees.Oversea AffairsNigeria(previous reference :CC(67) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)Uganda(previous reference:CC(66) 13thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in nigeria was still unstable. Although it had been thought that31st March might prove a critical date in relations between theEastern Region and the Federal Government, the former had not infact declared its secession. The Eastern Regional Government were however now diverting to themselves revenue from oil royalties which under the Constitution should be paid to the Federal Government.The Chairman of the National Liberation Council of Ghana (GeneralAnkrah) was continuing his attempts to achieve agreement betweenthe leaders of the Federal Government and the Governmentof the Eastern Region. The suggestion for an initiative by theCommonwealth Secretariat in which the United Kingdom special representative in East and Central Africa, Mr. Malcolm MacDonald,might play a part had however been rejected, primarily becauseGeneral Ankrah and others concerned had felt that a solution shouldbe found by the Africans themselves.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Minister of Statefor Commonwealth Affairs (Mr. Thomas) had on his present visit toUganda succeeded in allaying the fears of the President of Uganda(Dr. Obote) that we were endeavouring to interfere in Ugandanaffairs or to assist the exiled Kabaka of Buganda. Dr. Obote&apos;s own position was in doubt, however, and a military coup d&apos;etat against him might well take place, though probably not in the immediatefuture.
secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memorandumby the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary summarising their discussions on their visits to the capitals of the European economic community (e.c.) and the annexed Record of these discussions(C (67) 33). They also had before them a Note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet covering a further memorandum by officials on agriculture and the Common Market (C (67) 44).The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had agreed at theend of their previous discussion of this subject a provisional procedure for further discussions, namely that they should first conclude theirassessment of the results of the European tour, i.e., the main obstacles to our entry to the e.c. which the Cabinet had not already discussed(freedom of capital movements, Commonwealth problems, and regional policies) and the two main concerns expressed by the Six(the problem of sterling as a world currency, and the change in thecharacter of the Community which would result from the entry ofthe United Kingdom and from the entry or association of her partners in the European Free Trade Association (EFTA)). The Cabinet should then turn to consider the further paper on the common agricultural policy (C (67) 44) for which they had asked at their meeting on21st March, and any further interdepartmentally agreed factualpapers on other subjects which the Cabinet might need. Thereafterit would be necessary to consider the report which the Cabinet attheir meetings in October and November had asked officials to prepareon courses alternative to entry to the e.c., i.e., membership of an atlantic Free Trade Area, and a policy of abstention from any newassociation with wider groupings of countries. This report might beconsidered on 13th April. The Cabinet might then go on to considerthe further memorandum which he and the Foreign Secretary hadThe Commonwealth Secretary said that the recent military coupd&apos;etat in Sierra Leone had been successful and the NationalReformation Council led by Colonel Juxon-Smith was wholly in control. Brigadier Lansana, the head of the army and leader of theprevious attempted coup, had been sent to a post in the United States.The position relating to the Governor-General was constitutionallysomewhat confused but in effect he had been suspended but notdismissed, and no problem of recognition of the new regime in sierra leone therefore arose. There was no threat to Europeans in thecountry.In discussion it was recognised that these further examples ofinstability in African ex-colonial territories seriously embarrassed ourRhodesian policy.The Cabinet-Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statements.
undertaken to provide, analysing the various options open if it were decided to continue with the approach to Europe. It was difficultto lay down any more precise programme, since the timetable would need to be settled by the Cabinet in the light of the progress of their discussions, which in view of the issues at stake must be thorough and have adequate time. Provisionally, if the Cabinet were to devotetheir meetings on the 13th, 20th and 27th April and probably also on 4th May to the programme he had indicated, the stage at whicha decision could be taken should be reached about 10th or 11th May,and this would permit an announcement of the decision before theprobable date for the Whitsun Recess. This would be desirable, since otherwise at least two weeks would elapse during the Recess andfurther delay would ensue thereafter, since his visit to the UnitedStates and Canada would begin on 29th May. It would therefore be convenient if the Parliamentary debate which would have to be heldafter any such announcement could take place before the Recess,though it could if necessary be held afterwards.In discussion of further procedure the following points weremade (a) It would be desirable for the Cabinet to have additionalfactual assessments of the economic effects of entry to the Communityif this were in. 1967 or alternatively in 1968; of the total effect of entry, and not simply the effect of the common agricultural policy,on our balance of payments; of the legal and constitutionalconsequences of entry; and of the implications of free movement oflabour within the Community. It was agreed that the first twostudies should be prepared by officials in consultation with theEconomic Advisers: arrangements had already been made to review and re-circulate to the Cabinet the previous report (E (66) 10,circulated to the Cabinet before CC (66) 53rd Meeting) on legal and constitutional questions and considered in the Cabinefs discussions in October and November; and a paper by officials on the freedomof movement of labour would be ready for the Cabinefs consideration on 13th April. It would be desirable that Ministerial papers shouldnot be circulated until after the Cabinet had completed their consideration of the necessary studies by officials.(b) It was suggested that there might be some advantage in arranging, at an appropriate stage, for the Cabinet to consider the implications of entry into the e.c. in discussions on the lines of thosewhich had been held at Chequers in October 1966.(c) The timing suggested by the Prime Minister and particularly the period envisaged for a definitive decision would be likely to fit in well with other events to which their decision was related, notably the crucial stages of the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations andthe proposed meeting of Heads of the e.c. Governments in Rome.It was possible that a decision reached about 10th or 11th May wouldprecede the determination of the outcome of the Kennedy Round;and this must be avoided; on the other hand the French, whothroughout the Kennedy Round had been the most dilatorynegotiators, now contemplated a conclusion of these negotiationsabout 7th May; and it would be very difficult for a successful
SECRET7    118conclusion of the Kennedy Round to be delayed significantly beyond15th May. It was also important that the Cabinefs consideration should not be so prolonged as to give an impression of lack ofdetermination or of divisions of opinion which might itself prejudice the success of a decision, if such were taken, to apply at once for negotiations for entry into the e.c..(d) The nature and timing of the consultations with EFTA andthe Commonwealth to which we were committed would present a difficult problem. If the consultations were delayed until after adecision had been taken (but not announced), or even when it wasabout to be taken, it must be regarded as certain that the decision orthe prospect of it would become public knowledge before it couldbe announced to the House of Commons; and it was imperative toavoid this. The pressures from EFTA for consultation were muchmore insistent than those from the Commonwealth. The primeconcern of the EFTA countries was to be informed of our decision in advance, so that if it were to apply for negotiations for entry, theycould then consider, in the light of the consequences for EFTA, what action they themselves should take; they did not wish, however, tobe faced with a fait accompli. There were two possibilities. Wecould consult EFTA on a hypothetical basis at an early date: but itwas doubtful whether this would satisfy our partners in theAssociation. On the other hand it would be dangerous to reach adecision, and to announce it almost simultaneously to EFTA and parliament, but before the Kennedy Round had finished. officials were considering whether there was any way of avoiding this dilemmaby such devices as separate bilateral consultations with EFTA by oneor two Ministers, perhaps followed by a collective meeting with EFTAon the date on which our decision was announced. It would bedesirable to await the outcome of these enquiries and to consider what course should be followed later in April when the prospects forthe Kennedy Round might have been somewhat clarified.The Cabinet then turned to the consideration of the other issues arising from the tour.Capital movements the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the United Kingdomnow operated a rigid control over capital movements to thenon-sterling area, including European countries, and a voluntaryprogramme of restraint on the export of capital to the sterling area.If we were to enter the e.c. without making provision for the continuation of our exchange controls, there would be unacceptableconsequences for our balance of payments. It would therefore benecessary for us, in any negotiations with the e.c., to secure a transitional period until such time as the strength of our balance ofpayments had been increased and established. The risks were more serious in respect of portfolio than of direct investment. Investorsin the United Kingdom were more accustomed to internationalinvestment than those in the Community: for example, an upsurgeof equity prices on the United States Stock Exchange on Wall Street
would, without exchange control, result in substantial flows of capitalfrom the United Kingdom. As regards direct investments, outflows;if we were to join the Community might clearly be greater than theywere now, but it was not possible to estimate what they would be.and in any event there would be an off-setting and probably greater!inflow, especially from firms in the United States, who would prefer!to establish or expand enterprises in this country where their conditions of operation and notably the common language would bemore convenient than on the Continent. It would no doubt bepossible to produce a range of figures for the net outflow or inflowrepresenting the best consensus of expert opinion, but no reliancecould be placed on figures based on such a wide range of uncertainfactors. The essential point was that we must develop and establishduring a transitional period an external surplus such that our financial stability could not be shaken by any capital movements likely inthose circumstances.The Prime Minister said that during the European tour he andthe Foreign Secretary had drawn a sharp distinction between portfolioand direct investment. As regards direct investment one could onlyguess at the net result of the inflows and outflows; his own view wasthat there might well be a net outflow of direct investment to theCommunity, offset by a larger inflow from the United States forthe reasons given by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Such a result would be advantageous for our regional policies because we shouldbe able to insist that the new investment should take place in thedevelopment areas.In discussion, it was suggested that there were serious risks thatthe removal of foreign exchange controls and the consequential flowsof direct investment funds would lead to the movement of industryboth to the e.c. and to those parts of the United Kingdom whichwere closest to the Continent, notably the South East of England,especially when the Channel Tunnel was completed. It would beno consolation even for a relatively prosperous area of the UnitedKingdom to lose employment in this way that there was offsettingnew employment elsewhere arising from new investment by the UnitedStates, even if that new employment were in a development area.Indeed some Ministers saw a risk that the United Kingdom itselfmight increasingly assume the characteristics of a development areaowing to the gravitational pull in a large area of free trade of the regions of greatest economic and industrial activity. The lower basinof the Rhine and the adjacent ports such as Rotterdam exemplifiedan area whose facilities and levels of activity would be likely to attractindustry away from the United Kingdom.It was further urged that the real risk to our regional policiesdid not arise from the provisions of the Treaty of Rome or regulationsso far made under it, but from the effect which the removal of our foreign exchange control would have in weakening our capacity toenforce our regional policies, whether by the restrictions of the Indus-trial Development Certificates (IDCs) or by our fiscal and financialincentives favouring the development areas. At present, many UnitedStates concerns took the view that so long as there were two blocs
in Europe, EFTA and the e.c., it was advantageous to maintain a factory or factories in each bloc. But if the two blocs were merged,such firms might choose to concentrate their activities on theContinent, and there was some evidence for this in the fact that out failure to enter the Community in 1963 had not, as had been expected,reduced American investment in the United Kingdom, which had infact increased since then.On the other hand it was pointed out that many large firms had maintained factories in the United Kingdom and increased their exports from them, despite having to face the Community tariff and despite their possession of plants in the e.c. which were not sohandicapped. Our motor industry had been cited as being at risk,but Fords for example had said that they would have transferredtheir activities in Dagenham to the e.c. but for their expectation thatthe United Kingdom would join the Community. Chrysler&apos;sinvestment in Rootes had been similarly protected by specific pledges;General Motors were expanding in Lancashire, and BMC would remain a British firm. The investments which had been made of very large sums in plant now in the United Kingdom would inhibittransfers of the activities represented by these investments to theContinent. It was also necessary in these matters to consider thebalance of advantage between what would happen if we entered the Community and what would happen if we did not; in the latterevent, given the size and wealth of the Community market, it was even more likely that there would be a slow transfer of investment and economic activity from the United Kingdom to Europe in orderto avoid the tariff barrier. Moreover it would be difficult in the longrun to use our exchange controls against United Kingdom firms who were unable to export to Europe over the e.c. tariff and whoconsequently wished to establish factories on the Continent.In further discussion it was suggested that, whereas the effect onour balance of payments of freedom of capital movements in regardto direct and portfolio investment had been taken into account, theeffect of a flight of capital had not. It was pointed out on the otherhand that in the discussions with the Dutch we had been amply assured that we should be able as members of the Community to protectourselves against such threats. Moreover in our balance of paymentscrisis leads and lags in payment had played a much greater part thancapital flight; and recent international monetary arrangements suchas currency swaps between Central Banks and the Basle agreement had substantially reduced the dangers of capital flight.Portfolio investment presented a more serious risk than direct investment or capital flight unless in the event of our entry into theCommunity sufficient protection against these risks was negotiated.There were two risks, namely that the flow of portfolio investmentfunds to the e.c. would be greater than the reverse flow to the UnitedKingdom; and that the absence or inadequacy of a fence of foreign exchange control round the Community would permit a large netoutflow of United Kingdom funds to third countries, notably theUnited States.   Of these two risks the latter appeared the more
serious in view of the skill of our merchant bankers in arrangingprofitable transfers of funds with great rapidity. For these reasons it had been made clear on the European tour that we could not relaxour controls on portfolio investment to the e.c. until the e.c. itselfhad instituted similar controls; and even if the Community did, thedoubt would remain whether their controls would be sufficientlyeffective in view of the difficulties of regulating flows of funds.Nevertheless there was some reassurance in the fact that Article 70of the Treaty of Rome provided for a member country which wasthreatened by such flows of funds to exercise national control against them, provided that the e.c. was informed; once we were memberswe could ourselves propose the institution of effective Communitycontrols. In such a proposition we might well find that the french would be our best allies.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat it had perhaps been based too much on the circumstances ofthe present and of recent years in which the economies in Europehad been strong, and our own and that of the United States in deficit.A more dynamic analysis, recognising the growing strength of ourown position and the great change which would come about in the.position of the United States economy if the war in Vietnam were brought to an end, might well show a substantial change in circumstances, especially over a period of several years for which we might hope to secure transitional provisions in respect of freedomof capital movements. It had been made clear on the Europeantour that we should require such provisions and the discussion had brought out that it would be particularly important to secure effectivesafeguards in respect of portfolio investment.Regional policies the Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary said that theyhad nowhere found during their recent tour any disposition to question the acceptability of the regional policies which we at presentoperated. It had become increasingly clear that each of the six countries was able to pursue regional policies suited to itscircumstances and their hosts had clearly expected that we shouldbe allowed similar latitude provided that our measures did not involvediscrimination against other member countries or their nationals,Although the issue had been discussed at considerable length only in rome, it had been clear from their subsequent discussions of this sub-ject, both formal and informal, in other capitals that the Governmentsconcerned were aware of our position and did not take the viewthat this would give rise to any difficulty in relation to the policy and practice of the Community. During the visit to The Hague, forexample, the Netherlands Prime Minister had stated that theNetherlands Government operated regional policies designed topromote investment in certain parts of the country and, as a corollary,to inhibit developments in other parts.In discussion it was recognised that it seemed that we should be free to continue our present policies of regional development if wewere to join the e.c.. It was however argued that their effectivenesswould, in such circumstances, be considerably weakened. The system
&apos;   ISOof control on the siting of new firms and factories which was operatedthrough IDCs would be less effective;, while it would be open to usto require any firm, whether British or foreign, seeking to set up anew factory in the United Kingdom to establish it in a development area, it would no longer be possible to prevent United kingdom firms establishing branches in Europe. Moreover, the effectiveness of the system of IDCs in relation to foreign firms seeking to establishnew factories would also be lessened when, by establishing a factory in Europe, they could export its products duty free to the UnitedKingdom. Furthermore, it was argued that the encouragement to united States investment in the United Kingdom which would be afforded by our joining the e.c. had been over-emphasised and thatthe level of United States investment during the previous few years had derived much of its incentive, not from the prospects of ourentering into the e.c. at some later date, but rather from the need of the firms in question to establish themselves within the tariffpreference area of EFTA. The firms in question which had, for themost part, also established branches within the e.c. might well be disposed to concentrate on the latter if we were to join the community and therefore come within the same tariff area. In considering theextent to which United Kingdom firms themselves might, if we wereto enter the Community, be encouraged to expand in order to increase their exports to Europe, we must also have regard to the extent towhich our entry would lead to the loss of our present commonwealth and EFTA preferences and hence diminish the markets available forour exports other than in the e.c. itself.It was also argued that some of the firms which had establishedfactories in the development areas in recent years were, to the extent that this process had been in part subsidised as a result of regional development policies, not firmly based and were therefore particularlysusceptible to competition from European firms in the event of ourentering into the Community. The position in Wales up to the early part of the 1970s gave cause for particular anxiety because of theextent to which in that period there would be further closures ofcollieries and the need to develop alternative sources of employment.On broad economic grounds, it was argued that there was likely tobe a gradual concentration of industry in the central industrial areaof Europe and in these circumstances there was reason to fear thatthe United Kingdom would increasingly be on the periphery ofindustrial development. This would be particularly disadvantageousin so far as Community policy, whether on freedom of capital movements or on regional development, might weaken the restrictiveparts of our regional controls and so require the incentive parts to be strengthened at further cost to the Exchequer.On the other hand it was argued that the incentive which wouldbe given by entry into the Community to United Kingdom firms toestablish branches in Europe had been greatly over-emphasised. Thegreater part of the industrial production of most firms was for salein the home market. It seemed improbable that such firms would establish new factories on any scale outside the United Kingdom in
order to produce goods solely for export. In any event, to the extent that there was such an incentive, it was greater in presentcircumstances than it would be if we were to join the Community,because of the present need of United Kingdom firms to escape theCommunity tariff by basing some of their production in Europe. nor did the argument relating to the incentive given to the United Statesfirms to establish branches in the United Kingdom as well as inEurope in order to have bases of production within two separatetariff areas seem justified by experience, since there was good reasonto suppose that despite the setback in 1963 a considerable part ofrecent United States investment in this country had been promptedby the prospect of our eventually joining the e.c..   We couldmoreover reasonably expect that, to the extent that some UnitedKingdom firms did establish branches in Europe, there would be some counter-balancing investment in this country by European firms who might find it advantageous to base some of their production here for sale in the United Kingdom market.  Nor should the extent towhich the central industrial area of Europe attracted new industrial investment, including investment by United Kingdom firms, be over-emphasised.   An undue concentration in this area would undoubtedly lead to higher wage rates and other effects which would prove a disincentive to industry.  Moreover the substantial success which had been achieved by the Italian Government in promotingindustrial development in Southern Italy, or the similar success whichhad been achieved in South West France, and even the establishmentof new industries in areas of the United States remote from the centralindustrial areas, showed that even in existing circumstances suchattractions as were offered by a central industrial complex like thatin the lower Rhine basin could well be effectively countered by national policies within the e.c.. If our own policies in development areas had in some instances led to the establishment there of firms which were not soundly based, this would in the longer run be disadvantageous to our economy whether or not we joined the e.c..The strength and growth of our economy as a whole had a greaterinfluence on the extent of investment in development areas than anyother factor. There was good reason to think that our entry into the eec would prove a substantial incentive to industry to increaseinvestment and would therefore lead to a faster rate of economic growth.  The need to face European competition would necessitate the formation of bigger United Kingdom industrial units which wouldalso call for increased investment. This view was strengthened by theresults of the recent survey which had been carried out by the confederation of British Industry, which showed that UnitedKingdom industry in general took the view that our entry into theCommunity would be to our industrial advantage. Both on particulargrounds relating to our regional policies and on broader groundsrelating to industrial development which would be crucial to furthergrowth in the development areas, it was therefore urged that our entry into the Community would at the least not be disadvantageousto regional development.  To the extent that particular problemsarose in the next two or three years, these could be met by transitional provisions such as we might reasonably expect to be able to negotiate.
In further discussion there was general agreement that it wouldbe helpful for a study to be carried out departmentally by officials ofthe effect of entry into the Community on our planning policies:such a study should take into account the influence which wouldin any event be exerted by the opening of the Channel Tunnel on industrial development in the South East of England. But the wide range of variation over a period of years of other factors relatingto industrial growth in the development areas would make itimpossible to make any reliable quantification of the effect on such development of our entry into the Community.The international role of sterlingThe Prime Minister said that the British economic position, theinternational role of sterling and the sterling balances had been a prominent feature in the discussions on the tour. Throughout these,he and the Foreign Secretary had emphasised the favourabledevelopment of our balance of payments and our belief that the sterling balances would not and should not become a drag on theCommunity. The Dutch had suggested that the Community shouldbe protected from any obligation to assist us financially if any futuredifficulties on our balance of payments arose from sterling^ role asan international currency rather than from the United kingdom balance of payments as such. We had confirmed that we did not regard Article 108 of the Treaty of Rome as obliging the community as such to underwrite difficulties that we might encounter inconsequence of the world-wide uses of sterling and had undertaken to consider, if they wished, giving them a derogation to this effect.It appeared that the tour as a whole and this discussion in particularhad done much to reassure the members of the Community on thisparticular issue.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers proposalsfor their programme of further discussions of the approach to Europe and of alternative policies; that he would arrange for the preparation of further studies on theaggregate effect of entry into the e.c. on the balance ofpayments of the United Kingdom, and of the economiceffect of entry for say 1967 as against 1968: for any necessary revision of the study of the legal and constitutional effects of entry considered by the Cabinet inNovember 1966: and for circulation of the report by officials on the implications for the United Kingdom of freedom of movement of labour between members of theCommunity.(2) Agreed to postpone consideration of the nature and timing of consultation with EFTA and the Commonwealth until a further study of the problems of such consultation was available and until the end of the Kennedy Roundnegotiations was more clearly in sight.
(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an interdepartmental study by officials of the effect of entry into the e.c. on United Kingdom planning policies.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion on the approach to Europeat a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th April, 1967.
