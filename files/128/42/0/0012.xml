Social ServicesFamilyEndowment(previous reference:CC (67) 9thConclusions,Minute 4)CC 12 (67)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda on family endowmentby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (67) 23), by the Lord Presidentof the Council (C (67) 27) and by the Minister of Social Security(C (67) 24).The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had approved in principle an improvement in family endowment on the lines proposed by the Minister of social security, involving an increase of family allowances associated with areduction in income tax child allowances (&quot; give and take &quot;), but thathe had reserved his position on the method of finance to be adopted.Whatever method of finance were adopted, however, the 10s. increasein family allowances which had been proposed would add  160million a year to public expenditure, after taking account of the saving on supplementary benefits and other payments.   A decision toincrease family allowances by this amount, in advance of the general review of public expenditure which was currently proceeding, would amount to a decision to give first priority in 1968-69 to family allowances, notwithstanding that Social Security expenditure wouldhave been increased already by some  700 million a year, includingthe uprating of benefits which was due to take place later in thecurrent year.   Even without the increase of family allowances, itwas likely that public expenditure in 1968-69 would increase bybetween 10 and 15 per cent as compared with an increase of 8^ percent in the current year. Difficult decisions would have to be taken if this prospective growth of expenditure were to be contained, andit would be inconsistent to take a decision in advance to make asubstantial increase in family allowances. He took the view that themaximum increase in taxation rates which would be tolerable between now and 1970 was about  300 million, and that to limit the increase to this figure required a reduction of about  500 million in the total public expenditure programmes by 1970.   It was clear that anadditional increase in taxation of  160 million could not be accomodated within this figure, and accordingly any increase of family allowances could only be financed by making an equivalentand additional reduction in other public expenditure programmes.It would be wiser to defer a decision on family allowances until the outcome of the public expenditure review was completed in July sothat future public expenditure could be looked at as a whole.Despite the Cabinet rejection of direct means testing, this still remained in his view the most promising approach if socialprogrammes were to be developed as they should and help givenwhere it was most needed, without having to reduce expenditureelsewhere.The Minister of Social Security said that a larger part of theincrease of  700 million in social security expenditure was due solely to increased prices and she did not accept that a &quot; give and take &quot;scheme involving a family allowance increase of 10s. would increasepublic expenditure by  160 million. Family allowances and income7924a 2
tax child allowances had a similar nature and purpose, and anincrease of one matched by a reduction of the other representedonly a switch of income between husband and wife within the family.In consequence, for families paying the standard rate of tax there was virtually no change of income, no loss of taxable capacity and no increase in public expenditure. The real cost of the scheme was thusconfined to the cost of improving the position of the lower income groups. In relation to a 10s. increase in family allowances this wouldbe  32 million a year, although it would be  48 million in the first yeardue to the time-lag in the collection of income tax. The principle involved was the same as that which had been applied to investment grants and allowances, where it had been explained publicly that thenew investment grants involved no new burden since they replacedequivalent tax allowances. The &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme had the advantage of concentrating the benefit of increased family allowances on the lower paid at moderate extra cost, and a 10s.increase would bring above supplementary benefit level 65 per cent ofthe children in families now below that level. If a decision on theadoption of a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme were deferred to July,that would prejudice the possibility of introducing such a scheme inthe following April. Moreover, because of the extent of povertyamong children, it was desirable that some interim improvementshould be made before the winter and she had suggested that an interim increase of family allowances of 4s. for third and subsequent children of families should be made in October at a cost of some 10 million in the current year. But it was essential that theannouncement of any such interim increase should be combined withthe announcement of a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme if the interim increase in family allowances were to be subsequently subsumed inthe &quot; give and take &quot; scheme.The Lord President said that there was general agreement thatchild poverty constituted the largest remaining problem for the social services, and that any improved provision should be given on a selective basis. The difference of view had been on the method bywhich such selectivity should be applied. The choice had beenbetween direct means testing on the one hand and the application ofan indirect income test through the income tax machinery on theother, and a decision had far reaching consequences since it was likely that, whichever approach was adopted, it would be extendedwidely over the social services. The Cabinet had rejected meanstesting and accepted in principle the closer integration between tax allowances and family allowances foreshadowed in the Labour PartyManifesto. It was essential to the adequate future development of social security programmes that the Cabinet should be able to settle in this way not only the extent of additional expenditure in this field, but also the means by which it was to be financed. The principleof the Chancellor^ control of the details of the Budget was not inquestion; but the Cabinet must retain collective responsibility for themain lines of economic and social policy. If an early decision on family endowment were not taken the introduction of a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme next year would go by default and the possibility of
achieving desirable economies in the field of school meals would alsobe lost. It was now clear that there was no practicable means of achieving selectivity except through means testing which the cabinet had rejected, or the &quot; give and take &quot; approach which they hadalready accepted in principle.In discussion there was some support for the view that,irrespective of the extent to which the &quot; give and take &quot; type of schemeincreased public expenditure or reduced taxable capacity, on whichthere was some difference of view, a decision to increase family allowances should not be taken in isolation and in advance of the review of expenditure on other programmes which was currentlyproceeding. Nor was it clear that an increase of cash allowancesalone constituted the most effective method of combating childpoverty. It was further suggested that it would be premature to takefirm decisions on the method of financing an increase in family allowances before the budgetary consequences of other prospectiveincreases in public expenditure were apparent. On the other hand,it was pointed out that in relation to developments of policy which required long preparation, decisions necessarily had to be taken before their budgetary consequences could be assessed, and it was suggestedthat, since there were now no alternative means, acceptable to theCabinet, of concentrating additional family allowance expenditure on. the lower income groups (on the need for which there was generalagreement) there was no advantage in deferring a decision to proceedwith a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme.In further discussion of the financing of increased family allowances through reduced income tax child allowances it wassuggested that the tax-payer himself would not necessarily regard hisadditional tax payment as offset by the additional family allowancepayable to his wife, and to this extent the switch in income withinthe family could not be regarded as self balancing. An increase in family allowances would not be popular, and the method of financeproposed might increase this unpopularity. Further, if the increasein family allowances opened the way to increases in school meal and welfare milk charges and to increases in rent, families might, on balance, be worse off. Nevertheless, the Cabinet had accepted thatthe &quot; give and take &quot; approach was preferable to a straight increaseof family allowances and to the application of direct means testing.While finance through reduction of income tax child allowances was an essential feature of the &quot; give and take &quot; approach, it was suggestedthat the extent to which the increased family allowances should be financed by this means required further consideration as did theamount of the increase in family allowance itself. If, however, adecision were deferred as to the form which a &quot; give and take &quot;scheme should take, it would be important that this deferment shouldnot of itself rule out the possibility of introducing such a scheme inApril 1968 when final decisions were taken in July. Work on thedetails of such a scheme should, therefore, proceed in the meantime, if that were necessary to ensure that a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme
could be introduced in April 1968. It would have to be accepted,however, that there would be little opportunity for consultation withthe Trades Union Congress (TUC) or the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI), desirable though such consultation was.In discussion of the need for an interim increase of family allowances it was suggested that such an increase might be made inOctober 1967 to coincide with the general increase of national insurance benefits, and that expenditure on it might be of the orderof  40 million in a full year, comparable to the net cost of a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme, and concentrated on the larger families. Such anincrease might be announced in April. It was pointed out, however,that it would not be possible subsequently to subsume this increasein a later &quot; give and take &quot; scheme so that the cost of the interim increase would be additional to that of the &quot; give and take &quot; schemeand would prejudice decisions on the &quot; give and take &quot; scheme itself.Further, an interim increase of family allowances of this order, paidirrespective of income, would be widely criticised, notwithstanding that it would be confined to larger families. It would be insufficientof itself to enable an increase in the charges for school meals and welfare milk to be made, since these would apply to all families. Itwould be apparent to the public that in making a further unselectivedistribution of cash the Government were failing to take the basicdecision of principle.In further discussion the following main points were made:(a) In the longer term the possibility might be explored ofcentralising and integrating the administration of all social securitypayments and income tax through the application of automatic data processing, with the object of relating such payments to incomewithout the application of an overt means test.(b) Whereas means tests had in the past been designed to restrict payment as narrowly as possible, they could now berepresented as being designed to give the maximum help to thosefamilies and individuals who needed help most. Such tests were likelyto prove more acceptable on that account.(c) Preliminary consideration had indicated that a decision to seek to enter the European Economic Community would not have any direct implications for our policy on family endowment.(d) It was suggested that in order to operate a &quot; give and take &quot;type of scheme the Inland Revenue Department would have to begiven some weeks for the preparation and issue of detailed instructionsto their staff before the annual recoding began in the autumn;legislation would need to be drafted for introduction early in the new session. In consequence it was suggested that all the details of thescheme would have to be settled in consultation between the Ministryof Social Security and the Inland Revenue by July at latest.(e) The introduction of investment grants represented a closeanalogy to the &quot; give, and take &quot; approach on family allowances sincethe investment grants benefited, for example, small farmers, who didnot benefit from the tax allowances which had been replaced.
(/) While an increase of family allowances effectivelyconcentrated on the lower paid would be helpful to the government&apos;s policy on incomes and prices, it was not of major importance to it.(g) The Labour Party Manifesto included only an undertaking to seek ways of integrating tax allowances and social securitypayments and did not commit the Government to adoptingintegration.(h) Earlier consideration had not established the possibility ofmaking any satisfactory distinction, for public expenditure purposes,between transfer payments and other forms of public expenditure.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet at their previous discussion had, on balance, already rejected the application of means testing to improved family allowances andhad accepted in principle that there should be an increase in family endowment based on &quot; give and take &quot; principles.  In view of thepublic expenditure and fiscal considerations advanced by theChancellor, however, they now agreed to defer until July furtherconsideration of the issues relating to the amount of the family allowance increase (though it should be substantial) and the extent towhich it should be financed by reduction of income tax child allowances, by an increase in taxation or by a reduction in public expenditure elsewhere.  A decision on the charges for school meals and welfare milk and on the proposals of the Secretary of State for education and Science in (C (67) 9) should be similarly deferred. Itwas, however, essential that the deferment of a final decision on theform of a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme should not of itself prejudice thepossibility of introducing such a scheme in the following April.Consequently, urgent consideration should be given by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, in consultation with the Minister of social security, to the implications of such deferment on the possibility of introducing a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme in April 1968: he should beinformed of the outcome. Unless it was clear beyond doubt that theintroduction of a scheme in April would, not be prejudiced by thedelay, they should arrange for the details of such a scheme tobe worked out interdepartmentally as far as possible and withoutprejudice to the final decision.   The Cabinet did not favour theintroduction of interim increase of family allowances in advance ofa final decision on the form of a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme since thecost of such an increase could not be subsumed in the cost of the&quot; give and take &quot; scheme and would be additional to it.  It would,however, be open to the Minister of Social Security, when the Cabinetresumed their discussion of family endowment in the light of thepublic expenditure survey, to put forward proposals for an interim increase for which it might be possible to provide legislative time late in the Session.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and agreed to resume their consideration of the form of an increase in family endowment in the light of the review of public expenditure.
(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Social Security, to consider the implications of Conclusion (1) on the prospects of introducing anincrease of family allowances in association with areduction of income tax child allowances in April 1968,and to report to the Prime Minister in accordance withhis summing up of their discussion.HousingPublicAuthorityHousingProgramme,1967: Englandand Wales(previous reference:CC (66) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of housing and Local Government and Secretary of State for Wales(C (67) 25) and by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (67) 28) on thehousing programme for 1967 for local authorities in England andWales.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that overthe last three years we had not succeeded in building at a rate thatwould ensure our reaching the Governments target of 500,000houses by 1970. Completions in the public sector would show anincrease in 1967 and 1968 but the future level of completions in theprivate sector was very uncertain. While there were some signs thatperformance in the private sector would shortly improve, the numberof starts in that sector during 1966 had fallen by 18,000 comparedwith the previous year and there was therefore considerable leewayto be made up. In January 1967 the number of houses under construction was less by 25,000 in the public sector and 11,000 in theprivate sector than the number in November 1966. The present programme of approvals for 1967 fell short of the 1966 programme by 4,000; in addition, an extra 3,000 approvals would be needed for houses for miners; the combined effect was to reduce the 1967 localauthority programme by 7,000. If local authorities were to plan their programmes effectively, they needed adequate notice of the numberof tenders they could expect to be approved during the year andthey were now pressing for this information.We had in the past told local authorities in the priority areas tobuild to capacity and these authorities would be able to put intotender at least 10,000 more houses this year than in 1966. Ifthe total programme of approvals were not increased, it would benecessary either to hold back increased building in the priority areasor to inflict a cut of exceptional severity on the non-priority areas;the latter accounted for some 65,000-70,000 houses a year and if the priority areas were allowed to go ahead, the cut in the non-priorityareas would amount to 17,000 houses. There were urgent housing needs in the non-priority areas which differed from those in the priority areas only in scale. The cuts would be being imposed at atime when there was spare capacity in the building industry and wouldbe bound to provoke political criticism. The right course would therefore be to increase the programme by 4,000 in order to make good the shortfall as compared with 1966, by a further 3,000 to compensate for the extra houses required for miners, and by a further5,000 to allow for a modest increase over the previous year, makinga total increase of 12,000. However, in the light of discussion of this
bissue in the Prime Minister^ Group on Housing, he would beprepared to accept an addition of 7,000 and to defer a decision on afurther 5,000 until later in the year.The Secretary of State for Wales said that the rate of progressin housebuilding had been very slow over the past three years and aconsiderable stimulus would be needed if the target of 500,000 houses were to be achieved by 1970. If an increase of at least 7,000 houses in the 1967 programme were not authorised, we would be unlikely to reach this target and the impression would be given that theGovernment had abandoned it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the present authorisedprogrammes of approvals for local authorities were designed toprovide about half of the target of 500,000 houses in 1970; the programmes were not falling behind schedule.  The increase in thepublic sector had so far been largely offset by the fall in private housing, but performance in the private sector was capable of rapidimprovement.  An indication of this was the difference between the forecast by the speculative builders made in October 1966 that theywould start building only 179,000 houses in 1967, and the furtherforecast which they had made in January when their estimate hadalready increased to 204,000. While forward estimates for the private sector were necessarily uncertain, the Official Committee on Housingnow considered that, taking public and private sectors together, thenumber of completions for the United Kingdom in 1968 might be between 427,000 and 442,000. This offered a reasonable prospect of reaching 450,000 by 1969 and of having 500,000 houses under construction by 1970. While the programme of approvals showed a shortfall  in 1967 as compared with 1966, this was due to the decisionto increase approvals in 1966 to provide a temporary boost to theprogramme; it was recognised at the time that there would inconsequence be a fall in the number of approvals in 1967 when wereverted to the long-term programme as originally agreed.   Thehousing programme should not be increased&apos;simply because there wasspare capacity in the building industry; it was necessary to considerthe claims of housing against the claims of other programmes and thecurrent review of public expenditure would enable this to be done.It would be wrong to anticipate the outcome of that review by adding to the housing programme now. If later in the year it became clearthat performance in the private sector was not improving to thenecessary extent, and subject to considerations of public expenditure,it might then be justifiable to increase the housing programme;meanwhile, no increase should be authorised.In discussion, it proved to be the general view that an increase inthe programme at least of the 3,000 houses needed to offset theadditional houses required for miners was justified. On the otherhand there were objections to going beyond that figure, since such adecision would pre-empt the claims of other programmes of public expenditure. It would in any event be premature to authorise anincrease as large as 7,000 when an improvement in the performance
of the private sector might render this unnecessary. While predictionsby the private builders had proved unreliable in the past, there were now definite signs of renewed confidence in the industry and theincreased flow of funds to the Building Societies augured well for thefuture.In further discussion, it was pointed out that there had been asubstantial increase in the number of local authority houses approvedbut not yet started as compared with the position a year ago; therewas also an increase in the number of houses started but not completed, and delays between approval and completion appeared tobe lengthening. Any action which could be taken to reduce thesedelays would help to mitigate the constraint on the programmes ofthe non-priority areas.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that approvals for 1967 should beincreased by 5,000 and that the position should be reviewed again ina few months&apos; time in the light of progress in the private sector.The Cabinet-Agreed  that  the  programme of approvals  for localauthorities in. England and Wales for 1967 should beincreased by 5,000 houses.AgricultureFarm price review(previous reference:CC (67) 8thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Agriculture (C (67) 26) about the Farm Price Review, to which was attached a copy of the Annual Review White Paper.The Minister of Agriculture recalled that at an earlier meetingthe Cabinet had agreed that the Agriculture Ministers should in negotiations on the current year&apos;s farm price review be prepared tomake a total award of up to  25-25 million. An agreed settlementhad now been reached with the Farmers Union at that level (in detail,the figure was  25 - 332 million). Within that total, minor adjustmentshad been made, in consultation with the Minister without Portfolio,on the earlier proposals for individual commodities. By making nochange on potatoes and reducing somewhat the increases on milk,cattle and pigs, it had been possible to make a small award of 2/6d.per ton on sugar beet, a slight reduction in the cut on eggs, which now amounted to %d. a dozen and in view of the recommendation ofthe National Board for Prices and Incomes on increases for fertiliserprices the cut in the fertiliser subsidy had been reduced from  4 million to  2 million. No long-term assurances had been given inrespect of pigs.The Annual Review White Paper had been agreed with theDepartments primarily concerned, and would be published onWednesday, 15th March. Both the White Paper and his usualstatement about the Review after questions on the same day would emphasise that in addition to the changes which might otherwise benecessary the Government had decided this year to give a special
increase in the guarantees for the beef and dairy herds and for pigs,in order to provide the capital resources needed to finance the selective expansion programme and so save imports.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of C (67) 26.(2) Agreed that the Annual Review White Paper attached tothe memorandum should be published on Wednesday,15th March.EconomicSituation(previous reference:CC (67) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5)Trade Figuresfor February1967SECRET4. The President of the Board of Trade said that the Februarytrade figures were now available and showed that exports in Februaryamounted to  453 million and imports to  522 million. The exportfigure showed some fall from the record figure for January 1967 andthe total for imports was also less than the January figure. The deficit in the trade balance was  3 million, representing a fall since theprevious month when it was  7 million. During the last three months,exports had been at a rate 20 per cent higher than during the last quarter of 1964.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the President of the Boardof Trade.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th March, 1967.
