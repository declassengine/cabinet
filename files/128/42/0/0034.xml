SubjectDefence Expenditure Studies
CC 34 (67)secret the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (C (67) 81) on Far East Defence Policy and anote by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C (67) 87) to which was attached a letter to the Prime Minister from the Prime Minister of singapore.The Defence Secretary recalled that at their meeting on11th April the Cabinet had decided that, in consulting with our alliesabout our policy in the Far East and in particular about our intentionto withdraw from Singapore/Malaysia, we should leave open for decision in June/July whether or not we would maintain maritimeand air forces in the Far East area after this withdrawal and, if so,of what size they should be. The initial consultations which he andthe Foreign Secretary had had with the Governments of the UnitedStates, Australia, New Zealand, Malaysia and Singapore had beenmade much more difficult by our inability to state a willingness tomaintain such forces on a continuing basis. All five countries were opposed to our deciding now to withdraw wholly from Singapore/Malaysia in the mid-1970s and even more strongly to an announce-ment of this intention in July when the defence expenditure studieswould be completed; they considered that this would seriously impair the political stability of the area. In a recent letter to the PrimeMinister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, the Prime Minister of Singapore, had stressed his concern lest that by announcing an intention to leaveSingapore in the middle 1970s we should cause a complete loss ofconfidence in the area. In addition to our general interest in themaintenance of this stability, we had a particular interest in thesurvival of the present regime in Singapore since its co-operation with us was of paramount importance to an orderly rundown of our forces there. The Prime Minister would be visiting President Johnson later that week and it was essential to decide now whether he should saythat we might be willing to maintain a continuing military capabilityfor use in the Far East after 1975-76. We must also recognise that,if we were to decide to announce in July that we planned to leaveSingapore/Malaysia by the mid-1970s, it might be essential to announce simultaneously our intention to maintain a continuingcapability in the area; otherwise the present Administration in singapore might collapse in the next 12 months. It would, however,be premature to decide now on the character, scale and deployment of any capability that we might finally decide to maintain for use,if required, in the Far East since this must await decisions on our defence policy as a whole in the light of the defence expenditurestudies. Although these were not yet completed, the work done sofar indicated that, within a defence budget of  1,800 million (at 1964prices) for 1975-76, a useful capability could be provided for thispurpose. Taking account of the forces that would be required inany event to discharge responsibilities to our remaining dependent territories, to help friendly Commonwealth Governments or to serve as part of a United Nations force in the peace-keeping role,the additional cost of maintaining such a capability would not be8160
large since it would be part of the forces which we should require for other purposes: even if we were to deploy some part of it inthe Far East, the extra cost would only be about  10 million annually. The forces giving this capability might comprise a smallnaval force, including amphibious units either based on sharedfacilities in Australia or using facilities in Singapore maintained bythe Singapore Government, with Army and RAF forces available forreinforcement from the United Kingdom and perhaps sent outperiodically for exercises to Australia and Singapore or Malaysia.But no decisions need be taken now on these matters or on the part which a deployment of our Polaris submarines East of Suez or a continued use of Gurkhas might play in our plans. The future position of the Gurkhas was set out in detail in C (67) 81.In discussion it was argued that it would be mistaken policy forthe Government to make a commitment in respect of their defenceposture and oversea policy which would not have effect until asfar ahead as 1975-76. Constitutionally, the present Governmentcould not commit a successor Government by a mere pronounce-ment of intention, while politically we could not foresee thecircumstances in the latter part of the 1970s in which such a commitment might take effect. Furthermore, it was questioned whether the maintenance of a military capability for action in theFar East, in the terms proposed by the Defence Secretary, might notentail some additional defence expenditure. Such additional expenditure would admittedly be entailed if some form of UnitedKingdom military presence in Australia were to be involved. such expenditure would involve the corresponding curtailment of the government&apos;s plans for social and economic expenditure in theUnited Kingdom, plans which our lack of rapid economic growthwould in any event restrict below the minimum that was desirable.In general, a declared intention to continue to play a military role in the Far East in the latter half of the 1970s would be out of accord with the role in the world which this country could in future afford to play and could only lead to yet further reductions in that role in1the near future. In these circumstances, there was considerable support for the view that we should not in any event commit ourselves to maintaining a military presence in Australia after1975-76, in the sense of stationing forces in that country, though some Ministers who took this view felt that it would be acceptablethat we should declare an intention to maintain a military capabilityfor use in the Far East to meet commitments assumed by theGovernment of the day, on the understanding that the maintenanceof such a capability did not involve maintaining forces beyond thosewhich were required for our other policies and commitments.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a declaration thatwe would maintain a military capability for use in the Far East after1975-76 did not in reality entail any new commitment. On thecontrary, it implied a very large reduction of our existing commitments. It was of the greatest importance to our economic policy that we should reduce our prospective defence expenditure and the only theatre to which it was practicable and in accordance
with our own vital interests and security to look for majorreductions over the next few years was the Far East. To achievesuch large reductions (which were the largest we had ever made inso short a period except immediately after a World War), it was essential that we should at least plan our military forces and weaponspolicy on the basis that we should have withdrawn from the mainland of Asia (save from Hong Kong) by 1975-76 at the latest.Our future weapons systems must be planned some 10 years ahead.In these circumstances we should at least make it clear to our alliesthat we would have withdrawn by 1975-76, though it was for furtherconsideration whether it would be desirable to make a public statement to that effect in the near future. The discussions whichthe Foreign Secretary had had in Washington on the occasion ofthe meeting of the Council of the South-East Asia treaty organisation and which the Defence Secretary had subsequently hadin Malaysia and Singapore showed that we could not hope to obtainthe acquiescence of our allies in a withdrawal from the mainland ofAsia by that date unless we were now to give them a commitment that we would maintain a military capability for use in the Far Eastthereafter. Even if we made such a commitment, there would be theutmost difficulty in negotiating the reduction of our forces and ofour commitments in the intervening period. Unless we obtained the aquiescence of our allies in this manner we could not effect a withdrawal in accordance with our present plans (and therebyachieve the necessary savings on defence expenditure): the alternative would then be either to continue our presence for a longer period,or to withdraw precipitately in the face of opposition to our allies in a manner which would, by jeopardising local political and businessconfidence, risk the overthrow of the existing regime in Singapore,with the consequent danger of disorder which would not only entailincreased defence expenditure, but put at risk the security of our forces, of their dependants and of other British subjects in the area.In these circumstances, it was strongly urged that, while we neednot decide until the final conclusion of the defence expenditurestudies in July whether or not we should maintain after 1975-76 amilitary presence in Australia, it was essential that the Prime minister on his forthcoming visit to Washington should be in a position to assure the President of the United States, and that we shouldconcurrently assure our other allies, that we would maintain a continuing military capability for use in the Far East in the manner proposed by the Defence Secretary.In further discussion, note was taken of the conclusions of theDefence Secretary&apos;s paper regarding the stationing of the polaris submarines East of Suez and the future of the Gurkhas. TheCabinet were informed that the Ministers concerned had decidedthat in any event we should not seek to acquire the Poseidon missilesand there was agreement that, although there should be no commitment, it would be appropriate that in the course of had discussions the Prime Minister should ascertain the views of thePresident on the possibility of stationing the Polaris submarines east of Suez.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that our main objective must be to obtain the acquiescence of our allies inour plan to remove our forces from Singapore/Malaysia by the mid-1970s, having run these down by about half by 1970-71. Wemust also seek to reduce our commitments in the area in accordancewith the intended reductions in our forces. If we were to achieve this, it appeared that we should have to pay a price by indicating a willingness to maintain a military capability for use in the Far Eastbeyond the mid-1970s. The purpose of this capability would be tomeet any commitments that we might be shouldering in the area atthat time; the size, character and deployment of any such capabilityneed not be decided now.The Cabinet Approved C (67) 81.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st May, 1967.
