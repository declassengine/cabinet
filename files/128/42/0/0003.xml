CC 3 (67)confidential. The Foreign Secretary drew the attention of the Cabinet toPress reports that certain members of the Government were makingpreparations, extending in one case to contractual arrangements, forthe publication of their personal memoirs in due course and that forthis purpose they were maintaining diaries recording the course of current discussions in Cabinet. If these reports were true, issues ofpropriety and collective responsibility might be involved; and it was for consideration whether any action was required.The Prime Minister said that the relevant section of &quot; Questionsof Procedure for Ministers &quot; (C (P) (66) 5) provided guidance aboutthe categories of literary activity in which Ministers could properlyengage. These did not, of course, include works involving the disclosure of official information, in relation to which Ministers were subject in principle, like all other individuals, to the provisions of theOfficial Secrets Acts. In practice, however, it had always beenaccepted that an individual who had carried a significant degree ofresponsibility for the conduct of public affairs and was thereforepersonally and publicly accountable for his actions was entitled to enjoy reasonable facilities to defend his reputation and his record of office. It was a recognised and established convention that for thispurpose a former Minister might continue to enjoy access to theofficial documents which he saw, or himself originated, while he heldoffice, not excluding memoranda circulated to the Cabinet and the records of Cabinet discussions. Nevertheless, this convention was soadministered as to prevent, so far as possible, both direct quotationfrom official documents where this would involve a breach of thePublic Records Act, 1958, and the disclosure of differences of view between an individual Minister and his colleagues at the relevant time.It might not always be of the first importance to seek to enforce thesestipulations rigorously in cases where no more was in question than,e.g., a volume of memoirs written by an individual who had finallyretired from public life and was removed from all current political controversy. But tacit breaches of the convention in relation to thecurrent transaction of a Government&apos;!? business were moreobjectionable in so far as they could not but tend to undermine the relationship of trust and confidence between colleagues which layat the root of the doctrine of collective Ministerial responsibility.It was for this reason that any purely private or personal recordingof the course of Cabinet discussions was to be deprecated. Moreover,if it were thought that Ministers, while still holding office, were free to enter into commercial contracts for the publication of theirmemoirs or impressions in a manner which might imply a breach ofthe conventions, more serious considerations would be liable to arise.It would be particularly unfortunate if a Minister, by acting in thisway, allowed it to be thought, however erroneously, that he wasrendering himself liable to any kind of improper pressure. there might therefore be advantage in promoting a fresh review of theexisting conventions on the lines which the Foreign Secretary had suggested.
confidential parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.CONFIDENTIALEurope 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the visit which the PrimeVisit to Heads Minister and he had paid to Paris during the previous two days, to of the Europeandiscuss tne possibility of our subsequently seeking to join theEconomic European Economic Community (e.c.), had gone well as far aspersonal relationships with the President, General de Gaulle, andFrench Ministers were concerned. General de Gaulle had not raised onthis occasion the objections to our entry which had led him to veto it in1963, and the difficulties of which he had made most related to theCommunity(previous reference :CC (67) 2ndConclusionsMinute 2)The Lord President said that, in so far as the Press reports related to himself, they had no other foundation than the fact that, before hebecame a member of the present Administration, he had signed a contract for the publication, after his retirement from political life,of a book of personal memoirs together with a study of Governmentand Parliament which was intended to be a serious and responsiblecontribution to informed discussion of these institutions. Since hehad become a Minister, his regular publishers had been acquired bythe Thomson Group. He had therefore renegotiated the contract inorder to make provision for the serial rights and taken this opportunity to ensure that he would be under no obligation to publish,whether in book form or by serialisation, for five years after he ceased to hold office. This should suffice to ensure that no breach of the conventions would be involved.In discussion, it was argued that an arrangement of this kind,which related primarily to an academic study rather than to personalmemoirs and did not therefore necessarily involve any significantdisclosure of current Government business, was in a rather different category. In any event the basic issue involved was one which could never be satisfactorily regulated by rules or even conventions alone; itwas essentially a matter of an individuals good taste and personalloyalty. Nevertheless, it would be useful to re-examine the currentconventions; and if, as a result, certain changes proved to be desirable,it would be for consideration whether these should subsequently bediscussed with the Opposition in order to ensure that, so far aspossible, the main principles of conduct in this context continued torest on an agreed and bi-partisan basis.The Cabinet Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theappointment of a Ministerial Committee, under thechairmanship of the Lord Chancellor, to consider the rules and conventions governing the Ministerial use of officialmaterial otherwise than for current official purposes; andto make recommendations for any changes in those rules andconventions which appeared to be required in order tomaintain the principles., of confidentiality and collective responsibility in the conduct of Government business.
fact that the e.c. had now become a closely knit community withintimate relationships between member countries. The whole natureof the Community would be profoundly altered if not only the UnitedKingdom, but other countries such as some of our partners in theEuropean Free Trade Association were to join. An important factorfor the French Government in considering this aspect was the presentpre-eminence of French influence within the e.c. and the threat toit posed by this prospective enlargement. General de Gaulle had also raised at the final meeting the possibility of our being associated withthe e.c., though not a member of it, or even of establishing&quot; something new and different &quot;, i.e., presumably a wholly differentkind of Community; but he had in no way elaborated this concept,which clearly presented numerous difficulties both for the membersof the e.c. and for ourselves. Among other things, it might well become purely a device for imposing delay and preventing our entry into the Community. We had also put clearly on record the other major difficulties which would arise if we were to join the e.c., butdiscussion had otherwise centred primarily on the position of sterling.That discussion in no way related to the parity and the FrenchPremier, M. Pompidou, had gone clearly on record in stating thatit would have been wrong for the United Kingdom to have devaluedthe pound in July 1966 and that such action on our part wouldfurthermore have caused difficulties for France. The discussion hadrelated almost wholly to the implications of the sterling balances forfunctioning of the e.c. if we were to become a full member.The Prime Minister said that, while the visit did not in any wayappear to have changed the view of General de Gaulle that he would prefer that we should not join the e.c. at present, it had clearly madehim reconsider a number of aspects and he had said that he nowrecognised a clear difference between the attitude of the UnitedKingdom Government on the present occasion and that which the then Administration had demonstrated during the 1961-63negotiations. In discussion of technological collaboration General de gaulle had enquired why the successful collaboration which we already had with the French Government in respect of thedevelopment of military aircraft could not be extended to other fieldsbut he had accepted our answer that the present collaboration wasonly possible because the Governments were the buyers of the aircraftconcerned, whereas in civil technology collaborative products wouldbe in market competition with foreign products. Relatively little hadbeen made by General de Gaulle on this occasion of our links withthe United States and he had taken our point that we should seek to strengthen Europe so that it might play its proper part in relationboth to the United States and to the Soviet Union.In discussion the following points were raised:(a) The objection raised by General de Gaulle to the weakening,through our entry and that of other countries, of the existing intimatelinks between the present members of the e.c. was an aspect whichmight also weigh considerably with the Five and we should consider
how best we should present our position in order to avoid a hardeningof sentiment on this aspect.(b) While in certain circumstances it might prove that the concept of a different kind of association between a wider group of european countries might suit our interests, it would not only be whollydisruptive to the present series of visits if we were to seem to favour the idea at present, but it must also be recognised that the negotiation of such a different association would inevitably take so long a time that it might be indefinitely prolonged. We might therefore fail to gain either the advantages of entry into the Community or those of adifferent kind of association. In particular, if we were to seem to favour this alternative possibility it would gravely damage ourposition in relation to the Five and therefore the possibility of their being willing to use their influence with General de Gaulle to seek.an accommodation of our difficulties.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statements by the PrimeMinister and Foreign Secretary.Oversea AffairsGermany:offset agreement(previous reference :CC(66) 65thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that there was disturbing news ofthe action which the Federal German Government might take on theOffset Agreement. In discussions which he and the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson) had had earlier in the week withthe State Secretary, Herr Schutz, the latter had informed them that ameeting of the German Cabinet which was due to be held that day,Herr Strauss, the German Federal Minister of Finance, wouldadvocate that no further offset payments should be made after the ending of the current agreement in March 1967 and that any offsetpayments made in 1968 should be very small. We had naturallyrepresented to Herr Schutz the very serious view which the UnitedKingdom Government would take of any decision to that effect. our ambassador in Bonn had been instructed to make representationsaccordingly and similar representations would also be made by theUnited States Government. It v/ould be premature to seek to reach any conclusions at the present time on the action which v/e shouldtake if the German reply proved to be in the terms which had beenforecast. The position would be clearer after the current meeting ofthe German Cabinet and would be considered by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee early the following week. We must bearin mind the binding nature of our obligation under the Treaty ofBrussels not to withdraw troops against the wishes of the majority ofthe High Contracting Parties, though the Treaty made provision forthe review of our commitment if the financial conditions of carryingthem out were unacceptably onerous. It would be important for us at this stage to seek, to maintain the goodwill of the other parties tothe Treaty and to work in close concert with the United States in the tripartite discussions.In discussion the point was made that there might be somedisadvantage in our being too closely associated with United States
Iraq(previous reference :CC (65) 36thConclusions,Minute 2)Ghana(previous reference :CC (66) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.views during the tripartite discussions in view of the importance ofobtaining the agreement of our European allies to action which we might wish to take under the Treaty of Brussels. Our action must,moreover, have full regard to our strategic views on defence needs in Europe and the importance of not exposing our allies and ourselves to military danger.The Foreign Secretary said that for some time there had been a financial dispute between the Iraqi Government, the SyrianGovernment and the Iraq Petroleum Company (IPG) which was now coming to a head. One of the difficulties in the situation was thatthe IPG consisted of a group of four big international oil companies,each of which was concerned to decide the action which the IPCcould accept in Iraq in the light of its own world-wide interest. Thisinevitably led to delay in the IPC deciding their course of action andto protracted negotiations. The IPC had in the event made an offer to pay the Iraq Government the full sum which they required,including the money which was necessary to meet demands which the syrian Government had also put forward. They were not, however,prepared to make that payment direct to the Syrian Government,but only to provide the money to enable the Iraqi Government topay it in turn to Syria. Our Ambassador in Iraq had urged them tomeet the request of the Iraqi Government on this point but the IPChad declined because of the pressures to which such action on their part would subject the constituent companies elsewhere. Theirmanaging director had now been instructed to refuse to meet the IraqiGovernments proposal. It was likely that the outcome would be the nationalisation of their assets without compensation, an outcomewhich the companies forming the IPG on balance considered to beless disadvantageous to them than meeting the demands of the iraqi Government in full.The Commonwealth Secretary said that there was likely to bea serious deterioration in our relations with Ghana because of thedecision which the Home Secretary had very properly taken not to order the extradition of Mr. Kwesi Arm ah, the former Ghana HighCommissioner in London, to stand trial in Ghana. The HomeSecretary had acted in pursuit of the discretion given to him in theFugitive Offenders Act of 1881 because there was a political element in the charges made in Ghana against Mr. Armah. He was in full agreement with the action which the Home Secretary had taken, butthe present Ghana Government had reacted most adversely to it,partly on the grounds that this would be politically advantageous tothe former President, Dr. Nkrumah, and partly on the ground thatit represented a slur on the Ghana courts of justice. It might prove necessary to defer or cancel the visit which he himself was due topay to Ghana the following week to take part in the opening of theBritish Trade Fair.
international discussions(previous reference :CC (67) 1stConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there had beena successful meeting at Chequers the previous weekend between theFinance Ministers of France, Germany, Italy and the United Statesand himself for the discussion of current rates of interest. There hadbeen general agreement that the Governments concerned would wishto see general interest rates reduced and action would be taken where appropriate. Bank Rate would accordingly be reduced that day by\ per cent. This would be advantageous to our own internal economicsituation as well as to budget costs and our balance of payments.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.AircraftIndustrySonic BangTests(previous reference:CC (66) 39thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 10) by theMinister of Aviation on proposals to undertake sonic bang tests.They also had before them a note by the Minister of Aviation(C (67) 11) covering a report by the Official Committee on theEconomic Prospects of the Concord.The Minister of Aviation said that, while it would be premature to discuss the economic prospects of the Concord, the officials&apos; report had some relevance to the question of sonic bang tests because it made it clear that, if the public reaction to sonic bangs resulted in theprohibition of flying by supersonic transports (SSTs) over land, the traffic available to the Concord would be reduced by a factor of 0-55to 0-6, with a consequent reduction in sales. Tests had alreadybeen undertaken in the United States, France and Britain, but more work was required to enable the Governments to determine theirpolicy in respect of overflying not only by the Concord but also by theSSTs which would be developed by the United States. &quot;It would notbe wise for us to avoid sonic bangs by prohibiting supersonic flightsover the United Kingdom, since&apos; apart from the implications for our. attitude towards the Concord this would encourage other countries to adopt similar restrictions, to the detriment of its prospects.It was therefore proposed to arrange for tests to be carried out byRAF Lightnings during a period of six to nine months beginningin May 1967. In order to avoid the expense of moving the Lightningsfrom their present base, and thus of interfering also with the training programme, it was proposed that the tests should be carried out overan area which would include Hull and Grimsby. About five bangsa day would be created in order to assess public reaction to themaintenance of a constant high rate of bangs over a period. This hadnot been done in the tests carried out over Oklahoma City whichhad been based on a steady increase in the number of bangs until theend of the programme. There would be scientific examination of the physical effect on buildings, social survey by the Central Office ofInformation of the reactions of the public and an analysis of
complaints. Legislation was required to empower the Minister of aviation to authorise flights over specified areas, to prohibit legal proceedings in respect of noise from test aircraft, and to providestatutory compensation for injury, loss or damage. This would, ineffect, extend to flights by military aircraft the provisions of theCivil Aviation Act enabling damages to be claimed against the operators of civil aircraft without requiring proof of negligence. Thecost of the tests was estimated at  225,000; compensation paymentsmight amount to less than  100,000.In discussion of whether tests should be undertaken it wassuggested that new tests would be unlikely to add significantly tothe information already obtained elsewhere and that to undertaketests unnecessarily would merely stimulate public opposition and, ifpublic objection proved to be strong, damage the commercial prospects of the Concord; the outcome of the tests could not have a bearing on the question whether we should proceed with thedevelopment of the Concord, since on this we were alreadyinescapably committed by our legal obligations. On the other hand it was argued that if public objection to sonic bangs proved to beso strong as to imply a need to restrict severely the operation of theaircraft, and hence to throw doubt on its commercial viability, this might in itself afford a ground which did not exist at present forreopening our agreement with the French and might also influence the assessment which the French themselves had made of the economiccase for proceeding with development. If there were to be tests, there might be some advantage on this and other grounds in undertakingthem jointly with the French.The Cabinet then considered the. necessity for legislation.The Lord President said that in order to secure the passage of aBill by May, it would be necessary to take all stages on the floor ofthe House of Commons. A Bill of the character proposed would belikely to occupy a considerable amount of time, to the detriment ofthe remainder of the Governments programme. In thesecircumstances, it was for consideration whether legislation was essential, or essential this year rather than next.The Attorney-General said that he had advised that legislation was necessary because the Government ought not to undertake,without specific authority from Parliament, flights which were likelyto cause damage and nuisance. In the absence of legislation, membersof the public might seek injunctions to prohibit the flights. He didnot, however, agree that the right to sue for damages should be set aside. The provision in Section 40 of the Civil Aviation Act 1949prohibiting actions in respect of nuisance did not provide an analogysince it applied only where the aircraft in question was flying at aheight which in all the circumstances was reasonable: this wouldnot be the case where the aircraft was flying with the deliberateintention of causing a sonic bang. The Government should acceptabsolute liability for damage and permit recourse to the courts indefault of agreement.  Most claims would be settled out of court.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it haddisclosed a number of issues which required further consideration andclarification. In these circumstances the Cabinet were not as yetwilling to reach a conclusion on the desirability of tests. All the relevant questions, including the nature and timing of any necessary legislation, should be considered by the Home Affairs Committee,which should if possible reach a decision both on the necessity fortests and on the ancillary problems.The Cabinet Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for theHome Affairs Committee to consider in the light of their discussion the issues raised in C (67) 10 and to report their conclusions to the Prime Minister.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,26th January, 1967.
