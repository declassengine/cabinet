SECRET .  3CC 73 (67)confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons when the House reassembled after the christmas Recess.93SECRET2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(C (67) 192) and a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C (67) 193) on public expenditure.Public The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he had thought it rightExpenditure t0 eXp]ajn to his colleagues the reasons why it was imperative to(Previous secure substantial savings in public expenditure in 1968-69 and in C.C (67) 68th succeeding years. We faced a difficult situation as regards confidenceConclusions, abroad. In addition, all the evidence emerging from studies of the minute 3) requirements of economic policy following devaluation showed thatM or Sa n a vei*^ *ar e s^1^t G^ resources ^nto exports and import savings wouldin a 1968-69 8S ^e needed over the coming months: both considerations of confidence and succeeding and analyses of the needs of the economy pointed in this direction,years Only a massive switch of resources would enable us to earn asubstantial balance of payments surplus in 1969 and 1970. It wasthen that we should be feeling the full benefits of devaluation andit was essential that we should secure surpluses in those years sufficientto enable us to meet our obligations for repayment of debt and tobuild up our reserves and strengthen our borrowing rights so as todeal with any balance of payments difficulties which might recurin later years. In order to effect the necessary transfer of resources,it would be essential to hold back the planned growth of public expenditure: increased taxation was not an alternative.The Supply Estimates for 1968-69 as submitted to the Treasuryprovided for an increase of 11-8 per cent above this year&apos;s figure.Additional expenditure arising out of devaluation, to the extent thatit could not be absorbed, might bring the increase over 12 per cent.Such van increase would be substantially the &quot;highest since thatproduced by the Korean War, and the publication of Estimatesshowing an increase on this scale might have a dangerous impact on confidence abroad. The corresponding increase of 9-4 per centin 1963-64, which was part of the boom leading to a balance ofpayments deficit of  800 million, was the next closest increase tothat now in prospect. The increase last year which, in apparentlymuch easier circumstances, evoked wide criticism, was 8 - 5 per cent.It was therefore essential to secure a substantial reduction inthe prospective increase of 12 per cent. He was not at present puttingspecific proposals for savings to his colleagues, since more time was needed to consider these important issues. Nor was he atpresent proposing any specific percentage rise in the Estimates whichwould be acceptable: this would not be the best way to approach the problem since decisions taken over the next few weeks could have little impact on expenditure in 1968-69 and indeed only alimited effect in 1969-70. The main requirement was for theGovernment to put forward proposals for major policy changes8648
which would produce savings which were clearly identifiable andwould carry conviction; only if this were done would we securethe necessary impact on confidence at home and abroad. The aim should be to announce new measures as soon as Parliament resumed;and, if decisions had been taken in time, it might be desirable to recall the House of Commons a day earlier. He had had bilateral discussions during the present week with the Ministers in chargeof the main spending Departments and would be holding further discussions with them over the Christmas holidays.He invited the Cabinet to endorse the main argument in his memorandum, and the conclusion that the Government mustre-examine the main areas of public expenditure, both defence and civil, without being bound by past commitments in order to securesubstantial and clearly identifiable savings.In discussion there was general support for the argument ofthe memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theconclusion he put forward. It was suggested, however, that the prospective increase in the Supply Estimates for 1968-69 wasunexpectedly large. It went beyond the target which the Governmenthad previously set of an annual increase in public expenditureof 41 per cent over the period to 1970; and it exceeded the increaseenvisaged in the Governmenfs survey of expenditure to 1970carried out during the summer of 1967. While the increases werethe result of collective Ministerial decisions, it would be useful if theCabinet could be provided with a full explanation of how they weremade up.It was further pointed out that Supply Estimates often gave an exaggerated picture of the prospective increase in actual expenditure, since it was common for expenditure to fall short ofthe Estimates by a substantial amount, though the short-fall in1968-69 was unlikely to be as great as in recent years. It was unfortunate that because of the misleading impression given inthis way by the annual Estimates, the Government should incurcriticism and possible loss of confidence abroad. There was acase for considering some change in procedure in order to obviatethis: one possibility might be to publish simultaneously with theEstimates a White Paper surveying public expenditure over the next three years. A further problem about the Supply Estimates wasthat it was difficult to assess the real situation which they reflectedbecause they were expressed in terms of current prices, so that theeffect of price rises since the preceding year and the prospectiverise in the year to which the Estimates related was not shown.It was also desirable to consider the Supply Estimates in relation tothe total of public expenditure.In further discussion the following points were made (a) While major policy changes would be essential in orderto secure savings of the order required, it was also necessary tosecure all possible lesser savings by severe pruning of theDepartmental programmes in the Estimates. This should proceed without waiting for the major policy decisions.
- 5  494CC 73 (67)(b) The First Secretary of State said that since all areas of spending were to be examined regardless of previous commitments,it would be all the more important for the Government to establishproper priorities. So far as concerned the social services, he hadalready had it in mind to circulate a memorandum to his colleagues in the Social Services Committee proposing that they should examinepriorities both within and between the social service Departments.There had not hitherto been any systematic attempt to assess the comparative value of different elements of the Governmenfs socialprogramme. The present need to make major savings added urgencyto this and he would bring the matter before his colleagues at anearly date.(c) The decisions to be taken on public expenditure would inevitably be painful and would place a considerable strain on the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament. It would be necessaryto do everything possible to consolidate support for the government&apos;s policy; and to this end it was desirable that the governments supporters should be given a clear picture of the situation whichwe faced and of the magnitude of the transfer of resources whichwas called for.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet fully endorsed the general policy on public expenditure setout in the memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer. Hewould now arrange for a group of Ministers to meet under his chairmanship in the following week with the object of agreeingbroad directives on the areas in which major savings should besought; the Chancellor of the Exchequer would then be able to pursue his bilateral discussions with Ministers in charge of spendingDepartments within the ambit of those directives. The cabinet should consider a report from the group of Ministers at a meetingon Thursday, 4th January, and should hold further meetings as necessary in order to enable an announcement ,pf the new measuresto be made when Parliament resumed. The Chancellor of theExchequer should arrange that, when the Cabinet resumed their discussion, they should have before them memoranda explainingwhy the increase in the Supply Estimates for 1968-69 was greaterthan was envisaged at the time of the review of public expenditurein July 1967, and dealing with the points raised in discussion,including the relation of the sums in the Estimates to likely actual expenditure and the price terms in which the Estimates were framed.Finally, the Cabinet agreed that without waiting for major policy decisions on public expenditure, the Estimates for 1968-69 shouldbe subjected to the severest scrutiny in order to secure all possiblesavings.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the conclusion in C (67) 192 that it would be essential to secure major savings in public expenditurein 1968-69 and the succeeding years.
(2) Took note, with approval, of the arrangements for furtherconsideration of this matter outlined by the PrimeMinister in his summing up.(3) Agreed that, independently of the consideration of policy decisions on public expenditure, the Supply estimates for 1968-69 should be severely scrutinised to secure allpossible savings, and invited the Ministers in chargeof spending Departments to co-operate with theChancellor of the Exchequer to this end.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulatememoranda for consideration at their resumed discussion as indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up.(5) Took note that the First Secretary of State would circulate to the Social Services Committee at an early date amemorandum on priorities in the social services.(6) Agreed to resume their discussion on Thursday, 4th January,1968.approach to Europe(previous reference:CC (67) 69thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that it had not been his intentionto make a statement that afternoon in the House of commons on the outcome of the Ministerial meeting of the European economic community (e.c.). But, following the Parliamentary questions on this subject the preceding day 3.11(1 in tlic light of the outcome of the meeting of the e.c. Ministers, he now felt he must seek the authority of the Cabinet to make a statement that afternoon.He would as soon as possible circulate to the members of the Cabinetthe text of the announcement by the Ministers of the e.c. followingtheir meeting; but, in brief, the outcome had been such that wehad now secured the objective endorsed by the Cabinet on 30thNovember (CC (67) 69th Conclusions, Minute 4) namely &quot; to urge the Five to insist on fixing a date in January for the opening of negotiations, and so force the issue with the French either on18th-19th December or at the beginning of January &quot; (C (67) 187,paragraph 2 (b)). In the event the Five had stood up very firmlyto the intransigence of the French, indeed much more firmly than we had hoped, in supporting to the end the Commission^ proposition that negotiations should be opened with the States which had applied for membership. As a result, we had succeeded ineliciting a clear veto by the French on the opening of negotiations.It was now necessary to decide how we should proceed. a contingency planning memorandum, prepared by officials of theDepartments principally concerned under Cabinet Officechairmanship in response to the Cabinefs request of 30th November(CC (67) 69th Conclusions, Minute 4) was now ready for circulation.Its main conclusion was that, in the circumstances which we nowfaced, whilst the overriding priority of our external economic policy for the next few years must be the re-establishment of our economic position and stability, there was in the long term no satisfactory alternative to United Kingdom membership of the e.c.. He agreed with   this   conclusion,   which   was   also   consistent   with   the
Parliamentary Answer given by the Prime Minister in the Houseof Commons on the preceding day.   On that basis, we shouldhave three main aims in the immediate future.   The first shouldbe to maintain the longer term objective of full membership ofthe Communities as a valid and credible policy in the eyes ofpublic opinion here and in Europe.  Second, we should ensure sofar as possible that the Communities were prevented from developingparticularly in ways which Would make it more difficult for usto join them later.   Third, we should preserve, to the greatestextent compatible with the first two aims, our freedom of actionin the economic field pending our achievement of full membership.Whilst it was  clearly unrealistic to  think  in terms of full membership as long as President de Gaulle was in office, we should maintain our application for membership and make arrangementsfor consultation and common action with the Five in pursuanceof the three aims he had outlined.   The Five were now anxiousto develop, in collaboration with us, activities which would befruitful in themselves and would provide them with a reasonablebasis for ensuring that we should participate in future developments in the Community  (e.g., the Italians were  keen to developtechnological collaboration).   He had been assured by the DutchForeign Minister (Dr. Luns), with the authority of the DutchCabinet, that an agreement for mutual consultation would besufficient to achieve the second objective to which he had referred;and Dr. Luns had accordingly already summoned the Dutch Ministerof Agriculture out of the meeting of Agriculture Ministers of the six, which would not be resumed.   The Dutch had thus placeda veto on the agricultural negotiations within the community and so prevented progress with the review of the common agricultural policy in the completion of which the French and germans had important, though conflicting, interests.   Similarly,the pending meeting of the Finance Ministers of the Six had been cancelled; and the Five were thus taking the line that the unanimityrule should now apply to all Community decisions, with the effectthat the Community could make no progress.  He therefore sought the approval of the Cabinet for the three aims which he had setout at the beginning of his statement; and also for authority to consult confidentially with the Five and to make the most of theirresentment of French intransigence.   He also proposed to seek a high level meeting between the United Kingdom and the Five toconsider   the  consequences   of   the   French   veto the  ItalianGovernment were considering taking an initiative to this end.Such a meeting might discuss arrangements between the UnitedKingdom and the Five both for consultation and for joint actionin limited fields and might make a re-affirmation of the goal of a united Europe.  It would be desirable that the other three countriesapplicant for membership of the Community should be present atthis meeting, in order to make clear that the issue was not simplyone between the United Kingdom and France.   It would also benecessary in the near future to hold a meeting of EFTA at ministerial level to consider the position he had outlined.   In
sum, he could report that the objective set by the Cabinet on30th November to urge the Five to &quot; force the issue with theFrench either on the 18th-19th December or at the beginning ofJanuary &quot; had now been secured, and that we were now well placed to make use of this position. He had outlined the steps we shouldtake to meet the immediate tactical situation with which we wereconfronted; but the Cabinet would need to consider later ourlonger term position, and the memoranda necessary for this wouldbe circulated shortly.In discussion general agreement was expressed with the foreign secretary&apos;s report and proposals. It was very satisfactory that theFive had been so robust and that the Cabinefs objective ofsecuring an early and definitive answer to our application for membership had been achieved. It was clearly essential that theForeign Secretary should make a statement in the House ofCommons that afternoon based on the report he had made to theCabinet, though it would be desirable to avoid any overt referenceto the intentions of the Five to inhibit the development of theCommunity and our own attitude in that respect. It would be important to avoid saying that we saw no long term alternative to membership of the Community and to adhere to the establishedformula that, although there were alternatives, none of them could bemore than a second best. Nor should our longer term position, whilstrecognising that the United Kingdom was part of Europe and that relations with Europe would remain the most important part ofour foreign policy, be foreshadowed in terms which might limit the Cabinefs freedom to consider that position later or prejudge our attitude towards compromise solutions for a relationship with the eec falling short of full membership. On the other hand therewas no evidence that any of the Five would now press us to adoptany solution other than full membership; nor should such a solutionbe a satisfactory one for us. Moreover, any indication that wewere prepared to consider such compromise solutions would undermine the determination of the Five to maintain our rightto negotiations for full membership; and the maintenance of thestrength of the position taken up by the Five must now be theprime objective of our European policy. Whatever merits a compromise proposal might have, whether it came from the five or the Six, it would be bound to afford the French President anew opportunity to weaken the position we had now attained andto press his own aims further. One advantage of our presentsituation, which we owed to the way in which our approach to europe had been handled, was that, in contrast to our positionin 1963, the French Presidents rejection of our candidature would no longer come as a shock to public opinion; and it was important that this advantage should not be eroded.The Foreign Secretary said that in his statement to the Houseof Commons he would take account of the points that had beenmade in discussion. He proposed that his statement, after reporting the position reached in Brussels and paying tribute to the efforts ofthe Five on our behalf, would reaffirm our European purpose,would confirm that  our  application for membership of the
Communities still stood, would specifically state that we nowproposed to consult with the Five and with the applicants for membership and, whilst deploring the French veto, would make clear that we regarded the veto as European, and not simply an anglo-French, issue. Since, however, every part of his statement would be most carefully examined on the Continent for any hintof a change in our posture, it would be essential for him, for thereasons the discussion had brought out, to be very firm about theattitude we had taken up in regard to full membership.In further discussion it was emphasised that our relations withthe United States would be of special importance in the period inwhich we were excluded from the Community. American patiencewith the French Presidents policy had now worn very thin; and,whilst there might be elements in the American administration which were not wholly sympathetic to our European policies, theattitude of the Administration as a whole and of its senior memberswas firm in our support.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theimmediate question for decision was the response to be made in theForeign Secretary&apos;s statement that afternoon to the outcome of thediscussion by the Ministerial Council of the e.c. on our applicationfor membership. There was general agreement that our responseshould&apos;be such as would strengthen the determination and positionof the Five, who were now inclined to demonstrate that, if a vetocould be used in spite of Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome, itcould be used in respect of other aspects of the Community&apos;activities. The Cabinet endorsed the line proposed by the foreign secretary; and he should accordingly make a statement to theHouse of Commons that afternoon on the lines indicated in his report and in the Cabinefs discussion. He would arrange for theearly circulation to the Cabinet of the memoranda which had beenprepared, in accordance with the Cabinefs&apos; request of 30thNovember, as a basis for consideration of our position in the eventof our exclusion for some time from membership of the Community.&apos; The Cabinet-      ^i/sf&apos;^^^&apos;^^&apos;&apos;-&apos;&apos;1 &apos;.&apos;&apos;:;v:.&apos;&apos;.: --(1) Took note with approval of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make a statement to theHouse of Commons that afternoon on the lines indicatedin the Prime Ministers summing up.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to pursue the proposals putforward in his report for a confidential exploration withthe Governments of the Five of the scope forcollaborative action with them, including the possibilityof a high level meeting with the Five and with theother applicants for membership of the e.c. to considerthe consequences of the French veto.8648b
(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for theearly circulation of memoranda on which the cabinet would further consider, after Christmas, our positionduring the period in which we were excluded from membership of the Communities.IndustrialPolicyIndustrialExpansionBill: draft white Paper(previous reference :CC(67) 64thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 195) to which was attached adraft White Paper on the Industrial Expansion Bill.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that a meetingof Ministers under the chairmanship of the First Secretary of state had given further consideration to the draft White Paper on industrial expansion; and the draft attached to his memorandum reflected the agreement reached at that meeting. The early part of thedraft had been modified so as to take account of the implications of devaluation and to give a tauter and more coherent presentation of the case for the Industrial Expansion Bill.In discussion it was argued that in the new conditions whichwe faced following devaluation, there was a case for postponing,or even abandoning, the Industrial Expansion Bill. The bill would not enable the Government to do anything which they couldnot do under existing powers: indeed it appeared that, once theBill was enacted, it would be necessary to present schemes toParliament and secure the passage of Orders for projects whichhitherto the Government could have carried out under existing powers. There was considerable suspicion of the Bill on the partof industry; and there was some evidence that this was beingcarried to such lengths as to create apathy towards the exportopportunities opened up by devaluation. It was vital at the presenttime to restore confidence both at home and abroad: and towithdraw the Bill would make an important contribution to this,would in no way weaken the economy and would be a far lesspainful decision than those which would face the Government inthe coming weeks.On the other hand it was argued that it would be wrong for the Government to reverse their policy at this stage. Theyhad not yet presented the full case for the Bill in public; and,once this was done, it was likely that the opposition in industry,which was based on ill-considered ideological reactions, wouldabate. There was no reason to suppose that, if industry was reluctant to exploit the opportunities opened up by devaluation, thatreluctance would be diminished by abandonment of the Bill.Despite the pronouncements by the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI), there was a good deal of evidence that leading figures in a number of industries were anxious for the Government totake the- kind of action in their industries which the Bill would facilitate. Moreover, the powers conferred by the Bill could beused in ways which would assist the transfer of resources intoexports and import saving which was now required.   If the Bill
were dropped, it would be necessary to introduce four separateBills to deal with particular projects for which the industrial expansion Bill would make special provision; this would createserious difficulties for the Governmenfs legislative timetable.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet agreed on balance that the Government should go ahead with the Industrial Expansion Bill.In discussion of the draft White Paper, the following points weremade (a) The first part of the last sentence in paragraph 2 shouldbe deleted so that the sentence would read &quot; The legislation wouldnot confer any compulsory powers &quot;.(b) At the end of paragraph 4, there should be added a sentenceto the effect that in the longer term, the selective and timely useof the powers envisaged under the Bill would help to secure thefull advantages of the new situation.(c) In view of possible difficulties with our partners in theEuropean Free Trade Association, the reference to aluminiumsmelting in paragraph 6 should be omitted. It would almost certainly be necessary, however, to mention the aluminium smelting project in the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill.(d) The statement in the first sentence of paragraph 13, thatthe powers under the Bill would be used for projects which theGovernment judged it to be in the national interest to support,might be held to imply that the Government intended to thrustsupport upon industry whether or not industry wanted it. to correct this, the sentence should be expanded, possibly by the insertion of a cross-reference to the relevant part of the white paper, to make it clear that the Government would use its powers under the Bill only by agreement with the firms concerned.(e) There was general agreement that, while it would not bepossible to use the new powers in the Bill without first defining the relevant scheme in an Order laid before Parliament, this wouldnot preclude the Government from taking action of the kindenvisaged under the Bill by virtue of their existing powers where this seemed appropriate or convenient. The wording of paragraph17 of the draft White Paper did not conflict with this.(/) The words &quot; pay due regard to &quot; should be deleted from paragraph 18.In further discussion there was general agreement that theWhite Paper, revised in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, shouldbe published on the same day as the Government made the proposed statement of new measures on public expenditure which they had discussed under the previous item on the agenda. The industrial expansion Bill should be introduced into Parliament on the same day and published on the following day.
The Cabinet-(1) Invited the. Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toarrange for the draft White Paper annexed to C (67) 195to be revised in the light of their discussion and tobe published on the same day as the proposedGovernment statement on public expenditure.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology, in consultation withthe Lord President, to arrange for the industrial expansion Bill to be introduced in Parliament on thesame day as the White Paper was published and to bepublished on the following day.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st December, 1967.
