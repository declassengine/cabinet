secret. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the maindevelopments since the Cabinet had last discussed the situation inthe Middle East had been the report that the Straits of Tiran hadbeen mined by the Egyptians, the adjournment without a decisionof the debate in the United Nations Security Council, the visit ofthe United Nations Secretary-General, U Thant, to Cairo and&apos; aproposal by President de Gaulle for a four-Power initiative to reducetension in the Middle East. The approaches which we had made sofar to other maritime nations regarding a declaration on the freedomof navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba did not suggest that there wouldbe widespread support for robust action. The Foreign Secretary&apos;discussions in Moscow suggested that the Soviet Union wished toavoid war in the Middle East, but nevertheless she was givinguncompromising support to the United Arab Republic (UAR). the aim of the United States was to dissuade Israel from openinghostilities by providing her with assurances that the right of innocent passage by sea through the Gulf of Aqaba would be secured.They wished to be able to do this when Mr. Eban, the IsraeliForeign Minister, visited Washington on 26th May following hisvisits to Paris and London. Unless Israel could be brought to believethat the right of innocent passage would be assured by diplomatic action, she was likely to take early military action to secure it,since if she had to fight delay would be to her military disadvantage.Very early assurances were therefore essential. The Minister ofState for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson) was discussing in washington a programme of diplomatic and possibly military action with the United States Government designed to safeguard this rightof innocent passage. Any proposals that might emerge would bead referendum to both Governments.In discussion differing views were expressed on the extent towhich the situation in the Middle East had become more dangeroussince the Cabinefs previous discussion. The involvement of theFrench Government through their recent proposal was a favourablefactor, whereas the Soviet Union and the United States were now more clearly and publicly in confrontation in the area. Havingregard particularly to the Suez operation of 1956, it was in our interest not to be seen to be taking the lead in international actionin the present situation and it was for this reason that Canada and denmark rather than ourselves had at our request called for therecent meeting of the Security Council. So far as diplomatic action was concerned, there was general agreement that, before any furtherstep was taken to canvass support for a declaration by the principalmaritime Powers in favour of the right of innocent passage throughthe Straits of Tiran, we should first follow up the French initiativefor a quadripartite meeting of Permanent Representatives to theUnited Nations of the four Powers to discuss the situation. If theSoviet Union refused to take part in this or any action in theSecurity Council, our aim should be to secure French participation in further action with the principal maritime Powers.
As regards military action (should this become necessary) toenforce the freedom of passage for ships to the Gulf of Aqaba, the initial proposals of the United States, which rested heavily on the useof British Naval forces in the Red Sea, including the aircraft carrierHMS Hermes, were unacceptable to us politically and were militarilymisconceived. The Ministers primarily concerned were to discuss themilitary assessment of the situation with the Chiefs of Staff underthe Prime Ministers chairmanship later that day and we hoped to persuade the United States that the right course militarily would beto use, if necessary, a small force of minesweepers and frigates inthe Gulf of Aqaba for escort and minesweeping duties, backed bypowerful deterrent forces in the Eastern Mediterranean. If force had to be used we must not be, nor be thought to be, in the lead andit was essential also that countries other than the United States andthe United Kingdom should contribute to any force used, though their forces might not be able to arrive on the scene at the outset. Inthe meantime, action was being taken to ensure that appropriateNaval ships would be available for use if necessary, but neither thisnor any agreement that might be reached with the United States onthe best military solution to the problems would commit us to action without further consideration by the Cabinet.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Mulley) should leave for Paris immediately, provided this was acceptable to the French Government, to follow up the Frenchinitiative.  The Minister should warmly welcome this initiative and seek agreement that the meeting which they had proposed of thePermanent Representatives of the four Powers in New York shouldtake place that evening if the Soviet Government would agree or, ifnot, at the earliest possible moment. Further instructions should besent to the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Thomson)in Washington.  He should be authorised to complete the militarydiscussions with the United States on the clear understanding thattheir conclusions and any action flowing from them were adreferendum to both Governments concerned. His instructions shouldendorse the first paragraph of the agreed summary (in telegramNo. 1753 from Washington) of the discussions so far with the state department, to the effect that the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates would press for effective action through the United Nations,in particular at the current meeting of the Security Council, to guarantee the freedom of passage through the Straits of Tiran andthe Gulf of Aqaba. They would seek to ensure that any resolutionincluded an endorsement of the principle of freedom of passage. Ifthe Soviet Government abstained, the principle would have receivedUnited Nations approval.  In the event of a Soviet veto, action bythe maritime Powers would nevertheless be seen to have receivedwide international support.    Mr. Thomson should be furtherinformed that we welcomed the initiative of the French Governmentand were seeking an urgent meeting in Paris to pursue it with a view,if possible, to a quadripartite meeting in New York later that dayof the Permanent Representatives to the United Nations of the four
RegionalEmploymentPremium(previous reference:CC (67) 21stConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs andthe Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (67) 83) on the regional employment Premium (REP).The First Secretary of State said that it was now possible to assess the public reactions to the proposal to introduce REP whichhad been put forward by the Government in the recently publishedGreen Paper.  There had on the whole been a favourable reactionCC 32 (67)Powers. This should precede any further canvassing of our proposalfor an international declaration by the principal maritime Powerson the lines proposed in the second paragraph of the agreed summaryin Washington telegram No. 1753. We should seek to associate theFrench Government as closely as possible from the outset with boththe United Kingdom and the United States Governments in theproposal for such an international declaration when the time came to pursue it further. It should be made clear in the discussions in washington that the United Kingdom did not wish to appear to betaking the lead in a declaration on the freedom of navigation in theGulf of Aqaba and any international force which might be establised for the purpose of maintaining that freedom should not be solelyAnglo-American. Any naval force for minesweeping or escort dutiesdn the Gulf of Aqaba should therefore include ships from othercountries than the United States and the United Kingdom. It mightbe some time before these could reach the scene, but this could beaccepted provided that the countries concerned associated themselves with the declaration and committed themselves to provide such ships.Meanwhile, the Commonwealth Secretary should arrange for theCanadian Prime Minister to be informed of the way in which we were seeking a solution of the problem so that he might be fully aware of the Governmenfs views before any discussions which he mightbe having later that day with the President of the United States.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Mulley)-(a) to pursue discussions with the French Government onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister: and(b) to send instructions to the Minister of State forForeign Affairs (Mr. Thomson) in Washington onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to arrange for atelegram to be sent to the Canadian Prime Minister onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister.
by the responsible Press and opinion among economists had beendecidedly in favour of the proposal. The reactions of regional economic Planning Councils had been mixed, those covering regionswith heavy unemployment welcoming the proposal, while others inregions outside the development areas which nevertheless had considerable employment problems tending to emphasise theharmful effects on their regions of a further measure of preference for the development areas. The Confederation of British Industry(CBI) and much, though not all, opinion in industry had been hostile to the proposal. The Trades Union Congress (TUC) on the otherhand supported it. The Ministerial Steering Committee on economic policy had considered what course the Government should take inthe light of these reactions and had agreed that they should go ahead with the introduction of REP by means of a new clause to beintroduced at the Committee stage of the Finance Bill. TheCommittee had been conscious that REP was by no means the final solution to the problems of the development areas, but it offered the best prospect of reducing unemployment in these areas without giving rise to inflationary pressures or endangering the balance ofpayments.One of the main criticisms made by the CBI had been that theshortage of skilled labour in the development areas would be likelyto frustrate the intended effects of REP in reducing unemployment.,The CBI had informed him that they had proposals to make for increasing the supply of skilled labour in the development areas andhe proposed to discuss the matter with them. It would be desirable for the Government to be able to announce further measures to expand training facilities at the same time as they announced their decision on REP.The Ministerial Steering Committee had considered the case foradjusting the existing boundaries of the development areas if REPwere introduced arid for providing some form of special assistanceto those regions outside the development areas with particularemployment problems the so-called &quot; grey areas &quot;. On balance,the Committee did not favour either of these courses. If special assistance were given to selected areas outside the development areas, there would inevitably be pressure from still further areas for similar help and the eventual result would be seriously to weaken the present preference given to the development areas. TheCommittee had agreed, however, that the Government, at the sametime as they announced their decision on REP, should also announce the commissioning of a study in depth of regional economic policieswith a view to publishing a further Green Paper on this subject in,say, 18 months&apos; time. This study would examine the problems ofthe &quot; grey areas &quot; and possible action that could be taken to help them, including such matters as improvement of communications.The Green Paper had proposed that the Government should give an assurance that, if REP were introduced, it would continue tobe paid for at least five years. The Ministerial Steering committee agreed that, in order to ensure an adequate incentive to firms to move
to development areas, the assurance should cover seven years insteadof five. It was intended that before the REP was eventuallyterminated the amount of the premium should be gradually taperedoff over a period of years. The Committee had considered whethertapering should begin before the expiry of the seven-year period so asto phase out the premium completely by the end of that period. This,however, would run counter to the purpose of giving an assurancerelating to a longer period than that proposed in the Green paper and the right course would be to give an assurance that the premiumwould continue at the full rate for at least seven years.It would be necessary to decide whether REP should be paid tothe nationalised steel industry. Nationalised industries in generaldid not receive the existing premium under the Selective employment tax (SET) and would not receive REP. But the nationalised steelindustry would present a different problem in that it was essentially amanufacturing industry.In order to demonstrate that the Government had taken full account of the criticisms which had been made of the proposal forREP, it would be desirable to publish a White Paper setting out themain criticisms and the replies to them. It would also be highly desirable to arrange a debate in Parliament, since Parliament had not hitherto had an opportunity to express views on the issue. It was for consideration what attitude the Government should adopt insuch a debate. Ideally, the Government should make clear that theywould take account of views expressed in the debate before coming to a decision; but since only a few days would elapse between the debate and the putting down of the necessary new clause to theFinance Bill, such a posture might be regarded as unrealistic. TheGovernment should therefore announce during the debate their decision to introduce REP, but should say that decisions on particularaspects, such as the coverage and duration of the scheme and therate of premium, had not yet been made and account would be taken of the views of Parliament in determining these matters.In discussion, there was general support for the proposals outlined by the First Secretary of State. Time should be found fora debate in Parliament, even if this meant using a day which hadalready been set aside for proceedings on the Finance Bill.In further discussion it was argued that it would be necessaryto consider carefully whether REP should be paid to the nationalisedsteel industry in view of the discrimination which this would involvebetween some important firms in the industry. For example, the plant of Richard, Thomas and Baldwin Limited at Newport, whichwas outside the development area, would not be eligible for REP.It was planned to extend this plant and it might well be more economic to site this additional capacity at Newport than elsewhere;but the fact that plant at Newport would not be eligible for REPmight bring in question these plans for expansion. On the otherhand, it was argued that there was an overwhelming case for paymentof REP to the nationalised steel industry.   The industry was at
present eligible for the national premium under SET since it was amanufacturing industry; the fact that the major part of it was about to be nationalised should not be allowed to affect the position. Ifthe nationalised part of the industry were to be excluded from REP,this would put it at an unfair disadvantage as compared with that part of the industry which would remain in private hands. payments of REP to the steel industry would not imply that it should also bepaid to other nationalised industries, since they were properlyregarded as service rather than manufacturing industries for purposesof SET. Discrimination between competing firms in the sameindustry was an inevitable feature of REP which would not be confined to steel.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the Government should proceed with theintroduction of REP on the lines proposed by the First Secretaryof State. While the balance of view was in favour of payment ofREP to the nationalised steel industry, this question should be further considered by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy with aview to reaching a decision before the debate in Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should introduce the regional employment Premium.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord President of the Council (i) to arrange for the publication of a White paper setting out the main criticisms of the proposal for regional Employment Premiums and givinganswers to them;(ii) to arrange for a debate in Parliament on the regional employment Premium.(3) Agreed that the Government should announce their decisionto introduce the Regional Employment Premium duringthe debate in Parliament, but should indicate that decisions on particular aspects (such as the coverage and duration of the scheme and the rate of premium) wouldbe deferred in order to take account of views expressed inthe debate.(4) Agreed that, subject to consideration of views expressed inthe debate in Parliament, the Regional employment premium should be paid to manufacturing industry in thedevelopment areas at the rates set out in paragraph 8 ofthe annex to C (67) 83; and that the Government should give an assurance that the premium would continue to bepaid at the full rate for at least seven years.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for anew clause to be moved at the Committee stage of theFinance Bill to provide for the introduction of the regional Employment Premium.
(6) Invited the First Secretary of State to commission a study of regional economic policies and to arrange for this tobe announced concurrently with the government&apos;s decision on the Regional Employment Premium.(7) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theMinister of Labour and in the light of further discussionwith the Confederation of British Industry, to consider what measures to increase the supply of skilled labour in development areas might be announced concurrently withthe decision on the Regional Employment Premium.(8) Invited the Minister of Power to circulate a memorandum tothe Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy on thepayment of the Regional Employment Premium to the nationalised steel industry.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th May, 1967.
