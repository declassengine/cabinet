The Foreign Secretary said that a number of conflictingstatements had recently been made in Bonn about the position ofthe Federal German Government on the continuation of the GermanOffset Agreement. An authoritative statement had, however, nowbeen made by the Government spokesman which made it clear that,whether or not the current tripartite discussions between the UnitedStates, Germany and ourselves on the level of forces and offsetpayments in Europe resulted in agreement on further changes, theFederal German Government would maintain their offer to providea total of  31^ million in the following year in offset payments, ofwhich  22^ million would be in the civil field. It also appearedfrom our discussions with members of the Federal German Cabinetthat they now accepted that there was a difference between ourown problem and that of the United States in respect ofoffset payments: both they and members of the United states administration accepted the need for the tripartite discussions to result in an additional alleviation of the burden upon us. these issues would be considered in more detail at a meeting that evening of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee.The Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Gordon Walker) said thatthe previous day it had appeared that we had reached agreementwith the Maltese Government on the basis on which negotiations should be held on the rate of reduction of our forces in Malta andthe way in which the economic consequences of this reduction couldbe alleviated. We had offered to suspend action on the reductionof our forces pending the outcome of the negotiations, provided thatthe Maltese Government for their part agreed not to take furthertheir Bill to amend the Visiting Forces Act and to stop theharassment of our forces. The Maltese Prime Minister had, however,so far declined to stop the harassment of our forces until thenegotiations had reached a satisfactory conclusion. The acceptanceof such a condition would put us in a position of considerabledifficulty and the issue would be further discussed by the defence and Oversea Policy Committee. If the Maltese Prime Minister wereto maintain too rigid a line in this respect he would forfeit all public sympathy in the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note of the statements made by the Foreign secretary and the Minister without Portfolio.7888a 2SECRETParliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. They were also informed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would present his budget on Tuesday, 11th April.
Prices andIncomesThe Futureof Prices and incomes Policy(previous reference:CC (67) 8thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (67) 20) on the future of the policy on prices and incomes.The First Secretary of State said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision at their previous meeting, he had held further consultations with the Economic Committee of the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) and with the Confederation of British Industry(CBI). He had explained to them that the Government remainedof the view that in the present economic situation, it would not bepossible to move immediately from the present phase in which theGovernment possessed wide statutory powers under Part IV of thePrices and Incomes Act to a position in which no statutory powers were available other than the limited provisions of Part II. this did not mean that the Government regarded the policy as something which they could impose on the trade unions and management; onthe contrary, they attached the greatest importance to the successfuldevelopment of the influence which the TUC and CBI could exercisein furtherance of the policy. It had, however, always been clearthat the TUC and CBI would be faced with great difficulties inmaking a voluntary policy effective in the face of challenges byminority groups and the Government therefore believed that it was essential that they should hold some statutory powers in reserve fora limited period after the expiry of Part IV. In these circumstances the Government believed that the right course would be to activatePart II and beyond that to seek powers which would be exercisableonly to enforce recommendations by the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI). These additional powers would take the formof extending to 12 months the maximum period during which a standstill on increases in prices or pay could be enforced; theprevention of retrospective payment of wage increases for a standstillperiod; and enforcement of price reductions in appropriate cases.These new powers would be taken for one year only and would notbe renewable without further legislation: but no undertaking couldbe given at this stage whether such further legislation would or wouldnot be introduced when the time came.The Economic Committee of the TUC had not been prepared toaccept these proposals. They continued to maintain that the right course was to leave them to operate the policy on a voluntary basisthrough their own vetting machinery. They recognised that theycould not guarantee to deal effectively with challenges to such apolicy by minority groups, but they maintained that such challengeswould be insignificant and could be ignored. This attitude was difficult to reconcile with the tuc&apos;s previous support for theactivation of Part IV the previous year because they felt that without it minority groups opposed to the policy would secure an unfairadvantage and thereby jeopardise the policy. This was precisely thesituation which we should face again after the expiry of Part IV.The CBI did not welcome such legislation. They would prefer a completely voluntary policy to be given a trial, without even the
activation of Part II. They had also reacted sharply to theproposal for a power to enforce price reductions in pursuance of recommendations of the NBPI, but they were unlikely to press their objections as hard as would the TUC.Although he had not mentioned this to the TUC, it was forconsideration whether, in addition to the new powers he had mentioned, the Government should take a further power to deal with cases where price or wage increases were implemented before theycould be referred to the NBPI. Such cases were bound to arise and it was desirable to have power to deal with them by requiring the increases in question to be rescinded pending a reference to the nbpi.He had put to the TUC the proposal that, instead of a fixedpercentage norm, the amount which could be allowed for wage increases in any given year should be expressed in money terms as anational dividend. The TUC had not favoured this. His impression was, however, that they might be brought to accept it in time. they already accepted that there should be an annual discussion betweenthe Government, the CBI and themselves on the economic situation as the basis for settling prices and incomes policy for each year. Itmight be possible to formulate a national dividend as part of thisperiodical examination. For immediate purposes however there were two alternative approaches to the problem of an incomes norm:first, that no one would be entitled to a wage increase unless this was justified in relation to criteria which might approximate to those setout in the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy (Cmnd. 2639) this would be in effect a &quot;nil norm &quot;; alternatively, there could bea low norm which, in order to preserve a credible relation with the likely growth of productivity, would have to be no more than 2 percent and be accompanied by stricter criteria. For the 12 months from July 1967 he recommended the first alternative: a 2 per centnorm would mean that everyone was entitled to expect a pay increasemerely as a result of the passage of time and we could not affordthis. Moreover, adoption of a 2 per cent norm would raise in an acute form the question of the rate of economic growth at which theGovernment should aim and might result in the TUC or CBIpromulgating a norm different from that of the Government. Whilethe TUC did not welcome a &quot; nil norm &quot;, it. seemed likely that thiswas what they were expecting, and that they would prefer this toa low percentage norm with stricter criteria. The CBI also would support a &quot; nil norm &quot; with more flexible criteria.The Minister of Labour said that the General Council of the tuc had considered the Governments proposals on the previous day. He understood that, while one or two members of the council had indicated a willingness to contemplate the retention of somereserve powers by the Government, this view had not been pressedand the outcome had been a unanimous rejection of the governments proposals.   This made it virtually certain that the conference of
activation of Part II. They had also reacted sharply to theproposal for a power to enforce price reductions in pursuance of recommendations of the NBPI, but they were unlikely to press their objections as hard as would the TUC.Although he had not mentioned this to the TUC, it was forconsideration whether, in addition to the new powers he had mentioned, the Government should take a further power to deal with cases where price or wage increases were implemented before theycould be referred to the NBPI.

He understood that, while one or two members of the council had indicated a willingness to contemplate the retention of somereserve powers by the Government, this view had not been pressedand the outcome had been a unanimous rejection of the governments proposals.   This made it virtually certain that the conference of
trade union executives on 2nd March would likewise reject theGovernments proposals. This would mean that the TUC would be committed to complete opposition to these proposals and would thenbe in no mood to negotiate further. He therefore adhered to theview that the right course was for the Government to activatePart II before the expiry of Part IV, and possibly to seek to negotiate an extension of the maximum period of delay on price and wage increases to six months; it would, however, be wrong to attempt togo beyond this. A further meeting with the TUC EconomicCommittee should be arranged and proposals on these lines shouldbe put to them. There was a reasonable prospect that the moderateelements in the TUC would still be prepared to accept this. If,however, the Government continued to insist on wider statutory powers, they would forfeit the co-operation of the moderate elements,without which the policy could not possibly be effective.In discussion it was generally accepted that, if the Governmentcontinued to propose wider statutory powers on the lines suggestedin C (67) 20, they would face strong opposition from the TUC andfrom many of the Governments supporters in Parliament. It was argued nevertheless that the Government should adhere to thiscourse. While the TUC would continue to declare their opposition,they were unlikely in practice to carry it to the lengths of industrial action designed to wreck the policy. More probably, the situation would continue much as at present with the Government making onlyoccasional and selective use of the proposed statutory powers. a voluntary policy reinforced only by the activation of Part II couldnot be expected to be effective. The tuc&apos;s vetting machinery was quite inadequate to the task; it could only deal with a small numberof negotiations at national level and would not be able to consider at all negotiations at plant level which were of major importance insome industries, notably the motor-car industry. It was already clearthat the implementation of wage claims hitherto deferred wouldmean a substantial rise in average earnings during 1967; this, coupled with other wage settlements which could be expected in the second half of the year, would represent a serious threat to the stability ofthe economy. If this materialised, it would impose further constrainton economic growth and require the maintenance of unemployment at a high level. In such circumstances it would be difficult to get theco-operation of management and unions in measures to raiseProductivity. The Governments prime responsibility was to promoteeconomic growth and ensure full employment; if concessions on incomes resulted in failure to carry out this responsibility, theGovernment would rightly incur the censure not only of those whowere now opposing the policy but also of the country as a whole.If the Government now retreated from the proposals for additionalstatutory powers which had been put to the CBI and TUC, theywould be abandoning the policy which had been considered essentialon economic grounds. Such a move would be interpreted as a retreatby the Government in the face of pressure by the TUC and thiswould have a serious effect on opinion abroad and on confidence in sterling.
On the other hand, it was argued that, if the Government wereto take wider powers in the face of trade union opposition, those powers would prove unenforceable. They were likely to be challenged not only by smaller unions and those elements which had consistently opposed the incomes policy, but also by some at least of the major unions. The trade union movement as a whole couldbe expected to support any such challenge and the Governmentwould be powerless to meet it. There was also a danger, if wider powers were taken, of forfeiting the co-operation of employers, whichwas essential for the effective administration of the powers overprices embodied in Part II: these were more extensive than was oftenrecognised. There was moreover a risk, if the Government persisted in seeking wider powers, that this would wreck the chances of acceptance by the unions of the tuc&apos;s proposals for a voluntarypolicy with the result that there would in the end be a return tounrestricted bargaining. The prospects of a voluntary policyachieving a reasonable degree of wage restraint should not be under-estimated. The TUC were genuinely anxious to make it succeed.If it were backed by the powers in Part II and effective in restraint on price increases, there was a fair prospect that the trade unions would exert less than their full bargaining power and an acceptablemeasure of restraint would be achieved. If, however, experienceshould show that such a policy was proving inadequate, this wouldnot mean that we should necessarily be faced with an economic crisis of the dimensions of that of July 1966. The effects of some degreeof wage inflation on industry&apos;s competitive ability would take timeto appear. The country&apos;s basic economic position was radicallybetter than in 1966; it was accepted by opinion abroad that theprospects of our achieving a substantial balance of payments surpluswere realistic. It should be possible to avoid a crisis of confidenceso long as the Government were seen to be in control of the situation.Pronouncements by TUC spokesmen to the effect that they would prefer a reversion to &quot; stop-go &quot; policies rather than accept statutory powers in the incomes field were unlikely to represent the true viewsof the TUC General Council. If it were demonstrated that the failureof a voluntary policy was contributing to economic stagnation and high unemployment, the TUC would then be likely to accept theneed for statutory powers in the incomes field and the Governmentwould be in a strong position to take them. The right coursetherefore was to modify the proposals for additional powers in sucha way as to offer some prospect of securing the acquiescence of the tuc. It was important that this should not be seen as a retreat inthe face of TUC pressure; but the Government could reasonablyargue that it had formulated its final views in the light of consultations with the main organisations concerned and that a policy on incomeswhich was basically voluntary represented the objective which theyhad consistently sought.In further discussion it was suggested that it would be desirable for the Prime Minister to seek a meeting early in the following week
with the Economic Committee of the TUC and to try to persuade them to accept the following measures:(i) Activation of Part II.(ii) New legislation, valid for one year only, extending themaximum period of standstill under Part II to six months,and taking power to prevent retrospective payment of wage increases following the imposition of a stand still and to enforce price reductions where recommended bythe NBPI.It was however urged that a reduction in the maximum period of delay from twelve to six months would be regarded by the TUC asless important than the proposal to prevent retrospective wagepayments; in any case, to offer a reduction in the maximum periodspecifically to six months would be premature. The power to preventretrospective wage payments was however bound to be strongly opposed by the TUC and its inclusion might prejudice the chances of securing acceptance of the package as a whole; it would thereforebe better to drop this proposal. On the other hand, it was argued that the retention of this power was vital. If the TUC rejected itand if this rejection were confirmed at the conference on 2nd March,this need not be taken as final. There would be further opportunitiesafter the March conference of bringing pressure to bear on the TUC.It should be made clear to them that the Government were not atthis stage prepared to accept a rejection and there must be a processof continuing consultation on this and any other outstanding issues.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed on balance that he should arrange to see theEconomic Committee of the TUC early in the following week,accompanied by the First Secretary of State and the Minister ofLabour. He would stress the importance of an effective policy on prices and incomes in securing long-term economic growth with full employment, and would put it to the TUC that the alternative to such a policy would be a reversion to &quot; stop-go &quot; measures. Hewould say that, while the Government were anxious that the tuc and CBI should develop voluntary arrangements for carrying outthe policy, in view of the difficulties involved in this the government regarded it as essential to retain some reserve powers; they therefore proposed to activate Part II before the expiry of Part IV, and they considered that the maximum period of standstill which could be imposed on wage and price increases under Part II should beextended. He would not propose to adopt a rigid position on whatthat extension should be; he would make it clear that this was amatter which the Government would be prepared to consider further with the TUC. He would go on to tell the TUC that in theGovernments view it was necessary to take power to prevent theretrospective payment of wage increases following the imposition ofa standstill; that the Government recognised the difficulties whichthis proposal raised for the TUC and were not proposing to take adecision immediately; further consultations would be desirable andthe conference on 2nd March, while important, should not be
secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda on Family Endowmentby the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister without portfolio (C (67) 17), by the Secretary of State for Education and science (C (67) 9) and by the Minister of Social Security (C (67) 7,8 and 19).The Minister of Social Security said that further considerationsince their previous discussion had confirmed her in the view thatthe association of a general increase in family allowances with areduction of income tax child allowances, calculated so as to ensurethat the higher income families were neither better off norsignificantly worse off on balance (&quot; give and take &quot;), constituted themost acceptable and the most effective approach to the problem of child poverty. It would enable additional family allowanceexpenditure to be concentrated substantially on families with incomesbelow supplementary benefit level, thus enabling a significantproportion of those families to be brought above that level at fairlymoderate additional cost, without the need for a separate incometest and without any significant redistribution between richer andpoorer families as such. It also enabled a degree of help related to income to . be given to families with incomes little abovesupplementary benefit level but below the level attracting the standard rate of tax. This would help to offset the effect of the proposed increases in school meal and welfare milk charges and in national insurance contributions as well as prospective increases in rents.Presentationally, also, it was important not to appear to concentratesolely on the lowest income families. The net extra cost of a 10s.family allowance increase, associated with a reduction of income7888bregarded as in any way setting a term to consideration of this andother issues. There would be no question of withdrawing theproposal for a power to prevent retrospective wage payments as aresult of the meeting with the TUC without further reference to theCabinet. We should seek to continue consultations after theconference on 2nd March and it might prove possible to secureTUC acceptance of a power to prevent retrospective payments inreturn for concessions on other matters for example on themaximum period of delay under Part II. The meeting would be concerned primarily with the question of statutory powers: decisions on the incomes norm and criteria for wage increases should be left for later consideration.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister would arrange an early meeting with the Economic Committee ofthe Trades Union Congress to discuss further the future ofthe policy on prices and incomes on the lines indicated inhis summing up of their discussion.
tax child allowance of  45, would be  32 million a year, though itwould be  48 million in the first year. On this basis the family ofthe ordinary standard rate tax payer would lose 4d. a week for each child after the first, but this loss could be eliminated at the cost ofa further  6 million a year. Some 57 per cent of families withincomes at present below supplementary benefit level, including some65 per cent of all children in such families, would have their incomesraised above that level. This was a higher proportion of childrenthan would be brought above supplementary benefit level by the combination of an income tested allowance and an increased family allowance for the later children of larger families proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer. The additional cost in 1968 couldbe met within her public expenditure allocation, since national insurance benefits would not be increased in that year; additionally,the scheme would make possible the proposed increase in school mealcharges which would result in substantial savings.There were strong objections on grounds of social policy to theintroduction of any form of income-tested allowance as a means of concentrating additional financial help on the lowest income groups.She had recently received a deputation from the Social InsuranceCommittee of the TUC which had expressed strong opposition toany form of income-tested allowance, and had indicated a preference for a general increase of family allowances for all families associatedwith taxation changes to ensure that the effective benefit was directed to the lower income groups. These views had subsequently been confirmed by the General Council.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an increase of 10s.in family allowances would cost about  160 million a year gross.Under the &quot; give and take &quot; proposal this would be largely financed by reducing income tax child allowances, but it would still benecessary to find from general taxation the substantial sum of 48 million in the first year and  32 million a year subsequently.Family allowances were unpopular among the older members of thecommunity and among wage earners generally, and until recentlythere had been no pressure to increase them. The &quot; give and take&quot;type of scheme involving a general increase of family allowances would be neither a popular nor an effective way of relieving childpoverty, since the benefit was insufficiently concentrated on the families in most need. Further, the scheme would result in anincrease in the tax liability of some 3J million wage earners at a timewhen substantial increases in taxation were likely to be needed forother reasons.With the Minister without Portfolio he took the view that amore positive approach was needed which would enable the limited resources available to be concentrated to greatest effect where themost pressing needs had been identified. He suggested that this could best be done by a combination of specific measures. Thedetail of this combination would need further consideration, but hesuggested that some of the elements should consist of a scheme ofsupplementary family allowances, applied subject to an income test,
7888cbut adapted to help those who had to pay high rents, together withan increase of perhaps 5s. in family allowances for fourth and subsequent children and special provision for the rehabilitation of primary schools in educationally deprived areas. This app. oachwould enable a higher proportion of families with incomes belowsupplementary benefit level to be brought above that level at lowercost than any &quot; give and take&quot; type of scheme and would inparticular enable relief to be given to one-child families. while recognising that the introduction of an income test in this field wasnot free from difficulty, such tests had been widely accepted else wherein the social services without the disincentive effect feared by the tuc.In his view the choice lay between thr adoption of a new andmore selective approach relating improved provision closely to need,or perpetuating the policy of making universal provision irrespective of need, with the consequence of having to increase taxation on theone hand or reduce services elsewhere on the other. If the Cabinetconcluded in favour of a general increase in family allowances he must reserve his position as to the means by which this should be financed and as to the implications for expenditure on other services.In discussion there was general agreement that the extent of child poverty required an effective extension of family endowmenton a selective basis. Such selectivity could only be applied by eitherincome testing, which was an essential feature of the schemesuggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, or the &quot; give and take &quot; approach with its association of a general increase in family allowances with an increase in the tax liability of all tax payers with children eligible for family allowance. .,In further discussion of the implications of an income-testedallowance there was some difference of view and the following main points were made:(a) Adoption of income testing would involve a departure fromthe principle of universality, which could have repercussionsthroughout the social services, including the health and education services, and should be considered in this wider context.(b) On the other hand the principle of universality referredprimarily to the universal availability of services and did not exclude the application of income tests to non-contributory cash benefits. a clear distinction could be drawn between the latter and benefits suchas pensions, which were financed on a contributory basis.(c) The problem of family poverty could not adequately be met by means of additional cash allowances alone. The improvedprovision of services which was also necessary could more readily be afforded in association with income-tested cash provision than with the more expensive &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme.(d) Public antipathy to means testing had little rational basis and that the application of an income test in the field of family allowances might be the more generally accepted since public attention
had been focused on the limited extent of the problem in terms of numbers of families. On the other hand, it was suggested thatconcentration of benefit on the lowest income groups would be criticised as destroying working incentives where these were most needed.(e) Relief to the poorer families might be secured earlier throughthe introduction of income-tested allowances, since the introductionof a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme would have to wait until april 1968. It would not, however, be practicable to introduceincome-tested allowances as a purely interim measure, while a small increase in family allowance, for example for the fourth and fifthchild, could be given in 1967 and subsumed later in a &quot; give and take&quot;scheme.(/) There would be practical difficulties in applying an incomestest to people in full-time work, and income-tested allowances were likely to be more costly in terms of staff than the &quot; give and take&quot;type of scheme.In relation to the &quot;give and take&quot; type of scheme, it wassuggested that although for families on the standard rate of tax theincreased family allowances would almost balance their increased taxliability, the increase of general taxation required to finance thehigher family allowances for the lower paid would impose anadditional tax burden on the higher-paid families. There was some support for the view that the acceptability of the scheme would depend on a means being found of avoiding any extra cost to families with children, whatever their income. The following main points were also made:(g) An undertaking had been given in the Labour Party&apos;sElection Manifesto to seek ways of integrating income tax allowanceswith cash benefits. The &quot; give and take &quot; approach, in endeavouringto confine the benefit of additional family allowances to those who did not benefit from income tax child allowances, was consistent withthe approach already accepted in the Option Mortgage scheme.(h) On the other hand, the &quot; give and take &quot; type of schemeinvolved a substantial disturbance of the tax system, which wouldbe widely resented and misunderstood, in order to confer benefit ona relatively small number of families.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theCabinet agreed on the need to extend family endowment on a selective basis in order to alleviate child poverty. On balance theywere opposed to the introduction of income testing as a means of achieving selectivity and favoured an increase of family allowanceson the lines of the &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme proposed bythe Minister of Social Security, provided that a means could be found of ensuring that no extra cost fell on families with children. Thedetails of a scheme of this kind should now be examined further;and its implications should be considered in relation to, among other things, the proposals circulated by the Secretary of State for education and Science in C (67) 9. It would also be necessary togive further consideration to the implications for policy on family
ParliamentTelevising theHouse of Lords(previous reference:CC (66) 56thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council and the Lord Privy Seal (C (67) 21) on theproposed experiment with televising proceedings in the House ofLords.The Lord President recalled that the Cabinet had agreed on10th November to authorise a joint experiment in televising bothHouses of Parliament at a cost, in respect of the House of Lords,of  18,000. In the event the House of Commons had decided not toexperiment in their House, but the House of Lords wished to do soin theirs and the Government spokesman in the forthcoming debate on the report of the House of Lords Select Committee on the subject would be expected to make clear whether the earlier offer to meetthe cost up to  18,000 stood. The actual cost of the experimentwas now estimated at  16,500. It was proposed that the Governmentshould stand by their original offer.CC 9 (67)endowments of any decision to seek to enter the European economic community and any consequent need to align the social securitysystem in this country with the European system. The cabinet should resume their discussion of family endowment at a later meeting in the light of the outcome of these further studies.Meanwhile, no publicity should be given to the Cabinefs decision.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he did not dissent from the decision to adopt a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme,he must reserve his position about the method by which it shouldbe financed.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle an improvement in family endowmenton the lines proposed by the Minister of Social security in C (67) 7, without prejudice to further consideration bythe Chancellor of the Exchequer of the fiscal means bywhich a scheme of that kind should be financed.(2) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of social Security, to arrange for a more detailed examination of the implications of the decision ofprinciple under Conclusion (1) above, in relation inter aliathe proposals in C (67) 9.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for theSocial Services Committee to consider the implications for our policy as regards family endowment of a decisionto seek to enter the European Economic Community.(4) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.
In a brief discussion, the Cabinet agreed that, notwithstanding the decision not to proceed with the experiment in the House ofCommons, the cost of the proposed experiment in the House ofLords should be met up to  18,000.The Cabinet Agreed that the cost of the proposed experiment intelevising the House of Lords should be borne by public funds up to a maximum of  18,000.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd February, 1967.
