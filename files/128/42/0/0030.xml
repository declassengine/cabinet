ParliamentSelectCommittees(previous reference:CC(67) 29thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Lord President said that, in pursuance of the Conclusionat an earlier meeting (CC (67) 19th Conclusions, Minute 2) whenthe Cabinet had discussed the practice which Ministers proposedto follow in giving evidence before the Specialist Committees andthe Select Committee on Nationalised Industries, he had seen the chairmen of the Committees and had taken the opportunity ofproposing to them the formation of a steering committee of chairmen,which could be constituted as a sub-committee of the services committee, to consider how the expenditure of the Committees could best be managed. The Chairmen had accepted this proposal and intended to have an early discussion with the Chancellor of theExchequer about their financial arrangements.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Lord President^ statement.Private The Lord President said that several Private Members&apos; Bills hadMembers made progress in one or other House and had a good prospect ofbeing enacted in the current Session if they were given some government time, but not otherwise. It would be possible to give time without impeding the Government^ programme and therewould be advantage in doing so since otherwise the Bills would be reintroduced in the next Session and the Government would come under further pressure to provide facilities.In discussion it was pointed out that it might be somewhatinvidious to facilitate the progress of some Private Members&apos; Bills andnot others and it was desirable to avoid creating an expectation that,if a Bill made reasonable progress in the House of Commons or were passed in the House of Lords, the Government would givesufficient time to enable it to reach the Statute Book.  It must bemade clear that Government assistance would depend not on theprogress of the particular Bill but on whether it could be helpedwithout prejudice to the Government^ own programme. Subject tothis, however, time on a Friday, or in a morning sitting or afterSexual Offences 10 p.m. could be made available for the Sexual Offences (No. 2) Bill,(CC (66^52 d       PurPose 0^ wn^cn to legalise homosexual acts between consentingConclusions&quot;1    adults in private-had already been thoroughly considered byMinute3)       both  Houses;  the Sunday Entertainments Bill, based on the sunday Enter-  recommendations of the Committee on Sunday Observance undertainments Bill   the Chairmanship of Lord Crathorne, which if it did not pass this(CC(66) 52nd  Session the Government might wish to include in their ownMinute 2)&quot;S&apos;    programme for the following Session; and the Employment AgenciesEmployment a use^u^ measure tne progress of which had been blocked onlyAgencies Bill by a small minority of objectors. The Live Hare Coursing (Abolition)Live Hare Bill had however been inadvertently allowed to drop notwithstandingCoursing a Government promise of time for the adjourned debate on Second(Abolition) Bill Reading and the Government should not now provide time for itto be reinstated.CONFIDENTIAL8153 a 2
MedicalTerminationof PregnancyBill(CC(66) 5thConclusions,Minute 1)The Committee then considered what action should be taken on the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill. The Bill was down for consideration of Report and Third Reading on 2nd June but was unlikely to be completed in the House of Commons unless theGovernment provided time. This might be found after 7 p.m. on 3rd July, when the 10 o&apos;clock Rule could be suspended to enablethe debate to continue until completed. It was pointed out however that to provide Government time for the Bill would imply that theGovernment were in favour of its principle, on which they had so far taken no view; and, while this would be welcome to some sections of public opinion, it would undoubtedly alarm others. Onthe other hand it was arguable that on an issue of such socialimportance the Government ought to give time (unless the Bill as itemerged from Committee was bad in form) notwithstanding thatthis might be thought to imply Government support for the principle.The provision of time might indeed afford an opportunity for the opponents of the Bill to deploy their arguments in favour of itsrejection and the appointment of a Royal Commission to considerthe whole problem. The Home Affairs Committee would shortly be considering the difficult question of the Governments approach to Bills raising issues of conscience and the extent to which ministers should be committed upon them. The Committee were also toconsider the next day proposals by the Home Secretary for theamendment of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill to removesome of the unsatisfactory features which had resulted fromamendments in Committee. In advance of this consideration it wouldnot be appropriate for the Cabinet to consider whether time shouldbe given for the Bill, particularly as the complicated issues whichit raised were not before them.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wouldbe convenient if, after the Home Affairs Committee had consideredthe Home Secretary&apos;s proposals for amending the Bill, the legislation committee would discuss whether time should be given for its furtherconsideration in the House. The Committee should, if possible, settle the matter but if they were unable to do so the Chairman, or anymember who dissented from the view of the majority, would be free to bring the matter to his own attention so that he could considerwhether it should be brought before the Cabinet. If that became necessary it would be helpful to have a full statement of the historyof the Bill and the issues of policy which it raised. As to the other private Members&apos; Bills which had been discussed, the Sexual Offences(No. 2) Bill, the Sunday Entertainments Bill and the employment agencies Bill could be given Government time as proposed, subjectto the proviso that there was no interference with the governments programme or with their plans for rising for the summer recess and that no precedent was to be created which would enable a Private Member to claim that if his Bill made progress he was entitled to expect the Government to provide time for it to be passed.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Lord President of the Council (a) to arrange for the Legislation Committee to consider,in the light of the discussion of the Medical
Affairs:e:28thons,0SECRET2. The Foreign Secretary said that we had raised at a meetingof the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) the issueof the restrictions imposed by the Spanish Government on the use of spanish air space neighbouring the Gibraltar airfield. The discussionso far had not been unfavourable to us, but present indications were that we should not secure sufficient votes to debar the imposition ofthe restrictions. These would not prevent us from using the Gibraltarairfield in normal weather, but would make its use impossible at other times and one charter firm had already switched its flights from gibraltar to Malaga in consequence. We should seek to ensurethat there was no further switching of such charter flights without previous reference to Ministers. If the outcome of the discussions in ICAO proved in the event to be unsatisfactory, it appeared thatwe must, at least for the time being, abandon any hope of securingassistance in international organisations in dealing with the mountingSpanish campaign on our position in Gibraltar, since the discussions inthe Committee of Twenty-four had also failed to impose any restraint on the Spanish Government. In such circumstances it might benecessary to consider retaliation against Spanish interests.In discussion it was pointed out that approval had recently beengiven by the Air Transport Licensing Board for one of the Britishcharter aircraft firms to switch its flights from Gibraltar to Malagabecause these flights were part of a subsequent tour of Spain bymotor coach and Spanish controls at the frontier of Gibraltar now made these impossible to operate. The issue did not relate to theimposition of restrictions or the use of Spanish air space. Therewas no requirement upon the Board to seek Ministerial approvalbefore giving authority for such changes,, but they had been asked(and had agreed) to consult the Board of Trade before approvingany other changes affecting Gibraltar in present circumstances.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in Greece had deteriorated somewhat. We were still seeking to secure the release from imprisonment of Mrs. Ambatielos, but the British Consul had recently been denied access to her on the ground that she was beinginterrogated under oath. As regards our general attitude towardsthe Greek Government we were keeping in close touch with ourTermination of Pregnancy Bill by the Home AffairsCommittee on the following day, whetherGovernment time should be provided for its further discussion in the House of Commons;(b) to arrange for facilities to be given for theconsideration by the House of Commons of theSexual Offences (No. 2) Bill, Sunday Entertainmentand Employment Agencies Bills, subject to theprovisos indicated by the Prime Minister in his summing up of their discussion.
allies, who broadly shared our view that at this stage it would bemore effective to maintain the pressure which our respectiveAmbassadors were exerting privately on the regime to appoint aconstitutent assembly and return to a form of democratic government, rather than to make known publicly our concern at themilitary coup that had taken place. On balance, it was for the timebeing to our advantage to maintain contact with the present regime,while avoiding any question of appearing to give it explicit recognition.It was questionable how long it would be open to us, or in our interest, to maintain this position, but we could not ignore the factthat we maintained relations with Governments in a number of othercountries which had resulted from military coups d&apos;etat within thelast two or three years. It might be convenient to the Cabinet ifhe were to circulate a paper explaining the present position and setting out the policy which he advocated in existing circumstances.In discussion it was urged that the Governments position was difficult to justify to its supporters and that, despite the furtherrisk to Mrs. Ambatielos which might be entailed, there were broaderreasons why we should publicly declare our sense of outrage at thecoup. The balance of view was, however, that for the time beingwe should, in concert with our allies, maintain our present policyin relation to the regime.The TorreyCanyon(previous reference:CC(67) 17thConclusions,Minute 1)Nigeria(previous reference:CC(67) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would circulate a paper on the policy which should be pursued in respect of thepresent regime in Greece.The Foreign Secretary said that the recent meeting of theinter-governmental Maritime Consultative Organisation to considerthe implications for shipping of the wreck of the Torrey Canyon hadbeen successful; and although the main outcome was that numerouspoints had been referred to sub-committees, it appeared that thiswas how the Organisation effectively carried out its business. our success had been the consequence of a well-prepared and documentedcase.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in Nigeriawas no less tense than before, but was somewhat changing in nature.Previously the Eastern Region had effectively been moving towards a declaration of independence in the face of opposition to this coursefrom the rest of Nigeria. The Western and Mid-Western Regionswere however changing their attitude somewhat and favoured a muchlooser form of Federation. This was likely to result in a diminution of the pressure which was being exerted by the Northern Regionon the East. The troops in the North were, however, undisciplinedand we could not exclude the possibility that Colonel Gowon, theHead of the Military Government, might be overthrown.The Cabinet (2) Took   note   of   the   statements   by   the  Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.
South Arabia(previous reference:CC(67) 13thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C (67) 78) on future policy in South Arabia.The Foreign Secretary said that the handling in Aden of theproblems which faced us between now and the independence of south arabia would call for wide diplomatic experience. For this reasonhe had decided that Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, formerly a memberof the Indian Political Service and subsequently of the diplomatic Service and until recently British Ambassador in Moscow,should replace Sir Richard Turnbull as our High Commissioner in aden. He would make a statement in Parliament to this effect later that day explaining the reasons for the change. He would not,however, make any firm public declaration at this stage of any decisions that the Cabinet might take about our policy towards south arabia or about the intended date of independence. To do so would cause difficulties in that country and in the United Nations and wouldbe inappropriate in view of the current visits of King Faisal of SaudiArabia and of two Ministers of the South Arabian federal government. He would however undertake to make a full statementof policy in Parliament soon after the Whitsun Recess.Developments in the preceding two months made it necessaryto reconsider some aspects of our existing proposals for the grantof independence to South Arabia. When the Cabinet had last considered the matter on 13th March, the plan had been to grant independence on 1st November, 1967, maintaining our sovereignty in Aden and our control of internal security there until then; towithdraw all our forces from the mainland of South Arabia as quickly as possible after the grant of independence but to providecarrier-based air support to the new State against external aggressionfor up to six months thereafter. The Federal Government had rejected these proposals because they maintained that their ground forces would not be ready to assume full responsibility for internal security until 1st April, 1968, and that their navaFand air forces wouldnot be ready until some months later. They had said that they wouldbe willing to accept independence on 1st September, 1968, but only if:(i) we were to transfer all responsibility for internal security in aden State on 1st March, 1968;(ii) British forces remained in support in Aden State until 1st September, 1968;(iii) we gave a Defence Guarantee for up to three years after1st September, 1968;(iv) a new Constitution were brought into force well before 1st September, 1968.In the meantime the United Nations Mission to Aden had failedto make any contribution to solving the problem and, although wemust seek to ensure the continued involvement of the United Nations,there seemed no prospect that in the timescale on which we were planning to withdraw from South Arabia we could expect to receive
much help from the United Nations. Attempts to persuade theleaders of the Front for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen(FLOSY) to collaborate in finding a solution to the problem of south arabia or even to talk to us had so far failed, despite the further efforts of the Minister without Portfolio (Lord Shackleton). They were unwilling to make any move unless they were recognised as the solerepresentatives of South Arabia, which would be quite unjustifiable:this would be a position which we could not sustain. Violence in aden was continuing and there was no sign that the United arab republic (UAR) was making any effort to reduce it.It was essential to our policy for reducing defence expenditurethat we should maintain our decision to withdraw our forces by aboutthe end of 1967. We could not accept the proposals of the federal government either as regards the continued presence of our forcesin Aden up to September, 1968, or for a Defence Guarantee thereafter.At the same time we must do what we could to improve the prospect that the Federal Government would remain in being until our withdrawal. To this end we should decide that the grant of independence to South Arabia and the final withdrawal of our forces from Aden should be deferred from 1st November, 1967, to 1st January, 1968. The naval air force should be made available for six months thereafter and we might also examine the possibility ofproviding from Masirah and Sharjah support by land-based bomber aircraft after independence. We should also seek to provide theFederal Government earlier than the summer of 1968 with the fourjet Provost aircraft due for delivery then to make up their air arm.As regards the political future of South Arabia, our aim must remain to broaden, so far as we could, the basis of the federal government. Efforts were being made, though with little apparentprospect of success, to arrange round table discussions aimed atproducing a caretaker Government of all parties and interests, whichwould include the FLOSY, the National Liberation Front, the south arabian League and the East Aden Protectorate States. If these efforts failed it might be possible to persuade one or other of the terrorist organisations to co-operate with the Federal Government.In the meantime we must continue to back the Federal government itself, although a major element in our problem was that neitherthe local population in Aden nor the Federal Government themselvesfound their survival as such credible, particularly in view of our owndeclaration in favour of broadening the Governmenfs base. Wecould not ignore the possibility that towards the end of the period there might be no local Government at all.There now remained little time in which to take final decisions on our policy for South Arabia. It would be necessary to enactlegislation before the Summer Recess giving power to grant independence to South Arabia and to debate a Bill for this purpose in Parliament towards the end of June. We must then be readyto say publicly what our intentions were.The Defence Secretary said that he was in full agreement withthe Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals, although they could mean thatthe naval task force would have to remain in the vicinity of Aden
for 1\ months. It would be important to reach early agreement onthe precise nature and role of this force and, since it would be basedon Singapore, we should seek to make arrangements for rest and recreation for its personnel in Kenya. There was reason to hopethat the Kenya Government would welcome this. As regards thedate for final withdrawal of our troops from Aden it would be essential to take a firm decision by 1st June in view of the stagewhich planning had reached. The possibility of providing bombersupport from Masirah or Sharjah had been further examined andit was now clear that this could only be done by V-bombers whichwould not be suitable for the task; no offer of such support should therefore be made to the Federal Government except in very guardedterms. Although Lord Shackleton had suggested that we should provide air support to South Arabia with aircraft based atKhormaksar this possibility had been fully examined earlier andwas not acceptable since it would mean protecting the airfield withground forces, which would inevitably become involved in internal security operations and would delay our withdrawal. There were indications that preparations were being made in the Yemen by the uar for the further use of poison gas and in view of the risk thatit might eventually be used in South Arabia we should consider issuinga warning to the UAR on the subject.Discussion showed general agreement in the Cabinet with theForeign Secretary&apos;s proposals. We should hold firm to our intentionto withdraw from South Arabia at the end of 1967, and make itclear to the Federal Government that this was our intention, whilekeeping some flexibility about the precise date in January, 1968, whenindependence would be granted and our forces finally withdrawnfrom the mainland. As regards our policy on political developments in South Arabia, no final decision could be taken until Sir HumphreyTrevelyan had had an opportunity to appraise the situation in aden and until matters had developed further in the United Nations; itwould, however, be necessary to reach decisions within a very fewweeks. In view of the proposed delay in the grant of independence to South Arabia it might not be necessary to pass-the proposed AdenIndependence Bill through all its stages before the Summer Recess.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the grant of independence to South Arabiashould be deferred until a date early in January, 1968, and that a naval carrier force should, if necessary, be stationed in the vicinity of Aden for six months thereafter. The Federal Government shouldbe informed that this was our decision. It was not possible at thisstage to take decisions on the political aspects of our policy towardsSouth Arabia, which would depend on how matters developed andon the recommendations which Sir Humphrey Trevelyan would make.But our policy should continue to be the greatest possible broadeningof the base of the Federal Government. It might be possible forsome arrangement to be reached between the various parties involvedwithout holding a formal round-table conference. There should befurther discussion about the timetable of the Independence Bill
between the Foreign Secretary and the Lord President in view ofthe later date now intended for the grant of independence to south arabia.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by the PrimeMinister^ summing up of their discussion in respect ofthe policy to be pursued in South Arabia.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with the lord president of the Council, to consider in the light of thediscussion Parliamentary timetable for the South ArabianIndependence Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th May, 1967.
