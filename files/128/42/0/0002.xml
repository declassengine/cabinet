CONFIDENTIAL 3CC 2 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Agreement had beenreached on the timetable for the further progress of the Iron andSteel Bill.EuropeVisit to Headsof Governmentof the EuropeanEconomicCommunity(previous reference :CC(67) 1stConclusions,Minute 8)confidential. The Foreign Secretary said the discussions which the PrimeMinister and he had had in Rome with the Italian Government onthe possibility of our joining the European Economic Community(e.c.) had gone as well as could be expected: indeed, rather better.The main difficulties with which membership of the community would confront us had been made clear, especially those arising fromthe common agricultural policy. He had been at particular pains to demonstrate how unfair the present system of financing that policy would be, if it were applied to new members without adjustment.Our attitude to the Treaty of Rome had been set forth in the termsagreed by the Cabinet. There had been useful explanatory discussions of the requirements of membership, and of theCommunity&apos;s policies and practices, in respect of capital movements,regional development (where the Italians had special experience),technological collaboration, and social insurance and the movementof labour.The attention of the Italian Foreign Secretary, Signor Fanfani,had been drawn to the dangers which might ensue from thediscussion among the Six of political unity in Europe at theconference he had called in Rome in the early part of April, when our approach to Europe might well be under consideration. It mightwell be that the Six themselves would not want to risk the sharpdiscords to which a further discussion on political unity might giverise at such a time.It was clear that it had been right to pay the first visit to Rome.The Italian attitude was very friendly and favourable to our accession to the Community but it would be unrealistic to expectthem to stand up to General de Gaulle in the event of his deciding to veto our application for membership, should we decide to makeone.The Prime Minister said that the Italians would like to see usin the Community, but Signor Fanfani&apos;s experience of Frenchpressure in forming Community policy had clearly made a greatimpression on him. In two sessions and in his own final summing up we had (contrary to one erroneous report which the rest of thePress had deplored) insisted that our position as the world&apos;s largestimporter of agricultural products was unique and special considera-tion would have to be given to it.7704-2
In discussion the following main points were made:(a) It seemed clear that the French were still opposed to our accession to the Community, and would like us to decide not toapply for membership, thus relieving them of the onus of opposingus. We should therefore seek to put them in the position whereopposition to our membership would isolate them.(b) The future of the French aircraft industry, on which general de Gaulle set store, was to a very large extent dependentupon collaboration with us both as regards the major joint projectson which they were engaged and as to the market for them.Nevertheless it was doubtful whether General de Gaulle would allowsuch considerations to influence his decisions on major issues offoreign policy.(c) It was unlikely that General de Gaulle would make hishostility to our accession clear in the opening discussions, just beforethe French elections. He would rather seek to persuade us to decidenot to negotiate, and it would be important at the end of the seriesof visits to see whether the Five could be brought to declare publiclywhether they thought it would be worth while for us to seeknegotiations, in order that the onus of blocking our entry (should we decide to seek it) might clearly rest on France.(d) Hence the discussions in Bonn would be particularly important. The Federal German Government were much concerned to improve their relations with the French and General de Gaullemight well hope that they would refuse to agree with the rest of theFive on any such declaration.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it seemed clear that General de Gaulle would again seek support fora rejection of our approach to Europe on the basis that the Britishwere still not sufficiently European, despite the extent to which he himself had pursued policies which other European nations wouldnot regard as being in the general European interest. Theforthcoming talks in Paris, therefore, would be primarily political incontent, and to that extent the briefs which had been prepared forthe other visits would be of less relevance.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary.SECRETMalta 3.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the early part ofthe week he had had consultations with the Maltese Government onthe reduction of our forces there in consequence of the decisions reached after the Defence Review. He had explained the limiteddeferment of certain parts of the reduction (primarily the retentionof the two battalions in Malta for two years after 1968) which wewere prepared to make in order to alleviate the consequences on employment, but these had wholly failed to obtain the acquiescenceI
of the Maltese Government in our proposals. Their initial attackon them had indeed been based not on the economic situation, buton the contention that we were in effect abrogating the 1964 defence agreement by reducing our forces to a level which would make itimpossible for us to defend Malta against attack. There was nosubstance in this contention, since we would not be dependent fordefending Malta on forces stationed there at any time: indeed, anattack on Malta would involve the whole of the North Atlantic treaty organisation (NATO). Subsequently their opposition had con-centrated on the consequences for the level of unemployment. Itwas agreed between the Maltese Government and ourselves that the reductions were likely to increase unemployment by some 4,500 inthe first two years and 7,000 by the end of the period, thus resulting in a peak level of unemployment of about 14 per cent in 1968-69.He had also held discussions with a number of other interests in malta and in particular with the General Workers Union. Itappeared probable that the announcement of the proposals would lead to strikes and the possibility of violence could not be excluded.It was not, however, thought necessary to evacuate any of the families of British servicemen in Malta. In discussion with the Heads of theServices, the Commander-in-Chief, who also held a NATOappointment, had suggested some minor deferment of the navalrun-down, partly for NATO purposes and partly to mitigatesomewhat the consequent increase in unemployment in the next twoyears. Further study of the cost of such deferment was, however,required before a decision could be taken.In the upshot he had made no concessions on the governments proposals, but had agreed that he would report the outcome of the consultations to his colleagues.The one hopeful feature of the situation was that the situationin the dockyard had improved under the Council of administration and the agency of Swan Hunter. As the Cabinet were aware, thelong-standing dispute with Bailey (Malta) Ltd. made it necessary, iffinality were to be reached on reasonable&apos;terms, for legislation tobe passed in the Maltese Parliament nationalising the dockyard.If such legislation were passed in the near future the way would thenbe clear for further development which was at present inhibited andthere was every reason to hope that activity in the dockyard andthe level of employment there would substantially improve.It would be necessary to make an early statement in the Houseof Commons, preferably on Monday of the following week(23rd January), about the reduction of our forces which was envisaged, to inform the Maltese Government that this would bedone and to give the Heads of the Services in Malta the opportunityto inform their respective Services of what was proposed before a press statement was issued.In discussion concern was expressed about the level ofunemployment which would result in Malta from the rundown ofthe forces and it was urged that the United Kingdom Government
must accept some responsibility for these consequences in the lightof the history of our connection with Malta. It was questionable whether the likely cost of the changes in the naval run-downproposed by the Commander-in-Chief would be justified by the small increase in employment which might ensue, particularly since there seemed to be no prospect that this would be adequate to obtain the aquiescence of the Maltese Government in our proposals as a whole.It was, however, urgent to seek an early conclusion to the discussions on the future of the dockyard and to enable its development toproceed thereafter. It might also prove necessary to consider some further concession to Malta in respect of the level of immigration intothe United Kingdom.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Commonwealth Secretary.(2) Agreed that an announcement should be made in the Houseof Commons on Monday, 23rd January, of the details ofthe reduction of our forces in Malta.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th January, 1967.
