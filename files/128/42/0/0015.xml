ParliamentSelectCommittees(previous reference:CC(66) 58thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the first week after the Easter adjournment.The Prime Minister said that there was a possibility that theSelect Committee of the House of Commons on Agriculture might seek leave of absence from the House in order to visit the european economic Commission. Such a visit would imply a wider extensionof the activities of Select Committees than had been the original intention and there was a risk that developments on these lines mightestablish a precedent for their activities on the lines of committees of the United States Congress. It was relevant that Select committees on the Estimates had not previously paid comparable visits and thePublic Accounts Committee itself was not in fact allowed to sitbeyond the Palace of Westminster. While it would be impolitic forthe Government to seem unduly restrictive over the activities of select committees, the issues involved by this proposal and in Ministersappearing before the Committees could usefully be further consideredby the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure. In themeantime Ministers should defer action in these respects.In discussion there was general agreement that the issues involved called for consideration by Ministers, though it would be essential that there should be no interference with parliamentary privilege.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure toconsider in the light of the discussion the method of operation of the Select Committees and in particular theattitude which the Government should adopt towards thedesire of the Select Committee on Agriculture to visit theEuropean Economic Commission and the limitationswhich Ministers should observe in giving evidence.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to bring the issues involved before the Cabinet again in the light of theCommittee&apos;s discussion.OverseasAffairsSouth Arabia(previous reference:CC(67) 13thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal Government ofSouth Arabia were unwilling to accept the proposals which had beenagreed by the Cabinet at an earlier meeting for advancing the date of independence for the new State to 1st November and for providingair support for it against external aggression for up&apos; to six monthsthereafter. They claimed that they had been given to understand bythe previous Administration that independence would be linked to anadequate defence agreement and also took the view that they wouldnot be ready to assume responsibility for internal security in Aden on1st November. They had however agreed not to reject our proposals
Vietnam(previous reference:CC(67) 1stConclusions,Minute 2)Sierra Leone(previous reference:CC(67) 5thConclusions,Minute 3)outright provided that we did not announce them publicly as we had previously decided. The United Kingdom Representative at theUnited Nations (Lord Caradon) had also advised against publicationof the proposals, as planned, on 20th March since this would havecoincided with the arrival in London of the United Nations mission to South Arabia. The announcement had therefore been deferred.He had since met the United Nations Mission and had been impressed with its quality and with its resolve to find a satisfactory solution tothe South Arabian problem. The Mission did not however regard theFederal Government, as at present constituted, as acceptable from thepoint of view of the United Nations and they also wanted us to makeat least a gesture towards lifting the state of emergency in Aden. Onthe latter point he had told them that our ability to do this depended on whether, when they visited Cairo before going on to Jedda and toAden, they could, by bringing pressure to bear on the Government ofthe United Arab Republic, help to create the conditions in which thestate of emergency could be relaxed. We should have to consider inthe light of certain soundings which were being taken of Adeninationalist opinion and of the visit of the United Nations Mission toAden whether or not to proceed with our current plans for south arabia.The Foreign Secretary said that the Secretary General of theUnited Nations, U Thant, had now made proposals for a settlementof the North Vietnam conflict to the United States and north vietnam Governments and to ourselves and the Soviet government as Co-Chairmen of the Geneva Conference, as well as to the Inter-national Control Commission. These proposals envisaged three stages, starting with a general standstill in hostilities, to be followedby preliminary talks between the United States and north vietnamese, with ourselves and the Soviet Union participating if desired, and then a full scale international conference. Theseproposals were much on the lines of those which we ourselves had made in the United Nations; he had informed U Thant and theSoviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, that we welcomed them. TheUnited States had accepted the proposals following the recent conference in Guam with their Manila Treaty allies, but so far therehas been no response from the North Vietnamese.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in sierra leone was uncertain. It appeared that the Governor-General hadacted prematurely after the recent general election in asking the leader of the All Peoples Congress Party, Mr. Siaka Stevens, to forma government. At that stage the final results of the general electionwere not available. Mr. Stevens&apos;s party had 31 members returnedand the Sierra Leone People&apos;s Party, under the leadership of theprevious Prime Minister, Sir Albert Margai, had only 27 members.However, one electoral result had still to be declared and of theremaining seven independent members, five had since declared their support for Sir Albert Margai&apos;s party. It seemed unlikely therefore that Mr. Siaka Stevens would be able to form a government, moreparticularly if account were taken of the vote of 12 Chiefs in theLegislature, since ten of these were likely to support Sir Albert
Nigeria(previous reference:CC(67) 13 th conclusions,Minute 2)Margai. The Army Chief of Staff, Brigadier Lansana, had placed theGovernor-General, Mr. Siaka Stevens and the Minister of Informa-tion, together with some officials, under house arrest and there hadbeen riots with some casualties. The situation might however bepeaceablv resolved if the Sierra Leone Parliament could meet andthere seemed to be no present threat to the United Kingdom citizensin the country (who numbered somewhat over 2,000). This furtherexample of instability and military intervention in political affairs inan African country did, however, present embarrassing problems forour policy in Africa, particularly in relation to Rhodesia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in Nigeriawas in detail obscure but was clearly deteriorating. The Chairman ofthe National Liberation Council of Ghana, General Ankrah, wasattempting to arrange for a mission under the auspices of theCommonwealth Secretariat to go to Nigeria to seek to assist in asettlement of the current difficulties and the United Kingdom special representative in East and Central Africa, Mr. Malcolm Macdonald,might be a member. In the meantime arrangements to evacuate18,000 United Kingdom nationals in the country, should it benecessary to do so, were fully planned and it might be necessary toput these plans into effect during the Easter holiday, as 31st Marchmight prove to be a critical date.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign and Common-wealth Secretaries.CommercialPolicySECRET3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the President of theBoard of Trade (C (67) 35) on the Kennedy Round of tariff negotia-Kennedy Round tiong generaiiy an(j by the First Secretary&quot; of State and Secretary of(previous reference:CC (67) 4thConclusions,Minute 2)State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 38) and the Minister ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food (C (67) 36) on the negotiations for acereals agreement within the Kennedy Round.The President of the Board of Trade said that the kennedy round was now entering the critical final phase. The High LevelSteering Group, consisting of senior officials from the UnitedKingdom, the United States and the European economic commission, would meet on 29th March and the broad content ofthe final result of the negotiations would probably emerge from thismeeting. It was expected that there would then have to be a meetingof Ministers from the participating countries about 20th April.As regards industrial tariffs, the aim had been to secure a general reduction of 50 per cent and the major participants had tabled in 1964lists of the products which they felt obliged to exclude from such a cut.  The United Kingdom list of exclusions had been considerably
shorter than those of our major negotiating partners and accordinglyin November 1966 we had put in a list of further provisionalexclusions designed to restore the balance. The main participantshad agreed that they would during April of this year convert theiroffers into precise schedules of the reduced duties which they were willing to adopt in the light of the known offers by other countries.It would probably be necessary for us to incorporate further with-withdrawals in our final list. Since total imports of industrial goods intothe European Economic Community (e.c.) and the United Statesalone amounted in value to more than six times the correspondingimports into the United Kingdom, the new opportunities for ourexporters should more than compensate for the degree to which weshould have to open our market to the exports of others.There were also important issues relating to the non-tariff barriers imposed by the United States. The principal barriers were ]the American Selling Price (ASP) system for valuing benzenoidchemicals for duty and the practice of wine gallon assessment wherebyimported spirits were treated for tax purposes as if they were 100&quot;proof regardless of their actual strength, the effect being to reduceseriously our export earnings from whisky. The abolition of ASPand wine gallon assessment would each require legislation by theUnited States Congress and the Americans were therefore not in aposition to give unconditional assurances in the context of the kennedy Round on these matters. Accordingly, the concessions which we proposed in return for abolition, which were respectively jreductions in our tariffs on chemicals and abolition of the Common-wealth preference on imported tobacco, would be conditional on thepassage of the necessary legislation by the United States Congress.It would be necessary for Ministers to consider the major issues involved as the outline of the final agreement emerged, with a view tocompleting the negotiations by the agreed date of 30th April.The  Minister  of  Agriculture  said  that,  while  a cerealsagreement in itself would bring no net advantage to the UnitedKingdom, it was crucial to the success of the Kennedy Round as awhole. There were three main elements in the cereals negotiations:first, provisions relating to access by the cereals exporters to the markets of the importing countries, which would take the form of a self-sufficiency ratio whereby the importing countries would incurpenalties if their domestic cereals production expressed as a percentageof domestic consumption exceeded the agreed ratio; second, the level Iof minimum and maximum international cereals prices; and third, the Iinclusion in the agreement of a multilateral food-aid programme. As Iregards the self-sufficiency ratio for the United Kingdom, we had not 1hitherto authorised our negotiators to discuss any ratio below 72 per icent; but it was now clear that we might have to contemplate a a somewhat lower ratio if an agreement were to be secured. We were, however, committed under the selective expansion programme for iagriculture to an increase in domestic cereals production; in order to 1carry out the programme, we should aim to secure a self-sufficiency Iratio as near as possible to 72 per Cent and in no circumstances less Ithan 70 per cent.  It was unlikely that a cereals agreement could be I
secured without the inclusion of a food-aid programme, despite theUnited Kingdom objections to this, and we should now indicate our readiness to participate in such a programme subject to our contribution not exceeding  5 million per annum. This should enable us to obtain more favourable terms on the self-sufficiency ratio and on price levels which would more than offset this expenditure in foreign exchange. An increase in our self-sufficiency ratio of 1 per cent would for example enable us to save cereals imports to the value of  million. Since the cereals agreement was bound to involve anadditional cost in foreign exchange to the United Kingdom, it wouldbe necessary to ensure that we received compensating benefits in other sectors of the negotiations; but it would be necessary to proceedcautiously in attempting to bargain our participation in a cerealsagreement against concessions on non-tariff barriers, lest this should result in a cereals agreement on such terms as would seriously damage our interests.The First Secretary of State said that the Sub-Committee on external Economic Policy of the Ministerial Committee on economic policy had considered the issues in the cereals negotiations at their meeting on 21st March. They had agreed that we should instruct our delegation to impress on the United States delegation that we shouldnot be prepared to sign a cereals agreement unless they could offer ussubstantial concessions in return, particularly on non-tariff barriers.Subject to this, the Sub-Committee had agreed that our delegation should be authorised to explore what were the best terms we could secure on price and access if we were prepared to accept a food-aid programme at a cost to us not exceeding  5 million a year, and toindicate in their exploratory talks that we might be prepared to contemplate a self-sufficiency ratio somewhat below 72 per cent. TheSub-Committee had felt that a ratio below 70 per cent should not be completely ruled out at this stage, since it was conceivable that if wewere prepared to go below 70 per cent we could obtain offsettingadvantages on the other elements in the agreement.In discussion of the general situation in the Kennedy Roundnegotiations, the following points were made (a) Some of the restrictions which we were seeking to persuade the United States to remove (and for which we were prepared tomake concessions in our legitimate tariff measures) were contrary tothe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). If we did not get satisfaction on these issues, it might be necessary to considerretaliatory measures.(b) Our position in the negotiations was complicated by thepossibility that we might later enter the e.c.. In that event, it wouldbe contrary to our interests if during the Kennedy Round we had succeeded in bargaining for reductions in the e.c. tariffs which wouldbe contrary to our interests when we ourselves became a member ofthe Community. On the other hand, we could not afford to forgo thepossibility of achieving any reductions in e.c. tariffs now, since it was uncertain whether we should later become a member. There was the
further difficulty arising from the possibility of our joining theCommunity that at that stage we should, by definition, have to agree on the eventual achievement of a common tariff for the enlarged community. It would be important to ensure that we should not, asthe price of doing so, have to make further concessions to our othertrading partners to retain benefits which we had derived from the kennedy Round and for which we would already have paid inconcessions in the present negotiations. However, in the event of ourentering the e.c. any adjustments of agreements arising from the kennedy Round which might be sought by others would have to be negotiated with the enlarged Community as a whole. It was understood that the question was already being considered of our negotiators stipulating that any agreement on the conclusion of the kennedy Round would contain a saving clause in respect of the issues arising from our subsequent entry into the Community.(c) If the e.c. persisted in excluding heavy lorries from its tariffoffer on motor vehicles, we should have to consider whether towithdraw our own offer on passenger cars. Further consultations with the industry would be necessary, in the light of which ministers should re-examine the issue.(d) The position on textiles was that we could not offer to reduce our tariffs on cotton or jute textiles, and we should have to with drawour offer on wool in the absence of reciprocity from the United States.Unless we maintained significant offers in other parts of this sector,principally in man-made fibre textiles, there was a danger of the e.c. and the United States withdrawing much of their offers on textiles.These offers would indirectly be to our benefit by offering a largermarket for cotton textiles from the developing countries, so relieving the pressure on the United Kingdom market. It would, however, be essential to ensure that the interests of our own industry wereadequately safeguarded in the outcome of the textiles negotiations asa whole. The President of the Board of Trade would shortly beholding consultations with the Textile Council, who should be told in broad terms of our intentions. Ministers should consider further our offer on textiles in the light of these consultations.(e) The United States were pressing us to reduce our measuresto give preferences on citrus fruits and other tropical products, butwe were resisting this. We must however recognise that the protectionwhich we gave to citrus was contrary to the GATT.In discussion of the negotiations on cereals, the following points were made (/) We should not contemplate a self-sufficiency ratio of less than70 per cent, and the exploratory talks by our delegation should be conducted on that basis. The question of the self-sufficiency ratioshould be reconsidered only by Ministers in the light of the outcome of those talks.(g) It was not clear what the effect would be on a self-sufficiencyratio determined in the context of the Kennedy Round if we were subsequently to enter the e.c.. Presumably in those circumstances we should share a common self-sufficiency ratio which would apply tothe whole of the enlarged Community. Before Ministers made further
decisions on the cereals negotiations, following exploratory talks by our delegation, they should have before them a report on this question and its implications for the present negotiations.(h) It would have been preferable to avoid the inclusion of a food-aid programme in a cereals agreement. There were objectionsto aid of this kind, which tended to discourage the recipient countries from improving agricultural production. We should, however,indicate our readiness to participate in a food-aid programme in theinterests of the success of the Kennedy Round as a whole. However,if we did eventually participate, we should be doing so because ofgeneral balance of payments considerations quite unrelated to thepurposes of aid. It would therefore be wrong for our contribution to count against the budgetary limit imposed on our aid programme;either our contribution should be additional to the aid programme, or it might possibly be related to the loan element in that programme.This was one example of a number of problems related to budgetaryprovision for the aid programme; further consideration should begiven to these, including the question of tied aid.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that asregards cereals, our delegation should be authorised to explore themost favourable terms we could secure if we were to accept a self-sufficiency ratio somewhat lower than 72 per cent and if we wereprepared to participate in a food-aid programme at a cost to us notexceeding  5 million per annum but they should not contemplate thepossibility of a ratio below 70 per cent. The delegation should reportthe results of their exploratory talks to enable Ministers to decide onfinal instructions. The Minister of Overseas Development should alsoarrange for the Ministerial Committee on Overseas Development toconsider the general problems of budgetary provision for the aid programme, including the question of tied aid and food aid, bearing that mind that there were substantial objections to our contribution tothe latter counting against the budgetary limit on our general aid programme. Before Ministers took further decisions on the cerealsnegotiations, they should have a report on the implications for thenegotiations, particularly as regards the self-sufficiency ratio, of ourpossible entry into the e.c.. The Sub-Committee on external economic Policy of the Ministerial Committee on Economic policy should consider our offers on motor vehicles and textiles in the light offurther consultations with the industries concerned. The Sub-Committee, and subsequently the Cabinet, should consider the outline of the final proposals as a whole as they emerged from the meetingof the High Level Steering Group.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to arrange for instructions on the cereals negotiations in the kennedy round to be sent to the United Kingdom delegation asindicated in the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.
(2) Invited the Minister of Overseas Development to arrange forthe Ministerial Committee on Overseas Development toconsider the problems of budgetary provision for theUnited Kingdom general aid programme, including thequestion of tied aid and food aid on the basis indicated bythe Prime Minister.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with thePresident of the Board of Trade, to arrange for the Sub-Committee on External Economic Policy of the ministerial committee on Economic Policy (i) to consider a report on the implications for thenegotiations on cereals of the possible entry of theUnited Kingdom into the e.c., before further decisions were taken on those negotiations;(ii) to consider whether we should seek to stipulate thatany agreement on the Kennedy Round should contain a comprehensive saving clause in respect ofthe issues arising from our possible subsequententry into the e.c.;(iii) to consider further our offers in the Kennedy Roundon motor vehicles and textiles following consulta-tions with the industries concerned;(iv) to consider and make recommendations to theCabinet on the results of the negotiations of theHigh Level Steering Group in the Kennedy Roundbeginning on 29th March.confidential the &quot; Torrey 4.   The Secretary of State for Defence said that it was necessaryCanyon &quot; for ^Q Cabinet to consider certain issues which might arise in the nearfuture in respect of the action that should be taken by the Governmentto deal with the tanker Torrey Canyon which had been wrecked onthe Seven Stones Reef on the previous Sunday. There had alreadybeen a very large leakage of oil which might well pollute the beachesof the whole of Devon and Cornwall and there was still another100,000 tons of oil in the tanker. Although the weather so far hadbeen unusually favourable, with winds from the north and west whichwere blowing the oil &quot; slick &quot; southwards, there was a continual risk that a south-westerly gale might blow up and bring the oil back to thiscountry. The governmental arrangements for dealing with theproblem so far had been co-ordinated by the Ministry of Defence anda committee of scientists (with a representative of British Petroleum)had been set up under Sir Solly Zuckerman, the Chief scientific adviser to the Government, to consider all the ways in which theproblem might be dealt with. A number of ships were in action to try and break up the main &quot; slick &quot; of oil but, even if no more oilescaped, some ten days would be needed before the oil mass could bedispersed by the use of detergent and by wind and weather. the major problem, however, was what action should be taken in respectof the tanker itself and oil still within it. The best course would undoubtedly be to float off the tanker during a high spring tide; and
H10 cc 15(67)the best prospect for this to be done was the following Sunday night.This operation was being considered by a Dutch salvage firm, which  /as probably the most expert firm in the world in this type of operation. They would receive all possible assistance from the royal navy. Even if they were successful, however, there would then bethe problem of where the ship should be towed. This would not befor the Government but for the salvage firm themselves to decide.The best place- might prove to be Bantry Bay, but otherwise it mightbe necessary for the ship to be towed into one of the Cornish baysand it was for consideration what rights the Government would then have to restrict the operation. If attempts to float off the tanker failedit would also be for consideration whether the Government should arrange for the ship to be set on fire and what rights we had to orderthis to be done. In any event, it was questionable whether this wouldbe the wisest course, for in a similar operation in the Persian Gulfsome while ago, the ship had burned for three months and at the endof that time two-thirds of the oil still remained. Furthermore, the attempt to fire the tanker might result in an explosion, so releasing allthe remaining oil. The best technical advice was being taken on allthese issues, but the legal position was uncertain and it might benecessary to take action in an emergency over the weekend. In that event, the Cabinet might be disposed to authorise the Prime Minister,in consultation with the Attorney-General and himself, to decide onthis action even if this might call for subsequent validatory legislation.The Attorney-General said that our present view was that theTorrey Canyon was outside territorial waters. The legal position wascomplex: in particular there was conflict of obligations between theInternational Convention for the Prevention of Pollution of the Seaby Oil on the one hand, and the International Convention on theTerritorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone on the other. The test ofwhat action it would be appropriate for the Government to takedepended on what they were advised would be reasonable in thecircumstances at any given time. If they were advised that in certaincircumstances the towing of the ship to a United Kingdom bay might lead to its collapse or to extensive pollution of the sea and the beaches,then the Government would be entitled to take action to resist thiscourse, though naturally it would be preferable to seek the consent ofthe owners of the ship to whatever course we adopted. As long asthe ship was on the high seas any sanctions under international conventions could only be exercised by the Government of Liberia,since the ship was on the Liberian register, though the United StatesGovernment might also exercise influence as the ship was owned by a united States firm. The owners of the ship were themselves under a legal obligation to take reasonable precautions to prevent the pollutionof the sea by the oil from the tanker and, if the wreck of the ship hadbeen due to negligence in navigation, the owners were liable for theconsequences. In considering what was reasonable action at any time,relevant factors would be the value of the ship and the value of itssurviving cargo on the one hand, as compared on the other with areasonable estimate of the damage which might be caused by further
pollution to inshore fisheries and with the cost of dealing withpollution both on the sea and on the beaches. In certain circum-stances, these factors might entitle the Government to arrange for theship to be set on fire. The Government could not be sued in UnitedKingdom courts for such an act, which would constitute an act ofstate, but they might be liable to be sued in the International Court ofJustice.In discussion there was general agreement that in view of thegreat importance of preventing the extensive pollution of Britishfisheries and beaches all possible action should be taken by theGovernment to prevent this and that the Ministers immediately concerned should be authorised to take whatever action they judgedreasonable in the circumstances to that end. The following points were also made-(a) Even in the most favourable circumstances, the cost of thedetergent necessary to disperse the whole of the contents of the cargowould amount to some  12 million and in present conditions the cost would be much greater. It was not however necessary to emulsify allthe oil, since eventually it would disperse naturally and the problem was to prevent pollution of the fisheries and beaches meanwhile.(b) There was reason to think that there might have beennegligence in the navigation of the ship and the circumstancessuggested that it might be desirable for the Ministers concerned toconsider later the broader questions arising from the operation of flagsof convenience.(c) While the control of the governmental operations at thepresent stage was a matter for the Ministry of Defence, since the mainactivities were being carried out by the Royal Navy, the responsibilityfor answering questions in the House of Commons and forco-ordinating the financial aspects of action by local authorities would pass to the Minister of Housing and Local Government if the oilapproached the land. The Official Committee on Emergencies hadalready met and the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies should meet whenever circumstances made this desirable, to consider theco-ordination of all governmental action.id) In considering any action which the Government might take in respect of the ship itself, it would be desirable to seek theconcurrence of the foreign governments concerned, though we shouldnot necessarily be bound to obtain their agreement if the risk to our interests made it essential in our view for action to be taken.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were impressed by the extent and efficiency of the actionwhich the Royal Navy had already taken to deal with the situation.They agreed that further action in respect of the tanker should bedecided by the Defence Secretary and the Attorney-General, inconsultation with himself. Other action in respect of the oil at seawould remain the responsibility of the Ministry of Defence, whichwould co-ordinate governmental action in this regard. Action on land, and immediately off shore, should be co-ordinated by the official and Ministerial Committees on Emergencies.   At that stage the
Minister of Housing and Local Government would be responsible foranswering questions in the House of Commons.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to convey to theRoyal Navy their appreciation of the work which had beendone in dealing with the problem.(3) Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Defence and the Minister of housing and Local Government, to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Emergencies to keep thesituation under review and to meet as necessary to considerthe co-ordination of government action by the Govern-ment and by other public authorities.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to considerwhether it would be appropriate to review the issues arising from the operation of flags of convenience.AircraftIndustryThe Airbus(previous reference:CC(67) 13thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the minister without Portfolio (C (67) 34) on the outcome of his consultion withthe Ministers immediately concerned about the airbus and associatedquestions.The Minister without Portfolio said that the discussion with hiscolleagues had clarified the facts about new engines and the aircraft in which they could be used. The Ministers concerned had agreedthat British European Airways (BEA) should undertake an urgentstudy of the various aircraft which could meet their interim needs,including the BAC-211, the Trident 3B and the stretched VC-10.While recognising that no decision could be made until the results ofthe study were available, they were inclined to look unfavourably onthe BAC-211 project. On the airbus, they recommended that theUnited Kingdom should now proceed to the project definition stage,subject to the strict observance of six prerequisites. The first five ofthese were as set out in the Minister of Technology&apos;s earlier raemo-randum (C (67) 30), although condition (ii) about the necessity of re-examining the estimate of launching costs had been somewhatstrengthened. The sixth prerequisite referred to the capacity of the airbus, which they believed should not exceed 250 seats in the versionto be first developed although it would doubtless be open to&quot; stretching &quot; in subsequent years if there were a commercial demandfor this.In discussion it was pointed out that increasing the capacity ofthe airbus above 250 seats would make it easier to reduce the operating costs and might also make it easier to secure the adoptionof a Rolls-Royce engine.   However, these considerations were
outweighed by the fact that a larger European airbus would be indirect competition with the airbus to be produced in the UnitedStates, and this would greatly reduce its prospect of sales. It was essential that the European airbus should differ significantly in sizefrom the United States machine and should thus appeal to a somewhat different market.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to the agreement of the French and theFederal German Governments, the United Kingdom should proceed to the project definition stage of the Europeanairbus, subject to the strict observance of the six prerequisitesset out in C (67) 34.Cabinet Office, S.W.L23rd March, 1967.
