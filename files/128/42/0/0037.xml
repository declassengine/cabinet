CC 37 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret.   The Foreign Secretary said that the latest military situationin the Middle East conflict was that Israel, having defeated theEgyptian forces in Sinai, had now virtually ceased operations exceptagainst Jordan and Syria; reinforcements were however reported ontheir way to the United Arab Republic (UAR) from Algeria, including50 MiG aircraft, and if these were to reach the UAR Israel must beexpected to act against them.  Although, contrary to rumour, king hussein was still in Jordan, the situation there was very serious andarrangements were in hand to evacuate British nationals from thecountry by air; there was no information about the internal situationin the UAR. Israel had stated her willingness to accept a cease-fireprovided that her Arab opponents did so, but only Jordan had sofar shown herself willing.  There were reports that an Arab summitconference might be called, possibly by President Boumedienne ofAlgeria, to formulate a common policy on a cease-fire, on oil supplies and on diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom and the UnitedStates.   Our main interest now lay in re-establishing our relationswith the Arab States on as friendly a basis as possible and for theimmediate future this would be best served by saying as little aspossible publicly about the situation in the Middle East.   he proposed, therefore, to avoid if possible making a further statement in Parliament that day. As regards action in the United Nations, itwas possible that the Soviet Union might table a resolution in theSecurity Council calling upon Israel to withdraw behind her frontiers,but in view of the moderate attitude which she had adopteddiplomatically in circumstances of great difficulty for her this seemed unlikely.   This attitude, which was in sharp contrast to soviet propaganda, was in keeping with that which the Soviet Governmenthad taken during his recent visit to Moscow; despite this, however,there were very recent indications that Soviet broadcasts to theMiddle East were now beginning to follow those from the UAR inpropagating the lie that British and United States aircraft had supported Israel in the Middle East fighting.   A settlement of the crisis, which must aim at establishing a stable relationship betweenIsrael and the Arab States, would be very difficult to achieve; oneof our objectives must be that any such settlement should not be, orappear to be, reached between the United States and soviet governments alone, but that we and the French should play a part in reaching it. Finally, as regards arms supplies to the Middle East, weshould now cease to hold these up by administrative delay and revert to normal arrangements, under which such supplies were considered on their merits case by case.8177
In discussion it was suggested that, while the fighting was stillin progress in the Middle East, it would be wrong to resume suppliesof arms to countries in the area. On the other hand it was argued that there were strong grounds for reverting to normal practice,particularly in view of the fact that Israel had shown herself willingto accept a cease-fire and that hostilities were not now likely to lastlong. Furthermore, some other countries, and especially the soviet union, were continuing to supply arms and the continued impositionof a delay on our part might lead to Israel suffering greater difficultiesthan the Arab States in maintaining her forces. In addition, if we wereto default, both to Israel and the Arab States, on orders which hadbeen placed with us, we should cease to be regarded as a reliable source of supply and might put at risk large long-term orders alreadyplaced with us, including one for aircraft for Saudi Arabia. Weshould therefore revert to our normal practice as regards supplies tothe Middle East though no public statement to this effect should bemade.In further discussion the Minister of Power said that discussions had been taking place with the oil companies and with United StatesGovernment officials about oil supplies in view of the action takenby a number of Arab States to stop the flow of oil to ourselves andthe United States. This might lead to some temporary and limitedrundown of our present stocks, which amounted to some 90 days&apos;supply, but there would be no substantial difficulty in maintaining our supplies thereafter provided that the countries concerned did not reduce total output. Such a reduction would lead to a shortage ofsupplies and might even require petrol rationing. The implementation of a rationing scheme would take about two and a half months and require about 5,000 additional staff; in view of the uncertain situation it was essential that preparations should be put in hand now forpetrol rationing so that if it became necessary it could be introduced before stocks were dangerously reduced.In discussion of the oil situation it was suggested that in view ofthe real attitudes, as distinct from the public statements, of the oil-producing Arab States, it was unlikely that there would be a stoppage of oil supplies to us for more than a short period, particularly inview of the world oil surplus and the desire of Iran and Venezuala toincrease output. Contingency planning for petrol rationing should however continue and the Cabinet would consider the situationfurther at their next meeting.The Cabinet were also informed that, as was inevitable withvolatile exchanges in such a dangerous international situation, sterlinghad initially been under some strain but the position had not been serious and was now restored.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.(2) Agreed that the temporary delay imposed administrativelyon supplies of arms to the Middle East should cease andthat supplies should be resumed on the normal basis.
(3) Invited the Minister of Power to report further on the oilsituation at their next meeting.secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions between british and Spanish officials in Madrid on the restrictions imposed bySpain on the use of air space in the neighbourhood of the Gibraltarairfield were expected to end that evening without any agreement being reached. The Spanish representatives had maintained theirinsistence in respect of Spanish sovereignty over Gibraltar. On theconclusion of the discussions we should issue a statement deploringthe maintenance of these restrictions on aviation and should thensubmit a formal complaint about them to the International CivilAviation Organisation (ICAO). The United States Government had hitherto been unhelpful in our dispute with Spain over Gibraltar ingeneral and in particular during the earlier discussions in ICAO onthe Spanish aviation restrictions. Our Ambassador in Washingtonhad been instructed to approach the United States Government inan effort to persuade them to adopt a more helpful attitude in future.The Foreign Secretary said that an ugly situation had devolped in respect of British representatives in Peking. A Chinese mob had broken into the Embassy and done much damage while a numberof our representatives had been roughly handled. We had had noassistance or expression of regret from the Chinese Government. Weshould have to consider how long we could reasonably ask our representatives to remain in such circumstances.The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the light of the latest developments the British High Commissioner had decided that Britishwomen and children in the Eastern Region should be evacuated.-Nearly all had now left.   So far the Federal blockade had notrestricted the export of oil from the Eastern Region.The Prime Minister said that the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee had discussed the previous day the situation in rhodesia and the action which the Government should take. their consideration of the issues was not yet concluded, but thereafter itwould be appropriate for the matter to come before the Cabinet.The Foreign Secretary said that there were still large Egyptianforces in the Yemen although some had been withdrawn. It was too soon after the event to assess whether the defeat of the United arab republic by Israel would have any effect on the morale of the forcesremaining in the Yemen and whether the Yemeni royalist forces would renew their attacks.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister, theForeign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secretary.
Approach to europe(previous reference:CC (67) 29thConclusions,Minute 4)Arrangementsfor Trade andIndustry in theEuropeanCommunities:Draft WhitePaper4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Chairman of theOfficial Committee on the Approach to Europe (C (67) 94), to whichwas attached a draft White Paper about arrangements for trade andindustry in the European Communities.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish to considerwhether it was necessary to publish a White Paper on this subject at all; if so, whether the draft before them was satisfactory for thepurpose and whether it should be the last of the present series of white papers on this subject.In discussion, it was suggested that the present draft was not suitable for publication since it merely reported the present positionand did not examine the commercial and industrial implications ofUnited Kingdom membership of the European Communities. Wherethe problems involved in United Kingdom membership appeared tobe relatively easy of solution, the draft expounded them at some length but not always so as to make the most of the encouragingfeatures; but where, on the other hand, there were difficult problems,they were either dealt with inadequately or not mentioned atall as, for example, that of Commonwealth immigration. On theother hand, it was pointed out that, if an attempt were made to remedy the defects to which attention had been drawn, the White Paper wouldbe inordinately long and it was doubtful in any event whether therewas sufficient interest to warrant publication of a White Paper onthis subject.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet considered that the present draft was not suitable for publication. The Foreign Secretary should consider the draft further,in the light of the criticisms which had been expressed, to see whethera satisfactory White Paper of reasonable length could be produced.Ministers should send any further detailed,,comments on the present draft to the Foreign Secretary. The Cabinet would wish to reconsider the matter in the light of his views.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in the light of their discussion of the present draft, whether it was desirable to publish a White Paper on the trade and industrial aspects ofour membership of the European Communities and if so what its form should be.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,8th June, 1967.
