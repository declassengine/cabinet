SubjectApproach to EuropeDraft Opening Statement to the Ministerial Council of theWestern European Union
8184SECRETThe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Foreign Affairs (C (67) 114), to which was attached thedraft of a statement which he proposed to make to the ministerial council of the Western European Union on Tuesday, 4th July.The Foreign Secretary said that a large part of the draft hadbeen agreed interdepartmentally by officials. The paragraphs shownin square brackets represented issues on which agreement had notyet been reached.In discussion it was argued that the general tone of the statementimplied that the Government had gone further than hitherto in the approach to Europe towards accepting that political considerations were overriding, that those political considerations were wholly infavour of our joining the European Communities and that we wereprepared to accept in negotiation almost any economic price in orderto succeed. It was, however, the general view that since the speechmust be adapted to its audience and to the immediate purpose of seeking to ensure that negotiations actually began, it was necessaryto highlight the considerations which particularly appealed to the six. Read in this light, the speech as a whole did not go beyondthe terms of the White Paper on Membership of the european communities (Cmnd. 3269) and the Ministerial speeches which hadbeen made in Parliament; and it would be sufficient if particularpassages were amended in recognition of the fact that the speechwould also be published as a White Paper.In further discussion of the text of the draft, a number of amendments were agreed and the following main points were made (a) Paragraph 4. It was agreed to amend the final sentence inthe light of earlier Ministerial statements that the economic arguments for the United Kingdom were finely balanced. In terms both of presentation and of our negotiating position it would be preferable not to minimise the extent to which the economic issues were ofimportance to us.(b) Paragraph 6(b). It was urged that there should be an addition to the draft to recognise that institutional changes in a widerEuropean market would be necessary in order to provide for adequate political control of international companies which might otherwise operate in disregard of governmental considerations. Itwas, however, the general view that, important though these considerations might be, it would not be appropriate to develop them on the occasion of the speech.(c) Paragraph 13. It was suggested that the draft as it stoodpaid inadequate regard to the extent to which our joining theEuropean Communities would involve not merely a change ofdimension, but also an enrichment of the Communities throughdiversity. The point could best be made in an amended conflationof paragraphs 12 and 13.(d) Paragraph 20. It was urged that defence aspects shouldnot be mentioned in the context of our application to join the
European Communities: not only was the North Atlantic treaty organisation the forum in which we played our part in european defence, but also a reference in the terms used in the draft might be misunderstood as implying the development of a European nuclearcapability. It was however the general view that a reference to defence aspects should be retained, though amendments were agreed in order to lay slightly less emphasis on the extent of European unityin political and defence matters which would be involved.(e) Paragraph 23. It was questioned whether this paragraphwas in accord with the agreement which we had reached with theother members of the European Free Trade Association (EFTA),but it proved to be the general view that the draft fully met ourundertakings to them. It was agreed that it would be important thatthe text of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s speech should be made availableto other members of EFTA and also to other members of theCommonwealth shortly before it was delivered.(/) Paragraph 24. The Minister of Power said that the positionin the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC) was confusedand it might well not accord with our interests to join with no morethan a 12-month initial period of standstill. It was, however, argued that since in any event it appeared that the Six would require a longer period in their own interests, in that their position in these fields was weak relative to our own, it would be advantageous to usin negotiation to put them in a position of seeking from us a longertransitional period than we found necessary ourselves in this regard.It was agreed that the point could be met by reference to a limited,instead of a 12-month, initial period for our acceptance of ECSCobligations.(g) Paragraph 31. The Foreign Secretary urged that thisparagraph, referring to special aid to the hill farmers in the hill areasof the United Kingdom, should be deleted. He pointed out thatthis aid was fully comparable with other regional state aids providedby the Government and it had been accepted that these need not be mentioned in negotiations, since they were in accord with thepractice of the Community. Furthermore, special mention of hillfarmers might be positively disadvantageous in that a discussion ofthis aspect in negotiation might later make it more difficult for usto seek assistance for them from the Community&apos;s AgriculturalGuidance and Guarantee Fund. It was, however, urged that it was of considerable political importance in the United Kingdom thatthis issue should be mentioned in the opening statement in view ofits unique and sensitive nature. In further discussion it was agreedthat mention should be made of the issue in modified form by the deletion of paragraph 31 and the insertion in paragraph 32 of a reference to the problem in the context of the negotiation of theagricultural finance arrangements for the period after the end of 1969.(h) Paragraph 32. It was suggested that it would be incompatible with the Governmenfs earlier statements on the approach to Europe that we should leave discussion of levy payments under the common agricultural policy for settlement after we had joined the Communities. It was, however, pointed out that, if we were
to join before the end of 1969, when the agricultural financearrangements were due to be renegotiated, we should then be in aposition of negotiating as a full member with the right of veto. Itwas also clear politically that, if the Six were to wish to startdiscussions about that&apos; renegotiation before the end of 1969, theywould in their own interests wish us to partake in discussion and our interests were therefore fully protected by the terms of the paragraph.(/) Paragraph 34. It was agreed that the final sentence (in square brackets), relating to the interests of United Kingdom beetgrowers and sugar refiners, should be deleted.(/) Paragraph 37. It was agreed that the final sentence (in square brackets), which related mainly to Hong Kong, should beretained.(k) Paragraph 43. The President of the Board of Trade saidthat it was of considerable importance to United Kingdom industry that we should negotiate for nil tariffs or tariff quotas in respect of alimited number of raw materials. It was, however, urged that thiswould be incompatible with the Governmenfs statement that theysought no exemptions in respect of the Community&apos;s common external Tariff, that the Confederation of British Industry had statedthat they fully accepted this position and that to raise the issue atthis stage would do grave damage to the prospect of our success in achieving negotiations. The deletion of a direct reference in theopening statement did not preclude the possibility of it being decidedsubsequently to raise the matter in negotiations, though it might still remain the case that there would be substantial objections to ourdoing so. In further discussion it was agreed that the reference inparagraph 43 should be deleted, but that it should be open to ministers subsequently, in the Ministerial Committee on the approach to Europe, to seek a reconsideration of the extent, if any,to which this issue should be raised at some stage of the negotiations.(/) Paragraph 44. The Commonwealth Secretary suggested thatthe first sentence of this paragraph, regarding the limited number ofother points which would have to be considered, should include.a reference to &quot; a few problems relating to other Commonwealthcommodities &quot;. In discussion there was some support for this view,particularly in view of the absence of any reference in the statement which could otherwise be taken as covering the needs of India. Itwas, however, the general view that the needs of the Commonwealthwere adequately covered by paragraphs 30-40 and in particular thatthe reference to the Yaounde Convention in paragraph 39 sufficientlycovered aspects not specifically mentioned.(m) Paragraph 45. It was agreed that there was no needspecifically to mention fiscal harmonisation in this paragraph.(n) It was suggested that there should be a reference to the free movement of labour, in the interest of Commonwealth immigrants to the United Kingdom being allowed freedom of entry into Europe.It was, however, the general view that it was unnecessary to raise this aspect in the opening statement, since it appeared that the
interests of Commonwealth immigrants were adequately covered bythe existing Community arrangements, though it might well prove to be the case that the Six would themselves wish to raise the problem with us.In further discussion there was general. agreement that thestatement should be published as a White Paper on the evening ofTuesday, 4th July, as soon as the speech had been made in The Hague.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft statement appended to C (67) 114,subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.(2) Invited the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretaries toarrange for copies of - the speech, as amended, to be delivered to other member Governments of the european free Trade Association and of the Commonwealthshortly before the speech was made.(3) Agreed that the speech, as amended, should be published asa White Paper immediately after it had been delivered,on the evening of Tuesday, 4th July.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,.   3rd July, 1967.
