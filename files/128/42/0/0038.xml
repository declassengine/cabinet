Oversea affairs rhodesia(previous reference:CC(67) 37thConclusions,Minute 3)1.had been Press reports that the head of the illegal regime in Rhodesia,Mr. Smith, wished to resume talks with us about a settlement; andthere had been confirmation of this possibility in messages from theGovernor and others, though not directly from Mr. Smith. Therewas no clear indication whether a settlement on the lines of thatwhich emerged from the talks with Mr. Smith on HMS Tiger mightbe in mind or some other basis, nor whether members of the illegal regime other than Mr. Smith might be involved. The Prime Ministerand he had taken up with Lord Alport, formerly British HighCommissioner in the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, an earlier suggestion that the latter might go to Rhodesia later this yearto visit the Governor and to attempt to influence opinion in thecountry; as a result Lord Alport had agreed to visit Salisbury in thefollowing week. In addition to having talks with the Governor, hewould be available to see all sections of Rhodesian opinion and toreceive any views which they including members of the illegal regime might wish to put forward, though he would not take any initiative. Even if Lord Alport were to be refused entry to Rhodesiathis would damage further the public position in this country of the illegal regime. Lord Alporfs visit would be announced in parliament that day in reply to a Question.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, although theeconomic situation in Rhodesia. had deteriorated as a result ofeconomic sanctions, these had as yet had no political effect. some countries were not enforcing these sanctions vigorously and inparticular it had not yet been possible to reach agreement with France on arrangements which would restrict the flow of oil to Rhodesiathrough Mozambique. Mr. Smith&apos;s position in the illegal regime was uncertain and in any event we could not be sure that any proposalswhich might be made on his behalf for a settlement of the Rhodesiaproblem would have the support of others in the regime. Our own position on a settlement in Rhodesia remained that we would not grant independence before majority rule; and we would only be willingto consider with other Commonwealth countries any modificationof this commitment if there were a marked change of circumstances in Rhodesia, such as the removal of extremists of the Rhodesia Frontfrom power in the illegal regime, which gave more reasonableprospects of an acceptable settlement. It was suggested that in thesecircumstances it would be preferable not to announce in advance that lord Alport would be willing to see members of the illegal regimeif they approached him, although in practice he would no doubt beprepared to do so, since this might be thought to foreshadow the resumption of talks. It was however pointed out that it would be impracticable to deny, in answer to supplementary questions, that lord Alport, while himself taking no initiative, would be willing tosee all sections of opinion in Rhodesia.SECRET8178 a 2SECRETThe Commonwealth Secretary said that in recent weeks there
Middle East(previous reference:CC.(67) 37thConclusions,Minute 2)The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the mainevents since the Cabinet had last considered the Middle East situation had been the resignation and subsequent re-election of PresidentNasser of the United Arab Republic (UAR) and the outbreak offurther hostilities between Israel and Syria. But the cease-fire was now being observed generally, though sporadic outbreaks of fightingmight continue for some time. Israel was now taking firmly the line that she would retain the territories that she had conquered whilethe Soviet Government was attempting to re-establish her position with the Arab countries by adopting an increasingly aggressive attitudetowards Israel; there were suggestions that the Arab countriesthemselves would start guerilla action against Israel. OurPermanent Representative at the United Nations (Lord Caradon)had advised that immediate action there should concentrate on therelief of the suffering that had resulted from the war and in particular on the refugee problem. In the search for a general settlement of theMiddle East problem a major objective for us must be the earliestpossible resumption in the flow of oil to us from the Arab States,who were beginning to link this with demands that Israel should withdraw from conquered territory. Arrangements had beencompleted for the evacuation from Middle East countries of Britishresidents who wished to leave, apart from those in the UAR whowould be leaving that day. Arms supplies to Middle East countries had been resumed on the normal basis but with a careful scrutinycase by case. &quot;The Minister of Power said that the prospects for our oil supplies in the immediate future were not yet clear. Supplies from a numberof Arab countries to this country and the United States had been stopped.  The Governments concerned, save for Iraq, had done no more than put an embargo on tankers leaving for ports of eithernation but production in Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Libya had been stopped through action by the mobs.   If this situation were tocontinue it would have very serious effects and there would be asubstantial shortfall in supplies for the ^Eastern hemisphere.   Inaddition Iraq had placed an embargo on supplies from Iran passing through her territorial waters. He had in consequence instructed thatarrangements be put in hand for the introduction of a petrol rationing scheme and this fact would become public knowledge when the printing of ration books began at the beginning of the following week.It was necessary to do so since a rationing scheme required between two or three months to bring into operation.  Even if one became necessary, there would be advantage in deferring the introduction of rationing, if possible, until towards the end of August so as to avoid the peak of the holiday period; if this were to be done some economy in petrol consumption would be necessary from now on and he was considering   making   a   Ministerial   broadcast  asking  for  theco-operation of the public.   The United States Government had declared a state of emergency, which was legally necessary to enabletheir oil companies to take collective action in the face of anti-trustlegislation to meet a prospective shortage.  The Oil Sub-Committeeof the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development
Gibraltar(previous reference:CC(67) 37thConclusions,Minute 3)had met the previous day but agreement on action had been prevented by French obstruction; a further meeting would take place later that day.In discussion it was the general view that the balance ofadvantage lay in making no Ministerial broadcast appealing for economy in the use of petrol at present, but that, if a statement onthe situation in the Middle East were made in Parliament that day,it should cover the general position on oil supplies. As regards the embargo on oil supplies from Iran passing through the territorial waters of Iraq, we should not ourselves dispute this since we must seek to avoid becoming involved in a further dispute with the arab states and it must be a major objective of our policy to restore so faras possible good relations with them.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Minister of State for commonwealth Affairs would make an announcement on thefollowing day of our intention to carry out a referendum in Gibraltaron the choice between British and Spanish sovereignty. Its termstook account of the United Nations resolution on Gibraltar. TheSpanish Government would be informed of the statement shortly before it was made but had not been consulted on the terms ofreference of the referendum.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the commonwealth secretary, the Minister of Power and the Minister of Statefor Foreign Affairs.secret the &quot; D&quot; 2.   The Cabinet had before them a Note by the Secretary ofDm^whi^ the Cabinet (C (67) 95) t0 which was attached the draft of a white paper Paper on the &quot; D &quot; Notice system, together with the confidential finalrevise of the Report of the Privy Counsellors, under the chairmanship of Lord Radcliffe, who had investigated an alleged breach of&quot; D &quot; Notices in the previous February.The Prime Minister said that the need for a White Paper, to accompany the Radcliffe Report which was due to be published that afternoon, arose from the fact that the rather narrow interpretationplaced by the Radcliffe Committee on their terms of reference might result in some misunderstanding of the position unless a full statement were made by the Government both about the circumstances of the incident which had given rise to the appointment of the Committeeand about the implications of that incident for the future of the&quot; D &quot; Notice system. The draft White Paper had been discussed indetail by the Ministers primarily concerned; and it presented asobjective a picture as possible of the considerations involved.In discussion it was suggested that the White Paper might be criticised on the grounds that it appeared to contest the findings of the radcliffe Committee in so far as these exonerated the Daily Express
from the accusation that it had deliberately infringed two &quot; D&quot;Notices in the article published, in February. Moreover, the white paper might be thought to concentrate attention unduly on the extentto which the Secretary of the &quot; D &quot; Notice Committee might be held to have erred in his handling of the affair, whereas the RadcliffeReport revealed not only that the &quot; D&quot; Notices involved had themselves been progressively eroded by the passage of time but alsothat, in so far as the recent incident was concerned, officials other thanthe Secretary of the &quot; D &quot; Notice Committee might be held to beat some fault as regards the action which they had taken or had failedto take. In these circumstances, it might have been preferable if theWhite Paper had been confined to accepting the findings in the radcliffe Committee in relation to the incident in question and tostating that this incident showed that the &quot; D &quot; Notice system called for substantial revision, which was being undertaken as a matter of urgency.On the other hand no Government could remain indifferent to thefact, disclosed by the Radcliffe Report, that certain &quot; D &quot; Notices hadbeen so diluted in practice that they were no longer adequate toprotect national security and that, as a result, the &quot; D &quot;Notice system as a whole was in danger of collapsing. But the only alternative to the fresh attempt to restore and strengthen that system which the white paper proposed would be legislation designed to put the substance of &quot; D&quot; Notices on a statutory basis; and this would be soincompatible with the traditional freedom of the Press that it was essential to present to public opinion in a White Paper the full case for seeking to maintain the &quot; D &quot; Notice system and to enlist thefree and voluntary co-operation of the Press in its effective working.The Governments primary concern must therefore be not to attemptto apportion blame among the individuals involved in the incidentin question but to re-establish the &quot; D &quot; Notice system on a sound basis by remedying the defects which the Radcliffe Report had broughtto light and, in particular, putting the position and responsibility ofthe Secretary of the &quot; D &quot; Notice Committee on a clearer and more precisely defined footing than hitherto. Action to this end had, infact, been begun before the incident which had given rise to theappointment of the Radcliffe Committee. It should now be resumed,in conjunction with the consultations with the Press about the futureof the &quot; D &quot; Notice system which the Prime Minister proposed to initiate personally in the near future. Meanwhile it should be made clear that no disciplinary action had been taken against the secretary and that he had only been asked to elucidate certain discrepancies inthe evidence given to the Radcliffe Committee which the government felt bound to try to clear up before they could publish the white paper.The Cabinet-Agreed that the draft White Paper attached to C (67) 95should be published that afternoon.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th June, 1967.
