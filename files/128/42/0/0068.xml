parliament debate on fuel PolicyWhite Paper(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 3)OverseaAffairsMiddle East(previous reference:CC(67) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that the debate on the Arab/Israel conflict in the Security Council of the United Nations hadbeen brought to a successful conclusion by the unanimous adoptionon 22nd November of a British resolution providing for thewithdrawal of Israeli forces from occupied territories, an ending tobelligerency, guaranteed freedom of navigation through inter-national waterways and the despatch to the Middle East of a specialSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that, after the Prime Ministersdiscussion with the Miners&apos; Group members, it had been thought desirable to postpone the debate on the White Paper on Fuel Policyin order that the strong reaction among miners provoked by therecent speech of the Chairman of the National Coal Board, LordRobens, about employment prospects in the industry should beallowed to die down. It would not, however, be possible to defer the debate until after Christmas because a long delay would give theOpposition an opportunity to exploit the situation.In discussion it was suggested that the Miners&apos; Group, who hadnot contested the substance of the White Paper, were concerned lessabout the fuel policy itself than about the effectiveness of the government&apos;s regional policies and measures to assist development areas. Here the difficulty was largely one of timing. The problems would be intractable during the next 18 months, but thereafterwould diminish. It would be important, however, not to aggravatethem by further postponement of pit closures, which would necessitate a much accelerated run-down in the latter part of theperiod up to 1970 if the measures necessary to preserve the industry were to be completed in time.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment should complete their further consideration of fuel policy in time for a debate before Christmas, and it would be helpful if the Minister of Power would circulate a further paper in the lightof the revision of his calculations on the basis of the new exchange rate of sterling. In the meantime arrangements should be made, asindicated at their meeting on 21st November, for the ministers concerned with regional policies to discuss with the Miners&apos; Groupthe contribution which these policies could make to alleviate theeffects of colliery closures.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with other ministers concerned, to submit to the Cabinet a furtherpaper on fuel policy, taking account of the revision of hiscalculations on the basis of the present exchange rates.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to pursue his arrangements for meetings between the Miners&apos; Group and ministers concerned with regional policies.
South Arabia(previous reference:CC (67) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)Resumption ofDiplomaticRelations withthe united arab Republic(previous reference:CC(67) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4)Cyprus(previous reference:CC(67) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)representative of the Secretary-General charged with helping to achieve a peaceful settlement. The resolution had received the affirmative votes of all 15 members of the Council and both the arab states and Israel had acquiesced in it. The way was now open forthe Secretary-General&apos;s representative, who would probably beMr. Gunnar Jarring, a Swedish diplomatist, to go to the Middle East.The passing of the resolution, which was the first effective Britishinitiative on a contentious issue in the United Nations for a longtime, was a triumph for the United Kingdom Representative at theUnited Nations (Lord Caradon). It was too early to say whether itwould turn out to be the first step towards a settlement.The Foreign Secretary said that discussions had started in geneva on 21st November between the Minister without Portfolio,Lord Shackleton, and a delegation of the National Liberation Front(NLF). The talks had raised no serious difficulties so far, althoughthe NLF delegation had reacted unfavourably to the decision totransfer the Kuria Muria Islands to Muscat. There had not yetbeen any discussion of aid. The problem was to decide how muchof the aid we had offered to the former Federal Government we now needed to offer to the NLF in order to ensure the orderlywithdrawal of our forces. There was a risk of disorder if the south arabian Army thought they were going to lose the aid they expected.Meanwhile our withdrawal was proceeding smoothly.The Foreign Secretary said that the Government of the united arab Republic had now agreed formally to resume diplomatic relations and Ambassadors would be exchanged on 10th December.The Foreign Secretary said that there was grave tension between Greece and Turkey as a result of the recent incidentsbetween the Cyprus National Guard, under its Greek commander,General Grivas, and the Turkish inhabitants of the village of AyiosTheodoros. There was some doubt whether the incidents had beenprovoked by General Grivas on his own initiative or at the instigationof the Greek Government. The Greek Governmenfs reaction tothe incidents suggested that they had not been privy to them; andthey had helped to relieve tension by recalling General Grivas to greece. The Cyprus Government were also trying to restore thesituation to normal. The Turkish Government on the other handwere in an intransigent mood; and the Turkish forces were poisedfor an invasion of Cyprus by sea and air. He had been in touch withthe Turkish Foreign Minister, Mr. Caglayangil, and urged restraint.Meanwhile the President of the United States had decided to send to the area a special representative, Mr. Cyrus Vance, who was already in Ankara. The Secretary-General of the United nations was also sending a special representative to Cyprus, Greece and turkey.
Nigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)In discussion the Cabinet were informed that if Turkey invadedCyprus, the plan was to concentrate all United Kingdom nationals in the Sovereign Base Areas which were not expected to be involvedin a Turkish invasion. If Turkey invaded Cyprus she would probablyinvade Greece as well. The attack on Cyprus would not be againstthe Cyprus Government but against the Greek forces on the Island,of whom the Turks alleged that about 12,000 were there illegally.We had no defence treaty with Cyprus and were therefore under no obligation to respond to any appeal which the Cyprus government might make to us for assistance in the event of a Turkish invasion.Nevertheless, it was important that we should know in advance how we proposed to react in such a situation. The attitude we had taken up at the time of the Chinese invasion of India in 1964 and the war between India and Pakistan in 1965 might provide useful precedents.We should bring all possible pressure to bear on Turkey, seek to involve the United Nations as deeply as possible and take politicalaction at every level to stop the fighting. We should consider thepossible reaction of the Soviet Union. It was also necessary toconsider whether the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)could play a role in bringing to an end a war between two of its members. There was a danger that NATO intervention might leadto a break up of the Alliance. It might therefore be preferable toact through the United Nations.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider, in the light oftheir discussion, the political action which we should take,particularly in NATO, in the event of a Turkish invasion of Cyprus.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Defence and oversea Policy Committee had considered our policy on the supplyof arms to the Federal Military Government of.,Nigeria (FMG). Itwas now clear that the FMG was winning the war and that,negotiations having so far failed to lead to a settlement, our interests would best be served by a quick FMG victory, particularly by the capture of Port Harcourt. The Committee had therefore agreed thatour policy on arms should be relaxed so that we could now supply to the FMG such items as mortars and Stirling sub-machine guns,although there would be no question of allowing the export of aircraft or weapons of mass destruction.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement.
EconomicSituationConsequencesof Devaluation(previous reference:CC(67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Prime Minister said that, while it would be some time before the full implications of devaluation became apparent, itwould clearly be prudent to put in hand now a systematic study ofwhat was likely to be involved in terms of the realignment of theGovernments basic economic policies and forward strategy. the study would have to cover a wide field, including for example notonly policies for particular sectors of industry, but also the whole range of the Governments measures to promote industrial productivity and to save imports. He therefore proposed to invitethe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of State for economic Affairs to commission a study on these lines by their two departments, drawing on the advice of other Departments as necessary. While the full study would take a considerable time, the aim should be to produce an initial report in time for considerationby Ministers collectively before Christmas.There were a number of questions, affecting the Governmentsmeasures for switching resources to export and import saving, onwhich further work was in progress. The Cabinet had agreed attheir last meeting to consider further whether one of these measures should be to postpone the raising of the school-leaving age; it wouldbe helpful if the First Secretary of State, after consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for Scotland andthe Secretary of State for Education and Science, would circulate amemorandum on this for consideration by the Cabinet, if possibleduring the following week. The Chancellor of the Exchequer was considering further with the Ministers concerned two other outstand-ing matters which the Cabinet had agreed in principle: first, thebest means of securing a saving of  50 million in 1968-69 in civilpublic expenditure, mainly in the local authority field; and second,the specific reductions to be made in the investment programmes ofthe nationalised industries. The Chancellor of the Exchequer wouldbe reporting on these matters in due course.The Cabinet at their meeting on 16tb November had agreed inprinciple that an increase in the fuel oil tax should be included inthe package of measures following devaluation but had remitted theextent of the increase for further consideration. As a result of this further consideration it had been agreed on 18th November between himself and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the other ministers concerned that it would be preferable to omit the increase in fueltax from the package first, because, in the light of discussions whichthe Minister of Power had held with the interests concerned, therewas less ground for increasing the tax in order to allay anxieties inthe coal industry; second, because to include an increase in the tax would have given rise to criticism that the package of measures as awhole was placing an undue burden on industrial costs. Theannouncement of devaluation made on 18th November had therefore not mentioned an increase in the fuel tax. He sought the endorse-ment of the Cabinet for this decision.In discussion the following principal points were made (a) In considering whether the raising of the school-leaving ageshould be postponed, it would be useful if the Ministers concerned
CC (67) 68would also examine possible alternative means of reducing expenditure in the field of education, including expenditure onstudent grants; action on the latter might be more acceptable in thepresent climate of opinion than it would be in other circumstances.(b) It would be helpful from the point of view of the government&apos;s legislative timetable if it were possible to introducebefore Christmas the short Bill abolishing the export rebate and the premium payable under the Selective Employment Payments Act,1966 to manufacturing industry outside the development areas.(c) While the other nationalised industries had broadly acceptedthe proposed reductions in their investment programmes, there were signs that the National Coal Board would strongly contest the cutsproposed for their programme.(d) The Lord President would shortly circulate to all Ministersa brief on the economic measures to be taken following devaluation,to ensure consistency in public comment by Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Ministers statement about actionconsequential on devaluation.(2) Endorsed the decision that an increase in the fuel oil taxshould not form part of the package of measuresfollowing devaluation.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State, after consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Secretary of State for Education and science, to circulate, if possible for consideration duringthe following week, a memorandum on the desirabilityof postponing the raising of the school-leaving age andthe possibilities of alternative means of securingreductions in expenditure in the field of education.(4). Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Lord President and other Ministers concerned, toarrange for the preparation of a Bill to abolish the exportrebate and the premium payable under the selective employment Payments Act to manufacturing industryoutside the development areas, with a view to its introduction before the Christmas Recess.The Prime Minister invited the Secretary of State for economic affairs and the Minister of Labour to report on the discussions theyhad held with the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) and theTrades Union Congress (TUC) about the implications of devaluationfor the Governmenfs prices and incomes policy.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that, with theMinister of Labour, he had discussed the situation with the president and Director of the CBI and with representatives of the TUC on20th November. The object of the talks had been to secureendorsement of the Governmenfs economic measures and inparticular agreement that the criteria for price and wage movements
embodied in the White Paper on Prices and Incomes Policy(Cmnd. 3235 of 1967) would now need to be applied with even greater rigour. The TUC representatives had confirmed their support for the incomes policy and the TUC General Council, while accepting that a rise in prices was inevitable, had agreed that theywould not regard price increases arising from devaluation as constituting in themselves justification for increases in wages. Theyhad also agreed that they would regard as incompatible with incomes policy claims for improvements in wages due to take effect within12 months of a previous settlement. This was a satisfactory response and there had been remarkable degree of unanimityamong the members of the General Council.The response of the CBI representatives had been less satisfactory. They had argued that the advantages of devaluationto industry would be largely offset by the abolition of the exportrebate and the selective employment premium, increases in the priceof imported raw materials and the rise in Bank Rate. They had made it clear that they had no confidence that a prices and incomes policy on a voluntary basis could be successfully sustained in a situation of rapidly growing demand and falling unemployment. Thesolution they advocated was extensive cuts in public expenditure anda straightforward wage freeze. He had urged on them the importanceof the CBI endorsing the Governmenfs policy and advising theirconstituent organisations accordingly. The final attitude of the CBIwould not be known until after a meeting of their Grand Council on 6th December. While the discussion with their officers had been disappointing, in face of the more constructive response of the TUCthey might well hesitate to stand out in opposition.The Minister of Labour said that the response of the TUC hadbeen satisfactory, but pronouncements by the TUC General council would have little effect unless individual trade unions paid heed tothem. Unfortunately there were already signs that particular tradeunions, even where their leaders had been party to the GeneralCouncils decisions, would be reluctant to accept the implications ofthese decisions for their own wage negotiations. While his department would do their best to uphold the criteria for wage increases, it was likely that, we should be faced with considerableindustrial unrest during the winter, and the co-operative attitude ofthe TUC General Council would not of itself suffice to prevent a major confrontation.:   In further discussion the following principal points were made-(e) Increases in wages arising from settlements since the end ofJune 1967 had averaged about 6 per cent. Experience showed that wages tended to increase faster at times when unemployment wasfalling, and the prospect for 1968 was for an average increase in wages of some 7-8 per cent; indeed, taking account of the prospective increase in the cost of living, it might be even greater. On the otherhand, there was a smaller backlog of wage claims at the present time than there had been in July 1966 when the wage freeze was imposed.Moreover the impact of incomes policy over the last year on tradeunion attitudes towards wage claims should not be underestimated;
at least the unions now recognised that it was essential that wage increases should be linked with increased productivity. The main difficulties arose in sectors where productivity could not be measured.(/) It was suggested that it would not be possible, during a timeof rising prices and increasing demand for labour, to sustain anincomes policy which was basically voluntary. Though it would notbe practicable at present, it might be necessary next year for theGovernment to contemplate taking further legislative powers: forexample, they might need to consider fixing a positive annual normfor wage increases and enforcing this by law.(g) The Government should try to determine their attitudetowards major wage claims while these were still at an early stage of negotiation; if it was clear that in the end it would be compatible with the Governmenfs policy to allow some increase, it would be preferable to obtain a quick settlement with the interested parties on that basis rather than to engage in protracted opposition to any increase, which would antagonise the unions often without producing a more acceptable result.(h) It might be worth examining further the proposal that, inthe interests of preventing increases in prices which were not justified by the effects of devaluation, arrangements should be made for localauthorities to exercise some oversight over price movements in their areas. On the other hand, any such arrangement would cut acrossexisting provision for early warning and oversight of price increasesby the Departments concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidMinisters would need to give further consideration to future prices and incomes policy in the light of the attitude of the CBI and TUC.Meanwhile it would be useful if existing arrangements for oversightof price movements could be reviewed and consideration given to thepossibility of local authorities playing some part in this field.The Cabinet-(5) Took note of the statements by the Secretary of State for economic Affairs and the Minister of Labour.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Ministers concerned, to put in handa review of arrangements for the oversight of pricemovements as indicated in the Prime minister&apos;s summing up.
SocialServicesDevaluation:Implications forSupplementaryBenefit andFamilyAllowances(previous reference:CC.(67) 67thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C(67) 184) by theFirst Secretary of State on the implications of devaluation for supplementary benefit and family allowances.The First Secretary of State recalled that the Chancellor of theExchequer, in his statement on 18th November, had announced theGovernments intention to take, at the right time, steps to protect the most vulnerable sections of the community from hardshipresulting from devaluation, and he himself had been invited to discuss with the Minister of Social Security and the Treasury what steps would need to be taken. The people concerned were the old, the poorer families and others eligible for supplementary benefit. Itwould be necessary to resist pressure for increases in pensionsgenerally because of the high cost; and for the purpose of helping the most vulnerable to rely on the selective supplementary benefit.On the assumption that prices were likely to rise during 1968 by5 to 6 per cent, increases in supplementary benefit of some 4s. aweek costing  35 million net in a full year might be required by theend of the year. Supplementary benefit would not, however, help the families of the lowest wage earners in full employment, and, interms of an increase in prices and of the need to resist pressure forincreased wages, an increase in family allowances would be an appropriate means of helping these people. The amountproportionate to the rise in prices would be about Is. a week foreach eligible child, but it could be argued that the effect had to beconsidered in relation to the whole family income, and not merely the family allowance, and on this basis a politically more acceptablefigure would be 3s. a week costing about  35 million. The cost would have to be met out of taxation. It was not necessary to reach a decision on the amount at present, but since legislation would berequired the opportunity might be taken to amend the family allowances and National Insurance Bill, which was about to enterits Committee Stage, to give the Minister of Social Security powerto raise supplementary benefits by order subject to affirmative resolution. This would provide useful flexibility, but might alsostimulate pressure for action to assist pensioners.In discussion it was agreed that it would be necessary to increasesupplementary benefit during 1968, but an announcement of theGovernments intentions and of the amount of the increase could be delayed until the spring. The change could be made by statutory instrument, but it would be necessary to allow three months to bringthe increased amounts into payment.On family allowances, it was pointed out that, since large families and the families of low wage earners were known to beamong the poorest sections of the population, the Government wouldbe expected to make some increase in family allowances, but the increases need not be given across the board; they could be concentrated either on large families or, for example, on the secondchild in the family. It would in any event be convenient to take power to alter the allowance by order.  On the other hand, it was
argued that under the current Bill families would receive an increaseof 7s. in the allowances in April, when the increase in prices wouldhave become apparent. There did not at present appear to be anyjustification for raising the increase to 10s., particularly as family allowances were not popular and there was no clear evidence thatthey were relevant to wage claims, though the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) had shown themselves interested in social payments in this connection. It was suggested that family allowances shouldnot be paid at all above an income level of  1,000 a year, and thatthe money saved should be used to help the poorest families; if sucha change were ever to be made, the present might be a suitable opportunity.On the question whether enabling powers should be taken inthe current Bill, it was suggested that it would be preferable for any action on family allowances to be taken next spring, when theproposals could be seen in the context of the Budget and of any additional taxation that might be proposed. It would be preferable,therefore, not to seek powers now and thus to create an expectation of early action. A provision to increase family allowances, or even to take enabling powers, might be inserted in the Finance Bill. this might be criticised by the Opposition as contrary to the usual practice and proprieties, but was not impossible. consideration should, however, be given to using the rate rebate scheme ratherthan family allowances as a means of helping the poorer families.The rate rebate scheme was already m satisfactory operation and had resulted in the payment in the current year of  1 million in rebates,averaging  15 for each family concerned. The level of eligibility was at present an income of  10 a week for a married man, which roseby 30s. a week for each child. The details of the scheme could,however, be altered by Order in Council. It would provide a formof selectivity which had shown itself to be acceptable and had theadvantage that 25 per cent of the cost and the whole responsibilityfor administration fell on the local authorities.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that it would be necessary to increasesupplementary benefits during 1968, but that no announcement oftheir intentions need be made yet. The amounts and timing couldbe considered in the spring. On family allowances, they were agreedthat enabling powers should not be taken in the Family allowances and National Insurance Bill. If on further consideration a further increase in the allowances seemed desirable, it could be authorised by the Finance Bill when it could be seen in relation to the Budget.A decision whether to increase the allowances, and, if so, by how much, should be deferred until the spring, and in the meantimeconsideration should be given to the use of the rate rebate scheme as an alternative. The Minister of Social Security should consider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, what she should say on the protection of families in the further debates on the family allowances and National Insurance Bill.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be necessary to increase supplementary benefits during 1968, but that no decision as to theamount or timing of the increases should be taken beforethe spring.(2) Agreed that no amendment should be made to the family allowances and National Insurance Bill to confer on theMinister of Social Security powers to vary family allowances by order.(3) Invited the Minister of Social Security to consider, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, whatshe should say, in the further debates on the family allowances and National Insurance Bill, about theprotection of families against the effects of devaluation.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of housing and. Local Government, the Minister of Social Security,and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to consider whetheramendment of the rate rebate scheme would be preferable,as a means of giving help to the poorer families, to anincrease in family allowances.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,23rd November, 1967.
