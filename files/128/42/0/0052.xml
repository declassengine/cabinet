AberfanDisasterReport ofthe tribunal of Inquiry(previous reference:CC(66) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6)CC 52 (67)secret. The Secretary of State for Wales said that he had received on 19th July the report of the Tribunal of Inquiry on the disasterat Aberfan and had said in reply to a Parliamentary Question on thefollowing day that the report would be published as a ParliamentaryPaper early in August. It was necessary to decide when the report should be published, what should be said on behalf of the government at that point and what should be said before Parliament rose.Unfortunately it was not possible for the. report to be publishedbefore the Recess because of the time needed by the printers to reproduce the plans and photographs which were necessary to theunderstanding of the text. The earliest practicable date would be3rd August.The Prime Minister said that the report was a damagingindictment of the National Coal Board and contained severe strictureson a number of named individuals including the chairman of theBoard. It should be published at the earliest practicable date sothat any suggestion that publication had been deliberately deferred until after the Parliamentary adjournment could be firmly answered.It might be desirable to state on publication whether the government accepted the report or were considering it: to reject it seemed outof the question and it might be thought difficult to justify defermentof acceptance.In discussion it was suggested that the Lord President shouldtake an opportunity during the debate on the adjournment later inthe day to announce that the report would be published on 3rd august and to give a firm assurance that a full day&apos;s debate would be arranged as soon as the House resumed. It would be appropriate to say nothing further until the report had been published and careful thought would have to be given to the question whether theGovernment could then say that they accepted it, in view of thestrictures passed on named individuals. It might be possible to saythat the Government wished to defer a general statement on thereport until they had had the opportunity of considering the views expressed in the debate in the autumn.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that itwould be helpful if the Minister without Portfolio would take the chair of a committee of the Ministers principally concerned, toconsider in the light of the Cabinefs discussion what should be said on the publication of the report and what advice should be givento Ministers who could not avoid commenting on it during the Recess.Since attempts might be made to make political capital out of thereport during the Recess, Ministers who were not closely concernedwith the subject should be careful not to be drawn into public discussion of it. The Home Affairs Committee should consider inthe autumn what action the Government should take on the report and in the meantime it would be helpful if the Minister without portfolio would be responsible for watching the development of thesituation and the possible need for some further government statement.8206
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Wales to arrange for thepublication of the report of the Tribunal into the disaster. at Aberfan to be published on 3rd August,(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council to announce thedate of publication in the debate on the adjournmentin the House of Commons later that day and to undertakethat a debate would be arranged immediately the Houseresumed.(3) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for acommittee under his chairmanship, comprising the LordChancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the HomeSecretary, the Minister of Housing and Local Government,the Secretary of State for Wales, the Minister of Power,the Chief Secretary, Treasury and the Attorney-General,to consider what statement should be made on thepublication of the report and what advice should begiven to those Ministers who would need to refer to itpublicly during the Recess.Oil supply situation(previous reference:CC(67) 49thConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of power (C (67) 136) on oil supplies.The Minister of Power said that the supply situation was improving slightly; and the forecasts for the end of September had improved still further since his memorandum had been circulated.In general it remained a problem of the availability and of thererouting of tankers, rather than of the extent of supplies. The soviet union had again refused to supply us.&apos; He was keeping in close touch with the oil companies to see that the United Kingdom gotat least its fair share of deliveries despite the continuation of the banby Arab countries on shipments to the United Kingdom and UnitedStates. He was also discussing with them how best to strike a balance between our own immediate needs and our long-term interestin maintaining export outlets.The only immediate cause for anxiety was in respect of naphtha;there was an absolute shortage in the Western world at present. Thetwo main consumers (the Gas Boards and the petro-chemical industries) where being consulted on the use of alternative fuels and how best to apportion available supplies, including the possibility ofwidening the specifications. There had been no application for afurther increase of prices and a close watch was being maintained on the situation in this respect, in relation both to companies&apos; costs in the United Kingdom and to prices in Europe. As regards thebalance of payments, the present estimate was that, if the dislocationslasted for six months, i.e., until the end of November, the additional
: j.:   .... CC 52 (67)cost to the United Kingdom would be about  85 million, of which some  15 million would fall in 1968. Much the largest item wasthe cost of chartering tankers. If rationing were imposed, about  15million might be saved through the rationing of motor fuel andcertain restrictions on the consumption of industrial oil and about 25 million by more severe cuts, especially on industrial fuels. Butthe effect of these on industry in general, while incapable of closecalculation, could easily be so great as to result, through a fall in exports, in a net loss in the balance of payments. An efficientrationing scheme had now been fully developed and the printed rationbooks would be kept available in storage. It did not however appearthat it would be necessary to impose rationing on supply grounds :nor was it necessary as a precautionary measure to start the issue ofration books so as to be able to institute rationing by mid-Septembershould the situation deteriorate. Nevertheless, the position remainedprecarious and would need to be kept under constant review.In discussion there was general agreement with the conclusionsof the Minister of Power and the following points were made (a) If a deterioration in the situation made it necessary tointroduce rationing, it would also be necessary to suspend drivingtests for some three weeks, since those concerned would be requiredto assist in the introduction of rationing. As much notice as possible should therefore be given to the Ministry of Transport if this proved necessary.(b) Further consideration would have to be given to the positionof the Republic of Ireland if rationing were introduced in the UnitedKingdom: it would be necessary on supply grounds for the IrishGovernment to introduce rationing also, but there was no legislative provision for this.(c) After the present crisis was over, and supplies of naphthawere readily available, it might be desirable to consider maintaininglarger stocks in the United Kingdom. %In further discussion the Cabinet considered the desirability ofan early announcement that rationing would not be introduced.It was the general view that the major consideration in reaching adecision was the effect that such an announcement might have onthe attitude of the Arab States towards the continuation of supplies;this would call for further consideration by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of C (67) 136.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to keep the oil situation under close review and to report the situation weekly to thePrime Minister during the Summer Recess.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theMinister of Power, to consider in the light of the discussion the effect on the Arab States of an early announcement that oil rationing would not be introduced in the UnitedKingdom.8206a 3
(4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theMinister of Power and other Ministers concerned, would consider in the light of Conclusions (2) and (3) when adecision should be taken and announced that oil rationingwould not be introduced in the United Kingdom.IndustrialPolicyIndustrialExpansionBillSECRET3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State (C (67) 133) about the Industrial Expansion Bill.The First Secretary of State said that the Ministerial Committeeon Economic Policy had agreed that a general enabling Bill, on thelines described in his memorandum, was urgently required. TheBill would enable Ministers of Departments with responsibilities forsponsoring industries to introduce measures to promote industrial efficiency, to expand or sustain productive capacity and to supporttechnological advance. Schemes falling within the scope of the bill would be submitted to Parliament in the form of Orders subject to affirmative Resolution. When the Bill was introduced, theGovernment would submit to Parliament proposals for a SelectCommittee which would be able to examine schemes promoted underthe Bill. Private industry was at present often too slow in reorganisingitself and the Government had inadequate powers to provide thenecessary assistance.The Minister of Technology had three aircraft projects requiringlegislation and had other industrial projects in mind; these couldall be introduced by Orders under the new Bill if it were enacted intime. On the other hand, it was most important to consult industryfully about the proposals and not to leave them with the impression that the Government had left insufficient time to take the irrepresentations into account. These consultations could however be satisfactorily completed in time to introduce the new Bill in november and there would be little risk of having to defer its introduction until after the end of the year or, therefore, of requiring a separate Billfor the purchase of the Beagle Aircraft Company. Subject to cabinet approval, the Minister of Technology and he would see representativesof the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) on 27th July to discussthe proposals. He proposed to write to the General Secretary of theTrades Union Congress (TUC), suggesting a meeting with the TUCin September.  However, there was some difficulty about arranging the necessary early consultation with the National economic development Council (NEDC).   A very full agenda had alreadybeen circulated for the NEDC meeting on 2nd August and theywould not be meeting again until 9th October; but this would still leave time for the introduction of the Bill in November.  Finally,while it was not possible to identify now all the types of projects which the Government might wish to promote under the Bill in thefuture, it would be necessary to give industry, during the course of consultations, a considerably fuller description of the sort of projectsenvisaged than the draft White Paper at present contained.
The Minister of Technology said that the previous autumn hehad identified a number of projects to assist industry to increaseexports and to saves imports. However, he had been advised that each project would require separate legislation. More recently hehad discussed with the Lord President the problems involved in finding Parliamentary time for the separate Bills required for three aircraft projects for which legislation was required, as well as measures designed to sustain investment in the machine tool industry and to finance the leasing of computers. The proposal for a generalenabling Bill, of the kind now proposed, appeared to be a progressivesolution to the Parliamentary problems involved.It was however desirable that the programme of consultationwith industry and the publication of the White Paper should becarried out more quickly than had been suggested. The subjectcould appropriately be raised at the meeting of NEDC on 2ndAugust when a paper about the Ministry of Technology was underdiscussion. Arrangements should now be made for very earlyconsultation with the TUC and subsequently the White Paper onthe proposals could be issued in August. This programme wouldrequire a dummy White Paper to be laid by the end of that week.The Bill could then be introduced at the beginning of the following session.In discussion, there was general agreement that the White paper should be published earlier than had been contemplated by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy. Once consultations with industry began, garbled versions of the Governmenfs proposals would inevitably leak and would be open to deliberatemisrepresentation. It was also most desirable that the White paper should have been published before the Labour Party and TUC annualConferences. Since the Economic Policy Committee had made their recommendations, the subject had been widely discussed in the press and the previous arguments for delaying publication no longer hadforce. It was suggested, however, that it would make for better relations with industry if such an early White Paper made it clearthat, while the Government were fully committed to the general principles of the Bill, they were prepared to consider changes in thelight of the consultations with industry. It was also suggested thatit should be made clear that enabling powers provided by the bill would not be confined to projects to assist manufacturing industryonly but would extend more widely; for example, to the shipping industry.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that an Industrial Expansion Bill on the lines proposedin C (67) 133 should now be prepared. Consultations with the tuc and NEDC, as well as the CBI, should be brought forward asproposed by the Minister of Technology, to enable a White Paperabout the Bill to be published in the third or fourth week of August.The text of the White Paper should be cleared for publication bythe First Secretary of State in consultation with the other ministers concerned.  Meanwhile, the Minister of Technology should arrange
forthwith for the drafting of the Bill, which it should be the aim tointroduce at the beginning of the following Session, thus avoiding the need for separate legislation for the three aircraft projects referredto in paragraph 5 of C (67) 133.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State, with the other ministers concerned, to make arrangements for early consultationabout the proposed Industrial Expansion Bill with the cbi, TUC and NEDC.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to consider, in consultationwith the Lord President of the Council, the President ofthe Board of Trade, the Minister of Transport, theMinister of Power, the Minister of Technology and theChief Secretary, Treasury, the text of a White Paper onthe subject.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, subject to Conclusions(1) and (2) and in consultation with the Lord Presidentof the Council, to arrange for the publication of the white paper during the second half of August.(4) Invited the Minister of Technology to arrange, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, for the drafting ofan Industrial Expansion Bill on the lines proposed inC (67) 133.Cabinet(previous reference:CC(67) 52ndConclusions,Minute 4)Submission of white Papersduring theRecessCONFIDENTIAL4. The Secretary of State for Defence said that it might prove necessary for him to issue a White Paper during the Summer Recessin respect of the highly complicated case of Mr. Parkes, a deserterfrom the army who had been convicted in the Courts on the previous day of perjury. In view of the normal practice that the drafts of white Papers were invariably submitted to the Cabinet, it was forconsideration how the necessary collective Ministerial approval couldbe given during the period when the Cabinet would not normallyhave meetings.In discussion some doubt was expressed whether it would be appropriate to issue a White Paper in respect of the case mentioned by the Defence Secretary, but it was the general view that in any event arrangements should be made to give collective Ministerialapproval for the issue of White Papers during the Summer Recess,both because the need might arise unexpectedly and also becauseotherwise there would be unreasonable pressure upon the Cabinetto consider draft White Papers at the end of July.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet agreed that he should make the necessary arrangements ontheir behalf for a group of Ministers to consider and approve, as necessary, the drafts of White Papers which it might prove desirableto issue during the Summer Recess while regular meetings of
RailwayPolicyMain Reportof JointSteeringGroupSECRET5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 138) by theMinister of Transport, to which was attached the main report ofthe Joint Steering Group set up to review future railway policy.The Minister of Transport said that an earlier interim report had recommended Government grants to cover the losses which would otherwise be made by providing certain unremunerative passenger services for social reasons. The main report now made far-reachingproposals for the financial reconstruction of British Railways (BR)and for the improvement of its management structure. There hadbeen very serious lack of financial control by the British railways board for many years. Some  1,400 million had been invested inBR during the last ten years without any significant impact on itsdeficit. Financial and management reconstruction must be seen astwo complementary parts of a single programme and the first mustnot be allowed to proceed without the second. The financial proposals involved the writing off of  700 million of suspended debt and a very large part possibly  400 million of the  900 million of debt on which interest was still being paid. BR&apos;s assets would be written down correspondingly, so that there would be a reduction infuture provision for depreciation as well as interest charges. Thiswould have the incidental effect of imposing tighter control overfuture investment, by reducing the cash flow from normal operationsavailable to finance it. Track rationalisation was urgently required:with modern signalling equipment it would, for example, be possiblein many cases to carry on two tracks the traffic for which four trackswere now provided. A Government grant tapering from  15 million a year to zero over five years would enable BR to carry through thisrationalisation.The report also recommended that the BR Board should be smaller and that, in the main, the members should concentrate moreCC 52 (67)the Cabinet were not being held. In view of the doubts which were expressed about the case of Mr. Parkes, the Defence Secretary should set out the need for a White Paper in a minute to him which shouldbe copied to the Home Secretary, in view of the latter&apos;s concern withcertain aspects of the case.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a group of Ministers to consider collectively on their behalf the drafts of any White Papers which individual ministers might think it desirable to issue during the summer recess.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to submit a minuteto the Prime Minister, with a copy to the Home Secretary,about the desirability of issuing a White Paper regardingthe case of Mr. Parkes.
on broad policy issues and less on day-to-day operation. Thereshould, however, be members specialising on financial policy, long-range planning and labour relations. There should be a ChiefGeneral Manager responsible to the Chairman for the day-to-dayrunning of the railways. The Regional Boards should be abolished.In order to attract and keep managers of the quality required, it wouldbe necessary to pay them at the full commercial rates for comparableemployment. The Chairman of BR agreed with the financialrecommendations and also that the Regional Boards should be abolished but he was not yet favourably disposed towards theproposals for a Chief General Manager nor for a smaller, lessfunctional Board.Subject to the Cabinefs approval, the necessary provision wouldbe made in the Transport Bill, now being drafted, for those recommendations which required legislative sanction. It would be preferable to publish the report in full or in an edited version; butfailing this, its main recommendations should be included in one ofthe White Papers on Transport Policy which she proposed to publishin the autumn.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposalsof the Minister of Transport and the following points were made -(a) The proposals involved writing off large sums and it was essential that approval for this course should be conditional on theacceptance and simultaneous implementation of the proposals for changes in management structure.(b) The need to pay higher salaries to the senior staff and members of the British Railways Board would inevitably have repercussions on the salaries of members of the Boards of other nationalised industries. These salaries would in any event call forfurther consideration in the light of the present level of comparablesalaries in private industry. It would probably prove desirable toconsider these issues as a whole and it might be necessary to referproposals at some stage to the National Board for Prices and incomes. The best course would be for Treasury Ministers toconsider, in consultation with the Ministers concerned withnationalised industries, what proposals covering the whole field shouldbe put forward for collective Ministerial consideration.(c) Further consideration should be given to the timing andmanner of publication of the proposals, which would need to be related&apos;to the timing of any announcement of increased fares whichmight be made in the near future.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport to consult the ministerial committee on Economic Policy, in the light of her further consultations, on the timing and manner of publicationof the recommendations of the Joint Steering Group.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved C (67) 138.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,25th July, 1967.
