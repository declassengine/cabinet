CC 55 (67)secret. The Foreign Secretary said there had been no change in theposition with regard to the two British pilots who had been detained in Algeria since the aircraft carrying the exiled Congolese leader,Mr. Tshombe, had been taken over by force at the end of June.Their interrogation had been completed and no charges were beingmade against them. There was no reason to believe that theywere implicated in any way in the kidnapping. But the Algerianauthorities would not let them go until they had decided what todo with the other occupants of the aircraft and with Mr. Tshombe.All our efforts to secure the pilots&apos; release had so far been unsuccessful. He proposed to try to enlist the support of the united nations when he was in New York later in the month. He alsointended to discuss the problem with the Algerian Foreign Minister,if he were there, and with the Secretary-General of the united nations. But it was difficult to bring any effective pressure to bearon the Algerian Government so long as they were determined to disregard international opinion. Press interest in this country inthe fate of the pilots was mounting and there might be heavy pressure to place an embargo on all United Kingdom trade with Algeria andin particular to stop shipments of Algerian gas, which had just been resumed. Officials of the appropriate Departments were studying the possibility of such action and its legal and other implications.In discussion it was pointed out that the Gas Council boughtAlgerian gas from an international company in which they onlyhad a part interest and which they could not therefore control.A threat to stop buying the gas would not exert pressure on Algeriasince other countries would readily take over the contract. Moreoverwe badly needed Algerian gas in order to maintain our naphthasupplies over the next two winters.The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a renewal of serious fighting in South Arabia between the National LiberationFront (NLF) and the Front for the Liberation of Occupied SouthYemen (FLOSY) but the South Arabian Army seemed to be holdingtogether and was continuing its efforts to reconcile the two factions.There had been no official reaction from the NLF to the HighCommissioner^ offer to enter into immediate discussions with thenationalist forces: but unofficial reactions were not unfavourable.King Faisal of Saudi Arabia had reacted strongly in the face ofour offer and had asked that it be delayed for a month in which time he would seek to bring the various factions together. Wehad not felt able to accept such a delay.The referendum in Gibraltar on the choice between British and spanish sovereignty had now taken place and as expected had resulted in an overwhelming vote in favour of continued association with the United Kingdom. There had been no reaction from theSpanish Government since the referendum. He proposed now to concert with the Commonwealth Secretary a reply to the SpanishGovernment^ previous proposal for talks.8372
Cyprus(previous reference -CC (67) 28thConclusions,Minute 3)SouthAfrica(previous reference:CC (67) 35thConclusions,Minute 3)UnitedStates ofAmerica(previous reference:CC (66) 61stConclusions,Minute 2)In discussion it was pointed out that the commonwealth governments represented in the United Nations Committee of 24had played an unhelpful part in the Committee&apos;s recent discussions on Gibraltar, despite their professions of support for the self-determination of peoples under colonial rule. It might be helpful to arrange for Gibraltarian representatives to visit certainCommonwealth countries as part of an attempt to seek a morehelpful attitude towards our dispute with Spain on the part of theGovernments concerned.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider in the lightof their discussion the desirability of arranging forGibraltarian representatives to visit a number of commonwealth countries.The Foreign Secretary said that the discussions on Cyprusbetween the Turkish and Greek Governments had been resumed ata meeting on 9th and 10th September in Thrace between theirrespective Prime Ministers, but no progress seemed to have beenmade towards agreement.We had protested in the strongest possible terms to the SouthAfrican Government against their decision, announced on 8thSeptember, to send into Rhodesia, without our consent, a body ofSouth African police to co-operate with the Rhodesian police toprevent the incursion of terrorists into South Africa. our ambassador in Pretoria had on 13th September seen the SouthAfrican Foreign Minister who had indicated that the number ofpolice was not large and that he hoped it might be possible towithdraw them before long.The United States Senate had now endorsed the decision ofthe House of Representatives to insist on the requirement that allUnited States naval vessels should be built in American yards. the implications of this decision for our purchase of the Fill would need to be urgently considered in the light of the concurrentunderstanding about offset purchases. The United states administration was gravely disturbed by the decision, which it had done its best to prevent: but it could not effectively ask congress to reverse their decision. Our Ambassador in Washington had advised that we should immediately protest against the decision andpublicly express our concern both in the Press and at ministerial level. If we did not at once protest strongly, there was a dangerof similar decisions in other fields, arising from Congressionaldissatisfaction with our policy in Vietnam and particularly withregard to British ships sailing to North Vietnamese ports.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the implications of the decision for the prospect of offsetting the costs of buying theFill were less serious than might appear. United States purchasescovering 40 per cent of these costs had already been made and contracts to the value of a further  5 million were in the courseof being negotiated.
Nigeria(previous reference :CC(67) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)Nevertheless there was general agreement that the implications of the United States decision for our agreement to purchase theFill should be further considered.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that Ministers should, in consultation with theForeign Secretary, publicly express the Governmenfsserious concern at the decision of the United StatesCongress.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Defence to circulate forfurther collective Ministerial discussion a memorandumon the implications of this decision for our agreement to purchase the Fill.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the military stalematein Nigeria continued and that the attempt by the Secretary-Generalof the Commonwealth Secretariat, Mr. Arnold Smith, to promotepeaceful negotiations had received a negative response from bothsides. There had been some indication from the Chief Justice ofthe Eastern Region who had recently been in London that theGovernment of the latter might be prepared to start talks withoutconditions. But this was contradicted by the known views of colonel ojukwu, the military governor of the Eastern Region. We couldonly continue to watch the situation and lend support to any move towards a settlement.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statements by the Secretaries of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs.Middle EastCurrentSituation(previous reference :CC(67) 54thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C (67) 150) on the current situation in the Middle East.The Foreign Secretary said that the prospects of a settlement inthe Middle East were still confused. Since the meeting at Khartoumin August of representatives of the Arab States, the latter had shownsigns of a more rational approach to the problem of Israel and of seeking a settlement. The Israeli attitude on the other hand hadhardened; and there was a risk that the Arab States would revert to their former intransigence. It would be unwise to count on theearly reopening of the Suez Canal. Much would depend on theforthcoming meeting of the General Assembly of the United nations in New York. The United States Government believed that theSoviet Union were resiling from the terms for a draft security council Resolution which had been agreed in July between theSoviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, and the United states representative at the United Nations, Mr. Goldberg. We should seek acceptance by the Security Council of a Resolution on thelines of that draft, which established a direct connection between an Israeli withdrawal and the ending of belligerency by the Arabs.8372
OH supply situation(previous reference :CC (67) 52ndConclusions,Minute 2)There had been recent indications in particular an article inthe Sunday Times on 11th September by the Editor of Al-Ahramthat the Government of the United Arab Republic (UAR) were interested in resuming discussions with the United Kingdom andeven in resuming diplomatic relations. He had in response sentPresident Nasser a message indicating that if he wished to resumediscussions, we should be glad to do so and offering to send to cairo for that purpose a senior official whom the President knewand trusted.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that satisfactoryinternational arrangements could be made to deal with any balanceof payments problems which might arise from the withdrawal of sterling balances by Kuwait and other Arab states in order to fulfil the obligations which they had undertaken at the meeting inKhartoum to provide financial support for the UAR and Jordan.The Cabinet Took note of C (67) 150.secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of power (C (67) 149) on the oil supply situation.The Minister of Power said that the recent conference inKhartoum of representatives of Arab States had agreed that the banon oil supplies destined to the United Kingdom, the United Statesand West Germany should be removed on 1st September. Thiswould not affect the total supplies available to Europe which, aslong as the Suez Canal remained closed, were limited by tankercapacity and might be increased only by the opening of the pipelinefrom .Saudi Arabia to Syria or the resumption of exports fromNigeria. The decision would, however, assist the oil companies ineffecting the most economic programme for tankers and supplies and would enable us to obtain crude oils better suited to ourrefineries. Enough tankers were nOw available to meet Europeanneeds for oil in the coming winter, though at high cost: but theprospects would continue to be insecure until there was a settlement in the Middle East. Stocks in the United Kingdom during thecoming winter were now estimated to be at a satisfactory level exceptfor naphtha. Special measures were still necessary to deal withthis shortage but there could now be greater confidence that minimumdemands could be met: the position would be somewhat easierwhen the supply of Algerian natural gas was resumed. imperial chemical Industries had attempted to buy supplies of naphtha fromthe Soviet Union but these were only available on trans-shipment viaRotterdam and the additional cost involved made them uneconomic.The general supply situation was now such that the precautionary measures which had been taken in respect of rationing (which werecosting  30,000 a month for offices and pre-empting a number ofstaff) could be relaxed. There remained the possibility that anadditional temporary surcharge would be needed to cover theincreased costs of the oil companies and he would consult hiscolleagues further on this in the light of further discussion with the
CC 55 (67)companies. The committee of officials which had been consideringcurrent arrangements for our oil supplies would now turn to a longer-term study of the security of our oil supplies in the future.In discussion there was general agreement that the precautionaryarrangements in respect of rationing could now be relaxed asproposed by the Ministry of Power and that periodic reports on oil supplies, as distinct from supplies of naphtha, could be discontinued. The point was also made that we had been greatlyhelped in meeting the recent crisis by the large stocks of oil whichwere held in the United Kingdom. It would be necessary to considera timetable for building up those stocks to meet any later crisis thatmight ensue. In that connection it would be desirable to considerthe fullest possible use of the oil storage facilities maintained on defence account.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (67) 149.(2) Agreed that the precautionary measures which had beentaken in preparation for oil rationing could now be relaxed, as proposed by the Ministry of Power.(3) Invited the, Ministry of Power, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Defence, to consider the use of oil storage facilities on defence account in replenishingoil stocks.(4) Invited the Minister of Power to make fortnightly reports to the Ministerial Committee on Industrial Policy onavailable supplies of naphtha.of the Exchequer on a National Loans Fund (C (67) 144).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the object of theproposal in his memorandum to set up a National Loans fund was to take the great bulk of Consolidated Fund lending and of the resulting borrowing out of the Exchequer, i.e., those transactions inwhich the Government acted as an intermediary and not as a principal. His original reason for formulating this proposal hadbeen presentational, namely to remove the inhibitions on policywhich the inclusion of these transactions in the Exchequer accountssometimes created. The present arrangements required undueemphasis to be placed on the extent of Government borrowing even when the Budget provided for a substantial surplus. In working out the proposal, however, it had become clear that there was alsojustification of substance for it, i.e., that it was desirable to abandon the 19th century concepts of public financing which were embodied in the present arrangements and which had come to be outmodedby the increase in the number and size of Government borrowingtransactions.   Implementation of the proposal would enable himSECRETA national loans Fund4.The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor
to present a clear-cut Exchequer account and so to removemisconceptions about the significance for the economy of the relatively large Exchequer borrowing requirements, by concentratingGovernmental borrowing operations in the proposed separateNational Loans Fund, out of which loans to nationalised industries and local authorities would be made. To assist the dissociationof these transactions from the Budget and so ease its presentationforecasts of lending from the Fund could probably be published ata different time from the presentation of the Budget. Whilst theintroduction of the National Loans Fund would not ease any problemsof policy, it was hoped that it would allow, if that were desired, animmediate and significant increase in local authority access to thePublic Works Loan Board, whose operations would be brought within the ambit of the Fund. In so far as this reduced the need of local authorities to borrow on the open market, it would help to reduce the cost of their long-term borrowing. It would be agreat advantage if the Bill could be passed before 31st March, 1968,as there would be a very substantial Exchequer borrowing requirement in 1968-69, which would otherwise complicate the presentation of the Budget.In discussion there was general agreement in principle withthe proposal. The following main, points were made:(a) While the merits of the proposal were clear, it was forconsideration whether it should be introduced at a time when asubstantial increase in Exchequer borrowing was necessary; andthere might be attempts in Parliament to insist that the financialstatistics should continue to be made available on the old basis as well as on the new one. On the other hand it was pointed outthat the Chancellor had foreshadowed this reform in his 1967 budget speech and that the merits of the proposal both in rationalisingthe Governmenfs borrowing arrangements and in clarifying the presentation of the Budget would provide a firm basis for resistingsuch criticism.(b) It was not clear how the proposal would affect the alternative arrangements for loans for housebuilding which Ministers had considered during the summer; while the Chancellor^ proposalappeared generally acceptable, it might be desirable that under thenew arrangements loans for housebuilding should be shownseparately from other loans. On the other hand the proposal should help to reduce competition between local authorities in the moneymarkets and would meet the purposes of the alternative arrangementsfor housebuilding loans which had previously been discussed by ministers. Moreover, some of the detailed arrangements whichwould apply within the general framework of the proposal had notyet been fully worked out and this left room for discussion whether,inter alia, loans for housebuilding could be shown separately.Discussion was also continuing on whether the new arrangements should enable the Treasury to borrow abroad for the national loans Fund.
industrial disputes(previous reference:CC (67) 41stConclusions,Minute 4)RailwaysCONFIDENTIAL5. The Minister of Labour said that the current dispute inrespect of railway guards arose from the alteration in their duties in consequence of the change from steam to electric traction and theuse of diesel engines. These technical advances had made it unnecessary to employ second men on the footplate and the guardshad in consequence taken on certain extra duties. The NationalUnion of Railwaymen (NUR) were at fault in the dispute on twocounts. Procedurally they were in breach of their agreement tomake full use of the machinery for conciliation, and ultimately,arbitration, before taking industrial action. In substance they had paidno regard, in seeking extra pay, to the need to increase productivity inorder to enable the additional cost to be met, despite their earlieragreement to the contrary. In these circumstances it was essentialthat the Government should not weaken the position of the british railways Board and, though he would continue to watch the positionclosely, this was not a situation where he could suitably interveneso that a compromise might eventually be reached between the two sides.The Home Secretary said that the official Committee on emergencies Was keeping the situation under close review. So far,however, there was no occasion for action which would justify ameeting of the Ministerial Committee, nor did such a meeting seem desirable.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour andthe Home Secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,Nth September, 1967.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the proposals in the Chancellor&apos;s memorandum should be approved and the preparation and presentation of thenecessary legislation should proceed; the legislative programme hadbeen so devised that Parliamentary time would be available for its passage before 31st March, 1968. Meanwhile the ministers concerned should consider further the points made in discussion about housing finance.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (67) 144 for the establishmentof a National Loans Fund.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss with the Lord President of the Council and theMinister of Housing and Local Government thearrangements to be made in respect of loans forhousebuilding under the new proposals.
