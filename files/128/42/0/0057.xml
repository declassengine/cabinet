CabinetDespatch ofGovernmentBusinessduring theLabour PartyConferenceCC 57 (67)confidential. The Prime Minister said that he proposed during the debates at the Labour Party Conference at Scarborough to makeappropriate references to certain Government decisions on which itwould be desirable for the departmental Ministers concerned tohold Press conferences later the same day. It was not appropriate for civil servants to be associated with Party Conferences but therewould be no objection to Ministers arranging for their information officers to be present at these Press conferences, and fordepartmental advisers to be available either at the Press conferencesor if the Minister needed them for the despatch of urgent public business provided that Ministers ensured that no civil servant wasin any way associated with the proceedings at the Party Conference.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime ministers statement.OverseaAffairsForeignSecretary&apos;visit to theUnited NationsMiddle East(previous reference :CC(67) 55thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretory said that in the course of his visit to New York he had talks with 30 Foreign Ministers. He thoughtthat his speech at the General Assembly of the United Nations in new York had been well received and had succeeded in puttingour point of view without giving offence to those who did not shareit. In particular the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senor Castiella, after hearing what he had said on Gibraltar, had decided not to react as strongly as he had previously thought of doing. The foreign secretary had also spent some time with the President of theUnited States in Washington.His talks had been dominated by the Middle East. Thegeneral view was that the Middle East question should be put tothe Security Council ,as soon as possible. The aim should be toobtain a balanced resolution which provided not only for Israeliwithdrawal from occupied Arab territory, but also for recognition by the Arab States of israels right to exist. He had discussed thisquestion with the Soviet Foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko.Although Mr. Gromyko had gone back on his previous support forsuch a resolution, there were indications that he might be preparedto accept a resolution on similar lines if the majority of Arab States,including the United Arab Republic (UAR), would acquiesce.He had also discussed with the Yugoslav Foreign MinisterPresident Tito&apos;s proposals for a Middle East settlement. In theirpresent form these proposals failed to provide the necessary balance between israels withdrawal and recognition by the Arab States ofher right to exist.  But the Yugoslav Foreign Minister, Mr. Nikezic,
had indicated that the proposals were not final and were open toany improvements. The attitude of the Arab States, with theexception of Algeria and Syria, continued for the moment to berealistic and restrained; and they no longer seemed to believe thatthey would benefit from renewed fighting or that Israel could be destroyed. The attitude of the Israeli Foreign Minister, Mr. Eban,on the other hand, had been very rigid.There were various possibilities of practical progress includingthe appointment of a United Nations Representative in the middle east to help establish contact between the two sides, some new arrangement for the refugees and possibly a move towardsreopening the Suez Canal. He had had a long talk with the ForeignMinister of the UAR, Mr. Mahmoud Riad, who had asked him tosend a representative to Cairo for talks in the near future with aview to the resumption of diplomatic relations. He proposed to doso in mid-October and hoped that this would open the way to discussion of the reopening of the Suez Canal. Meanwhile he had suggested to Mr. Riad that the UAR should open the southern endof the Canal to release ships now detained. He had also discussed the Suez Canal with Mr. Eban and had the impression that itwould be easier for Israel to withdraw from the banks of the canal and thus facilitate its reopening if the Security Council passed a balanced resolution recognising Israel&apos;s right to exist and at leastimplying her right to use the Canal even if this right were notexercised initially.In discussion attention was&apos; drawn to the importance of theearly reopening of the Suez Canal. It was also important to bring home to Israel the price which we were now paying for giving hermoral support. The closure of the Suez Canal was costing us about 200 million on the balance of payments and had deprived us of the achievement of a favourable balance this year and of the opportunityto make an earlier and more decisive start with the process ofreflation.Vietnam(previous reference:CC (67) 23rdConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary and ofthe points made in discussion.The Foreign Secretary said that his discussions on Vietnamin New York had been discouraging. The attitude of the soviet foreign Minister, Mr. Gromyko, had been totally inflexible; andthere seemed to be little chance that between now and the celebration in November of the 50th Anniversary of the OctoberRevolution the Soviet Government would risk any initiative whichmight incur criticism in Communist countries. The United states attitude was not much more hopeful. There did not appear to bemuch room for manoeuvre on either side at present.In discussion it was pointed out that there was a strong feeling in this country that the war in North Vietnam was an unjust warand a consequent demand that the Government should clarify theirattitude towards it.   Besides the moral issue there was also the
falkland islands(previous reference:CC (66) 48thConclusions,Minute 1)Gibraltar(previous reference :CC (67) 56thConclusions,Minute 1)The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a long and franktalk with the Spanish Foreign Minister, Senof Castiella, in the courseof which he had made plain that there could be no question of ourgiving up sovereignty, and that on this basis we would be willingto resume talks with Spain.CC 57 (67)political question of our international standing in the world,especially among the developing countries of Asia where we were in danger of being regarded as supporting American intervention in vietnam. It was generally known that we were unsympathetictowards the continued bombing of North Vietnam and would welcome its suspension.  We should therefore say so publicly.On the other hand it was argued that the United States werenot responsible for the war in the first instance. North Vietnamhad broken the Geneva Agreement and the United States had theright to afford South Vietnam the assistance for which they hadbeen asked. Repeated United States offers of negotiations hadbeen rejected by the North Vietnamese; and the Soviet Unioncontinued to be their major supplier of arms. If the United states were now to break faith with South Vietnam the confidence of herother allies, not only in Asia but in Europe and the rest of the world,would be gravely shaken.The attitude of the Government had been clearly andrepeatedly stated, in particular by the Foreign Secretary at theLabour Party Conference at Brighton in October 1966. TheGovernment did not support the war. They deplored its escalation.They condemned the continued bombing of North Vietnam. Butthey also condemned terrorist activities in South Vietnam. It was essential to keep this balance if we were to retain our power to influence events. Our attitude was understood by the UnitedStates and put us in a position to exercise our influence in favourof a settlement at the appropriate time. We had already taken anumber of initiatives in this sense, in particular in February 1967at the time of the visit to London of Mr. Kosygin, the Soviet PrimeMinister. The United States attitude had changed considerablyover the last two years: the fact that they had shown willingness tonegotiate was largely due to our influence. It was important toretain our influence to help in bringing the war to an end. A public declaration of policy might impair it.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate a paper onVietnam for consideration at a later meeting.The Foreign Secretary said he had discussed the falkland islands with the Argentine Minister for Foreign Affairs,Senor Costa Mendez, and they had made good progress.
EuropeanEconomicCommunity(previous reference :CC (67) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)UnitedStates ofAmerica(previous reference :CC (67) 55thConclusions,Minute 1)Anti-ballisticMissilesHe had also had an interesting talk with the French ForeignMinister, M. Couve de Murville, who had been unusually friendly.In reply to direct questions he had appeared to accept that we were bound to join the European Economic Community, and to agreethat negotiations might begin by the end of the year.We had protested as strongly as possible to the United StatesGovernment against their failure to consult us or their other alliesbefore announcing their decision to deploy a limited number of anti-ballistic missiles to guard against a possible attack by theChinese Peopled Republic. He had made an immediate public statement, had written to the United States Secretary of State,Mr. Dean Rusk, and had seen the United States Ambassador. Hehad also left the President of the United States and Mr. Rusk in nodoubt about our attitude to the United States decision during his recent discussions with them. It was clear from these discussions that the United States decision was not necessarily irreversible.The United States Secretary of Defense, Mr. McNamara, was now discussing the question with his North Atlantic treaty organisation colleagues at their meeting in Ankara.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary.ParliamentParliamentaryProcedure(previous reference:CC (67) 19thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (67) 152) on House of Commonsprocedure.The Lord President said that he sought the agreement of theCabinet to a number of proposals for reforming the procedure ofthe House of Commons. These had been recommended by the ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure after a reviewof the outstanding proposals of the Select Committee on procedure and of the experience of the experiments with morning sittings and specialist Committees. The two major proposals, which were also likely to be controversial, were those affecting the Finance Bill andmorning sittings. It was proposed that the Committee stage of theFinance Bill should be sent to a Grand Committee of 80 members and that this proposal should be adopted in the coming Session.While an extended Report stage would be required, the change would save six or seven days on the floor of the House. the timetable for the Finance Bill would be safeguarded by theapplication of the further proposal for the extension to Committeeand Report stages of Bills generally of voluntary timetabling, whichcould be backed by a resolution if the agreement broke down.The intention to send the Committee stage of the Finance Billupstairs should be announced along with the other proposedprocedural changes in the forthcoming debate on procedure.Although the experimental morning sittings had disposed of a
substantial amount of secondary business, they had not reducedlate night sittings. It was therefore proposed as an alternative toenable the Government to move, without notice or debate, the suspension of a late sitting until the following morning. The useof this device might, in practice, be largely confined to the latter part of any session. In order to make the arrangement effective, itwould be desirable also to limit to \\ hours debates on affirmative resolutions taken after 10 p.m. This would be a logical extension to affirmative resolution of the limit applied to negative resolutionsduring the Conservative Administration;, any Order of major importance could still be started before 10 p.m. These proposals would together make Government business substantially morepredictable and would reduce the number of late night sittings.He also sought agreement that where a Bill had been referredto the Second Reading Committee or the Scottish Grand committee it should be possible to remit the Report stage to that Committee;that Third Readings should normally be formal; and that theprocedure for putting amendments should be simplified. It was proposed that the Select Committee on Statutory Instruments shouldbe enabled to consider all statutory instruments and that theyshould be empowered to report on drafting defects as well as ondefects of vires. Further, it was proposed to implement the main recommendations of the Select Committee on Procedure in relationto urgent debates under Standing Order No. 9. The Speaker wouldhave discretion to allow a matter raised under the Standing Orderto be debated on the day after it was raised, and would be specifically exempted from any obligation to give reasons for allowing or refusing such a debate. While the change would belikely to confer benefit on the Opposition in moving what were, ineffect, censure motions, the Government would benefit also fromthe longer time available to prepare for the debate and to adjust their business. The Opposition would, in addition, be allowed to select up to four half-days from the 29 supply days for urgentdebates. It was proposed that the power to accept a closure motion should, for Report stages only, be extended to the Deputy Speaker.On Select Committees, he proposed that the Select Committeeon Procedure should be reappointed to make an urgent report onthe use of Private Members&apos; time, to be followed by a report on theannual Parliamentary timetable. Meanwhile, six of the 12 daysnormally allocated to Private Members&apos; motions should be givento Private Members&apos; Bills. The Select Committees on Science and technology and on Agriculture should also be reappointed for afurther Session. Failure to reappoint the Committee on agriculture would be misinterpreted in the light of their recent reports andthey should be given an opportunity to make the departmentalstudy for which they had been appointed. Further select committees should be appointed to deal respectively with thoseactivities of the Department of Education and Science and theScottish Education Department which were not already covered bythe Select Committee on Science and with foreign affairs. A Select
Committee might also be required in connection with the industrial expansion Bill, and a separate Committee should be established as required to consider the desirability of legislation in particular fields;a suitable subject for such an enquiry would be the question whether there should be a statutory restraint on the invasion of the privacyof the citizen.The Ministerial Committee had also recommended that theClerks to the House of Commons should be relieved by resolution of the House of their obligation to wear wigs and gowns except onceremonial occasions; he proposed to pursue discussions with the speaker on this recommendation.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposalsfor changing the procedure of the House of Commons and thefollowing principal points were made:(a) Finance Bill. It was suggested that a decision might be deferred on whether the Finance Bill in the coming Session should necessarily be referred to the proposed Grand Committee, but therewas general agreement that the balance of advantage lay in introducing the change in time for the next year&apos;s Finance Bill. Itwas essential that the proposed arrangements for timetabling theCommittee and Report stages of Bills should apply to the finance bill and it was to be understood that the Grand Committee wouldnot sit in the morning, although formally this would be a matter for the Committee itself.(b) Timetabling of Committee and Report stages. The proposedprocedure should be tried experimentally on a major Bill.Consideration should be given to selecting the Transport Bill, butthis as a controversial measure might not be suitable. It was agreedthat further consideration should be given to this problem.(c) Report stage of Second Reading Committee Bills. It wassuggested, with particular reference to Scottish Grand CommitteeBills, that the power to rectify on? the floor of the Houseamendments which had been carried in committee should be adequately safeguarded. The adequacy of the safeguards in relationto Scottish Bills should be further considered by the Lord President,in consultation with the Secretary of State for Scotland.(d) Third Readings. The proposal to take Third Readingswithout debate, unless an amendment had been tabled over the names of six members, would be more acceptable if Finance Billswere excepted, since the Third Reading of such Bills could provide an opportunity for general debate on economic affairs. moreover the Third Reading of Bills founded on Ways and Means Resolutionscould not, under existing Standing Orders, be taken on the same dayas Report stage. It was. agreed that the proposal to take third reading without debate should not apply to Finance Bills.(e) Statutory Instruments. If the Select Committee on statutory instruments were empowered to report on drafting defects, statutory instruments urgently required might be delayed. It was agreed thatthe Committee should not be so empowered.
CONFIDENTIAL   \ :  $ .&apos;&apos;CC 57 (67)(/) Standing Order No. 9. Although the Speaker would haveregard to the views expressed by the Select Committee on Procedureon the exercise of his discretion in granting debates under theStanding Order, he would be unduly exposed to pressure to concededebates if, as proposed, he were freed from past precedent andalso exempted from giving reasons for refusing debates. While the speaker should be freed from past precedent he should continueto be required to give his reasons for refusing debates; at least it,i ould be left open to him to do so. It was agreed that the lord president should ascertain the views of the Speaker on thissuggestion and report them to the Prime Minister.(g) House Officers&apos; dress. It was agreed that it would bedesirable to relieve the Clerks of the House of the obligation to wearwigs and gowns except on ceremonial occasions, such as theOpening of Parliament. The Lord President should discuss thisproposal further with the Speaker. Corresponding changes in theHouse of Lords should be considered by the Lord Chancellor andthe Lord Privy Seal.(h) Select Committee on Procedure. It was agreed that theLord Chancellor and the Lord Privy Seal should consider inconsultation with the Lord President the implications for the Houseof Lords of the proposal to reappoint the Select Committee on procedure to review the use of Private Members&apos; time in theHouse of Commons.(i) Hours of sittings. In presenting the proposal for suspension of sittings after 10 p.m. until the following morning, it would be important not to concede that the establishment of regular morningsittings had been abandoned as a long-term objective. It waspointed out, however, that even in the long term, if the use of committees were expanded, and if late night sittings were largelyeliminated, it might well be found convenient to leave morningsfree for committee work and to continue to take business on the floor of the House in the afternoons and evenings.(/&apos;) Select Committee on Agriculture. It was agreed that in thecircumstances the Select Committee on Agriculture should bereappointed, but it should be made clear that this was for onlyone year to enable it to discharge the task for which it had been created. It had already been explained to the Chairmen of committees that Departments could not enter into discussion withthem on matters which were currently the subject of sensitivenegotiation so that the farm price review would not be open to investigation until after it had been completed. Agriculture inScotland should continue to be excluded from the Committee&apos;sfield of study. Early consideration should be given to the form ofthe reply to the Select Committee&apos;s recent report.(k) Select Committee on Foreign Affairs. It would be undesirable to appoint a Select Committee on Foreign Affairs witha wide remit but there were both practical and presentationaldifficulties in establishing a limited field Within which it could
operate. It was therefore agreed that a Select Committee OnForeign Affairs should not be appointed in the coming Session.(/) Select Committee on Science and Technology. ThisCommittee had expressed the wish to investigate research for defence purposes. It was, however, clearly established that select committees should not have access to information affecting national security. The matter should be discussed by the Secretary of Statefor Defence with the Chairman of the Committee.(m) Select Committee on Productivity. It was suggested thata Committee on productivity should be established. In view of theexistence of the Select Committee on the Nationalised Industries,such a Committee could in practice be expected to concentrate on private industry, and could be used in connection with the industrial expansion Bill. It was pointed out, however, that the establishmentof a Committee with wide terms of reference might disturb workingrelations with the Economic Development Councils and with private industry. It might be preferable to limit the terms of reference toGovernment action in relation to productivity. A decision on thisproposal would, however, fall to be taken in the context of the cabinet&apos;s discussion of the proposed White Paper on the industrial expansion Bill.(n) Pre-legislation Committee. It was agreed that it might be appropriate for proposals for legislation which were not the subjectof party controversy but raised important social issues to bereferred on the initiative of the Government to a pre-legislation committee. Care should be taken to avoid any implication that a pre- -legislation Committee could appropriately consider proposalsfor legislation outside this restricted field.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion^ said that theCabinet approved the proposals for changes in House of Commonsprocedure set out in C (67) 152, subject to the points agreed in thecourse of discussion. The Lord President should settle the detailsof the proposals in relation to the Finance Bill in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer. The Lord President should alsoarrange for the Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary procedure to review the present arrangements for replying to the requests ofSelect Committees, which involved considerable delay before theGovernment^ answer to a Committee&apos;s criticism was made public.The Ministerial Committee should also consider urgently inconsultation with the Ministers primarily concerned the reply to therecent report of the Select Committee on Agriculture. Theopportunity should be taken to secure the publication of the ministerial correspondence establishing agreement that the SelectCommittee would not investigate matters which were the subject ofsensitive negotiations.The Cabinet (1) Approved C (67) 152, subject to the points agreed in discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President to discuss further with the speaker of the House of Commons the points made at(/) and (g) of their discussion.

IndustrialPolicyIndustrialExpansionBill(previous reference :CC (67) 52ndConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Technology (C (67) 153) to which was attached a draft white paper, revised in the light of discussion by the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy, setting out proposals for an industrial Expansion Bill.The Prime Minister said that his colleagues would wish toknow the attitude of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)towards the Governmenfs proposals as this had emerged from his recent discussions with their representatives. The Grand Councilof the CBI had unfortunately chosen to take a doctrinaire line in opposition to the Governmenfs proposals and had instructed theofficers of the Confederation that they were not to discuss with theGovernment any possible safeguards or improvements; they were authorised only to seek clarification of the Governmenfs objectives and to propose alternative ways of achieving them. He had seenrepresentatives of the CBI the previous evening, when they had emphasised the strength of feeling amongst their members, claiming that even the more moderate elements were completely opposed tothe Governmenfs plans. Two main grounds for objection had beenput forward. First, the CBI representatives had argued that parliamentary scrutiny of projects promoted under the industrial expansion Bill would be too perfunctory: projects should beauthorised by the full legislative procedure. In reply to this he had emphasised the need for speed in dealing with situations whichcould not be foreseen, and had instanced the Governmenfs recentactions in arranging assistance to the Cunard Company. Second,the CBI representatives had objected on ideological grounds to theGovernment taking powers to purchase equity shares by agreementwith the firms concerned; it had emerged in discussion that this,rather than fear of inadequate Parliamentary control, was theCBFs fundamental objection to the proposals.  The representativesCC 57 (67)(3) Invited the Lord President to discuss with the Chancellorof the Exchequer the details of the proposals affectingthe Finance Bill and with the other Ministers concerned the points made at (c) and (h) of their discussion.(4) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure in the light ofthe Prime Ministers summing up:(i) to give early consideration, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Agriculture,to the reply to be sent to the Select Committeeon Agriculture on their recent report;(ii) to review the arrangements for replying to reportsof Select Committees and the Public accounts committee.
of the CBI had maintained that for the Government to proceed withthe Bill would damage both industrial confidence and the relationsbetween the Government and industry. They had conceded underpressure that it was unlikely that employers would in practice allowtheir investment plans, especially those involving government assistance, to be influenced by the enactment of the Bill and, while they still maintained that some deterioration in relations with the cbi was inevitable, this would only be temporary. The CBIrepresentatives had, however, eventually accepted that they couldnot refuse indefinitely to discuss the provisions of the Bill andwould at some point need to seek a fresh mandate from their members in order to do so. The position of the CBI wouldprobably be that, while they would initially maintain their opposition in principle, once it was clear that Parliament wouldenact the Bill they would subsequently co-operate with theGovernment in seeking ways of improving it. The CBIrepresentatives had accepted that the Government could not toleratea veto on their actions and must now make their own decisions inthe matter.He proposed to refer to the Governmenfs proposals in his speech to the Labour Party Conference in the following week, andit would be desirable, immediately following his speech, for theMinister of Technology to arrange for fuller briefing of theindustrial correspondents of the Press on lobby terms. The cabinet might wish to consider whether it would be wise to publish a white paper at all; to do so might simply give more scope to the government&apos;s critics, and it might be sufficient if a full explanatory memorandum were published with the Bill. If, however, theCabinet thought that a White Paper was desirable, it would benecessary to consider the timing of publication: one possibility would be for the Bill to be mentioned in The Queen&apos;s Speech atthe Opening of the new Parliamentary Session, for him to describe the Governmenfs plans in his speech during the Debate on the address, and for a White Paper and the Bill to be published shortlythereafter.In discussion, there was general agreement that theGovernment should not be deterred from proceeding with the Billby the opposition of the CBI. The lack of powers such as the bill would confer had already caused difficulties with a number of projects where Ministers had been obliged to take the risks of proceeding in advance of securing Parliamentary authority. It wasnecessary to be able to take action swiftly on proposals forGovernment assistance initiated by industry itself, and this wouldbe impracticable if separate legislation had to be introduced in eachcase.In further discussion it was the general view that theGovernment should publish a White Paper setting out their proposals. There was considerable genuine misapprehension aboutthe Governmenfs intentions, and a White Paper would be the best means of dispelling it. As regards timing, there was some support for the view that publication soon after the Governmenfs proposals
had been considered by the National Economic development council (NEDC) at its meeting on 9th October would be desirable,lest the Governmenfs case should go by default. On the otherhand it was recognised that other considerations might point todeferring publication until after The Queen&apos;s Speech. It would bedesirable to defer a decision on this matter until the reactions ofthe NEDC could be assessed.In discussion of the draft White Paper the following points were made:(a) The main fear of the CBI in relation to acquisition by theGovernment of equity holdings was that such holdings would beused to influence the policy and position of the firms concerned.Consideration should be given to the desirability of stating in theWhite Paper that the Government proposed to limit itself to participation in the profits of enterprises in which it held shares,and would not seek to influence the policy of the managementsconcerned: this would mean that the Government would follow the practice commonly adopted by insurance companies in relationto firms in which they held shares.(b) Consideration should be given to the desirability of settingup an advisory council, with representation from industry, to advise the Government on the exercise of the powers in the Bill. If this were accepted, an appropriate reference should be included in theWhite Paper.(c) It might be possible to find better examples than those given in paragraph 4 of the draft of projects in which the industrial reorganisation Corporation (1958-59) and the National Research andDevelopment Corporation had participated. In particular, the reference to the Hovercraft would not be popular with some interestsand might be omitted.(d) The drafting of the second sentence in paragraph 5 shouldbe improved.(e) The reference in lines 11-12 of paragraph 7 to sustaininginvestment &quot; in key sectors&quot; should be qualified. In a number of key sectors, for example chemicals, it was not practicable to take such action and the drafting should reflect this.(/) It would be preferable in the last two sentences of paragraph 7to refer to the delays involved in seeking legislation rather than tothe difficulty of legislating.(g) Paragraph 8 listed a number of types of project where action by the 1958-59 would not be suitable. It should be made clear that theGovernment would nevertheless often want to seek the advice ofthe 1958-59 in cases of this kind.(h) In line 6 on page 5, after the words &quot; social policy &quot; thereshould be inserted the words &quot; particularly regional policy &quot;.(/) A number of references to Parliamentary procedure were tooimprecise. In the last sentence of paragraph 9, there should besubstituted for the phrase &quot; Parliamentary authority &quot; the words
&quot; specific legislation &quot; or some similar phrase. The reference at thebeginning of paragraph 11 to &quot;a faster and more flexibleParliamentary procedure &quot; should be amplified to make clear thatthe essential point was to obviate the need for a series of separateBills, and to distinguish the two concepts of &quot; timing &quot; and &quot; control&quot;which were run together in the draft; and the effectiveness of theform of Parliamentary control proposed should be fully brought out. The reference in line 8 of paragraph 15 to opportunity for parliamentary debate should be amended to state specifically theprocedure envisaged.(/&apos;) Paragraph 10 of the draft should be reconsidered. Thepassage on page 6 gave an unfortunate impression that theGovernment would be prepared to assist firms or projectsirrespective of their commercial viability. This was inconsistent with what was said in paragraph 16 about the intention to subjectprojects under the Bill to stringent examination.(k) Further thought should be given to the financial proceduresreferred to in paragraph 13.(/) Paragraph 16, which stressed the importance of a successfulprivate sector in industry, should come earlier in the draft, possiblyafter paragraph 1. This paragraph was important from the point ofview of the impact of the proposals on industry, and the wordingshould be further examined to see if it could be strengthened.(m) In line 3 on page 9, the words &quot; partnership in &quot; shouldbe inserted before &quot; launching &quot;.(n) All the references in the draft to the proposal for a SelectCommittee to examine projects promoted under the Bill should beregarded as provisional, pending further consideration of a SelectCommittee on Productivity.(o) Much of the misgiving felt by the CBI was due to theirfear that equity participation by the Government in particular firmsmight in a number of ways give those firms an unfair advantage over their competitors though in fact the same difficulty aroseequally in respect of existing forms of Government assistance not involving equity participation. Given that selective intervention was the Governments settled policy, it might not be possible to say anything in the White Paper to allay the fears of the CBI on thispoint, but the Government would have to be prepared to deal withthis criticism in defending the Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that a White Paper should be published setting outthe Government^ proposals for the Industrial Expansion Bill, andthat the timing of publication should be further considered in thelight of the reactions of the NEDC at its meeting on 9th October.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, in consultation withthe Lord President, the President of the Board of Trade, the Ministerof Technology and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should nowarrange for the draft White Paper to be revised in the light of thediscussion and recirculated to the Cabinet as soon as possible. Theneed for a flexible procedure would best be met if he, in consultation
with the Ministers concerned with the revision of the draft, were authorised to arrange publication of the White Paper, if political considerations made this desirable, shortly after the NEDC meetingon 9th October; otherwise the Cabinet would decide on the timing of publication as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toarrange in consultation with the other ministers concerned for a revised draft of the White Paper annexed to C (67) 152 to be circulated to the Cabinet.(2) Agreed that the timing of publication of the White paper should be determined as proposed by the Prime minister in his summing-up.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,28th September, 1967.
