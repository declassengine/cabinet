ParliamentCompositionand Powers ofthe House ofLords(previous reference:CC (67) 54thConclusions,Minute 5)SECRET*1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the LordChancellor (C (67) 157) to which was annexed a report on the composition and powers of the House of Lords by the ministerial committee on the House of Lords.The Lord Chancellor recalled that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had agreed that the Ministerial Committee on the Houseof Lords should consider proposals for changing the composition and functions of the Lords, without prejudice to a subsequent decision by the Cabinet on whether such changes should be made. the ministerial Committee had reached agreement on the need for legislation in the coming session. The Government were committed by their election manifesto to the reform and modernisation ofParliament and specifically to deal with the power of the House ofLords to delay legislation which, the Cabinet were now agreed, couldnot be dealt with in isolation from the composition of that House.It was probable that, if the Government failed to take the initiative in the coming session, proposals would be put forward by one orother of the Opposition parties, and there would be practical andpresentational advantages in taking the lead. Further, if theGovernment were to be sure of enacting legislation in time to remove the potential risk of their legislative programme being obstructed bythe House of Lords in the final session of the Parliament, it was essential that this legislation should be introduced in the coming session.The Ministerial Committee were also agreed on the general objectives of reform. They proposed that the hereditary basis of theHouse of Lords should be eliminated, thereby removing the in-builtConservative majority, and that the Government of the day shouldbe able to secure a reasonable working majority over both opposition parties. Since, however, there could be no absolute assurance of aGovernment majority in all circumstances, the Committee also proposed that the power of the Lords to delay legislation should be restricted and that their power to withhold consent to subordinate legislation against the will of the Commons should be abolished.The Committee proposed that within the framework of a modernParliamentary system a reformed Second Chamber should play apart complementary, but subordinate, to that of the House ofCommons; and that both the functions and the services of the two houses should be more closely integrated.The Committee considered that these major constitutional changes ought to be the subject of consultation with the Opposition.If agreement could be reached, it would not be necessary to force the legislation through under the Parliament Acts and the danger ofdisrupting the Governmenfs legislative programme would be avoided. But it would be necessary to make clear in The Queen&apos;sSpeech that the Government intended to introduce legislation to-------------:---* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET  :!^MW&amp;:^:::
eliminate the hereditary basis of the House of Lords and to reduceits powers.In respect of the composition of the reformed House, the ministerial Committee considered that, in order to reach agreementwith the Opposition while preserving the essential objectives of reform, the Government should be prepared to accept a two-writsystem whereby existing peers by succession could continue to speakin the House of Lords, though they would cease to have any right to vote by virtue of their hereditary peerages. Voting writs would be confined to peers of first creation who undertook to attend the Houseregularly and play a full part in its work. Those who could not accept these obligations should be given speaking writs. Since thenumber of Conservative peers of first creation who attended regularlywas insufficient to constitute an effective Opposition, it would benecessary once for all to give a number of Conservative hereditary peers life peerages, by virtue of which they could continue to be members of the House with voting rights. It would, however, be essential to avoid any concession to the hereditary principle such as,for example, giving peers by succession a right to elect voting members from their number. If negotiations broke down the Governmentwould be free to proceed with their own legislation, possibly on more radical lines.The Lord President said that the principal objective of reformshould be to ensure the more efficient working of Parliament as awhole. It could not be assumed that the present situation, which onthe whole had operated favourably to the Government, would continue, or that the issue of reform could be avoided. Since theConservative leaders were prepared to abandon the hereditaryprinciple, it should be possible to achieve reform by agreement onthe lines of the proposed two-writ scheme. The Government were committed to reform and modernisation of Parliament, and this could not be complete or wholly effective unless it extended to the lords. Further, these proposals, by enabling peers to be givenspeaking rights only, afforded a means of reconciling the need for a house in which the Government were normally assured of a votingmajority with the desire to preserve the character of the House asa debating Chamber and to permit the continued participation ofcross-benchers.In discussion it was suggested that it would be inopportune to legislate at the present time since the Government would be criticised for diverting attention in the country and in Parliament to this issueat a time when there were other more pressing matters to be dealtwith, especially in the economic field. The issue was one on whichthere would be a wide difference of view among government supporters, and it was suggested that the risks inherent in the ministerial Committee&apos;s proposals should be further consideredbefore the proposals were accepted. In particular it was suggestedthat, if the House of Lords were established on a more rational andreputable basis and with enlarged functions, its authority would be enhanced while the Government would still have insufficient control
over it. The balance of voting power would lie with the cross-benchers and there were no sanctions which could be brought to bearon Government supporters comparable with those which could beapplied in the Commons whose members had to stand for re-election.If he attended regularly a peer, once nominated, could continue to enjoy his voting writ for many years, even if he ceased to support his party. Consequently, the Governmenfs majority might tend todisappear during the course of a Parliament, and they could not inany event count on a majority on critical issues. Further, theproposals might confer undue patronage on the party leaders, andthe additional creations that would be necessary on a change ofGovernment to give the incoming Government a majority wouldunduly enlarge the size of the voting House. It was uncertain how many peers of first creation would be able to undertake theobligations attendant on voting writs, and an estimate should therefore be made of the number of new creations of conservative and Labour peers which would be required on the setting up of thenew House and on a subsequent change of Government. It was further suggested that if it were left to the Conservatives to take theinitiative, they might feel obliged to put forward more radicalproposals which would make less concession to the hereditaryprinciple.On the other hand, it was pointed out that unless the legislation were introduced in the coming session, it would not be possible toensure that the Lords were deprived in the present Parliament oftheir power to frustrate the Governmenfs programme in the finalsession and to reject statutory instruments. It might be dangerouswith regard to the economic situation, to leave the Lords with their powers over subordinate legislation, since it might be necessary tobring statutory instruments into operation quickly. There was considerable public support for institutional reform generally, andthe Government would be open to criticism if they exempted theHouse of Lords, since its present composition was indefensible. Itcould be demonstrated that in the coming session Parliament woulddevote a very substantial amount of time to economic legislation anddebate compared with the time that would be needed for legislation to reform the House of Lords.In relation to the proposed two-writ scheme, it was also suggested that since the age of nominated peers would necessarily be high, the wastage through death and retirement was likely to obviate the risk of a progressive increase in the membership of theHouse. There was no reason to suppose that the loyalty ofGovernment supporters in the Lords would be less than at present,and discipline might be stronger because of the obligations attachedto acceptance of a voting writ. Voting writs would be issued for the duration of a Parliament, and the right of nomination would rest with the Prime Minister. The real powers of the Lords would be restricted and their enlarged functions as a scrutinising and revisingChamber would be exercised in a subordinate capacity only, subjectto the clear overriding authority of the Commons.
In further discussion the following principal points were made:(a) Peers by succession who, as an initial measure, were givenvoting rights, would receive those rights solely by virtue of a lifepeerage. They would not be required to renounce their hereditarypeerage, which would cease to confer any voting rights whatever.Further consideration would, however, have to be given to the rightof peers by succession, who were excluded from the House of Lords,to vote in Parliamentary elections and stand for election to theHouse of Commons.(b) While existing peers by succession who could continue to speak in the House would disappear with time, it was envisaged that provision for nominated peers who could speak but not vote wouldbe a permanent feature of the House. It was suggested, however,that this should be further considered, since it appeared to conflict with the concept of the reformed House of Lords as primarily a working House.(c) Relatively few cross-benchers were likely to attend oftenenough to enable them to qualify for voting writs, since only 12 atpresent attended more than one-third of the sittings. Neverthelessfurther consideration should be given to the position of cross-benchers, particularly the bishops and the law lords, and theirnomination for voting writs.(d) It should also be considered further whether nomination asa peer entitled to a voting writ should be for life or for some shorter period; and whether there should be means of withdrawing a votingwrit, and, if so, in what circumstances.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet accepted in principle the proposals of the ministerial Committee on the House of Lords, subject to furtherconsideration by the Ministerial Committee of the points made at(a), (b), (c) and (d) in the discussion and to further study of the numberof peers who might have to be created from Conservative andLabour Party supporters at the outset and on a change ofGovernment. The Cabinet agreed that a passage should be includedin The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament in the terms proposed by the Ministerial Committee. The Lord President should arrange for information to be made available, for use if necessaryduring the debate on The Queen&apos;s Speech, about the time likely tobe devoted in the coming session to economic legislation and debatecompared with the time likely to be occupied by legislation on the reform of the House of Lords. In consultation with the LordChancellor, the Lord President, and the Lord Privy Seal, he would himself consider the arrangements for conducting the negotiationswith the Opposition parties.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the ministerial committee on the House of Lords to consider further thepoints made at (a), (b), (c) and (d) in their discussion andthe number of peers who would have to be created on the
SECRET&quot;   ? 397CC 59 (67)establishment of the new House of Lords and on a changeof Government.(2) Subject to Conclusion (1) approved in principle the proposals in C (67) 157.(3) Invited the Lord President to report to the Prime minister on the number of days likely to be devoted by parliament in the coming session to debate on economic affairscompared with the time occupied by legislation to reform the House of Lords.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theLord Chancellor, the Lord President and the Lord privy seal would make arrangements for the conduct of thenegotiations with the Opposition parties on the reform ofthe House of Lords.IndustrialPolicyIndustrialExpansion bill draft white paper(previous reference:CC (67) 57thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 158) to which was annexed adraft White Paper on the Industrial Expansion Bill.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said that the white paper had been redrafted in the light of the Cabinets previous discussion. The Governments proposals for the industrial expansion Bill had been discussed earlier that week by the national economic Development Council (NEDC), and the representatives ofthe Confederation of British Industry had reacted more equably than might have been expected from their previous attitude. A numberof important points affecting the proposals remain to be settled. Itwas necessary to decide whether an Order subject to affirmative resolution should be required for every project promoted under theBill which involved equity participation by the Government; whethera new Select Committee should be set up in connection with the bill and if so what form it should take and what its terms of reference should be; and what consultative machinery should be established to evaluate projects under the Bill, and in particular to ensure fairconditions of competition. It was also desirable to clarify further the relation between the functions of the Industrial reorganisation corporation (1958-59) and Government initiatives under the Bill; hewould be discussing this with the Chairman of the 1958-59. It was not essential to reach precise decisions on all these points before theWhite Paper was published but it was probably desirable to delaypublication for a little time to enable further work to be done on them.The Cabinet first considered the timing of publication of theWhite Paper. It was argued that the critics of the governments proposals had been allowed to hold the field for too long; there was much genuine misapprehension about the Governments intentions and the sooner a definitive statement was issued, the better. On theother hand it was argued that the presentation of the Governments
case would be improved if study of the important issues stillunresolved were first carried further; this pointed to publicationshortly after The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament, withsimultaneous publication of the Bill itself if that proved practicable.Meanwhile, however, it would be useful if articles were published inone or more responsible newspapers giving an objective account ofthe Governmenfs proposals, and were designed in particular toremove the fear that these proposals were a form of &quot; backdoornationalisation&quot; and to emphasise the Governmenfs firm intention that projects under the Bill would be undertaken only in partnership with industry. It would further be useful if the articles could draw attention to the fact that industry had originally opposedestablishment of the 1958-59 just as strongly as they were now opposing the Industrial Expansion Bill, but the 1958-59 was now generally accepted as performing a valuable role. While the articles might include some reference to the importance attached by theGovernment to Parliamentary scrutiny of projects promoted underthe Bill, no specific information should be conveyed to the Pressabout the Governmenfs intentions as regards the matters referredto in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the draft White Paper, namelyParliamentary procedure and the establishment of a SelectCommittee,In general discussion the following points were made:(a) The proposals at present did not incorporate any financiallimit on the action which the Government could take under the Bill.There were difficulties in devising a financial limit, notably becausesuch a limit would have to be set very high if it had to accommodatecurrent projects in the aircraft industry, and this might increaseapprehensions about the Governmenfs intentions rather than allaythem. It was, however, the general view that some form of financiallimit was essential if the Bill was to be acceptable to Parliament.Consideration should be given to excluding the aircraft projects fromthe Bill entirely and dealing with them in separate legislation; thiswould also avoid the difficulty that if they were to be covered by theBill, the Government would be pressed during its passage to announce policy decisions affecting the aircraft industry which theywere not yet ready to make. If, however, the complete exclusion ofthe aircraft projects raised too many difficulties, an alternative mightbe to incorporate in the Bill a financial limit which did not apply tothe aircraft projects; the latter could be subject to a separate limit.As regards the financial limit for expenditure apart from the aircraft projects, one possibility would be to fix a limit initially which couldsubsequently be increased by Order.(b) Further consideration should be given to the proposal madeat the meeting of the NEDC that where the Government wished toparticipate in a project by means of an equity holding, it should doso by taking a holding in a subsidiary company established speciallyto carry out the particular project in question, rather than by taking a holding in the participating company or companies. There were some difficulties about this proposal and it might not always be easy to separate a particular project from the other operations of the
firms concerned. On the other hand to proceed in this way might give the Government more effective control than the alternative proposal for purchase of non-voting shares in participating firms.The Government needed to have power exceptionally to intervene in the management of a participating firm, e.g., in the event of a major crisis in the firm&apos;s affairs, though normally the Governmentwould rely on informal talks with management and not on formalintervention as a shareholder; if the Government proceeded on theselines it would broadly be following the practice of insurance companies which held shares in firms. For the purposes of theWhite Paper, however, it would be preferable for the government not to be committed to any particular formula for equity participationsince this was a matter which should be further discussed with industry.In discussion of the text of the draft White Paper the followingpoints were made:(c) The beginning of the third sentence in paragraph 1 shouldbe amended to read &quot; A vigorous and successful private sector withina competitive economy is essential if a satisfactory rate of economic growth . . .&quot;(d) It was important that firms should continue to rely on existing financial institutions, rather than on Government finance:this point was made in paragraph 2 but in view of its importance itmight be given more emphasis.(e) Paragraph 9 should be reconsidered after consultations withthe 1958-59. In the penultimate line the words &quot;expected to&quot; shouldbe deleted.(/) In the second line of paragraph 11, the words &quot; with industry &quot;should be inserted after the words &quot; worked out &quot;.(g) At the end of paragraph 11, the words &quot; there should be nodoubt about the Governmenfs ability &quot; should be deleted and thereshould be substituted the words &quot; the Government must be able &quot;.(h) The substance of paragraphs 13 and 14 dealing with parliamentary procedure would need further consideration. It wassuggested that, since some projects involving equity participation bythe Government might be relatively trivial, there should not be a requirement to seek an Order in every such case; there was, however,wide support for the view that it would not prove unduly onerousto require an Order in every case and that this would be desirablehaving regard to the sensitivity of industry on this matter. It wasagreed that paragraphs 13 and 14 should come later in the draft, tofollow paragraph 17.(/) The last sentence of paragraph 15 should be amplified tomake it clear that the Government did not intend to acquire sharesfreely in the market, but would purchase holdings only in agreementwith the management of the firms concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that the White Paper should be published shortly after The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament. Meanwhile,
the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, in consultation with theLord President and the Minister of Technology, should arrange forthe Press to be briefed on the lines proposed in discussion. TheSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Board of Tradeand the Minister of Technology, should now consider further the outstanding policy questions, in particular the best means ofincorporating a financial limit or limits in the Bill, which was a majorParliamentary issue, and the questions which had been raised in discussion affecting the projects in the aircraft industry. TheSecretary of State for Economic Affairs should bring into consultation the Lord President and the Chief Whip on the issues ofParliamentary procedure and a possible Select Committee whichwere dealt with in paragraphs 13 and 14 of the draft White Paper.He should arrange for the draft White Paper to be revised in the lightof further consideration of these issues and should be free to makeany presentational or drafting changes which seemed desirable. the revised draft should be considered by the Cabinet in time to allowpublication shortly after The Queen&apos;s Speech.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the White Paper on the Industrial ExpansionBill should be published shortly after The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs,(i) in consultation with the Lord President and theMinister of Technology, to arrange for the press to be briefed as indicated in the Prime Minister^summing up;(ii) in consultation with the Ministers concerned, toconsider further the outstanding policy issues; and(iii) to circulate a revised draft of the White Paper forconsideration by the Cabinet.CONFIDENTIALLegislation 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the LordDivorce Law    Chancellor (C (67) 154) on the reform of the divorce law.reform the Lord Chancellor said that there was widespread agreement that the existing law on divorce was unsatisfactory. It had been strongly criticised in recent reports by the Group appointed by the archbishop of Canterbury to consider divorce law reform, and bythe Law Commission for England and Wales. The Archbishop&apos;sGroup had initially proposed that the sole ground of divorce shouldbe the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage. This view had beenaccepted by the Church Assembly, the Methodist Conference, anda considerable body of public opinion. But it would involve thecourt in conducting an inquest into the state of every marriage whichwas the subject of a divorce petition, and neither judges nor courts
CONFIDENTIALcould be provided in the numbers required. Discussions betweenthe Archbishop&apos;s Group and the Law Commission for England andWales had, however, now produced agreed proposals that were not open to this objection. It was proposed that the court should grant a decree only if satisfied that the marriage had irretrievably broken down and that, unless the contrary were proved, the marriage shouldbe presumed to have broken down if the court was satisfied thatcohabitation could not be expected to continue because of either theadultery or other conduct of the respondent, or that the parties hadbeen separated for at least two years and the respondent did not object to divorce, or that there had been separation for at least fiveyears. An encouraging measure of agreement had now been reached,and he proposed that a Bill drafted by Parliamentary Counsel to theLaw Commission should be handed to a Private Member; and thatthe Government, while remaining neutral on the merits of theproposals, should consider making Government time available forits discussion in Parliament in the light of the degree of supportshown for it on Second Reading.The Scottish Law Commission had also presented a reportmaking recommendations not inconsistent with those put forward for England and Wales, and he proposed to discuss with the Secretaryof State for Scotland and the Lord Advocate the question whetherprovisions appropriate to Scotland should be included in the EnglishBill.The Lord Advocate said that he was anxious to keep open thepossibility of legislation to amend the law of Scotland either in theEnglish Bill or in a Scottish Bill in the same Session. It was undesirable that Scotland should appear to lag behind England andWales in social reform merely because Parliamentary time could notbe found for the Scottish counterparts of English Bills.In discussion it was mentioned that the Home Affairs Committeehad considered, but rejected, the alternative of introducing aGovernment Bill, but allowing a free vote. Such a procedure couldcreate difficult in the management of the Bill and lead to embarrassingpressure for a free vote on other Government measures. It might also place Ministers in personal difficulty if on grounds of consciencethey felt unable to support the measure. If, however, the measurewere introduced by a Private Member, the Government might find themselves committed to making Government time available inorder to enable Parliament to come to a conclusion upon it. This,in addition to the provision of the draft of the Bill, would be anundeniable departure from neutrality, and there was some risk thatthe Government would be exposed to the criticism of those who, on either humanist or religious grounds, opposed, in particular, theproposals for divorce with consent after two years&apos; separation andwithout consent, after five. There was likely to be considerable opposition to the former from members of the Free Churches whofeared that, by encouraging the tendency of young people to enterinto marriage without proper regard for the sanctity of the marriage
CONFIDENTIALvow, it would endanger the stability of the institution of marriage.It was desirable that the Government should be seen to take a neutralattitude on the merits of the Bill and should not be placed, as theyhad been in respect of the Medical Termination of Pregnancy Bill,under the necessity to intervene in order to ensure that the Bill was put into a workable form. To provide a Private Member with aBill which was in the proper form at the outset might reduce theextent of the Governmenfs involvement, and the public were increasingly coming to understand that to give a Private Membersufficient Government time to ensure that the consideration of hisBill did not depend on the hazards of the Ballot for Private Members&apos;time was a valuable way of bringing the resources of Parliament tobear on important social problems without implying the support ofthe Government for any particular proposals in the Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, while some Ministers in their individual capacity had^eservations aboutparticular features of the proposed scheme, the Cabinet were agreedthat a Bill on the lines proposed by the Lord Chancellor should be drafted for introduction by a Private Member in the House ofCommons. If it appeared from the Second Reading debate that theBill would receive substantial support, the Government should beprepared to make sufficient time available to enable the House tocome to a conclusion on it. The Government would not be committed to a view either on the Bill as a whole or on the particularprovisions, and Ministers would be free to vote according to their personal opinions. The Lord Chancellor should discuss with theLord President, the Secretary of State for Scotland and the lord advocate the best means of handling the legislation in respect ofScotland, having regard both to the desirability of amending the lawon both sides of the Border in the same Session and to the risk thatthe addition of Scottish provisions to an English Bill might add tothe difficulties which the Private Member would face in piloting it through the House.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals in C (67) 154 relating to legislation on divorce law reform to be introduced by a private member.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, in consultation withthe Lord President, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Lord Advocate, whether provisions relating to scotland should be included in the English Bill or beintroduced separately.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th October, 1967.
