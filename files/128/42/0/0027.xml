SubjectApproach to Europe
CC 27 (67)secret the Cabinet considered a Note by the Prime Minister (C (67) 72),to which was attached the draft of a Parliamentary Statement on the approach to Europe.The Prime Minister recalled that at the conclusion of the Cabinetmeetings held at Chequers on the preceding Sunday he had undertaken to prepare a statement for consideration by the Cabinet.The discussion of the statement could perhaps constitute the contextwithin which the Cabinet should come to a decision on whether ornot application should be made for entry into the european communities. ..In discussion of the draft it was suggested that it would be imprudent for the statement to commit the Government to an unconditional application in the form proposed, since if theapplication were to fail, the damage to our position would be allthe greater. It was the general view, however, that if an applicationwere to be made, the right course would be to make it whole-heartedlyand to put all the force of the Government behind the attempt tomake it succeed, provided that the initial statement made it sufficiently clear that suitable arrangements in respect of the major issues involved would have to be negotiated before we actually joined the communities. It would also be important to make it clear in thecourse of subsequent debate in Parliament that this application wasnot being made from a position of weakness: there were alternative courses before the Government, but they believed this course to bethe best.Certain textual amendments to the draft were agreed; and thefollowing main points were made- (a) It would be important to retain the suggestion that many ofthe lesser issues involved could suitably be settled after our entry intothe Community.(b) It was suggested that the reference to the need to providesafeguards in relation to the far-reaching changes in the structure of British agriculture which would be entailed by the common agricultural policy of the European Economic Community (e.c.)might imply that we expected to negotiate major changes in that policy which we had little expectation of achieving in fact. It was generally agreed, however, that it was important not to understatethe effects of the policy on British agriculture, while equally avoiding any implication that we expected to be able to negotiate major changesin its essential features (although we might reasonably hope thatadjustments extending beyond transitional provisions might be madein certain cases).(c) It was suggested that a reference to tropical foodstuffs shouldbe made in the paragraph dealing with essential commonwealth interests. It was the general view, however, that this was unnecessarysince the major problem in this area related to the commonwealth sugar Agreement, which was specifically mentioned in the statement.approach to Europe(previous reference :CC(67) 26thConclusions)
(d) It was agreed that the paragraphs which referred to our widerpolitical reasons for seeking to join the Community should be recast.(e) The final paragraph of the statement should be amended inthe light of the Cabinets discussion on Parliamentary Procedure.In further discussion the Cabinet considered the appropriateform for a White Paper on the approach to Europe. It was generally agreed that the best course would be for the Prime ministers statement to be reproduced as a White Paper and that the need topresent fuller information on the issues involved could best be met by the subsequent publication of a further paper or papers dealingfactually with such questions as the impact of the common agricultural policy on British agriculture. Arrangements for such papers shouldbe agreed between the Ministers primarily concerned; and the draftsneed not be submitted to the Cabinet.At the conclusion of the discussion the Cabinet agreed that,subject to the approval of Parliament, the Government should make an application to join the European Communities on the basis indicated in the draft Parliamentary statement appended to C (67) 72,as amended in their discussion, and that this statement should bemade by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Prime Minister suggested that it would not be appropriate for other Ministerial statements or broadcasts to be made in thecourse of the next two days, save to oversea Governments and inrespect of our foreign and Commonwealth affairs. This need not,however, inhibit appropriate briefing of the specialist Press; andfrom the end of the week onwards Ministers might feel free to speakin public within the ambit of the Cabinets decision. cabinet ministers should draw the attention of their junior Ministers and parliamentary Private Secretaries to the implications of this decisionfor their own positions, as indicated in the memorandum on Questionsof Procedure for Ministers (C (P) (66) 5). The booklet on theEuropean Economic Communities which had been prepared by theDepartment of Economic Affairs (attached to C (67) 67) might nowbe published as a document issued by the Central Office ofInformation; and arrangements should be made to make it availableto Members of Parliament.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, subject to the approval of Parliament, anapplication should be made for the United Kingdom tojoin the European Economic Communities on the basis indicated in the draft statement appended to C(67) 72,as amended in their discussion.(2) Took note, with approval, that this statement would be madeby the Prime Minister in the House of Commons that afternoon and would subsequently be issued as a white paper.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theLord President of the Council and the Ministersdepartmentally concerned, would arrange for a furtherpublication, or series of publications, to be laid before
Parliament providing factual information about the impact of joining the European Communities on such issues as British agriculture.(4) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, to arrange for the bookletby the Department of Economic Affairs on the european economic Communities, attached to C (67) 67, to bepublished by the Central Office of Information and to bemade available to Members of Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd May, 1967.
