CC 13 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. On Thursday,23rd March, it was expected that the House of Commons would meet at 11 a.m., that Questions would be taken until 12 noon andthat the House would adjourn at 5 p.m. until Tuesday, 4th April.secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the Federal German cabinet had reversed their position on the offset costs of our forces stationed in Germany. They were now offering DM450 million for our financial year 1967-68, of which DM200 million would be for purchases of military equipment and DM250 million for civilpurchases. If this contribution, which would amount to some 40 million, were added to the administrative economies that we were making in the cost of our forces in Germany ( 10 million), savings from withdrawing one brigade ( 5 million) and half of the value ofthe purchases which the United States Government were makingunder our agreement with them not to reduce our combat strength in Germany before 1st July ( 6 million), the total that could be set against the oversea costs of our forces in Germany was somewhatover  60 million. In addition the United States were being pressed by their representative in the tripartite talks to provide a further 7 million. There was to be a meeting of the Tripartite Group in washington on 20th March and we had to decide the line to be takenthen on the new proposals.In discussion it was pointed out that on the new basis weshould still not cover the full oversea costs of our forces in germany in 1967-68, which amounted to  80-85 million. Moreover, severalaspects of the matter required clarification before a decision couldbe taken. These included in particular the response of the UnitedStates Administration to the proposal for additional relief of 7 million to our balance of payments; whether or not it was appropriate to include in the calculation the  6 million of the totalof  12 million of American equipment purchases, the whole of whichwas to secure our agreement not to reduce our combat strength inGermany before 1st July; whether or not the Federal GermanGovernment accepted that under their proposals we should stillwithdraw a brigade; and finally the implications of the Americanplan to rotate one division of their forces in Germany. It wouldbe necessary for the facts to be clarified, and the necessary decisions taken, on the following day by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the situation in Nigeriawas deteriorating. In particular Ibos who had jobs or were resident in the Western region might well be subject to attack, though therewere as yet no reports of any being killed. In general, the outlookwas serious.
South Arabia(previous reference :CC(66) 60thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in south arabia was bad and was deteriorating. Terrorists organised by theEgyptian Intelligence Service from Taiz in the Yemen were very active in Aden and dissident groups were operating against us and each other. The position was made more difficult by the fact that,although nothing had been said publicly, the Federal Governmenthad gained the impression under the previous Administration thatthe grant of independence in 1968 would be accompanied by a defence agreement under which we would give military support to south Arabia after independence. He had had consultations aboutthe situation with the High Commissioner and with two ministers of the Federal Government and there has been an intensiveexamination by himself and the Defence Secretary of other possible course of action. Our primary requirement was the withdrawal ofour forces from South Arabia in accordance with the plannedtimetable. If we were to have any prospect of doing this the federal government must be kept in being, at least up to the time of our final withdrawal. The Federal Government were confident that theycould deal with the internal, security problem in Aden more effectively than we were doing, although we ourselves were doubtfulof this. But they were looking to us for support against external aggression while they dealt with the internal security problem, and,unless this were forthcoming, the Federal Government were likelyto collapse before we had withdrawn our forces.In these circumstances he had considered how far we could gotowards meeting the wishes of the Federal Government with the leastrisk either of extending the period during which we maintained forcesin South Arabia or of becoming involved with Federal forces indealing with internal security. He now proposed that the date of independence for South Arabia should be advanced from 1st January,1968, to 1st November, 1967; this would give the new State someprospects of acceptance by the General Assembly of the united nations during the 1967 session, although the possibility of a vetocould not of course be excluded. Shortly after 1st November all our forces would finally be withdrawn from South Arabia itself, but fora period of up to six months thereafter we would station a strikecarrier and a&apos; commando carrier (with an embarked commando) inthe area. Their purpose would be restricted to providing the new state with air support against external aggression and, if need be, toevacuating United Kingdom nationals. It was not thought likely thatEgyptian forces from the Yemen would attempt to invade south arabia, at least as long as it was supported against external aggression and if it succeeded in establishing itself as a stable state the Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Commonwealth Secretary.
aircraft industry(previous reference:CC(67) 3rdConclusions,Minute 6)The AirbusSECRET4. The Cabinet considered a Memorandum by the Minister of technology (C (67) 30) covering a report by Officials on the proposedEuropean airbus, and a memorandum by the President of the Boardof Trade (C (67) 32) on the relationship between the airbus and therequirements of British European Airways (BEA).The Minister of Technology said that the proposed airbus wouldbe a short-haul aircraft with a capacity of about 250 seats and operating costs per seat-mile about 30 per cent below the lowest costof present types. It was to be developed by a consortium of British,French and German firms, and should be available for sale to the airlines by 1973. As the project depended on existing technology, itcould be regarded as primarily a venture in collaborative productionand marketing.   By 1980 there should be a world market forthereafter. The advantages of the proposed arrangement were thatwe could adhere to, and indeed advance, the timetable for our withdrawal, that the risk of becoming involved in internal securityoperations after independence would be eliminated and that south arabia&apos;s prospects of acceptance by the United Nations would be improved by the fact that all our troops would have left when theapplication was made. It was important, however, both that weshould do all that we could to secure acceptance of the new federal constitution by the United Nations mission and that we should seek to broaden the basis of the Federal Government. He was taking action to this end.If the proposals were agreed the Minister of State for ForeignAffairs (Mr. Thomson) would leave for Aden that evening in anattempt to secure acceptance of them by the Federal Government. Astatement would be made in Parliament about our proposals on the morning of Monday, 20th March, as background for the debate onthe Second Reading of the Consolidated Fund Bill that afternoonwhich would deal mainly with the Aden situation.In discussion there was general agreement that any course opento us in South Arabia would involve serious risks and that theForeign Secretary^ proposals offered the best prospect of minimisingthese and of securing our objectives. It was important, however, thatwe should limit strictly the duration of our commitment to givesupport to South Arabia against external aggression to a maximum of six months after independence. It would also be both necessary,and desirable in our own interest, to announce this limit publicly.The Cabinet Agreed that action should be taken in respect of our future position in South Arabia on the basis proposed by theForeign Secretary.
700-800 airbuses of which about 300 would be for use outside theUnited States. The European airbus would have to face competition from United States industry, but the United States rival, which wouldbe in service a year earlier, was likely to have a capacity of300-350 seats and a somewhat longer range than the Europeanmachine. Should we not proceed with the European airbus, theUnited States would acquire a monopoly in the field of largesub-sonic aircraft, and this would have serious effects on theEuropean aircraft industry and on the associated advancedtechnological industries. In view of the large launching costs forprojects of this kind, United States domination could be averted only by a collaborative European effort. The British, French and german aircraft industries had a common interest in airframe development,but the United Kingdom had in addition a special interest in thedevelopment of the new engine which was proposed for the airbus.The United Kingdom would bear 37^ per cent of the cost of launching the airbus, which was estimated at  130 million. It hadbeen argued that this was an over-estimate and that a figure of 90- 100 million would be more realistic, but this suggestion shouldbe treated with caution in view of the way in which initial estimates of development costs had in the past almost invariably been exceededin the event. The total cost to the three Governments of launchingthe airbus, including the Rolls-Royce engine, would be  185 million,of which the United Kingdom share would be about  75 million.300 airbuses would have to be sold if these costs were to be recovered, and the outlook for the project was poor in terms of directprofitability. However, if foreign exchange earnings and import saving were taken into account, the project appeared in a morefavourable light. The calculations which were summarised in annex 1 to the report by Officials showed that total sales of100 airbuses would entail an implied preference of 8-11 per cent, andif total sales reached 150 no preference would be involved. If an allowance were made for interest on the Government outlay, theimplied preference on total sales of 150 airbuses would be 10 percent. If in addition the Government loss at various levels of salewere compared with the foreign exchange savings or earnings atthose levels, and if the differences were then discounted at 8 per cent(to represent the present value of Government expenditure and prospective foreign exchange savings / earnings), the implied subsidy on 150 sales would be 13-17 per cent. These figures comparedfavourably with the preference we were prepared to accord to certain other industries for example, computers. One of the prerequisitesfor our participation in the project was an assurance of orders for75 airbuses from the national airlines of the three countries, whichwas 50 per cent of the total sales of 150 assumed in the calculations.The airbus would therefore have a larger assured market at the outsetthan any comparable project on which we had embarked in the past.The President of the Board of Trade said that BEA wouldrequire an aircraft of the airbus type at some time after 1973-75.However, their immediate concern was with their requirement foran aircraft of intermediate size which would span the gap betweenthe aircraft now in service or on order and the airbus.  They had
now formally asked for authority to order 30 BAC-211 aircraft, withan option for a further 10, using the Rolls-Royce RB-211 engine.The BAC-211 would be the most profitable alternative aircraft tothe Boeing 727, which BEA had been refused permission to purchase in 1966. It would also be less noisy. The BAC-211 was in fact afurther development of the BAC-111, of which 82 had already been sold overseas, earning  99 million in foreign exchange. It might therefore be expected that the BAC-211 would also have a good prospect of export sales. There was a difficulty over the engine inthat Rolls-Royce were unlikely to have the capacity to undertake the simultaneous development of the RB-207 for the airbus and the rb-211 for the BAC-211. An alternative engine for the BAC-211was the existing Rolls-Royce Spey, but this would be noisier andconsequently would reduce the acceptable frequency of operation and the prospect of sales. A decision to proceed with the airbuswould clearly have serious implications for any intermediate aircraft which BEA would be allowed to order, and further consideration should be given to the latter problem before reaching a decision onthe airbus. BEA could not be instructed to order the airbus, but ifthey undertook to do so while at the same time they were refusedthe BAC-211, they would seek a firm commitment that theGovernment would relieve them of the financial burdens which might result from the uneconomic operation of a fleet of aircraft, the composition of which had been largely determined by theGovernments policies for the aircraft industry.In discussion it was pointed out that many of the aircraft projects sponsored by the United Kingdom industry since the war had proved to be uneconomic. It now appeared that even the bestcollaborative venture which could be divised on a European basis would not be economically viable. On a national basis we hadalready given financial support to the computer industry in order to.avoid United States domination. The question at issue was whethersimilar action was now required on a European basis in order to preserve the aircraft industry. This was, a major political problem which required further information and a more extensive review. Itwas also important to remember that, once we had committedourselves to the early stages of such a co-operative project, it would subsequently prove difficult to extricate ourselves as had alreadybeen demonstrated in connection with Concord and the programmeof the European Launcher Development Organisation. The market for the airbus would be predominantly in the United States, andthe United States airbus would be available before the Europeanversion. It seemed likely that the United States airbus would capturevirtually the whole of the American market and a significant part ofother markets (e.g., in Australia). There was also some doubt whether Lufthansa would be willing to commit themselves firmly tothe purchase of the European airbus. It had been stressed that support for the airbus would involve increases in the planned levelof public expenditure in the next few years. It was therefore necessary to be clear whether a decision to participate would entail
reductions in other programmes and, if so, precisely what these would be.On the other hand it had to be remembered that the airbusproject was important to any general acceptance of the concept ofa European technological community and, bearing in mind the saving of imports that would be involved, its economic prospects had proved on examination to be more encouraging than had been expected. Moreover the estimates might well prove to be over-conservative. The acceptance of the Rolls-Royce RB-207 was ofparticular importance to the United Kingdom, as Rolls-Royce werehoping that the same engine might be adopted by Lockheed for theUnited States airbus, in which case the RB-207 engine would powerboth the European and the United States machines, with very largeconsequential earnings of foreign exchange for the United Kingdom.Hawker-Siddeley would be willing to yield the design leadership ofthe airbus project to Sud-Aviation on condition that the RB-207engine were adopted. It was, moreover, important that we shouldnot delay the project pending further discussions of theBEA requirements since this would at best impair the prospect of sales and might well indeed put the whole project at risk. in considering the BEA proposals, it was relevant that by comparisonwith the airbus the export prospects for the BAC-211 were at leastopen to question. However, further information should be obtained on the ability of Rolls-Royce to develop both the RB-207 and the rb-211 at the same time. Alternative aircraft which could beadopted by BEA instead of the BAC-211 were the Trident-3B or thestretched version of the VC-10, although BEA had said that both these aircraft would be uneconomic in operation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were on balance inclined to favour participation in the project definition stage of the airbus on the basis proposed. At theforthcoming meeting of Ministers of the three countries concernedwe should not appear to be hampering the progress of the discussion,but at the same time we should not seek to urge our prospectivepartners to proceed with the project against their own judgment. Weshould stress the five prerequisites for our participation, and inparticular it was essential that the Rolls-Royce engine should beadopted. However, the Cabinet considered that further information was needed to clarify points raised in the discussion before a finaldecision was taken, and the Minister without Portfolio should examine these with the Ministers primarily concerned. In the lightof their discussion, the issue should then be referred back tothe Cabinet for a final decision.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for theMinisters primarily concerned to discuss the issuesrequiring clarification and to report their conclusions tothe Cabinet.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion the following week.
- 9CC 13 (67)confidential. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the deficit in our balance of payments for 1966 showed a very marked improvement on that for earlier years. The deficit in 1964 was estimated at 822 million. This had been reduced to  410 million in 1965 and 189 million in 1966. It was particularly notable that theimprovement in 1966 arose almost entirely from the change in thesituation brought about by the Governments measures in July ofthat year, which had led to a substantial surplus in our balance ofpayments for the last quarter of the year. If those measures hadnot been taken our economic situation would have been extremely serious. The Basle international credits had now been renewed,although it was to be hoped that it would not be necessary for usto make use of them. The trade figures for the first two months ofthe current year were also satisfactory. In these circumstances, andhaving regard to a general fall in interest rates in a number of majorinternational financial centres, Bank Rate was from noon of that daybeing reduced to 6 per cent. There was, however, some slight cause for concern at the position of the gilt edged market where the needfor a large issue later in the year to provide for compensation forthe nationalisation of the iron and steel industry was having a depressing effect.The Prime Minister said that this general improvement not onlyin our balance of payments but also in the general economicsituation, should be widely publicised in Ministerial speeches and byother means.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.secret . The Cabinet considered a note by the First Secretary ofState and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 31) to whichwas attached a draft White Paper on prices and incomes policy after30th June, 1967.The First Secretary of State said that, in pursuance of &quot;the cabinets decision at their meeting on 9th March, he had discussed with representatives of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI)and the Trades Union Congress (TUC) the memorandum on thefuture development of policy on prices and incomes which was annexed to his note and which he now proposed should be regardedas the draft of a White Paper, subject to some further amendments which he proposed in the light of these consultations. The CBI hadconfined themselves to making a number of detailed points on thememorandum. They had asked about the Governments intentions as regards statutory powers after the period of severe restraint. Hehad told them that no final decisions had been made but that theGovernment at present adhered to the proposals previously putforward, except that they did not wish to take up a rigid attitude
about the maximum period of delay which might be imposed onincreases of prices and wages under statutory powers after July 1967.The meeting with the TUC had been difficult and they had objected to discussing the memorandum at all. They claimed in the first placethat they needed more time to consider it. There had been somesuggestion that they would like a further meeting with him onMonday, 20th March, but the General Secretary of the TUC had said they would need a further month to consider the memorandum andthe suggestion for a further meeting had not been pursued. Themain reason, however, for the tuc&apos;s attitude was that they were unwilling to discuss the questions of a norm and criteria for wage increases until they knew the Governmenfs decisions on statutory powers. They had also appeared to argue that they would wish to operate a voluntary incomes policy on the basis of criteria of theirown choosing and that it would not be necessary to make any preciseformulation of such criteria. He had emphasised to them the needfor an early Government statement on norm and criteria in orderto give guidance to those concerned in wage negotiations in thecoming months.In the light of these consultations, the right course was to givethe TUC until Monday, 20th March, to make any further commentand then to publish a White Paper on 21st or 22nd March in theterms of the draft annexed to his note, subject to such amendments as the Cabinet thought fit and to his discretion to make further changes of a purely drafting character. He would make a statement in Parliament and hold a Press Conference at the time of publication.At their previous meeting the Cabinet had asked him to consider what might be done to influence the forthcoming annual conferencesof trade unions in order that they might take account of the fact thatconsultations on future policy were still continuing between theGovernment and the TUC. However, it would be necessary to take decisions on the question of statutory powers shortly after Easterand there would be no important union conferences until the end ofApril. If the Government adhered to the proposals on statutory powers hitherto discussed with the CBI and TUC, their decisions would not be welcomed by the unions. In these circumstances, whilethe public presentation of the decisions would be important, it wouldnot be appropriate for Ministers to seek to defend them byaddressing the annual conferences of trade unions.In discussion of the draft White Paper, a number of minor amendments were agreed and the following points were made:(a) In paragraph 2, reference should be made to the government&apos;s success in keeping down prices and in securingreductions in interest rates.(b) Paragraph 4 (i) should be reworded in order to convey morepositively that it was the Governmenfs objective to secure conditionswhich would encourage faster economic growth and to avoid the need to revert to deflationary measures.(c) It should be made clear in paragraph 4 (ii) that the operationof a policy on a voluntary basis, towards which it wasthe Governmenfs objective to work, must be effective.
(d) The Minister of Agriculture said that, if the supervision ofprices were to be concentrated on those prices of economicsignificance, as proposed in paragraph 6, this would mean a loosercontrol of food prices than under present arrangements, and therewas some inconsistency between this reference and the statement inparagraph 7 that the present early warning system for prices wouldbe continued. On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was proposed to include in the prices which would be supervised thosewhich were of importance to the cost of living, and this would includethe prices of the main foodstuffs. It was agreed that the first secretary of State should consider further the wording of paragraphs 6-7 in consultation with the Minister of Agriculture.(e) In the section of the draft dealing with criteria in respect ofprices, a reference to the nationalised industries on the lines ofparagraph 8 of Cmnd. 2639 should be inserted.(/) The First Secretary of State should consult with the HousingMinisters on a possible rewording of paragraphs 13-14 dealing withrents.(g) The section dealing with incomes from employment made no reference-to the phasing of wage increases. This raised thepossibility that substantial increases agreed after 30th June, 1967,might be implemented in full at a time when increases allowed underthe criteria for the period of severe restraint were still being phased;this might produce some anomalies. The First Secretary of state should consult with the Minister of Health on this point.(h) The reference in paragraph 16 to the tendency for any positive figure for a norm for wage increases to become in practicea general minimum increase should be either deleted or related topast experience rather than to future expectations.(/) The proposed criteria for incomes did nothing to remedy the anomalies which had arisen where groups of workers in England andWales received wage increases just before the standstill, whilecorresponding groups in Scotland had had to wait for an increasebecause settlements in their case usually followed some time aftersettlements for England and Wales and they had in consequencebeen held up by the standstill. This, however, was a problem whichhad arisen solely because of the imposition of the standstill andshould not recur in the future.(;*) It should be made clear that the additional considerations tobe taken into account in applying the criteria for wage increases,which were set out in paragraph 19, were without prejudice to the generality of the main criteria for incomes.(k) The presentation of the passage on salaries in para-graphs 23-24 would be particularly important. It would benecessary to avoid giving the impression that salaried employees werebeing treated more favourably than wage earners. It might bedesirable to bring out more clearly in paragraph 23 that employeeswhose salaries were subject to review at the discretion of management had been particularly affected by the standstill and theperiod of severe restraint.
(/) It would be helpful to include in paragraph 27 a referenceto the present low level of profits and dividends and in particularthis section should not be so phrased as to discourage the private sector of the economy. The First Secretary of State should consult with the Chancellor of the Exchequer accordingly.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theFirst Secretary of State should now, in consultation with theMinisters concerned, revise the draft White Paper in the light of thediscussion, incorporating any further changes of a purely draftingcharacter which he thought desirable. The TUC should be givenuntil 20th March to make any further comment and the White paper should be published on 22nd March. It would be desirable for itssubstance to be discussed with the Governments supporters inParliament before publication. The First Secretary of State should put proposals to the Cabinet on the issue of statutory powers shortly after Easter. It would be necessary to consult the TUC furtherbefore decisions on this issue were promulgated, and it might be appropriate for him to see them on the matter.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft of the White Paper on Prices and incomes Policy, annexed to C (67) 31, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion and to any further minordrafting amendments which the First Secretary of Statemight wish to make.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, to arrange for its publication on 22nd March.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate to them after easter proposals in respect of statutory powers on prices and incomes.reorganisation of thePost Office(previous reference:CC(66) 36thConclusions,Minute 4)Draft WhitePaperCONFIDENTIAL7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePostmaster-General (C (67) 29), to which was attached the draft ofa White Paper on the reorganisation of the Post Office.The Postmaster-General recalled that in July of the previous year the Cabinet had agreed that the postal and telecommunicationservices of the Post Office should be transferred to a new public corporation. It had subsequently been agreed that the Post OfficeSavings Department should remain in the Civil Service and should report to Treasury Ministers, although the new National Giro andthe existing Post Office remittance services were to become theresponsibility of the Corporation.After the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries had reported on its current inquiry into the Post Office, and afterconsultation with the Staff Side, the terms of the draft White paper had been agreed by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.
The reference in paragraph 25 to the National Data ProcessingService had subsequently been agreed by the Sub-Committee onComputer Policy of the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.The target for vesting day for the new Corporation should nowbe fixed as 1st April, 1969. This would entail securing Royal assent to the necessary Bill by July 1968. A place had been sought in thelegislative programme and it was aimed to introduce the Bill in timefor the Second Reading to take place before the Christmas Recess.In keeping with this timetable it was desirable to present the white paper to Parliament before Easter.In discussion a few minor amendments to the text of the draft white Paper were agreed and the following main points were made:(a) It was suggested that the proposal, recorded in paragraph 31of the draft White Paper, to make the Corporation^ power to grantlicences under its monopolies subject to the consent of the Minister,but to give the Corporation the sole right to refuse licences withoutthere being an appeal to the Minister, might lead to undue restrictioneither of new technical developments or of local rights. It was,however, the general view that on balance the Corporation shouldhave the unfettered right to refuse licences, though it might benecessary to consider this issue further if the relevant clause in theBill was subjected to strong criticism in Parliament.(b) The timetable for the necessary legislation would require futher consideration by the Future Legislation Committee.The Cabinet (1) Approved the publication before Easter of the draft white paper on the reorganisation of the Post Office attachedto C (67) 29, subject to the amendments agreed in discussion.(2) Invited the Lord President of the Council, in consultationwith the Postmaster-General, to arrange for the future legislation Committee to consider the necessary arrangements for legislation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th March, 1967.
