Subject:Middle East
8154SECRETMiddle East The Foreign Secretary said that the present critical situation inthe Middle East had developed from retaliatory action undertaken by Israel in Jordan because of terrorist attacks from both Jordan and syria. In consequence Jordan, Syria, Israel and the United arab republic (UAR) had in turn felt obliged to adopt increasinglybelligerent attitudes and the present position was that the UAR hadmobilised some 60,000 men, together with a considerable armouredforce and substantial air support along the Sinai frontier. In addition,the Palestine Liberation Army of two divisions was mobilised in theGaza Strip. These forces were considerably greater and bettertrained than were the Egyptian forces in 1956, which had been deprived of air support by pur own bombing attacks. The Israeliforces, on the other hand, were much smaller and there were indications that Israel had been caught unprepared. TheSecretary-General of the United Nations had given way precipitatelyto pressure from the UAR to withdraw the United NationsEmergency Force (UNEF) and, in addition to moving up to theGaza and Sinai frontiers, the Egyptian Forces had reoccupied thebatteries at Sharm-el-Sheik controlling the Tiran Straits. They were thus in a position to close the Gulf of Aqaba and had been movingwarships into that area and were reported to be laying mines. Theywere likely to stop ships flying the Israeli flag from entering the gulf of Aqaba and to stop other ships if they were carrying strategicsupplies to Israel.Israel had repeatedly made it clear that she would regard the closing of the Gulf of Aqaba as a casus belli, since access to the port of Eilat was vital to her economy according to a recent assessmentsome 15 per cent of her import trade by weight passed through thisport in 1965, some 90 per cent of her oil imports and some 40 percent of her exports of phosphates. Although israels position inrelation to the UAR was considerably weaker than it had been in1956, and great damage was likely to be done to her towns by air attack in the event of war, there was a grave risk that Israel wouldbe tempted to launch a preventive war since her relative strengthwas likely to decline, especially if access to the port of Eilat were cut off. The immediate problem was to find means of dissuadingIsrael from taking this step and thereafter of bringing the situation under control.The United States were committed to intervene to prevent thedestruction of Israel and wished to reactivate the tripartite declaration of 1950 which guaranteed existing frontiers in this partof the Middle East. This proposal was not, however, acceptable tous, since it would involve a commitment to military action to maintainthe frontiers, not only of Israel, but also of the UAR and reactivationwould be harmful to our relations with the Arab States generally.The French Government, as the third party to the Declaration, took a similar view. The Soviet Foreign Minister (Mr. Gromyko) had recently visited Cairo and, while there was no information about thepurpose of his visit, it might be assumed that the Soviet Government
were concerned to support Syrian interests in order to reassert their position in the Middle East. In the circumstances he had proposedin the first place to call a meeting of the Security Council to considerthe threat to peace in the Middle East and to pass a resolution calling for the Tiran Straits to be kept open. It was now clear, however,that there was likely to be insufficient support to enable such ameeting to be called before the Secretary-General returned in two days&apos; time from his visit to Cairo; and thereafter it was likely thatthe Soviet representative would prolong the discussion and eventuallyveto the resolution. It was unlikely that Israel would feel able to await the outcome of a meeting of the Security Council, and he therefore sought the authority of the Cabinet to join with the UnitedStates Government and such other maritime countries as could beenlisted in support in announcing an intention to establish a naval force, whether under the auspices of the United Nations or not, tokeep the Gulf of Aqaba open to shipping of all nations, or to reopenit. It was very desirable that such a declaration should be made without delay although no effective force could be assembledimmediately. The United States had two ships which could bebrought to the Gulf in a few days, but it would be necessary for ships of the Sixth United States Fleet to pass through the Suez Canaltogether with supporting British vessels from Malta. It would not,therefore, be possible to prevent the Gulf of Aqaba being closed,but the assurance that it would be reopened offered the best chanceof dissuading Israel from launching a preventive war. The declaredpurpose of the operation would be to assert maritime rights, not toassist Israel, and would be unlikely to have any serious effect on ourrelations with the Arab States generally.In discussion, it was pointed out that the proposed naval force would necessarily have to be drawn largely from United States andBritish ships at present in the Mediterranean, and it was questioned whether the Egyptian Government would permit them to pass the suez Canal once the intention of reopening the Gulf of Aqaba hadbeen announced. It was suggested further that, before any decision could be reached, detailed consideration should be given with theUnited States Government to the practicability of the proposed operation if the Egyptian Government should offer resistance toit and to the risks involved, including the risk of being drawn intomilitary action against the UAR. Alternative means of opening theStraits should also be explored. It would be relevant to know theextent to which other countries would participate and what the likelyeffect would be on our position and interests in the Middle East.It was urged that no commitment should be made until these issueshad been explored, and it was questioned whether an immediatestatement of intent was essential in order to avoid precipitate action by the Israeli Government.In further discussion it was argued that it would be inconsistent with our interests in the Middle East to incur the risks inherent inany commitment to the use of force to reopen the Straits. In additionto its effect on our relations with the Arab States and on our difficultiesin South Arabia in particular, such action might have grave financial
consequences. Even although we should no doubt seek to avoid the appearance of taking the lead, there was a risk, in view of the firm United States commitments to Israel and of the predominantpart which the United States must necessarily play in any operation,of our being drawn into their wider commitment, the full extentof which should first be ascertained. It was questioned whether,if the United States had already given firm assurances to Israel andif Israel were reluctant to take the offensive, any further assuranceon our part would have any significant effect on the Israeli attitude.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the United States&apos;commitment was an undertaking to prevent the destruction of Israel.It did not however cover her economic strangulation through the closing of the Gulf of Aqaba and would therefore not operate to deter Israel from embarking on a preventive war if she judged thatthis offered less risk than submission to economic blockade.Reassurance over the Gulf of Aqaba was more likely to be effective in restraining her, but it would have to be given without delay.Further, while it was possible to regard the Tripartite Declarationas having been superseded, Israel had agreed to withdraw from theTiran Straits in 1957 on assurances, to which we were party, thatthe Straits would be occupied by the UNEF and we were committed by a statement made by the then Prime Minister, Mr. Macmillan,of 14th May, 1963, and subsequently endorsed by the present PrimeMinister on 16th December, 1964, and 13th April, 1965, in relationto the freedom of passage through the Gulf of Aqaba. If we didnot honour these assurances, and if Israel were to launch a preventivewar and reoccupy the Sinai peninsula, she clearly would not agreeto withdraw on any subsequent assurances, particularly as there wouldbe a consequent risk of intervention by the Soviet Union on behalfof the UAR. Furthermore our relations with the United States werepassing through a critical stage and would be very severely strained,with adverse consequences for our financial position, if we refusedto play any part with them in the Middle East situation. Since wecould neither stand aside nor accept the implications of the tripartite declaration and since there was little prospect of early action bythe United Nations, the course which offered least risk and the best prospect of restraining Israel, was to give an assurance in concert with other maritime countries of intention to make effective thefreedom of passage through the Tiran Straits in the terms of the1957 declaration. Such an assurance need not indicate a particular course of action, but urgent consideration should be given inconjunction with the United States Government and the othermaritime powers concerned with the issue to devising a workableplan and to assessing its implications. It seemed doubtful whetherthe Egyptian Government would resist action to keep the Straitsopen if convinced of the United States&apos; determination to do so.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that we should base ourselves on the assurance givento Israel by the main maritime powers in 1957 that they would support and assert the freedom of passage in the Straits of Tiran.  On that
occasion we had said that we would assert this right on behalf ofall British shipping and were prepared to join with others to securegeneral recognition of these rights; and it was in this spirit that weshould act now. The Foreign Secretary, in his forthcoming visit to moscow, should inform the Soviet Government accordingly, andshould tell them that the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs(Mr. Thomson) would be visiting Washington at the same time inorder to seek to promote action, in collaboration with other maritimecountries concerned with access to the Gulf of Aqaba, in accordancewith the declaration. The Minister of State, who should be accompanied by defence advisers, should endeavour to ascertain the position of the United States Government in relation to the tripartite Declaration of 1950 and to persuade them that in viewof Mr. Macmillan&apos;s statement of 14th May, 1963, and of his (thePrime Ministers) own statements of 16th December, 1964, and 13thApril, 1965, we could only base future action on the declaration of1957. He should make it clear that it was our intention to make that declaration effective, provided that any measures for this purposewere sufficiently international in character and that an acceptablemilitary plan for this purpose could be devised. The precise scope and nature of this plan would, of course, have to be ad referendum tothe Cabinet, who would be concerned to be satisfied that it wasmilitarily realistic. They would also wish to consider whether itimplied an unacceptable risk of escalation.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of State forForeign Affairs to be guided by the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion on their visits to moscow and Washington.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th May, 1967.
