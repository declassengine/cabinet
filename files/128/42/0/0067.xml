CC 67 (67)confidential. The Minister of Agriculture said that the present epidemicof foot-and-mouth disease was one of the worst of this century.The virus was unusually severe and had spread exceptionally fast.There had so far been 672 outbreaks and some 133,000 cattle hadbeen slaughtered. Government compensation to farmers would exceed  10 million. However, the epidemic had been largelyconfined to the West Midlands, though there had been one or twooutbreaks in adjoining areas including one in South Derbyshire.The present epidemic, like its predecessors, was being tackled byslaughter. A change to a policy of vaccination and slaughter wouldcertainly be no cheaper; it would probably involve annual expenditure at a rate at least equal to the total compensation dueso far as a result of the present epidemic. He paid tribute to theunstinted efforts of the veterinary service of the Ministry ofAgriculture, whose officers had been working at full stretch for along period, and to the co-operation of farmers in infected areas andothers concerned.There was no positive evidence of the source of the infection.He thought that the wind and birds could be ruled out in view ofthe geographical area affected and the fact that the nearest pointof infection was in Germany. The most likely cause was imported meat. He confirmed that there had never been an outbreak offoot-and-mouth disease in the Irish Republic which had never&apos; imported meat from the Argentine. He would put before theCommercial Policy Committee later in the week proposals to ban,temporarily, all imports of carcass meat and offal from dangeroussources of supply these would not include Ireland, Australia, NewZealand or North America to avoid risk of another primaryoutbreak; and to review the existing veterinary safeguards on importsof meat in order to reduce the risk of future outbreaks.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister of Agriculture.Agriculture(previous reference:CC (67) 12thConclusions,Minute 3)Foot-and-MouthDiseaseAircraftIndustryRe-equipment of BritishEuropeanAirways(previous reference:CC (66) 41stConclusions,Minute 6)confidential. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the first secretary of State (C (67) 176), the President of the Board of Trade(C(67) 177) and the Minister of Technology (C (67) 178) on there-equipment of British European Airways (BEA).The President of the Board of Trade said that the papers beforethe Cabinet had been prepared before devaluation, and it would bedesirable to consider the problem in the light of fresh calculationsbased on the new value of the pound. The necessary work had beenput in hand.
The Prime Minister said that the item should be placed on theagenda for the Cabinefs next meeting and every effort should bemade to have the new figures ready by then.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade, in consultationwith other Ministers as necessary, to circulate amemorandum, setting out the effects of devaluation onthe estimates already circulated for consideration at their next meeting on Thursday, 23rd November.(2) Agreed to consider the re-equipment of British european airways at their next meeting.secret parliament 3.   The Lord President said that the recent White Paper on(Previous Fuei policy (Cmnd. 3438) was to be debated in the House ofCC (67) 63rd Commons on Monday, 27th November. The Government had putConclusions, down a motion to approve the White Paper, but a considerableDebate on Fuel camPaign nacl been developed by the Members of ParliamentPolicy White representing mining constituencies as well as by the Miners&apos; GroupPaper to persuade the Government to alter the terms of their motion sothat it would invite the House to take note of the White Paperrather than to approve it. This pressure resulted from the strong feelings aroused by the contraction of the coal industry envisaged in the White Paper, which would have serious effects on employmentin particular areas; and the strength of these feelings should notbe underestimated. At the same time, the mining lobby had notattempted to challenge the conclusions of the White Paper on anyrational basis; they simply maintained that the prospect for theindustry was unacceptable. The Government would need to decide how to handle the situation.The Chief Whip said that the leader of the Miners&apos; Group,Mr. Swain, had asked for a discussion with the Prime minister before the debate. Mr. Swain believed that, if he could have sucha discussion and assure his fellow Members that the Prime Ministerfully understood their position, he would then be able to persuade them to accept the Governmenfs motion inviting approval of theWhite Paper.In discussion there was general recognition that the situation would need careful handling. The effects of colliery closures on employment in particular areas could be very serious. Muchdepended on the timing of closures: the situation might well changeradically within the next two years, when the main problem of thecoal industry might be excessive voluntary wastage of manpowerrather than the redundancies caused by closures; moreover, theproblem of finding alternative employment for miners affected by pitclosures might well be much easier in 12 months&apos; time. There wastherefore a case for some flexibility in the timing of collieryclosures over the next 12 months, while adhering to the broad
objectives, of the White Paper. At the same time, it would benecessary to pursue vigorously measures to bring new industry tothe worst hit areas. On the other hand, it was argued that, while there might be scope for altering the order of pit closures as distinct from the overall rate of contraction, there were considerable risksin interfering with the closure programme. In the past a closurehad been postponed after the National Union of Mineworkers(NUM) had taken action to secure acceptance of it by the minersconcerned, and this had placed the Union in a difficult position.There was some evidence that the Miners&apos; Group were more extreme in their opposition to the closure programme than theminers themselves.Devaluation would affect the calculations underlying the fuel policy embodied in the White Paper, and these were being reworked.Oil imports would become more expensive, but this was likely to be offset in due course by the removal of the surcharge on oil imposedduring the Middle East crisis. The difference in cost between oiland coal in the uses for which they were in competition was so great that devaluation would not materially affect the position and theGovernment should not encourage the idea that it would. The bestline for the Government to take in discussions with spokesmen forthe miners was to emphasise that the production targets for thedifferent fuels embodied in the White Paper were not intended tobe rigid and that, as the White Paper stated, the Government would keep the situation under review and would be prepared to adjust the policy in the light of developments.In further discussion there was general agreement that theGovernment should not alter the terms of the motion which hadbeen put down for debate on 27th November. All possible steps should be taken, however, to avoid the motion being passed withthe support of the Opposition and against the votes of the Miners&apos;Group. To this end, it would be right to accept the request of the leader of the Group for a discussion with the Prime Minister. Itwould also be useful if the Ministers concerned with regional policieswere to have a separate discussion before the debate withrepresentatives of the Group.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the terms of the Governments motion for the debate on the White Paper on Fuel Policy should stand, and thatthe object should be to avoid this motion being passed with thesupport of the Opposition against the votes of the Miners&apos; Group.It would be useful if, before the debate, he himself, together withthe Minister of Power and the Chief Whip, were to see either the leader and the secretary of the Miners&apos; Group, or the whole Group;alternatively, it might be more productive to see the leader and secretary with the Executive of the NUM. It would also be useful to arrange a separate meeting between the Miners&apos; Group and theMinisters concerned to discuss the action being taken by way of regional policies to alleviate the effects of colliery closures on the
worst hit areas. The Chief Whip should discuss these possibilitieswith the leader of the Miners&apos; Group and should make arrangementsaccordingly.The Cabinet Invited the Chief Whip, after discussion with the chairman and secretary of the Miners&apos; Group, to make arrangementsfor meetings with Ministers as indicated in the PrimeMinisters summing up.EconomicSituationDevaluation(previous reference:CC (67) 66thConclusions)DefenceExpenditureSECRET*4. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 182) to which was attached an extract from theConclusions of the Cabinet meeting of Thursday, 16th November,1967, relating to the devaluation of sterling.The Prime Minister said that the devaluation, considered as an operation, had gone very well: the fears that too many other currencies might follow our change of rate had not in the event been realised: only a few countries had devalued, and in some of thesecases, where the countries were important food suppliers, the devaluation was welcome. Throughout the operation our relationswith all the Governments with whom we had had to make contacthad been excellent, and the reports of their reactions had shown a strikingly standard pattern of approval for our holding the oldrate as long as we could, for our consultation with them about thechange when that could no longer be avoided, and for our choice of the new fixed rate. It was now necessary for the Cabinet toconsider further the measures to be taken consequentially upondevaluation in certain areas of public expenditure which had been referred to only in general terms in the public statements already made.  It might be convenient to start with defence economies.The Secretary of State for Defence said that he was proposing to save a total of some  110 million of the estimated expenditure for 1968-69. Of this, some  60 million was accounted for by a wide range of small savings which had already been under discussionbefore the decision to devalue. The further  50 million of savingshad therefore had to be concentrated upon cuts in our defencecapability, some of which were quite severe and would involve asubstantial reduction in our capability for operations outside europe during the next five years. In all the circumstances, itwas right to incur the risks involved, but it should be made clearthat those risks were there. The broad pattern of the saving hadbeen that each of the Armed Services should sacrifice a major item of re-equipment. Thus the Royal Navy would not now receive thelast eight of the Buccaneer aircraft they were due to get, and theaircraft carrier HMS Victorious would probably not now be put back into service, though a final decision on this should await a report on
CC67(67)the extent of the damage caused by the fire which had taken placerecently towards the end of her refit. Other possibilities which were under consideration were that the Royal Air Force would not nowreceive two VC-10 aircraft, which it was hoped to sell eitheroverseas or at least to domestic airlines, and would not receive theChinook heavy-lift helicopters, a loss in which the Army was alsointerested; and that the Army would not now receive the M-II newbridging equipment; some at least of the new Chieftain tanks theywere due to receive would not be taken and would instead be soldabroad if, as was thought likely, suitable buyers were available; andthe disbandment of two battalions would be advanced from nextyear to this year. Finally, it had been decided not to go ahead withthe staging post on Aldabra. All these cuts would bring biggersavings in the years after 1968-69. In addition, there would be in anumber of areas a slowing down of re-equipment and of new building, and a running down of stocks. All these cuts, totalling 110 million in 1968-69, would bring in that year a direct foreign exchange saving of some  15 million. The cuts would be veryunwelcome to the Services, but they had been allocated in such away as to reduce to a minimum their impact on morale and efficiency.He had now been able to consult Mr. McNamara, the United states secretary of State for Defense, about the cuts. Mr. McNamarahad received them, including the decision on Aldabra, in a veryunderstanding spirit, and indeed with praise for the way the devaluation had been handled. So much so, that the consultationhad extended to a consideration of further sales by the UnitedKingdom under the Offset Agreement with the United States; andit might now be possible to make a further Offset Agreement whichwould provide for further sales by the United Kingdom up to themaximum agreed under the collaborative arrangements. It wasnot yet possible to decide how many of these cuts could be announced at an early date, because the timing of the announcementof the cuts could affect the terminal and cancellation charges, andthis position was under urgent examination. In so far as examples of the cuts had to be given in the forthcoming debate, the best course would be to announce one major economy in respect of each service.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the proposals for economies in defence expenditureput forward by the Defence Secretary in his statement.Civil The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that civil expenditurePublicExpenditure was proving the most difficult area of public expenditure in which to make economies. In addition to the cuts in defence expenditurejust agreed, a considerable measure of agreement appeared to havebeen reached on cuts in the investment programmes of nationalised industries between the Departments and the Chairmen of thePublic Boards concerned. Economies in civil public expenditurerepresented the smallest part of the package of accompanyingmeasures.  But it was the most troublesome, because even a small
saving was difficult to achieve in an area where a very substantial proportion of the expenditure was on items Of such social importance that the Cabinet had decided to safeguard them, e.g., in the localauthority field, where substantial reductions had been envisaged,about half the expenditure was on education; or where reductionswere hardly practicable or very difficult to achieve, e.g., about halfthe expenditure in the local authority field was in salaries and afurther quarter in interest charges. It appeared that the proposalto save some  30 million by holding the Rate Support Grant at itspresent level would not in fact be practicable, and it had beendecided that so significant a proposal as postponing the raising ofthe school-leaving age for four years would need much moreconsideration. There were therefore at present no concreteproposals for adequate economies in civil public expenditure. Thiswas particularly unfortunate in the light of the stress laid on sucheconomies in financial circles at home and abroad, and in view ofthe burdens which were going to be imposed on the public throughhigher prices, on public and private industry and on the defence services.The Prime Minister recalled that the Cabinet had decided attheir meeting on 16th November that there should be economies in public expenditure either through the stabilisation of the rate support Grant, or if that were not practicable, through someequivalent saving in the local authority field. It was quite clear thatin the new circumstances many local authorities, partly for political reasons, were going to cut their expenditure, and it would be unrealistic to assume that there would not be some saving in this field. The best course might be therefore for the Cabinet to decide that economies of some  50 million in local authority spending shouldbe achieved and announced, and that the Chancellor of theExchequer with the Minister of Housing and Local Government andthe other Ministers concerned should concert together the precisemeans by which this might best be done.In discussion it was confirmed that the Rate Support Grantdid not present a practicable means of making economies thesupport obligations were statutory, and the Order implementingthem to the end of 1968-69 was due to be signed immediately. Inany event the necessary saving in real resources could not beachieved in that way. It was therefore essential to seek other means of making the economies in civil public expenditure; andthe need for a cut in local authority expenditure was incontestable,for a number of reasons. Moreover there was clearly scope forsuch economies both in respect of less essential capital projects,such as city centre development and office building which couldwell be deferred, and in local authority current expenditure on the salaries of the higher grades, on travel, entertainment, and other less essential items. It would however be necessary to avoidanything that might be represented as panic cuts; and items of greatsocial importance such a slum clearance and the main local authoritysocial services should be exempted from the economies proposed.It was also recalled that in the Cabinefs review in July 1967 of
public expenditure to 1970, a cut of some  25 million in miscellaneousheads of expenditure including local authority environmental services had been agreed in principle, and the details remitted for furtherconsideration; but no economies had yet been secured and meanwhile the planned expenditure under these heads had increasedby over  50 million.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were agreed that it was essential that the package of measures accompanying devaluation should includeeconomies in civil public expenditure, mainly in the local authorityfield, of some  50 million. The Ministers principally concerned should consider how economies of this size could best be achievedhaving regard to the. need to avoid cuts in items of major socialsignificance. The Cabinet should give early consideration to measures in the social security field to protect the most vulnerablesections of the community, and to the question of postponing the raising of the school-leaving age.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to include in his announcement of the domestic measures accompanyingdevaluation provision for economies in civil public expenditure, mainly in the local authority field, of some 50 million in 1968-69, and in consultation with theMinister of Housing and Local Government and the other ministers principally concerned, to consider howeconomies of this scale could best be achieved, havingregard to the need to avoid cuts in expenditure on items of major social significance.(3) Agreed (i) To   consider   at   their   meeting   on   Thursday,23rd November, means of protecting the most vulnerable sections of the community againstrising prices.(ii) To consider at an early meeting the desirability of postponing the raising of the school-leaving age.Nationalised The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, from discussion^ with the Ministers concerned, proposals had emerged for reductions in the investment programmes of the nationalised industriesamounting to some  75 million in 1968-69 and  90 million in1969-70.  The proposed reductions were as follows:    million1968-69    1969-70Electricity (England and Wales)Reduction in electricity supply industry&apos;scapital investment programme in real terms: details still to be worked out butdeferment of one power station due to start in 1968-69 would be involved   ...      17 20

t^ltlll^ SECRET     S^S^S^SlftSS        HCC 67 (67)to these totals and to the announcement of the overall savings to besecured. It would, however, be necessary to reach firm decisions on the specific reductions during the following week since therewould be Parliamentary pressure for this information.In discussion the following points were made (a) The NCB would like to secure savings mainly by abandoningsome of their less profitable subsidiary activities. This might createproblems since some of these activities were located in development areas, though in so far as they were in the areas particularly affected by colliery closures they might be eligible for the special assistance which the Government was planning for those areas.There should be further discussion with the NCB designed tosecure the full saving of  7 million, if possible, in 1968-69, withoutdamage to the interests of the development areas. It would,however, be wise for purposes of a Government announcementduring the next two days of the total saving in this field to takecredit for savings by the NCB by only some  4 million in 1968-69.(b) The NCB were doubtful about the wisdom of abandoningtheir investment at Immingham Dock since they felt that following devaluation there would be greater possibilities of handling exportsthere. This, however, was insufficient ground for continuing the project, though it might be necessary to reconsider the matter ata later stage.(c) There was some danger that the steel firms which had beennationalised would exert pressure on the British Steel corporation for an unduly large investment programme, but the Chairman of theCorporation was well aware of this risk.(d) While it should be possible to obtain the proposed reductionin the investment programme of the sea, it should be left to theAuthority, in consultation with the Ministry of Technology, todecide how this should be achieved.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that, subject to the views of the Postmaster-general on reductions in the Post Office programme, reductions in the investment programmes of the nationalised industries should be made, broadly on the lines proposedby the Chancellor of the Exchequer, totalling  70- 75million in 1968-69, and that the amount of the total reduction should be announced during the forthcoming debate in Parliament.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to pursuediscussions with the Ministers concerned with a view to reaching firm decisions as soon as possible on the specificreductions to be made.General The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that representatives ofthe International Monetary Fund (IMF) were still discussing withthe Treasury the package of measures to restrain demand which
the Government proposed. Their enquiries had been searching, andthey were taking the line in general that the package was too smalland that its emphasis was misdirected. In their view, theGovernment should do more (though not necessarily immediately)to restrain consumption by reductions in the social services, therebyavoiding the need for additional taxation. The IMF wouldprobably accept the Governments proposals because of broaderconsiderations affecting the international monetary situation;nevertheless, their views were worthy of respect and the cabinet should weigh them carefully.In discussion there was support for the view that further actionto increase taxes or to reduce public expenditure would be needed in the next Budget, and that there would be advantage in announcing now that this was likely. In considering the measureswhich should be taken it was necessary to distinguish between on theone hand the action needed to effect a shift of resources into exports and import saving in order to reap the benefits of devaluation, andon the other hand action to restrain demand which might become necessary at a later stage in order to contain inflationary pressuresas the industries making exports or import substitutes began to expand. For the first of these purposes, the package of measuresso far agreed was probably adequate, but further action might wellbe needed in the next Budget to contain inflationary pressures. Itwas suggested that it would be useful if a small group of ministers were invited to study future strategy for public expenditure andtaxation and to evaluate these matters more systematically than had been possible in the discussions in the context of devaluation.Serious consideration should be given to tax measures which would afford some relief to the higher levels of earned income, since thedisincentive effect of taxation at these levels had a crucial bearing on the productive efficiency of the economy and on the loss of highly trained manpower overseas, especially as devaluation would increase the incentive to emigrate. Some tax relief for the higherbrackets of earned income might be coupled with increased taxation of the higher levels of unearned income. On the other hand it was argued that, whilst it might be highly desirable to reduce direct taxation in this way, it would be impossible to give any relief tothe higher income groups as long as the very large numbers ofworkers on the lowest wages levels were still subject to direct taxation. To give any tax relief to the latter however would onlybe feasible if there were either offsetting increases in indirect taxation (which was much higher on the Continent) or alternativelyoffsetting reductions in public expenditure, on a scale which couldonly be achieved if the Government were prepared to face up to reductions in the major social programmes such as health, education and housing.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said it was clear that further measures to increase taxes or toreduce public expenditure, or both, might be needed in the nextBudget, and that a suitable reference should be made to this in theforthcoming debate, but only in general terms, and distinguishing
between action consequent on devaluation and later measures to contain inflation. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would wish totake full account of the points made in discussion in consideringfuture policy on taxation and public expenditure.The Cabinet (6) Invited Ministers to be guided by the Prime minister&apos;s summing up in their interventions in the forthcoming debate in Parliament.(7) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account ofthe points made in discussion in considering future policy on taxation and public expenditure.NationalisedIndustriesBritishRailwaysBoardSalaries(previous reference:CC (67) 62ndConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister ofTransport (C (67) 179 and 183) and the Chief Secretary, Treasury(C (67) 181) about the salaries to be paid to the Chairman and members of the British Railways Board (BRB).The Minister of Transport said that it was necessary toreconstitute the BRB because of the impending resignation of thepresent Chairman and a number of retirements already agreed upon.Mr. Peter Parker was in principle ready to accept the chairmanship,but not at the present salary of  12,500 because this would leaveinsufficient room for the salaries which he thought it essential topay to the members of the Board and their senior officers, and inparticular to the occupant of the new post of Deputy chairman and Chief Executive which had been recommended by the JointSteering Group. Mr. Parker had himself been offered a salary of 15,000 as an ordinary full-time member of the Board of the steel corporation and he considered it vitally important that the new members of the Railways Board should be paid salaries sufficientto attract men of the right calibre. His own initial view, therefore,was that the Chairman&apos;s salary should be  20,000 and the newDeputy Chairman&apos;s  17,500. Soundings taken of other potentialchairmen and advice received from management consultantsindicated that it would probably be necessary to pay  15,000 for board members and that  20,000 for the Chairman would beconsidered appropriate.It had not been possible for the Cabinet to consider the matter at their previous meeting, but a small group of Ministers had met and had invited her to see Mr. Parker again and attempt to persuade him to accept the &quot; tariff&quot; salary of  12,500 with the assurance that his salary and that of the Deputy Chairman wouldbe reviewed. She had seen Mr. Parker and had subsequentlytaken him to see the Prime Minister, who had persuaded him todiscuss the matter further with her after the week-end. On Mondayshe had discussed the situation with Mr. Parker and withMr. Johnson, the prospective Deputy Chairman and Chief Executive,
in the light of the devaluation of the pound. Mr. Parker, whileappreciating the Governments position, had adhered to the viewthat if he was to make a success of the reorganisation of therailways it was essential to create the right conditions for efficient management by paying realistic salaries. He pressed the point that,whereas the working railwaymen and middle management hadreceived increased rewards for increased effort, the top managementhad not. He had offered to accept a 12% per cent rebate himself on a salary of  17,500, but had insisted that Mr. Johnson shouldbe offered  15,000. This would not be an increased salary for thesame job, since Mr. Johnson was to occupy a newly created postwith much greater responsibility.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would not be rightat present to pay the Chairman and Deputy Chairman of the BRBmore than the normal &quot;tariff&quot; rate of  12,500, and  10,000respectively. The higher salaries approved for members of theBritish Steel Corporation were not a parallel because there it hadbeen necessary to secure the services of men already earning highersalaries in the industry. The right course, therefore, was to pay thecurrent tariff rates, but to consider these salaries in the context ofthe review of the salaries of members of Boards in the nationalised industries generally.In discussion it was suggested that it was as important to provide adequate incentives for higher salary earners in the public sectoras in the private. The reduction in the salary of the Chairman ofthe Atomic Energy Authority when a new Chairman was appointedhad had a harmful effect throughout the industry, and might well have given some encouragement to senior scientists to contemplateemigration. It might be possible to avoid repercussions on other nationalised industries by fixing the salary for the new post of chief executive of the BRB ad hoc and not relating it to the existingtariff; and the Finance Director who would be required shortlymight possibly be obtained from the private sector on loan. It waspointed out, however, that any expedient which involved payinghigher salaries to secure members of the BRB or their staff, whetherfixed ad hoc or not, would involve a breach of the prices and incomes policy and severely aggravate the task, which was more important than ever in the light of devaluation, of persuading the trade unions to accept restraint on incomes. The problem was partly one of timing. It was particularly difficult to increase BRB salaries in theimmediate aftermath of devaluation and it was important that theyshould be considered in the context of those of the nationalised industries generally.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that, whilethe Cabinet appreciated the difficulty in which the Minister ofTransport found herself because of the immediate need to find anew Chairman of the BRB, they could not agree to the paymentof the salaries which she proposed for the Chairman and deputy chairman. The salaries should be held at their present level pendingthe consideration of the review of the salaries of the nationalised
Boards which should be brought before the Cabinet as soon as itcould be completed. In the meantime the Minister of transport should inform Mr. Parker that she could not offer him any increase on the current salary; and she should consider another candidate for the chairmanship who had been brought to his notice and who might be found no less suitable for the post.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the salaries of the Chairman and deputy chairman of the British Railways Board should be heldat their present rates pending the review of the salaries of members of the Boards of nationalised industries.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to inform Mr. Parker thatshe could not offer more than the current salaries for himself or the Deputy Chairman.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would transmit to theMinister of Transport for consideration the name of analternative candidate for the chairmanship of the british railways Board.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to bring before theCabinet the result of the review of the salaries of membersof the Boards of nationalised industries as soon as it was completed.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21st November, 1967.
