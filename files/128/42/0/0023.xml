CC 23 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week. Parliament would risefor the Whitsun adjournment on Friday, 12th May, until Wednesday,31st May.secret. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of an unprecedented situation which had arisen in connection with a bookabout the Suez episode which Mr. Anthony Nutting proposed to publish and to serialise in The Times, in the near future. Mr. Nutting,who was a Privy Counsellor, had been a junior Minister in theConservative Government of 1956 but had resigned as a result of thecircumstances in which that Government had intervened in the dispute between Israel and the United Arab Republic. His forthcoming bookwould purport to disclose the discussions of policy within theGovernment Of the time and various exchanges between its members.It was customary to grant reasonable latitude to Ministers wishing to publish their memoirs; but their right of access to documents which they had seen while in office was dependent on their submittingtheir texts for clearance before publication, a stipulation which wasnormally observed. Mr. Nutting had not sought access to documents and claimed to have based his book solely on his recollections andon the notes which he had made during the period in question. Buthe had been warned in ample time that he would still be expectedto submit his manuscript for clearance before signing a contract for publication. Nevertheless, he had disregarded this warning andhad already entered into a contractual commitment when he submitted a proof copy of the book. It had shown a completedisregard of the normal conventions of collective ministerial responsibility; and although, in response to representations, he had made certain amendments in the text, there was little doubt that, whenpublished, it would still constitute a serious breach of the establishedprinciples. He had now been informed that, fn these circumstances,both the Government and the Opposition would reserve their rightto make it clear that they did not accept the reasons by which he had sought to justify the publication of the book at this time.Publication would undoubtedly renew the long-standingcontroversy about the Suez episode; and it might well be necessaryto provide some Parliamentary occasion for pursuing this matter onparty lines. But the breach of principle was a separate issue which any Government, whatever its party complexion, must be bound to regard very seriously, since the necessary trust and confidence betweencolleagues would be gravely undermined if it came to be accepted that a Minister could disclose, after resigning, what had passed between other Ministers and himself and to disregard for this purpose the principles of the Fifty-year Rule (soon to be replaced by the thirty-year Rule). It must be accepted that the sanctions which couldbe invoked against an offence of this kind were limited unless the
circumstances were so extreme as to make it clearly appropriate to institute proceedings under the Official Secrets Acts. It must also beaccepted that Ministers should not be prevented from continuing to enjoy the privilege of publishing, within reasonable limits, accounts of their periods of office. On the other hand, it was clearly necessaryto make a fresh effort to re-establish the conventions which should govern disclosures of this kind; and the Committee on MinisterialPublications should give urgent attention to this matter.The Cabinet Agreed that the issue of principle which would be raised bythe forthcoming publication of a book by Mr. AnthonyNutting on the Suez episode should be further consideredby the Committee on Ministerial Publications.Oversea AffairsDefenceExpenditureStudies(previous reference:CC(67) 19thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that although the consultationshe had initiated, during the recent meeting of the Council of theSouth-East Asia Treaty Organisation (SEATO) in Washington, withthe United States, Australia and New Zealand about the proposed changes in our policy in the Far East had proved somewhat lessdifficult than he had expected, there had been strong opposition on thepart of all concerned to our plan to announce that we intended towithdraw from the mainland of Asia (apart from Hong Kong) bythe middle 1970s. Opposition to our plans for the area generally hadstiffened following consultations between our three allies, particularlybecause of the attitude of the Australians. Although there had been general acceptance of our plans to reduce our forces in Malaysia and singapore by half by 1970-71, the Americans had stressed theproblems which they would face in the Senate over their foreign policyif we were to announce now our intention to withdraw altogether from singapore/Malaysia. They had made it plain that there could beno question of their being willing to take over any responsibilities inthe area that we might give up. In discussion with the Americans hehad been able to point to their intention not to maintain forces orbases on the mainland of Asia after the Vietnam war was over. Hehad spoken throughout strictly within the bounds of the cabinets decision on these issues: but this task had been made much moredifficult by the fact that he had thus been unable to say that we would maintain small maritime and air forces using facilities in Australiaafter we had withdrawn from Singapore and Malaysia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the Australian and NewZealand Governments were now taking a calmer view of our intentions in the Far East than at the time of the SEATO Council meeting.Initially they had formed the impression that we had already takenfinal decisions but it had been made plain to them that, althoughthe plans already put forward were likely to be carried through, therewould be opportunity for real consultations with them before decisions were taken in June /July.
South-East Tne Foreign Secretary said that the SEATO Council meetingOrgardsadon m Washington during the previous week had been dominated byCouncil Meeting representatives of the countries providing troops for the Vietnam warand these had attacked ourselves and other signatories of the SEATOTreaty for not doing so. There was no obligation on us under theTreaty to provide troops for Vietnam and he had strongly maintainedthe view that the most valuable contribution that we could make layin continuing our diplomatic efforts to stop the fighting. The first draft of the communique of the conference had been belligerent intone but he had succeeded in obtaining agreement to substantialamendments which made it acceptable to us.Vietnam(previous reference:CC(67) 15thConclusions,Minute 2)Greece(previous reference:CC(65) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed the situationin Vietnam at length with several members of the United states administration, including the President, during his visit to washington the previous week. It had been suggested that we might consider a fresh initiative in seeking a settlement as co-Chairmen withthe Soviet Union of the Geneva Conference; if such diplomaticactivity were taking place it would be easier for the United states administration to resist internal pressures to increase the intensity of the fighting in Vietnam. A further direct approach to the SovietGovernment on Vietnam at this stage would raise difficulties forthem in view of the recent failure in Vietnam to extend the cabinet truce,but it might be possible to approach the problem indirectly through a meeting of the Geneva Conference on the associated problem ofLaos. There was as yet no firm information about the alleged damagethrough American bombing to the British cargo ship Dartford inHaiphong Harbour, and our Consul-General had so far been unableto obtain permission from the North Vietnamese Government to investigate the incident. Although the ship was technically British, ithad a Chinese crew, apart possibly from two officers, was undercharter to the Government of the People&apos;s Republic of China and waspart of the fleet which they were using to supply Vietnam.The Foreign Secretary said that it was now clear that the group of middle ranking Service officers who had succeeded in taking overpower in Greece had done so with the support of the Greek armed forces as a whole. King Constantine had not been a party to therevolt and had shown great courage in his dealings with its leaders;he had succeeded in imposing a civilian Prime Minister on them andhad expressed the hope that there would soon be a return to parliamentary government. We had co-ordinated our action duringthe crisis with that of the Governments of the United States and turkey and were continuing to do so. A letter had been receivedfrom the Foreign Minister of the new Greek Government: we must decide whether or not to reply to this. To refuse to have dealings with the new Greek Government would mean breaking off diplomatic relations with Greece and we could avoid any question of recognitionof the new regime, or of approval for it, if we took the line that wewere merely continuing relations with a Government whose Head ofState was unchanged. He proposed therefore to authorise anacknowledgment of the letter from the Greek Foreign Minister.
In discussion it was argued that a distinction must be drawn between our having continuing relations with the new GreekGovernment, which had overthrown parliamentary government, andany action which could be construed as signifying approval; the factthat King Constantine had indicated his acceptance of the new government by presiding over a meeting was not relevant to thispoint. On the other hand it was our normal practice to havediplomatic relations with Governments which were effectively in power whether or not we approved of them. The fact that in this instance King Constantine, to whom our Ambassador was accredited,remained on the throne meant that no new act of recognition was involved but merely a continuance of existing relations. The situationin Sierra Leone was in many respects a parallel, in that a militarycoup had overthrown the previous parliamentary government but the queen continued to be recognised as Head of State.It was not yet clear whether recent events in Greece would have repercussions in Cyprus. It was not thought that General Grivaswas in any way involved, but the existence in the island of largequantities of Czech arms which might be issued to Greek Cypriottroops and police posed a problem. The Foreign Secretary was intouch with the Secretary-General of the United Nations with a viewto ensuring the closest possible control of these arms by the united nations troops in Cyprus in the period immediately ahead.The Foreign Secretary said that he had had a very lengthy and difficult meeting on 16th April with members of the United NationsMission to South Arabia. He had eventually succeeded in agreeingwith them a joint statement covering the situation in South arabia and the part which the United Nations might play in finding a solutionthere. It had been essential to do this as a basis on which we couldreply to any report which the Mission might make to the united nations, since this was likely to be hostile to us. The situation in aden had been relatively quiet since the Mission had left and theMinister without Portfolio (Lord Shackleton) would be returning that day for discussions with him. He would report further to the Cabinetin the following week on our plans for South Arabia.The Prime Minister said that during his visit to Bonn earlier that week for the funeral of the former Federal German Chancellor,Dr. Adenauer, he had met a large number of Heads of Government,including those of the United States and members of the european economic Community and the European Free Trade Association.He had also met the South African Foreign Minister, Dr. Muller, andhad discussed the Rhodesian situation with him. The hope of theSouth African Government appeared to be that a peaceful settlementof the Rhodesian problem would be reached and they did not appearto be willing to sustain the illegal regime. The Cabinet should consider a report on the current situation in Rhodesia in the nearfuture.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, as a result of actionsby the Government of the Eastern Region of Nigeria the situation inthe country was extremely tense and hostilities might break out therein the near future.
SECRET 7     1CC 23 (67)The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister^ foreign secretary and Commonwealth SecretaryApproach toEuropeProcedure(previous reference:CC(67) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. (i) The Prime Minister said that the most convenientprocedure might be for the Cabinet to take the items of their agendaconcerning the approach to Europe in the following order: first, thememorandum by the Law Officers on the Legal and ConstitutionalImplications of United Kingdom Membership of the european economic Community (e.c.) (C (67) 62); then the note by theSecretary of the Cabinet covering a further report by officials on the implications of Membership of the e.c. for Mobility of Labour and immigration Policy (C (67) 58); the two memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Affairs, i.e., the Value of theCommonwealth (C (67) 59) and Commonwealth Interests in our approach to Europe (C (67) 63), and the note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet on the Effect of Entry into the e.c. on the UnitedKingdom Balance of Payments (C (67) 61). Before doing so, however,the Cabinet would wish to be informed of the developments whichhad taken place in the last few days in regard to consultations withthe European Free Trade Association (EFTA) and also to consider further the arrangements which might be made for the issue ofinformation for Parliament and public discussion concerning the approach to Europe.As regards consultation with EFTA, at their meeting on18th April (CC (67) 21st Conclusions, Minute 3, Conclusions (5), (6)and (7)) the Cabinet had approved the proposals put forward in amemorandum by officials attached to C (67) 54, subject to consideration of supplementary proposals for Ministerial visits toEFTA and Commonwealth capitals, whereby we should first seek to persuade our EFTA partners that the consultations to which wewere committed could best be carried out by means of bilateralcontacts through the diplomatic channel; but if this course wereunacceptable to them we should agree to hold an early meeting withthem, on a purely hypothetical basis, before a decision on the approach to Europe had been taken by the Cabinet, at which EFTAGovernments should be asked for their reactions to the various possible courses before us. In the event, Sweden and Switzerland had insisted on an early meeting and other EFTA members had been unwilling to oppose them, so that it had been necessary to agree tothe second course, as had been envisaged by the Cabinet, and toarrange urgently a meeting of the EFTA Ministerial Council. only two dates had been available before the Recess the EFTA countriesthemselves would not be content with a date after the Recess anda meeting of the EFTA Ministerial Council had accordingly beenarranged on the first of these, i.e., Friday, 28th April in London.During his visit to Bonn he had had the opportunity to speak to the heads of all the EFTA Governments except those of Portugal and
Material forParliamentaryand public discussion(previous reference:CC (67) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement on thearrangements made for consultation with EFTA on the approach to Europe.(ii) The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would wish toconsider the measures in hand for providing material for parliamentary and public discussion of the approach to Europe. Inaccordance with the conclusions of their meeting on 20th April(CC (67) 22nd Conclusions, Minute 2 (ii)) a White Paper of some five or six pages was being prepared. If the Government were to decide to make an early application for entry to the e.c. the White paper would have to inform the public of the reasons for the decision andof its main effects. Whilst setting out the difficulties which such adecision would involve, it would be essential to avoid weakening ourposition in any subsequent negotiations or giving any impression thatthe Government were half-hearted in their decision. Enquiries had shown that there would not be time to prepare and print a comprehensive White Paper of considerable size containing all theinformation which should be given to Parliament and the public;and it would therefore be desirable to supplement the shorter white paper by a series of documents which might include the bookletprepared by the Department of Economic Affairs, setting out theessential information about the e.c. together with parallelinformation about the United Kingdom. A revised text of this document had now been circulated to Departments. This could befollowed by more specialised documents based on the material whichthe Cabinet had had before them, notably the material which hadbeen submitted to the Select Committee on the agriculturalimplications of entry and the report by officials which the LordChancellor had presented to the Cabinet on the legal and constitutional implications (E (66) 7).Finland, and in particular with the Prime Minister of Sweden, and wecould hope that the meeting would not present too many difficulties,But at the present stage of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion of the approach to Europe, it would be preferable that individual Ministerial contacts with EFTA representatives should be avoided and that the conduct ofthe discussions should be left to the Foreign Secretary in the light ofthe Cabinefs views.In discussion it was questioned whether it had been necessary tocall an EFTA Ministerial meeting at such short notice.   Theannouncement of the EFTA meeting, together with that of the cabinet&apos;s forthcoming discussions at Chequers, had stimulated Pressspeculation, which it would have been desirable to avoid, as to thenature and timing of the Cabinefs decision on the approach to europe. On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was important from the point of view of our EFTA partners to hold the meetingbefore the discussions which the Cabinet had agreed to hold at chequers on the week-end of 29th/30th April and that oursummoning of the meeting had been welcomed by our EFTApartners. The course of events had in fact left little alternative.1
In discussion it was urged that it was essential for Parliament tohave full information about the implications of a decision to apply for early negotiations for entry before they debated that decision.Much factual information had been before the Cabinet and it wouldbe unfortunate if the impression were created that such information could not be made available to Parliament and the public. On theother hand it was pointed out that, while the announcement toParliament of the decision of the previous Administration in 1961to apply for entry to the e.c. had been followed by a two-day debate,no White Paper had been issued on the occasion of the announcementor of the debate, but only some considerable time afterwards. Itwould not be practicable to prepare and print comprehensive accounts of the implications of entry in a number of specialised fields in timefor a decision and debate before the Recess, though certaindocuments, notably those on agricultural and legal and constitutionaleffects of entry, might be produced reasonably soon thereafter. Itmight be best to consider the subjects which might be treated in thisway during the course of the Cabinet discussions on those subjects,since difficulties of presentation would arise in particularly sensitiveareas, e.g., reference to the possibilities of secession from theCommunity, political and social problems of immigration policy andthe wide powers of Community institutions.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the material on which effective Parliament debates might be basedneed not be provided only through the medium of a White paper or Papers. It was customary that much of the material should beset out in the opening speeches; and with a decision of the importanceof that under consideration, it would be proper for him in openingsuch a debate to make a comprehensive statement of considerablelength. Nevertheless it might prove to be desirable to attach to the short White Paper to which he had referred in his statement briefannexes dealing with those subjects for which sufficient material couldbe assembled and presented in the time available. It would be forconsideration in the light of the relevant papers now before theCabinet whether these should include, as well as a brief annex onthe legal and constitutional aspects of entry based on thememorandum by the Law Officers, pending consideration of the lord chancellor&apos;s fuller report for publication later, the information on agricultural problems based on that submitted to the SelectCommittee on Agriculture and the material before the Cabinet onthe effects of entry in the field of mobility of labour. It would benecessary to exercise particular care in dealing with sensitive itemssuch as those referred to in discussion.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to circulate for their consideration the draft booklet on the functioning of the eec which had been prepared by his Department.

(iii) The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Law Officers(C (67) 62) on the legal and constitutional implications of United-Legal andConstitutionalImplications ofUnited KingdomKingdom membership of the e.c..Membership ofthe european community(previous reference:CC(67) 21stConclusions,Minute 3)The A attorney General said that the Law Officers had been invited by the Cabinet to consider the report by officials attached to E (66) 7.The preparation and passing of the Acts implementing the Treatiesin respect of joining the Community would be a major legislativeoperation and there would be need to amend a considerable body ofour existing Acts and to incorporate in the law of the UnitedKingdom categories of Community law which had direct internaleffect. But these problems could be overcome.British constitutional doctrine was that Parliament was sovereignand that no Parliament could preclude its successors from changing the law. Acceptance of the Treaties implied not only the acceptanceof existing Community law, but also that we would refrain fromenacting future legislation inconsistent with Community law. while this requirement detracted from Parliamentary sovereignty, such arestraint would not in principle be unprecedented in that ourlegislation often took account of treaty obligations. The continuingincidence of future Community legislation would however be without precedent and would present us with continuing legislative and constitutional problems in that future Community law would have tobe accepted as binding on us. There was, however, in theory no constitutional means by which we could be certain that no futureParliament would enact legislation in conflict with Community law; ifit did so, it was the opinion of the Law Officers that the courts would apply that legislation despite its repugnance to Community lawHowever, they took the view that this theoretical possibility could inpractice arise on a matter of importance affecting the Community onlyin political conditions in which the United Kingdom, after becoming a member, had decided to break with the Community. The risk ofinadvertent contradiction between future United Kingdom and community law was not great: if we joined the Community we shouldbe taking part in the preparation and enactment of all futureCommunity law.Community law had little direct effect on the ordinary life ofprivate citizens, their rights and obligations and by far the greaterpart of our domestic law would remain unchanged. The main impact of Community law would be in the realm of trade, customs, restrictive practices and immigration. It was important that there should be aright of appeal to the European Court from Community decisions affecting individuals and corporate bodies. The Law Officersconsidered that the various powers of the Commission to authorise itsinspectors to enter premises, inspect books and interrogate persons,were acceptable provided that such powers were not normallyexercised in this country without an order made by a United Kingdomcourt.As regards our international relations, the requirements underthe Treaties would restrict our independence of action in future international dealings, but this was an inevitable and acceptableconsequence of accession. As a matter of international law we would
have no right to withdraw from the Treaties unless there were a fundamental change in circumstances. However, the Law Officersregarded this as somewhat academic: if for any reason the UnitedKingdom decided to withdraw and an Act of Parliament were passedfor this purpose, they found it difficult to imagine that UnitedKingdom courts would not give effect to it.In discussion it was noted that the views of the Law Officersconfirmed those expressed in the report by officials on these issues which had previously been considered by the Cabinet. It wassuggested that, if the Government were later to decide sto apply tojoin the Community, it would be desirable that the documents whichshould then be published should include one on the legal and constitutional implications. The paper by the Law Officers should form the basis of a brief annex to the short White Paper. The fullerlegal report circulated under cover of E (66) 7 should also be reviewedas a matter of urgency to consider the extent to which it wouldrequire amendment for later publication. It was suggested that sincethe report had been written the previous year it might be necessaryto make enquiries of the e.c. on Community legislation which hadbeen passed meanwhile, in order to enable the report to be brought up to date. The Cabinet were, however, informed that the requisiteinformation was already available in Whitehall. The point was also made that if an amended report were published it would be necessaryto make plain that some of the theoretical legal consequences would,as a matter of political reality, be substantially modified in practice.Furthermore, it was questionable whether it would be appropriate torefer in a published document to the legal considerations arising if,theoretically, we should later wish to withdraw from the Community.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in consultation with the Attorney-General, to arrange for officials(i) to prepare the draft of a brief annex to a White Paper,based on C (67) 62 and(ii) to revise the report by officials attached to E (66) 7,in the light of C (67) 62 and of the points made in discussion, with a view to its later publication,(iv) The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 58) to which was attached a report by officials insupplementation of C (67) 48, on the implications of United Kingdomentry into Europe for the mobility of labour and for United Kingdomimmigration policy.The Home Secretary said that officials had taken the view that,given the differing considerations which arose in respect of eachof the member countries of the e.c., it would be most useful toexamine the experience of Belgium under the provisions of the Treatyof Rome covering free movement of labour. The Belgian Governmentwere more liberal than other members of the e.c. in permitting free movement of labour and their experience suggested, even taking intoaccount the likelihood that the Community as a whole would move
towards the abolition of restrictions on labour movements, that the implications for the United Kingdom did not give cause for realconcern. Nor did it appear that we should be faced with particularly difficult problems in respect of the machinery for the control of immigration or of our right of deportation, while it should also bepossible to make adequate arrangements to deal with the moreextended right which the United Kingdom legislation gave to supplementary benefit as compared with the right to similar benefits in the countries of the e.c.. The major difficulty would be thepolitical problems arising from our policy on commonwealth immigration. On the assumption that we maintained present restrictions, we should, if we were to enter the Community, then bedifferentiating against Commonwealth citizens and in favour of EECnationals, who would then be allowed to come here freely for employment. There would be strong objection to any amendment ofour Commonwealth restrictions which would impose a differentiation between immigrants from the Old Commonwealth and those from theNew Commonwealth. There was good reason to expect that it wouldnot be necessary for us to introduce a system of national registration,but this aspect could if necessary be further pursued at the subsequent meeting of the Cabinet on the following Saturday.The Minister of Labour said that the e.c. was moving towardsthe abolition of restrictions on the movement of workers, but it was difficult to assess the implications of regulations which were at present only in draft and might subsequently be amended. They were alsomoving towards the establishment of equality of treatment of all EECnationals in respect of housing benefits and social insurance, as wellas in relation to work councils. It appeared that the member countries of the Community hoped to develop a system by which there wouldbe a link between all national employment exchanges in respect ofinformation on offers of employment.In discussion there was general agreement that the major difficultyin this sphere, if we were to enter the Community, v/ould arise inrespect of the implications for the Government^ policy on commonwealth immigration. There was ajso general agreement thatthere would be grave objection of principle to amending that policythrough the introduction of differentiation on grounds of colourbetween immigrants from different Commonwealth countries. It was,however, pointed out that our entry into the Community would not,in practice as opposed to theory, make any substantial change in thecontrol which we now imposed on immigrants from theCommonwealth on the one hand and from Europe on the other.Substantial numbers of workers from Europe came to this countryannually, but for the most part they did not settle here as didimmigrants from the Commonwealth. It seemed improbable thatour entry into the Community would effect any basic change in thispattern nor did it seem likely that the immigration of Europeanworkers in future would be on a scale which would cause any serious political or industrial difficulty. Indeed, to the extent that our economy was suffering from a shortage of labour in the longer term,as the National Economic Plan had shown, the immigration of furtherworkers from Europe was to be welcomed on economic grounds.
In further discussion there was general agreement that therewould be advantage if, in the event of the Government deciding toapply to join the Community, the proposed White Paper, or white papers, were to include a section on the implications of entry forthe mobility of labour and for our immigration policy, based on the document before the Cabinet and on the previous study which theyhad considered at an earlier meeting.The Cabinet (5) Took note of C (67) 58.(6) Invited the Home Secretary and the Minister of Labour, inconsultation with the Commonwealth Secretary, to arrangefor officials to prepare, in the light of the discussion, adraft annex to a White Paper, based on C (67) 48 andC (67) 58, on the implications of entry into the e.c. forthe mobility of labour and for the United Kingdomimmigration policy.(v) The Cabinet considered memoranda by the commonwealth secretary on the value of the Commonwealth (C (67) 59) and on commonwealth interests if we were to enter the e.c. (C (67) 63).The Commonwealth Secretary said that his paper on the valueof the Commonwealth was not for substantive discussion in thepresent context, but rather to provide a general background for the cabinet&apos;s assessment of the importance to be attached to commonwealth interests if we were to seek to enter the e.c.. Therehad been major changes in the Commonwealth in recent years, andwe should make it clear that we were not prepared to sustain theCommonwealth whatever the cost to us might be. But theCommonwealth connection still had substantial material and politicalvalue for us and, if we were to join the Community, we should seek to minimise so far as possible the damage to Commonwealth interests,and so to our own interests in the Commonwealth, which might otherwise ensue. His second memorandum (C (67) 73) first set outthe probable effect on the Commonwealth if we were to enter the eec without safeguards. While there was no intention of doing so, this enabled us to see what measures must be taken to safeguard the Commonwealth interests. The memorandum then set out what other Commonwealth Governments were likely to ask us to secureon their behalf. It would not, in practice, be possible to obtain all their desiderata, but certain issues were of major importance both to the Commonwealth and to ourselves.New Zealand presented a series of problems which in total werethe most formidable arising from our Commonwealth connections.The effect of the common agricultural policy (c.a.p.) on their agricultural exports and in particular on their exports, of butter wouldbe catastrophic for New Zealand unless we were to secure majorderogations: transitional provisions would not suffice. We shouldalso bear in mind the importance of sustaining as far as possible theinterests of Australia and Canada and in particular the importance
which these countries attached to getting a satisfactory agreement on cereals in the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations. Such anagreement would substantially mitigate their opposition to our joining the e.c.. It was relevant to the consideration of the course which weshould follow to bear in mind the estimate of Mr. McEwen, the deputy Prime Minister of Australia, that, if we were to enter the eec, this course would eventually lead not only to the loss of australian exports to the United Kingdom of some  80 million ayear, but also a loss of United Kingdom exports to Australia of asmuch as  160 million a year; this estimate, though not entirelydisinterested, was of a significant order.The interests of the independent and dependent Asian and African Commonwealth countries varied widely and could best beconsidered in relation to specific commodities, in particular sugar,bananas, citrus, tobacco and coffee. It was important that we shouldprotect their interests in any negotiations with the e.c. and we must bear in mind that meanwhile our trade with them would inevitably be damaged, in that they would naturally seek to diversify their owntrade in order to safeguard themselves against the impact on it of our entry into the Community.The major commodity which would be affected in both developed and developing Commonwealth countries was sugar. TheCommonwealth Sugar Agreement was due to terminate in 1974. Weat present imported some 1,900,000 tons of sugar a year under theAgreement and, if we were to enter the e.c., there would no doubt be pressure upon us to substitute for this some part of the presentexportable surplus of sugar in the e.c. and their associated countries of some 400,000 tons a year. Quite apart from the effect of raisingsubstantially the price of sugar in the United Kingdom, we must bearin mind the crucial importance of the employment of labour on sugarproduction in the developing Commonwealth countries, not only fortheir economy, but also for their political and social stability. Finally,Commonwealth countries might seek to diversify their presentholdings of sterling, which in total amounted to some  2,000 million.In discussion it was urged that our entry into the community would inevitably weaken our links with other members of theCommonwealth, both economically and politically. Yet in majorrespects our interests were the same as those of other Commonwealthmembers: in particular it was to our interest to buy food from them as the cheapest world producers (so keeping down our cost of living)and in their interest to sell it to us. To take a step which would reduce our imports of Commonwealth foodstuffs and consequently lead other commonwealth countries to intensify their industrialisation, and hence the competition facing our own exports of manufactures, wouldbe in the interest neither of the rest of the Commonwealth nor in ourown. Moreover, entry into the Community would inevitably lead tothe disappearance of the preferences which we at present enjoyed in commonwealth markets. These covered some 50 per cent of ourpresent exports to Commonwealth markets, amounting to  1,000million a year, and in addition we must also bear in mind that ourpreferences in South Africa would also be at risk.   Admittedly, a
steady erosion was taking place of Commonwealth preferences, butthis had only affected a relatively small part of them and the abolitionof the Commonwealth preference system would have the most damaging effect on the total level of our exports. particular importance must also be attached to the value of the commonwealth sugar Agreement to the Commonwealth countries concerned.Moreover our present sugar system reconciled the interests of domestic as well as of Commonwealth producers and its disruptionmight have serious consequences for the United Kingdom productionof sugar also.On the other hand, it was argued that, while entry into theCommunity would admittedly cause some damage to our commonwealth preferences and the level of Commonwealth trade,other members of the Commonwealth were already diversifying their exports and increasing their industrialisation, with all its consequences for our own exports, as fast as possible; and our entry into theCommunity would therefore do no more than accelerate existingtrends. Nor was there cause for concern at the possibility that their reserves would no longer be kept in sterling: some diversification hadalready taken place, but as long as we maintained the strength ofthe United Kingdom economy, in accordance with the government&apos;s policy, it would remain in the interest of Commonwealth countries to keep substantial reserves in sterling, in view of the rate of interest which they earned thereby. In considering the interests of commonwealth countries we should bear in mind that, while NewZealand constituted a special case and certain problems arose inrespect of the developing countries, notably sugar, it would be broadly in the interests of the developing members of theCommonwealth that we should join the Community. This wouldenable us to encourage the pursuit of liberal Community policies inrespect of trade and aid with developing countries and freer access to the much larger European market would be of great benefit to the economies of the developing countries of the Commonwealth. in considering the interests of Australia and Canada, it was pertinentto bear in mind that not only had they a higher level of income per head than the United Kingdom, or any member of the e.c., but alsothat in recent years they had been guided solely by their own interestsin reducing or eliminating preferences which they accorded us, in pursuing a policy of rapid industrialisation and, e.g., in buying foreignaircraft when we might reasonably have looked to them to pay moreregard to United Kingdom interests. We should therefore not undertake in negotiations with the e.c. obligations to those countrieswhich we could not hope to carry out: while we had considerablebargaining strength in negotiation, this would only enable us to achieve a limited range of objectives and in pursuing these we shouldhave regard primarily to our own interests and to the interests ofthe poorer Commonwealth countries and of New Zealand.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet were under no illusion about the fact that entry intothe Community would cause some damage to Commonwealth
interests and to our Commonwealth trade. The extent of thisdamage would be for further consideration when the cabinet considered the balance of advantage if we should seek to join theCommunity: in particular these aspects could be further examinedwhen they came to discuss the paper (C (67) 61) on the effect of entryon the United Kingdom balance of payments.The Cabinet-(7) Took note of C (67) 59, C (67) 63 and of the points made in discussion.(8) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,27 th April, 1967.
