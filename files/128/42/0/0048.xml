secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of memoranda bythe Minister of Transport (C (67) 122). and by the President of theBoard of Trade (C (67) 127) on the revision of the present road haulage carriers&apos; licensing system.The Minister of Transport said that at the Cabinefs previous,discussion she had outlined her proposals for a revised road haulagelicensing system comprising two types of control quality licensing and quantity licensing.   When this issue was considered by the ministerial Committee on Economic Policy, there had been general support for the proposals on quality licensing.  Quantity licensingwould apply to vehicles of over 5 tons unladen weight which were engaged either on hauls of over 100 miles or on the carriage overshorter distances of certain types of bulk cargo. When the operators of these vehicles applied for a licence, the application would be opento objection by the railway operators on the grounds that they could provide a service which would be equally satisfactory as regardsspeed, cost and reliability.   The system would apply not only to public hauliers but also to firms carrying their own goods in theirown vehicles (&quot; own-account&quot; operators).  Some of her colleagues had doubted the desirability of extending this system to own-accountoperators.   But the object of her proposals was to secure the diversion to rail of some 30 million tons of traffic now carriedannually by road, which was essential if we were to avoid under-useof rail freightliner services representing a very large investment.Over one-third of the traffic in question was carried by own-accountoperators and this objective could not be secured if these vehicles were exempted.   The British Railways Board believed that theycould secure the diversion to rail of about half the traffic at issue byordinary promotional methods, but licensing would be necessary ifthey were to secure the remainder in view of the long-standingprejudice against the railways which was felt by many firms.  the prejudice against use of the railways was illustrated by the poorresponse of road hauliers to the opening of freight terminals for use by their vehicles which had eventually been secured after protractedopposition by the railway unions.  If own-account operators wereexempted from quantity licensing, this would inevitably lead to aSECRET1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that, while the date of the adjournmentfor the Summer Recess depended on the progress of parliamentary business, it was hoped that the House might adjourn on 28th July.It was proposed that the House should resume on Monday,23rd October.
further proliferation of vehicle fleets operated on own-account forwhich there was no economic justification. Moreover, the applicationof licensing to these vehicles would have a beneficial effect in stimulating greater attention by firms to their transport costs. a recent survey of a sample of firms operating own-account vehiclesshowed that about half of them had no knowledge of railway freight rates or how these compared with their own transport costs. Therewas no question of attempting to divert to rail traffic which wasunsuitable for this purpose. Licences would only be refused wherethe case had been fully made out that the railways could offer an equally satisfactory service. If the vehicle operator could show thatthe freightliner services would not meet his needs for examplebecause his vehicles needed to make calls at intermediate points which were not served by rail then he would be given a licence.In cases where a firm had a genuine need for a small number of vehicles to be held available to meet unforeseen contingencies, itwould be open to the licensing authority to award a licence for alimited number of the operator^ existing vehicles. The system should conduce to greater efficiency on the railways, since the railwayoperators would know that, if they failed to fulfil assurances as tothe quality of the service they could offer, it would be open to vehicleoperators who had been refused a licence to apply again. Thereshould be no major administrative difficulties in operating the system,which would apply to only some 70,000 vehicles as compared with1,500,000 vehicles which were at present subject to licensing. Thepresent licensing authorities were satisfied that it should be entirelypracticable for them to form a fair assessment of the relative costs of rail and road services, provided that the railway operators didnot seek to contest relatively insignificant licence applications; therewas no reason to suppose that they would do this.It was necessary to take into account broader issues than thestrictly economic considerations. The introduction of quantitylicensing would give a considerable measure of reassurance to bothmanagement and unions on the railways about the Governmenfsfuture transport policy. The Government had rightly asked boththe British Railways Board and the unions to accept someunpalatable decisions in the interests of greater efficiency, notably the continuing rundown in the railways&apos; labour force and the admission of private hauliers to freight terminals. It would be ofgreat assistance in carrying through these policies if the railwayscould be given the assurance of full economic use of the freightlinerservices. There would be an extremely hostile reaction from railwaymanagement and unions if quantity licensing were completelyabandoned. There would on the other hand be opposition from the confederation of British Industry (CBI) and the road haulageemployers to her proposals, but she would be able to emphasise thattaken as a whole they represented a considerable liberalisation ofexisting licensing procedures. Moreover it had to be rememberedthat the amount of road goods traffic which would be affected byquantity licensing was a very small proportion of the total, thoughit would constitute no less than 14 per cent of the present volumeof rail freight traffic.
SECRET* : 5    321CC 48 (67)Her proposals for quality licensing were in line with practice inthe European Economic Community (e.c.). On quantity licensing,the e.c. countries operated a quota system which at present excludedown-account operators. There was, however, a growing body ofopinion in the e.c. that this was completely illogical. If we wereto enter the e.c., it would be preferable to have a viable system ofquantity licensing of our own since this would help to prevent our being saddled with a rigid quota system.She sought the agreement of the Cabinet to her proposals as abasis for future transport policy and for the consultations with industry which would then be necessary.The President of the Board of Trade said that he fully supported the Ministers proposals for quality licensing but was opposed tothe imposition of quantity licensing on vehicles operated onown-account. To impose a physical restriction of this kind on theoperations of private industry would be unprecedented and it was aserious matter to hand over, in effect, management decisions in individual firms to a licensing authority.. A control of this kind would be inconsistent with the Governmenfs general policies for increasing productivity and helping exports. The right course wasto leave the railways to attract traffic to the new freightliner services by demonstrating in practice that these were efficient and reliable.If they were, there was no reason to suppose that suitable traffic would not be secured. The reluctance of many firms to use therailways was not due simply to conservatism, nor were theyprimarily influenced by relative costs. The most important factorfrom their point of view was that they needed an absolute assurance that goods would be delivered by a particular time, since factoryproduction would often depend on this. In view of the unreliabilityof railway services in the past, the reluctance of firms to divert theirtraffic to rail was understandable and in many cases justified. Thegreat increase in the number of own-account operators which hadtaken place since the introduction of the present licensing system in1947 showed that there was a genuine economic requirement forfirms to be able to operate their own vehicles. The assurance thatthey would have control of their own means of transport wasfrequently a crucial factor in persuading firms to move to development areas and the introduction of quantity licensing would therefore have adverse effects on the Governmenfs policies for distribution of industry. A better alternative to the proposedlicensing system would be to increase the licence duty on goods vehicles. This would encourage the diversion of suitable traffic tothe railways but would still leave it open to a firm to retain its owngoods vehicles where it had good reasons for doing so; it wouldalso bring in additional revenue to the Exchequer.In discussion there was general support for the Minister^proposals on quality licensing. On quantity licensing, while it was generally agreed that the objective should be to secure the maximum practicable diversion from road to rail of suitable traffic, it was
argued nevertheless that the Government would not be justified in introducing a system which would force firms to use the newfreightliner services before these had proved themselves in practice,particularly as regards reliability, which was a more important factorthan cost from industry&apos;s point of view.   The operation of theproposed licensing system would be likely to have adverse effects on industrial efficiency and exports unless the railways proved morereliable in the future than they had been in the past; and it was wrong to assume in advance that they would prove to be so.  The;mistrust of the railways felt by many firms rested on past experienceof unreliability and high cost and these factors went far to account for the proliferation of vehicles operated on own-account since thepresent licensing system was introduced in 1947.   It was an inadequate defence of the proposed system to say that, if thefreightliner services were in the event to prove unsatisfactory, a firmwhich had been obliged to use them by refusal of a licence would be free to renew its application, since by that time the firm would havedisposed of its vehicles.  In many cases it was crucial to a firm&apos;sefficiency to have control over its own transport in order to cope with unforeseen contingencies or to have an absolute assurance of delivery of raw materials or components at a particular time in orderto maintain production.   The risk that firms might be obliged touse the railways would deter them from moving to development areas. There was already a considerable volume of complaints fromfirms in the remoter parts of these areas about the unsatisfactorynature of rail services.   Quantity licensing would provoke strong and continuing opposition from industry, which would be reinforcedwhenever there was disruption of freightliner services, for examplebecause of strikes. Morale in industry generally was low at present;the introduction of quantity licensing would be an additional blowat a time when a revival of confidence was essential if we were tosecure the economic rate of growth at which we were aiming.Instead of introducing licensing before the freightliner services had had an opportunity to prove themselves, it would be preferable forthe Government to announce their intention to introduce it at some future date say after 12 months when there had been sufficientexperience of the new services to justify this.  In this way therewould be time for public opinion to be prepared.On the other hand it was argued that it would be impossible tocarry through an integrated transport policy without a system ofquantity licensing which covered own-account operators. It wasjustifiable to allow considerations of public policy to be taken intoaccount in determining whether firms should be permitted to use their own vehicles, since the roads on which they travelled were maintained at public expense. A system of licensing on the lines proposed was fully justified as an alternative to the nationalisation of road haulage. Too much weight should not be attached to theneeds of firms to maintain their own vehicle fleets; this was oftendone for reasons of prestige or as a form of advertising rather thanbecause of any genuine advantage in cost or efficiency. But the primary argument for quantity licensing was the need to ensure thefull utilisation of the large investment in freightliner services and
the heavy cost to the nation if these facilities were under-used. Anincrease in the vehicle licensing duty was a matter of taxation policy,but it should not be regarded as a substitute for licensing: it wouldpenalise many firms who could not possibly divert their traffic tothe railways and who would have got licences under the proposedlicensing system. For the Government to announce that a licensing system was its ultimate objective but to defer introducing it for aconsiderable period would give an appearance of vacillation andwould allow the maximum opportunity for opposition to theproposals to develop.In further discussion it was suggested that the best course wouldbe to introduce in the forthcoming Transport Bill provisions forquantity licensing on the lines proposed by the Minister of Transport,but to provide that they should only come into force on a day tobe appointed by Order. A period could then be allowed for furtherexperience to be gained of the operation of the freightliner services.The Minister could give an approximate indication during thepassage of the Bill through Parliament of the time at which theGovernment would intend to bring the provisions into force if thenew services developed satisfactorily. This might perhaps be abouta year ahead, but it would be wise to avoid commitment to a specificdate. The effect of proceeding in this way would be that the railways would be put on their mettle by the knowledge that, if the freightlinerservices did not prove their efficiency and reliability and if there weredisruptions, the implementation of the licensing provisions wouldbe deferred.The following additional points were also made:(a) It would be important for the licensing authorities in dealingwith applications for quantity licences to take account of the speed and reliability of the rail services not only as regards the carriage ofgoods between freight terminals, but also as regards delivery fromthe terminals to the ultimate destination.(b) In the consultations with industry which would be necessary before licensing provisions could be introduced, the present proposals on quantity licensing should be made more flexible in order to meetthe difficulties which would undoubtedly arise in some cases forexample, where a firm needed to maintain a limited number of vehicles to provide stand-by capacity which it would be uneconomicfor them to maintain unused save in emergency. consideration should be given to the desirability of special concessions for firmsconsidering a move to a development area and firms already established in the remoter parts of the development areas.(c) Consultations should take place initially with the CBI: theirviews would carry greater weight than those of the road haulageemployers, who were interested parties.(d) In view of the strong criticism from industry which the licensing proposals were bound to evoke, it would be important in presenting them to emphasise the degree of liberalisation which they represented, as compared with the present licensing system.
(e) If quantity licensing were introduced, it would be essential Ito emphasise to the railway management and unions the need for 1their fullest co-operation in measures to increase efficiency and red i cecosts.IThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the proposals by the Minister of Transport foithe introduction of quality licensing.  They also agreed on balance Ithat provision for quantity licensing broadly on the lines proposedin C (67) 122 should be introduced in the forthcoming transport bill. However, in Order to allow a period of time during which the Ifreightliner services would have an opportunity to demonstrate their fefficiency, the provisions should not come into force immediately on 1the passage of the Bill but should be activated on an appointed day by Order.   The Minister of Transport could then indicate during fthe passage of the Bill through Parliament the approximate time at which the Government would intend to bring the provisions into 1force but should make it clear that they would only do so if they 1were satisfied that it was then appropriate in the light of the efficient 1and reliable working of the railways in the intervening period. The minister should now proceed with her consultations with industry [!and in the course of these consultations she should consider what 1modifications might be made to her proposals on quantity licensing Iin order to meet the difficulties to which the system would give rise jin particular cases of the kind mentioned in discussion and any other jdifficulties which might emerge during the consultations.   Points jof importance arising from these discussions should then be jconsidered by the Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy.     . 1The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in C (67) 122 for the introduction Iof quality licensing for road haulage vehicles.(2) Agreed that provision should be made in the forthcoming transport Bill for the introduction of quantity licensing jbroadly on the lines proposed in C (67) 122, the provisions j;to come into effect on a day to be appointed by Order as 1, indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up of the discussion.(3) Invited the Minister of Transport:(a) To proceed with the necessary consultations with jindustry and to consider in the light of thoseconsultations and of the points made in discussion jwhat  modifications   might   be  made  to her jproposals for quantity licensing in order to meet jparticular difficulties to which the system seemed likely to give rise.(b) To circulate any revision of her proposals resultingfrom   Conclusion   (3) (a)   to   the   ministerial committee on Economic Policy.
secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (67) 128 and 131) and a memorandum by theMinister of Social Security (C (67) 132) on family endowment.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that at their previous discussion, while rejecting the application of means-testing toimproved family allowances, the Cabinet had accepted in principlethat there should be an increase in family endowment based on&quot; give and take &quot; principles, but had, in view of the public expenditure and fiscal considerations, deferred further consideration of the issuesrelating to the amount of the increase and the method by which itshould be financed.  There was currently widespread concern withthe problem of child poverty and he had given much thought to thebest method of improving family endowment selectively so as to concentrate on the most needy the limited additional resources whichcould be made available. He had been driven to the conclusion thatthe most  effective, most politically  acceptable and the most economical answer lay in the adoption of a means-tested scheme,involving the introduction of a new housing allowance. Under sucha scheme, a family would get an allowance for rent and rates of 30s.a week (which was the average rent) or more if the actual rent were greater, where its income did not exceed  9 a week for a married couple and one child; the qualifying level of income would beincreased by  1 for each child after the first and, in computing family income, family allowances would be disregarded. :-: The housing allowance would taper off for families with higher incomes. While thescheme would benefit some 300,000 families with incomes a little abovethe supplementary benefit level, it would effectively concentrate helpon the neediest 160,000 families with incomes below that level.  Itwould bring 86 per cent of such families up to the presentsupplementary benefit level at a cost of no more than  32 million,and would, in particular, benefit families with only one child who could not be helped by any increase in family allowances.  Whileany such scheme, the details of which would need to be more fullyworked out, might require the employment of an additional600-700 staff and would involve certain administrative difficulties,adoption of the alternative &quot; give and take &quot; approach would also involve a substantial increase in Inland Revenue staff because of theadditional numbers brought into the income tax field and would itself be accompanied by administrative difficulties. While applicants for a housing allowance would have to take the initiative in claiming,it should be possible, by simplifying the procedure and by publicity,to make people aware of their rights and to ensure that the greatmajority of those who were qualified claimed the allowance. In sofar as the introduction of the allowance might discourage localauthorities from introducing rent rebate schemes, no new issue was involved, since the new supplementary benefit scheme was alreadyhaving this effect; and the method would be discussed with the localauthorities.   Only 5 per cent of council tenants would, however,benefit from the housing allowance.   The allowance would be
available to tenants in the private housing sector where the rent rebate scheme did not apply.If, however, despite its advantages of doing more for the neediestfamilies at lower cost than any other scheme, the Cabinet still rejected the means-testing approach, he would accept as an alternative a5s. or 7s. all-round increase in family allowances, financed by a combination of reductions in income tax child allowances and reduction in the reduced rate band of income tax, with perhaps anincrease in personal allowances and some addition to corporation taxor other adjustments. As compared with a housing allowance scheme, however, such increases would cost respectively some 62 million, and  87 million a year net after payment of income tax,and would lift only some 35 per cent and 44 per cent of deficientfamilies up to the present supplementary benefit level. A 5s. increase would restore family allowances to their value in 1956, when theywere last increased, whereas a 7s. increase would match the risein average earnings since 1946. On public expenditure grounds hecould not accept a greater increase; a 10s. increase would cost 160 million a year gross, or  120 million a year net after paymentof tax. Nor could he accept that the cost of such an increase shouldbe financed by a directly matching reduction in income tax child allowances; he accepted, however, that it would be necessary to make an interim increase in family allowances and he proposed that family allowances should be increased at the end of October by 5s. forfourth and subsequent children at a cost of  13 million in a full year.The Minister of Social Security said that the Government were committed to announce their new scheme of family endowmentbefore the Summer Recess. A housing allowance, subject to a means test, would be widely unpopular with the Government supportersand in the country, and would be ineffective because people wouldbe reluctant to apply for it. There was disturbing evidence thatdespite the publicity for supplementary benefit, a substantial numberof qualified people were not applying for it. Any means-testedallowance would have a disincentive effect on families with lowincomes who could none the less increase their earnings; and herDepartments survey had disclosed that only about one-sixth of thebreadwinners of such families were physically or mentally handicapped. Local authorities would be reluctant to introducerent rebate schemes, and both they and private landlords would beless hesitant about increasing their rents. On the other hand a 10s.increase in family allowances would bring 65 per cent of children infamilies with incomes below supplementary benefit standard up tothat level and that part of its cost ( 32 million a year) which would fall on general taxation under a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme would beless than that of the housing allowance scheme combined with the interim increase of 5s. for fourth and subsequent children. In so faras a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme represented simply a switch of incomewithin the family from husband to wife, there was no loss of taxable capacity and no increase in public expenditure. Indeed, on this basis,a 15s. increase in family allowances would cost no more than theChancellor of the Exchequer^ proposals and would be nearly as effective in bringing families up to supplementary benefit level.Further, it would help the substantial number of families with incomes
CC48(67)only just above that level who would otherwise be adversely affectedby the proposed increases in the charge for school meals and welfare milk prices.In discussion, there was general agreement that, whateverapproach to family endowment was adopted, it was essential thatit should be capable of presentation as a selective improvementwhich would not benefit the well-to-do. The difference of view was essentially whether selectivity should be achieved through directmeans tests applied to the lower income families (the &quot; means test&quot;approach), or by adjusting the income tax liability of the higher paidto offset the benefit of improved family allowances (the &quot; give and take &quot; approach). In discussion of the means test approach, it waspointed out that its effectiveness depended on the extent to whichpotential applicants were aware of their rights and were preparedto take the initiative in making claims which could involve an approach to both employers and landlords; and in the light of experience of such schemes in other fields it was questioned whethera reluctance to claim could be sufficiently overcome. While,therefore, a scheme of the housing allowance type might be potentiallymore effective than a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme, this might not inpractice prove to be the case. It was further pointed out that whilethe proposed housing allowance might none the less prove to be themost effective and economical approach to the problem of childpoverty, as well as offering a means of modifying the regressive effectof rent and rates, a scheme on these lines would have to be fullystudied interdepartmentally before there could be any assurance thatthe difficulties could be solved. It was suggested that there was a need for a comprehensive review of policy in the field of rent and rates and for rationalisation of the various means tests applying inthis and other related fields. The problem should be dealt with asa whole and not piecemeal and any announcement of a housing allowance so soon after other recent changes., and in particular afterthe recent circular to local authorities suggesting a model rent rebatescheme, would only create confusion and give the appearance ofvacillation. It was suggested, therefore, that the possibility of introducing a housing allowance should be considered in a more general study of the problem of rent and rates with a view topromulgating a policy statement in two or three years&apos; time on theposition of tenants generally. While there was a risk that a housing allowance might provide an incentive to landlords to put up rents and to tenants to move into more expensive accommodation, it wassuggested that even if local authorities tended to exclude the poorestfamilies from rent rebate schemes, this might have the effect of encouraging the development of such schemes for other tenants.In further discussion it was suggested that since the proposedhousing allowance scheme would need further detailed study, andin view of the doubts which were felt about its effectiveness andacceptability, there was no alternative to the adoption of the &quot; giveand take&quot; approach if an announcement of the government&apos;s proposals for improved family endowment were to be made, aspromised, before the Recess. This would be in line with the closer
integration between the income tax system and social securitypayments which would eventually have to come. On the other hand,it was argued that, in so far as the &quot; give and take&quot; approachinvolved the financing of increased family allowances by increasingthe tax liability of families with children, particularly those only just above the level at which liability for the standard rate was incurred, it would be widely resented. The selective effect of &quot; giveand take &quot; schemes was, however, dependent on the reduction of child tax allowances in order to offset the benefit to better off families of higher family allowances. It was suggested that in view of thedifficulties inherent in the &quot; give and take &quot; approach, there should only be a limited increase in family allowances, perhaps confined tothe older children of larger families and financed from general taxation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that while there was a difference of view on the merits of the proposed housing allowance as a means of alleviating family poverty, there was generalagreement that any such scheme would require further detailed studybefore its effectiveness and acceptability could be satisfactorilyassessed. The Government were, however, committed to announcingtheir proposals before the Summer Recess. In these circumstances,the Cabinet were inclined to favour a general increase in family allowances, provided that a form of finance could be designed which met the objections to a fully equivalent reduction of income taxchild allowances and which could still be presented as sufficientlyselective in its effect. They should therefore consider the alternativeapproach suggested by the Chancellor whereby an increase in family allowances would be financed by a combination of adjustments of child allowances and personal allowances, with a reduction in the reduced rate band of tax and possibly other changes in the taxstructure. They should consider how far, consistently with the need to preserve the Chancellor&apos;s freedom to determine how expenditure should be financed, this alternative could be presented as a selectiveapproach to family endowment in conjunction with some extensionof the present arrangements for remission of charges for school meals and welfare milk. A draft statement should be prepared for their consideration accordingly by the Minister without Portfolio, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the lord president, the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Secretary of Statefor Education, the Minister of Housing, the Minister of social security and the Minister of Health. The draft statement should include, for consideration, a reference to further study of a housing allowance.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister without Portfolio, in consultation withthe Ministers principally concerned, to prepare a draft statement on family endowment in accordance with the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th July, 1967.
