ParliamentTransport Bill(previous reference:CC (67) 69thConclusions,Minute 9)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be desirable if possible to allow two days for the debate on the Second Reading of theTransport Bill.(2) Invited the Lord President to announce the business for thefollowing week as originally proposed, but to show himselfwilling to meet a demand for its rearrangement on thelines suggested in discussion on the basis of a resumptionof sittings on 17th January.CabinetSecurity ofMinisterialDiscussions(previous reference:CC (67) 56thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet were informed that the Defence and overseas policy Committee at their meeting on 8 th December, had discussed with concern the danger involved in Press speculation about the government&apos;s future decisions on its defence and other programmesfollowing devaluation; and had agreed that it was undesirable thatPress correspondents should be briefed on matters on which government decisions had not yet been taken. Since that meeting,further speculation had reinforced the concern there expressed, as would be apparent from the discussion of the following item.In discussion there was general agreement on the importance ofconfining briefing to decisions which had been taken and avoidingspeculation on matters still awaiting decision. Press speculation, suchas that which had occurred on the subject of a South African request for maritime equipment, could have the effect of restricting the government&apos;s freedom of action. We should have to face manydifficult decisions in relation to the economy early in the new year.It was important not to prejudice these decisions in any way. It couldbe particularly damaging if questions under discussion were represented in the Press as personal issues between Ministers. Thesame considerations applied to conversations between Ministers and members of Parliament.confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.In discussion it was suggested that it would be desirable to givetwo days to the debate on the Second Reading of the Transport Bill,for which only one-and-a-half days were allowed in the proposed arrangement of business. The Lord President said that, in viewof the proposed foreign affairs debate on a Supply Day on Wednesday,20th December, this would not be possible without putting the house to the inconvenience of sitting on Friday, 22nd December. The only alternative seemed to be for the House to reassemble on Wednesday,17th January, instead of Monday, 22nd January and to arrange for a two-day debate on foreign affairs in the first week. It could be indicated to the Opposition that the Government would be preparedto make such an arrangement if it appeared to accord with the wishes of the House.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it was extremely important, particularly at this difficult juncture, to avoidbriefing the Press on questions under discussion by the Government.Ministers should be fully informed when matters of concern to their departments were the subject of collective Ministerial briefings, andit was desirable that they should also be informed of what was said on such matters when the Press were briefed by individual Ministers.It might be advisable to have a Press Officer present on such occasions.Particular care should be taken to avoid giving the impression that questions of policy were issues between individual Ministers ratherthan matters of collective responsibility.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Oversea AffairsSouth Africa:MaritimeDefenceSupplies(previous reference:CC (64) 8thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Prime Minister said that when a South African approachabout the supply of maritime defence equipment had been discussed by the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee (OPD) at a meeting on 8th December, opinion in the Committee had been divided. Theyhad therefore agreed to defer their consideration of the problem for about a month, and that the question must then be referred for decision to the Cabinet. On the day before the meeting of OPDa delegation from the Anti-Apartheid Movement, having failed tosecure from the Minister receiving them an assurance (which clearlycould not be given) that Government policy on the supply of arms to south Africa would not be changed, had stimulated Press speculationthat a change of policy was in fact in prospect. In this situation some general remarks made by another Minister at a later meeting of a group of private Members of Parliament had led to renewedspeculation to the same effect. In consequence of this publicity, whichhad probably been encouraged by the Sodth Africans, it was necessaryto reach an immediate decision on the South African approach.In discussion it was common ground that the Cabinet would not wish to consider this question in the absence of the Foreign Secretary,who was delayed by the weather in Brussels where he had beenattending a meeting of the Council of Ministers of the North atlantic treaty Organisation (NATO). They might meet again on the foreign secretary&apos;s return either later that day or the following day. In thesecircumstances it would not be possible to make a statement inParliament that week, but the Reply to Private Notice Questions for answer that afternoon could indicate that there had been no changein Government policy and that a statement would be made in thefollowing week.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that it wasthe view of the Cabinet that in reply to Private Notice Questions that afternoon he should say that the Governmenfs policy remained as stated on 17th November, 1964, and should promise a fuller statement in the following week.
Greece(previous reference:CC (67) 64thConclusions,Minute 2)AircraftIndustryRe-equipment of BritishEuropeanAirways(previous reference:CC (67) 67thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the President of theBoard of Trade (C (67) 190) and the Minister of Technology(C (67) 191) about the re-equipment of British European Airways(BEA).The First Secretary of State said that in July 1966 theGovernment had refused permission to BEA to purchase Boeing 727aircraft. BEA had subsequently asked for permission to buy the bac 2-11 aircraft and the question for decision was whether theGovernment should accede to this request or whether they should require BEA to purchase instead the Trident 3B aircraft which wasthe effective alternative. A group of Ministers under his chairmanshiphad considered this issue before devaluation and had on balancefavoured the Trident. The Ministerial Committee on the aircraft industry had reconsidered the matter earlier that week, taking intoaccount the effects of devaluation and the offers which had now beenmade by the British Aircraft Corporation (BAC) and Hawker SiddeleyAviation themselves to bear part of the launching costs of the bac 2-11 or the Trident 3B respectively. The Committee had cometo a clear decision, with the President of the Board of Trade dissenting,to uphold the view previously taken. They had been influenced bya number of considerations. They did not think that much weight should be attached to the objection that if the Government insisted on the Trident, they would be overruling the commercial judgment ofBEA. This should not be the deciding factor when large subventionsfrom the Government would be required if BEA&apos;s request were accepted. Exchequer expenditure on the scale involved would be evenmore difficult to justify after devaluation than before. Whiledevaluation had.improved the export prospects of the BAC 2-11,export sales would be achieved only with an implied subsidy whichwas greater than could be justified; the aim following devaluationshould be to divert resources into projects which did not require anysubsidy. Before devaluation, one of the arguments for the BAC 2-11CC 70 (67)The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Prime Minister would reply to private notice Questions that afternoon on the lines indicated inhis summing up.(2) Agreed to discuss at a subsequent meeting the question of supplying maritime defence equipment to South Africa.(3) Instructed the Acting Secretary to circulate to the Cabinetthe memorandum on the supply of maritime defence equipment to South Africa considered by the Defence and oversea Policy Committee on 8th December.The Cabinet agreed to discuss at the same meeting the situationin Greece resulting from the attempted coup on 13th December and the subsequent flight of the Greek King.
had been that by providing an outlet for the Rolls Royce RB 211engine, the BAC 2-11 would improve the export prospects for thatengine, and in particular its prospects of being sold in the Americanmarket for incorporation in the projected American Airbus. Butdevaluation had given the Rolls Royce engine a further priceadvantage and less weight should therefore now be attached to this argument. Finally, the Committee believed that development of the bac 2-11 would run counter to the policy which we were nowpursuing of developing major aircraft only on the basis of an assuredEuropean market, and would in particular damage the prospects ofthe European Airbus.The President of the Board of Trade said that there were powerfularguments in favour of the BAC 2-11. First, this was the aircraft which BEA wanted; if the judgment were overruled for a second time, this would involve giving them in effect a direction to purchaseTrident aircraft which would give rise to great public controversy andwould impair morale in BEA. Second, there was no doubt that BEAwere right in believing that the BAC 2-11 was the best aircraft fortheir purposes: it was the right intermediate size between existingtypes of aircraft and the Airbus; it was the first of a newgeneration of quieter aircraft; and because of its lower operating costs, BEA&apos;s financial results would be better by some  30 million over a 10-year period than if they were obliged to take the Trident.A more decisive argument was the greatly improved export prospects of the BAC 2-11, which as a result of devaluation would haveoperating costs some 10 per cent below those of the rival Boeing 727aircraft. The estimates of export sales by BAC were more optimisticthan those made by the Ministry of Technology, but the Ministryestimated that total sales of 150-200 could be achieved, of which100-150 would be exports. Export sales of 100-120 would bring inforeign exchange earnings of  25O- 30O million, and earnings wouldbe much greater if the BACs expectations were fulfilled. Since BAChad been responsible for some of our most successful aircraft in thepast, due weight should be given to their assessment. A furtherconsideration was the claim by Rolls Royce that development of the bac 2-11 would improve the chances of selling their RB 211 engineto the American market, though he agreed that since devaluation hadin any case improved the sales prospects of the engine, this was nolonger a major consideration. Finally, we should be justified in developing the BAC 2-11 as a form of insurance policy. While it was clearly right to rely primarily in the future on European collaborationfor aircraft projects, there were considerable risks in relying on itexclusively. If we did not develop BAC 2-11 and if the Airbus projectwere to be abandoned, we should face an extremely difficult situation:BEA would then be compelled to buy American aircraft, and therewould be no outlet for the Rolls Royce &quot; new technology &quot; enginesother than the American Airbus.The main argument which had been advanced against the bac 2-11 was the extra cost which would be involved. The totallaunching cost for the aircraft and the engine would be  120 millionspread over five years; the launching cost for the Trident 3B would
CC70(67)be  15 million. But in the case of the BAC 2-11 the net call on theExchequer would be reduced because of the better operating results which BEA would achieve, and taking this into account the additional cost to the Exchequer of the BAC 2-11 as compared with the Tridentwould be reduced from  105 million to  80 million. Further, if the rb 211 engine was sold in the United States, the engine launchingcosts for the BAC 2-11 would be attributable to the American firms concerned and this would reduce the Exchequer commitment by afurther  30 million. In budgetary terms, therefore, if all these factorswere taken into account, the requirement would be for an additionalExchequer expenditure, as compared with the Trident alternative, of 10 million per annum for five years. These figures made allowance for recoupment of part of the Governmenfs investment on total sales of 150 BAC 2-1 Is; if larger sales were achieved, the call on theExchequer would be reduced.There were two general considerations which argued in favour of developing the BAC 2-11. First, we could not regard devaluationas being sufficient in itself to solve our balance of payments problems and we should still be prepared to incur Government expenditurewhere this would yield worthwhile results in terms of foreign exchange. Second, it was wrong to think that in our presentconditions it was necessary to reduce public expenditureindiscriminately: we should consider all items of expenditure fromthe point of view of their effect on the balance of payments, and fromthis point of view expenditure on the BAC 2-11 was fully justified.The Minister of Technology said he was opposed to thedevelopment of the BAC 2-11. It would be wrong to allow the issue to be decided by the commercial judgment of BEA, since a largeGovernment subsidy was involved and past experience showed thatthe Government would be unlikely to recover the major part of it.It was wrong to develop any major aircraft unless there was an assured market for it with at least three major airlines: this was thepolicy invariably followed by the American manufacturers and hadbeen the basis of our participation in the Airbus project. Devaluationhad strengthened the case for the Trident 3B: its operating costs would now be as low as those of the Boeing aircraft which BEA had originally wanted; the prospects of the European Airbus, with whichthe BAC 2-11 would be in competition, had been improved, as hadthe prospects of selling the RB 211 engine to the Americans though this particular argument for the BAC 2-11 had never been strong,since if this engine were incorporated in the BAC 2-11 it would notbe flying until two years after the American Airbus came into service.The BAC 2-11 would be bound to prejudice the future of theEuropean Airbus, without which we should inevitably becomedependent on the United States for large civil aircraft within a fewyears. It might also prejudice the links which were being built upbetween Rolls Royce and the French firm Snecma. Export prospects of the BAC 2-11 were bound to be speculative since the aircraft had not yet reached the stage of project definition, but he regarded the estimates made by BAC as unrealistic. If the Company themselves
had confidence in them, they should not require any Government aid;but in fact they were prepared to make only a minor contribution tolaunching costs, which they were bound to recover from sales toBEA. The BAC 2-11 would not come into service until some fouryears after the Boeing 727 and would find it difficult to capturemarkets in these circumstances. The difference in BEA&apos;s operatingresults between a BAC 2-11 fleet and a Trident fleet were only one to two per cent of total turnover, and this was within the margin of error of the estimates. The Trident 3B, on the other hand, would come into service a year earlier than the BAC 2-11, would secure someexports and import savings, and would be as cheap to operate as, andno noisier than, the Boeing aircraft which BEA had originallyrequested. The Trident would also enable BEA to achieve savingsby sharing common services with other Trident fleets.In discussion there was wide support for the view that it wouldbe wrong to support development of the BAC 2-11. The following main points were made (a) Experience showed that large aircraft projects should be developed only if there were an assured market. It was unlikely thatan aircraft designed to meet domestic requirements alone would be successful in world markets. Exports of the BAC 2-11 on the scaleenvisaged would mean that it would have to capture 40 per cent of theworld market for this type of aircraft, and it was unrealistic to expectthis to be achieved. Even if total sales of 150 were achieved, taking into account Exchequer expenditure, there would be an impliedpreference of 21 per cent, or 15 per cent if the engine launching costscould be attributed to the American Airbus. This was a higher rate than we had been prepared to contemplate for the European Airbus,even before devaluation. There would be only a short period duringwhich the BAC 2-11 would remain competitive in world markets, and during this time BEA would pre-empt the major part of production.(b) It should not be assumed that following devaluation weshould be prepared to commit large domestic resources in order to achieve smaller foreign exchange returns. Devaluation made our exports cheaper and therefore lessened the need for subsidy, while at the same time it placed a great strain on domestic resources.(c) If the European Airbus were to be abandoned, Europe,including the United Kingdom, would then be dependent oncomparable American aircraft. Development of the BAC 2-11 wouldnot prevent this; it might serve only to reduce for a time the numberof American aircraft which would otherwise have to be bought.(d) In view of the Governments present plans for reorganisation of the airframe industry, BAC would not be taking any risk in developing the BAC 2-11 and this should be taken into account in assessing their confidence in the aircraft.(e) If the Government decided against BAC 2-11, their decision should be presented in such a way as to gain the maximum credit withour French and German partners in the Airbus project.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said the cabinet agreed that the Government should assist the development of theTrident 3B, but not of the BAC 2-11, and that BEA should be told
that it was the considered view of the Government that they shouldpurchase the Trident 3B; if necessary they would have to be giventhe equivalent of a direction to this effect. There could be no questionof entertaining any renewal of the original application to buy the boeing 727. The President of the Board of Trade should now discuss with BEA the precise composition of their future fleet on the basis ofthe Cabinefs decision. He should also arrange to make a statement in Parliament before the Christmas Recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should support development ofthe Trident 3B, but not of the BAC 2-11.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade (i) to   convey   to   British  European   Airways   the government&apos;s decision as in (1) above, and toinform them that it was the Governmenfsconsidered view that the right course would befor BEA to purchase the Trident 3B;(ii) to discuss with BEA the precise composition of their future fleet on the basis of the Cabinefs decision;and(iii) in consultation with the Lord President, to arrange to make a statement to Parliament before the christmas Recess.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th December, 1967.
