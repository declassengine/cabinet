The Minister of Labour reported that the men werereturning to work that morning in the Liverpool docks, but the strike in the London docks continued. He was meeting the British railways board and representatives of the National Union of Railwaymenlater in the day and would press the Union to accept the currentproposals for ending the dispute about the duties of guards. Theproposal seemed to him to be an acceptable basis for agreement.The Prime Minister said that in the circumstances no questionof declaring a state of emergency arose, though the situation in theLondon docks should be kept under review.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Minister of Labour andthe Prime Minister.south arabia(previous reference:CC (67) 30thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C (67) 169) on our policy for South Arabia.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation in South Arabiahad changed drastically since the Cabinet had decided on our policy for the area earlier in the year. Although it had seemed doubtfuleven then whether the South Arabian Federal Government would succeed in maintaining its authority up to and beyond independence,there had been no real alternative to continuing to back the federal government, while at the same time seeking to broaden its composition to include representatives of other shades of opinion inSouth Arabia. It was on this basis that the decisions had been takento complete the withdrawal of our forces from the mainland of south arabia early in January 1968 and to provide maritime and air support for the new State against external aggression for a period after independence. The disintegration of the Federal Governmentand the failure of the Rulers to maintain their authority even in theirown States had left the National Liberation Front (NLF) and theFront for the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) as the dominant political forces in South Arabia. Negotiations had been taking place for some time in Cairo between the NLF and FLOSYabout the formation of a government for South Arabia but no agreement was yet in sight. There was thus no government to whichwe could hand over our responsibilities in South Arabia nor was itclear that there would be one even by the end of the year. In themeantime there was a risk that the South Arabian Army, which hadbeen the main stabilising influence in the country in recent months,might split into NLF and FLOSY factions. The run-down of our forces in South Arabia, and the removal of our military stores, had gone according to plan and would be completed by mid-November
apart from those required for the final period before withdrawal; the external threat to South Arabia was being reduced by the withdrawalof United Arab Republic (UAR) forces from the Yemen, whichwould be completed by early December, and there was no likelihood that if we were to speed up our own withdrawal the UAR would attempt to intervene in South Arabia.Our policy must be adjusted to meet the new situation. Inparticular, there was no advantage in retaining our forces in south arabia until January 1968; in the period between now and the endof the year they would be exposed to increasing risk from acts of terrorism as their strength declined and as the competing factionsin South Arabia sought credit by attacking them. It might well bethat a political settlement in South Arabia would be hastened by a rapid withdrawal of our forces.He proposed that we should bring forward the date for the finalwithdrawal of our forces from South Arabia into the second half ofNovember and that we should announce that this was our intention;planning would proceed for withdrawal on the earliest possible date,which was 22nd November, but we should leave open for the next two weeks the possibility of postponement until the end ofNovember should developments make this desirable. We should alsodecide and announce that we were withdrawing our offer to providemaritime and air support to South Arabia against external aggressionfor a period after independence. The disappearance of the federal government had removed any obligation on us to maintain this offer;the withdrawal of UAR forces from the Yemen had made such support unnecessary and no successor regime in South Arabia was likely to want it. Some naval forces should, however, remain in thevicinity of Aden for a short period after our withdrawal in case it became necessary to evacuate the 800 British subjects who would remain in Aden.Since it was important to maintain the cohesion of the south arabian forces and their co-operation with us, we were continuing to send them the supplies of military equipment which had alreadybeen arranged. But we should seek, if possible, to avoid providingthem with Hunter aircraft as had previously been intended; other questions of military and civil aid to South Arabia after independenceshould be left for later consideration. We must also decide what action should be taken about the 80,000 inhabitants of South Arabiawho had citizenship of the United Kingdom and Colonies but noother connection with this country. He proposed that we should provide against the risk that they might seek to come to this countryin large numbers by making an Order in Council that would give them citizenship of South Arabia and by taking powers at the sametime to deprive them of citizenship of the United Kingdom and colonies, though leaving for later a decision whether to exercise these powers. Finally we should accept that there was no prospect thatthe United Nations would agree to accept responsibility for Perim,and we should decide that the Kuria Muria islands should revert tothe Sultanate of Muscat and Oman and that Kamaran should remain part of South Arabia.
TransportPolicyRailwayPolicy: draft white Paper(previous reference :CC(67) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (67) 170) to which was annexed a draft White Paper on railway Policy.The Minister of Transport recalled that the Cabinet had agreed at their meeting on 25th July to accept the recommendations in theReport from the Joint Steering Group under the chairmanship of theJoint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Transport (Mr. JohnMorris) which she and the Chairman of the British Railways Board(BRB) had set up to review future railway policy; the Cabinet had agreed that the necessary provisions should be included in theforthcoming Transport Bill. The Cabinet had also invited her to consult the appropriate Ministerial Committee on the timing andmanner of publication of the recommendations of the Joint steering group. As regards the manner of publication, the best course wouldbe to publish the Group&apos;s Report in full. For this purpose theGroup had prepared, at her request, a slightly revised version of theCC 62 (67)We were now in sight of achieving the main objective of our policy, which was to withdraw our forces from South Arabia in an orderly manner; although there seemed little prospect that therewould be a political authority to which we could hand over our responsibilities, the civil service in South Arabia, which consistedmainly of local staff, was holding together. Our actions had been criticised by King Faisal of Saudi Arabia who feared that they mighthave repercussions for the Rulers of the Persian Gulf States andthere would be criticism in some quarters in this country when our plans were announced. Our policies were, however, likely to command general agreement in Parliament and in the country and could easily be defended.The Cabinet were informed that the Foreign Secretary&apos;sproposals had been endorsed by the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee in the previous week. In discussion there was generalagreement with them, but the, Foreign Secretary undertook toexamine further the position of the small Jewish community in Adenin the context of his proposals for dealing with the nationalityproblem there.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion said that theCabinet approved the proposals for our policy for South Arabia setout in C (67) 169. There had been speculation in the Press, following the meeting of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee in theprevious week, about impending changes in our policy for south arabia, but it appeared likely that this was no more than intelligentguesswork.The Cabinet &apos;    Approved C (67) 169.
report which they had submitted in July 1967 including only theminimum editorial changes but incorporating their earlier InterimReport. The revised version should now be regarded as the substantive Report of the Group, and the two earlier reports would remain confidential. The BRB had agreed to the publication of the substantive Report and she proposed that it should form an Annex tothe White Paper. The main text of the White Paper set outthe background to the new railway policy, described the main recommendations by the Group and announced the government&apos;s decision to accept all these recommendations.Publication had now become urgent because of developmentsaffecting the future of the Chairman of the BRB, Sir StanleyR-aymond. It had previously been decided that he should be replacedas Chairman of the Board and should be invited to take appointment as Chairman of the proposed Freight Integration Council (FIC). Ithad been her intention to defer action on this matter until after thepresent critical stage of negotiations between the BRB and the unions.However, she had learned during the previous week that the press had gained some advance information of what was proposed and thatreports were about to be published that the Chairman was to be dismissed. In order to forestall such misleading reports, it had been necessary to bring matters quickly to a head. She had therefore, afterconsultation with the Prime Minister, seen Sir Stanley Raymond, tooffer him appointment as Chairman of the FIC, and this had been announced. It was now imperative to publish the White Paperquickly in order that the public should be informed about the policybackground to the change in the chairmanship of the BRB and inorder to minimise undesirable speculation about Sir StanleyRaymond&apos;s successor. She therefore recommended that the white paper, subject to any amendments which the Cabinet wished to make,should be published on Thursday, 2nd November. The draft annexed to C (67) 170 had had to be prepared quickly, and it would be helpful if her colleagues would give her discretion to make any amendments of a purely drafting character which might be desirable.In discussion it was suggested that the circumstances in whichthe Chairman of BRB had been informed that his appointment wasto be terminated were unfortunate. On the other hand it had beenessential to act immediately and to offer him the post of Chairmanof the FIC to prevent misleading reports in the Press on the following day.In discussion of the text of the draft White Paper the followingpoints were made:(a) It was stated in paragraph 3 that the decision, published inMarch 1967, to adopt a basic railway network of some 11,000 routemiles would call a halt to the drastic reductions in route miles whichwould have been necessary under the term of the 1962 transport act. This statement could be regarded as a firm commitment in all circumstances to a network of not less than 11,000 route miles,although further reductions might be needed at some time in thefuture. While any direct suggestion that further reductions were contemplated would impair the confidence and sense of security which
it was important to foster in the industry, the wording of paragraph 3was too inflexible. It would be preferable to substitute a statement on the lines that the decision on the basic network brought to anend the phase of drastic reductions under the Act of 1962. TheMinister of Transport in consultation with the Secretary of Statefor Economic Affairs and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should give further consideration to the drafting of this passage.(b) Paragraph 5 stated that the Joint Steering Group had submitted their main report in July 1967 and that the full text, whichincorporated an interim report, was being published as an annex tothe White Paper. This, however, was inaccurate since what it was now proposed to publish was a revised version of the July Report.The present Report incorporated only minor changes from the JulyReport which were entirely the work of the Joint Group themselves.Nevertheless, it was essential to avoid any possible suggestion thatthe Government had for its own ends suppressed an earlier report.Therefore the present Report should not be dated July, which wasincorrect, but should bear the date on which the Group had approved the modifications to their July Report, and if necessary the Chairmanof the Group should be asked to sign a fresh copy bearing the correctdate. Paragraph 5 of the draft White Paper should be amended tomake it clear that the Group had submitted a first draft of theirReport in July and that the Group themselves then revised this draftbefore submitting their final Report as produced in the Annex tothe White Paper.(c) In paragraph 8 it was perhaps misleading to suggest that itwould be the community which consciously decided whether thesocial benefit to be obtained from the maintenance of a particular service was sufficient to justify- the cost of continuing it. It wasagreed that line 7 should be redrafted so as to omit the reference to&quot; the community &quot;.(d) Reference should be included in paragraph 8 to the part played by Regional Economic Planning Councils in consultation onclosure of railway lines.(e) It was important to ensure that the Departments concernedwith regional policy, including the Scottish and Welsh Offices where their interests were affected, were brought into consultation aboutpossible rail closures at an early stage.(/) Paragraph 8 should be amended to make it clear that it was open to the Minister of Transport to take the initiative in proposing a grant for unremunerative passenger services as an alternative toclosure.(g) In paragraph 8 after the words &quot; Directorate General ofEconomic Planning &quot;, there should be inserted the words &quot; in theMinistry of Transport&quot;.(h) The word &quot; much&quot; should be omitted from line 2 ofparagraph 13.(?) The figure of  159 million in parentheses in line 19 ofparagraph 14 should be omitted.
(j) In paragraph 15, line 4, the word &quot; liabilities &quot; should besubstituted for &quot; debt&quot;. The second sentence should end at&quot; Minister&quot; in line 8 and the third sentence should be omittedentirely.(/c) Paragraph 19 should be amended to make clear that although, in general, members of the reorganised Railways board would not be executively responsible for particular functions, one member would continue as at present to be responsible for industrial relations.(/) The last two sentences of paragraph 21, referring to theabolition of Regional Railway Boards, would be likely to cause somedismay in the regions. It was pointed out, however, that the present draft made clear that the regions would not cease to exist asmanagement units; it was, moreover, essential to announce thedecision to abolish Regional Railway Boards and it would be difficultto tone down paragraph 21 without impairing the powers of thereconstructed Board to conduct a far-reaching review of themanagement structure. On the other hand the Report of the JointSteering Group referred to the need for &quot; dispersed management&quot;and it might be possible to improve the presentation by insertingafter the reference in the penultimate sentence to the Transport Act,1962, a passage to the effect that the Regional Railway Boards assuch were not necessary to the dispersed management which thereport regarded as essential. The remainder of the sentence could then stand, with the insertion of &quot; railway &quot; before &quot; regions&quot; andthe deletion of &quot; have to &quot; in the penultimate line.(m) In paragraph 5.33 of its Report the Joint Steering Groupexpressed the view that substantial improvements would be requiredin the level of remuneration both of Board members and of chief officers and they proposed to make recommendations on this matter in a later report. The payment of higher salaries to the senior staff and members of the BRB would have repercussions on the salaries ofmembers of the boards of other nationalised industries which were,in any case, due to be reviewed. Althdugh it was important to takeearly decisions on BRB salary levels, it was necessary to consider thequestion of salary increases for members of the boards of nationalised industries as a whole. The best course would be for TreasuryMinisters, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, to putforward proposals covering the whole field for early consideration by ministers collectively.The Cabinet then considered the timing of the publication of theWhite Paper. It was agreed that the balance of advantage lay inpublication on Monday, 6th November, either early in the day sothat reports would appear in the Press that evening, or late in the dayso that reports would appear the following morning.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Transport (i) in consultation as necessary with the ministers concerned, to revise the draft White Paper on railway Policy circulated with C (67) 170, taking account of the points made in discussion;
(ii) to arrange for the final Report of the Joint steering group to bear the date on which it was approvedby the Group;(iii) to arrange for the publication of the revised white paper on Monday, 6th November, at a time to bedecided in consultation with the Lord President ofthe Council;(iv) to ensure that Departments concerned with regional policy were brought into early consultation on possible rail closures, as proposed in discussion.(2) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, after consultation withthe Secretary of State for Economic Affairs and theMinisters responsible for the nationalised industries, toarrange for proposals on the salaries to be paid in future to members of the Boards of nationalised industries,including the reorganised British Railways Board, to beput forward for consideration by Ministers collectively.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th October, 1967.
