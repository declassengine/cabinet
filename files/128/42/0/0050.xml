The House would rise for the summer adjournment on Friday, 28th July.Oversea AffairsAlgeria(Previous  ,Reference :CC (67) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)South Arabia(previous reference:CC (67) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)Middle East(previous reference:CC(67) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)   :.&apos;&apos; secret. The Foreign Secretary said that contact had now been madewith the two British pilots who had been captured and imprisonedin Algeria when the aircraft carrying Mr. Tshombe, the exiledCongolese leader, was taken over by force. Although the pilotshad been subjected to solitary confinement at the outset, they werein good health and were now being well treated. It seemed likely that they would soon be released but, in case this did not happen,consideration was being given to the action open to us to secure their release.A member of the Federal Council of the Government of south arabia, Mr. Bayoomi, who had been nominated by the Council as prime Minister (designate) under the new Constitution, had succeeded in forming a Government of eight members. Its compositionappeared to offer the prospect that the Front for the Liberation of occupied South Yemen (FLOSY) and the National Liberation Frontmight agree to participate in a Government. Some members of theFederal Council who had not been included in the new Governmentwere however objecting to some of its members, but our HighCommissioner in South Arabia, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan, was seeking to persuade them to withdraw their objections. Sir HumphreyTrevelyan would be visiting New York shortly for discussions withthe United Nations Mission for South Arabia: it had been hopedthat he might also meet members of FLOSY there but they had arranged to leave New York for Paris before his arrival. There was now some sign that the States of the Eastern Aden Protectorate mightbe willing to consider joining the proposed new South Arabian Statebut, although it remained our objective that they should do so before independence if possible, we could not defer action on our plansif they did not.The Special Session of the United Nations General Assembly was expected to end soon with agreement on a procedural resolution whichwould have the effect of remitting the Middle East problem to theSecurity Council. Our Permanent Representative at the united nations, Lord Caradon, had discussed with the Foreign Minister ofthe United Arab Republic (UAR), Dr. Fawzi, the possibility of clearing the southern section of the Suez Canal so that ships held up in the Canal could get away. It was clear, however, that the uar would not allow even this limited clearance of the Canal solong as Israeli forces occupied its east bank, while Israel was unwilling to remove her forces without first receiving assurances of a settlementof the Middle East problem that would include agreement that hershipping could use the Canal.   Observers of the United Nations
Nigeria(previous reference:CC(67) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)Hong Kong(previous reference:CC (67) 46thConclusions,Minute 1)Truce Supervision Organisation were now patrolling both banks ofthe Canal. This, together with the negotiations that should become possible once the Special Session of the General Assembly was completed, might create conditions in which the Canal could bereopened. We were much more heavily dependent on the Canal thanthe other maritime powers and we had obtained little support among them for efforts to secure its reopening. As regards refugees fromthe west bank of the Jordan, Israel was not fulfilling her undertakingsabout allowing them to return to their homes; we had protested toher about this.The Commonwealth Secretary said that some 850 persons,including some 500 British subjects, were that day being evacuatedby sea from the breakaway Eastern Region of Nigeria (Biafra).Although this might be the last opportunity for evacuation, a numberof British subjects had chosen to stay behind. The fighting betweenthe Federal Forces and those of Biafra was sporadic; Federal forces had however taken some towns and, if the rainy season held off, theycould probably soon take Enugu, the capital of Biafra, although therewas guerilla activity behind their lines. There had been no further developments in the Nigerian oil situation.The situation on the border between Hong Kong and the People&apos;republic of China was now quieter; although there had been some signs of movement of Chinese troops, both sides had withdrawnheavy weapons from the frontier itself. Incidents were continuingin Hong Kong and Kowloon, the Hong Kong police had raided TradeUnion and Communist headquarters and 15 leading Communistshad been detained. Although disturbances in Hong Kong were beingsupported by the Peking Government, there was no evidence thatthey had been responsible for their outbreak.The Cabinet Took note of the Statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretaries.PublicExpenditureEconomicOutlook to 1972and CivilReviews(previous reference:CC (67) 49thConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C (67) 125) about proposedadjustments to the programme of public expenditure to 1970-71.They also had before them the following memoranda:C (67) 129 Public Expenditure: Education.   By the Secretaryof State for Education and Science.C (67) 130 Public Expenditure: Proposed Adjustments: aid programme. By the Minister of Overseas Development,together with the following memoranda by the Chancellor of theExchequer:C (67) 97 Public Expenditure:  Civil Reviews:  Health and welfare.C (67) 98 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews : Social Security.C (67) 99 Public Expenditure: Civil Reviews: Housing.

In the light of that review itwas now necessary to take decisions on the savings to be achieved on each programme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in 1965 theGovernment had declared their intention of limiting the growth in public expenditure to 4  per cent per annum at constant pricesover the period to 1970-71. If the existing programme were maintained, the rate of increase over this period would average 4-per cent and for 1968-69 would be approximately 6% per cent. Theproposals in his memorandum C (67) 125 were designed to moderatethe planned rate of increase so as to bring it fractionally below 4 per cent per annum averaged over the period. The Cabinefs decisions would broadly determine the level of taxation over the next fewyears. The implications for taxation of any given reduction in total expenditure were necessarily uncertain, but he wished to place before his colleagues some illustrative figures. It was estimated that,if planned expenditure were reduced by  400 &quot;million in 1970-71, itwould still be necessary to increase National Insurance contributions(taking employers&apos; and employees contributions together) by 5s. 6d.a week. The average rate poundage for local rates in England andWales would rise from 11s. 8d. in 1967-68 to 12s. lid. in 1970-71for domestic ratepayers and from 12s. Id. to 14s. 7d. fornon-domestic ratepayers. Assuming for the sake of simplicity that increases in rates of taxation took the form of an increase in thestandard rate of income tax, that rate would have to be increased from 8s. 3d. to 8s. 9d.; alternatively, an increase of 1\ per cent inthe indirect taxes governed by the regulator would be needed. Ifthe reduction in planned expenditure for 1970-71 amounted to only 300 million, and again assuming that tax increases took the formof an increase in the standard rate of income tax, the rate would then have to be raised from 8s. 3d. to 9s. which would be the highestrate since the war with the exception of a brief period during the korean crisis; alternatively, an increase of 12 per cent in the regulatortaxes would be required. All these estimates assumed that tax allowances would be held at their present level, which would mean
that their value would be eroded as prices rose and the real burdenof taxation would thus be increased. It must be borne in mind that there was already widespread dissatisfaction with the present level of taxation.The Cabinet then turned to consider the proposals in C (67) 125in respect of the main programmes of expenditure.Transport The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that in their previous discussion there had been general agreement that the Governmentshould aim at a reduction in the railway deficit of  30 million by1970-71. There had also been general support for the introductionof special charges on heavy lorries designed to reflect the wear and tearon the roads which these vehicles caused, and on the carriage by roadof abnormal loads. It was estimated that these charges together mightyield some  25 million in a full year. He proposed in addition thata saving of  25 million in 1970-71 should be secured by reductions in the roads programme or in the further proposals for expenditureon infra-structure grants and other matters referred to in paragraph 4of C (67) 125, or by some combination of savings from these sources.The Minister of Transport said that some of the proposed reduction would necessarily take the form of the deferment of new projects in the roads programme and it would be difficult to avoidsome dislocation of that programme. She was, however, preparedto accept the proposal by the Chancellor of the Exchequer on thebasis that she would have discretion in determining how to allocate the reduction within her own programme. She would propose tointroduce provision for the new charges in the forthcoming transport bill. If the yield of these charges varied in the event, this would nodoubt be taken into account in determining the precise savings tobe achieved in expenditure on the transport programme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the railway deficit should be reduced by  30million in 1970-71.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to make provision in theforthcoming Transport Bill for the introduction of charges in respect of road transport on the lines proposed in discussion, designed to yield  25 million in a full year.(3) Agreed that the planned expenditure in 1970-71 of  894million on the roads programme and on the further proposals referred to in paragraph 4 of C (67) 125 shouldbe reduced by  25 million.Housing The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that themaximum reduction which should be imposed on the housing programme of local authorities in England and Wales was a reductionby 5,000 in the number of houses it was planned to complete in 1970.This would mean reducing the number of starts by 5,000 in 1969and by a further 2,500 in 1970 and would yield a saving to theExchequer of  19 million in 1970-71. A reduction of this order would make it difficult to achieve the target of 500,000 houses in1970 and it was therefore desirable to stimulate private sector housing
in order to make good as far as possible the reduction in theprogramme of the public sector. First, that part of the Governmenfsoption mortgage scheme whereby 100 per cent mortgages would be guaranteed to house buyers taking out option mortgages should,subject to consultation with the building societies and the insurance companies, be introduced in April 1968, at the same time as the mainscheme. Second, the limit for the present year on local authoritymortgage lending of  130 million should be increased progressivelyby  10 million in each year from 1968 to 1970.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that a large part of theincrease in the cost of the future housing programme arose from the implementation of improved housing standards in England and Wales.It would be inequitable if this led to a reduction in the housing programme for Scotland. Moreover, because of the effects on housebuying of the higher level of unemployment, there was less prospectin Scotland than in England and Wales of a reduction in the localauthority housing programme being made good by an increase in private sector housing. The target for Scotland of 38,000 houses in 1970 should therefore be retained.In discussion there was general agreement that the local authority housing programme for England and Wales should be reduced asproposed by the Minister of Housing. The programme for scotland should not be reduced but, since there must be some doubt whether that programme could be fully achieved, it would be reasonable toassume a saving to the Exchequer of  1 million in 1970-71 on the planned programme. There was general agreement that theGovernment should adhere to the target of 500,000 houses in 1970and should keep under review the need for measures to stimulateprivate sector housing so as to offset the reduction in the programmeof the public sector. The measures to be considered should include,in addition to the action proposed by the Minister of Housing, anincrease in the programme of local authority houses built for sale,subject to further examination of the relative cost to the exchequer of such houses as compared with local authority houses built forrenting.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the local authority housing programme for england and Wales should be reduced so as to providefor the completion of 5,000 fewer houses in 1970, witha saving to the Exchequer of  19 million in 1970-71.(5) Agreed that the local authority housing programme inScotland should not be reduced, but that a saving to theExchequer from that programme of  1 million in 1970-71should be assumed for the purposes of the present review.(6) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to keep under review the need for measures to stimulate privatehousebuilding, including the possible introduction of the
guarantee element of the option mortgage scheme in April1968, an increase in the present limit on local authoritymortgage lending and an increase in the number of houses built for sale by local authorities; and to keep the PrimeMinister informed on these matters.Education The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recommended anet saving of  45 million in expenditure on education in 1970-71after allowing for any additional expenditure on the developmentof primary education on the lines proposed in the Report of theCentral Advisory Council for Education (England) under thechairmanship of Lady Plowden, on Children and their primary schools (the Plowden Report). The Cabinet had agreed at their previous meeting that the charge for school meals should be increasedby 6d. and that the resultant net saving of  16 million, after allowing for the extended arrangements for remission of the charge for school meals, should count towards the saving to be made in the programme for expenditure on education.The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that the basic programme for education had been reduced to take accountof a revised forecast of the number of teachers and this saving of 20 million, which represented a reduction in the service provided,should also count towards the reduction of  45 million in expenditureon education for which the Chancellor of the Exchequer now asked.A further saving of  5 million in 1970-71 could be achieved by thewithdrawal of the free milk service in secondary schools, but sucha withdrawal could not be made unless authoritatively supported by medical opinion. He proposed, in consultation with the Minister ofHealth, to set up a committee to consider the matter accordingly;he had little doubt that they would recommend withdrawal of theservice. He would consider further the question of substituting loans for part of student grants, particularly in respect of graduate students,although it would not be possible to secure any savings by 1970-71by this means unless the scheme were operated through the banks.Similarly, he would consider the possibility of further economies,including an increase of fees for further education and the limitationof student grants to their present level. It was not possible, however,to quantify the savings which might thereby be achieved.Against the saving of  41 million resulting from the shortfall in the number of teachers, the increase in the charge for school meals and the withdrawal of milk in secondary schools, it would benecessary to set certain additional expenditure which was urgently required but not included in the basic programme, although theGovernment were to some extent committed to it. A start must bemade on implementing the recommendations of the Plowden Report,for which some  8 million should be allowed. Similarly, provision must be made for the new Medical Schools which would be recommended by the Royal Commission on Medical Education underthe chairmanship of Lord Todd when it reported in 1968; and some 2 million should be allowed for this. A further sum of the order of 2 million should be allowed towards the cost of the Open University.After allowing for these increases, which together amounted to  12
million, the net reduction in the basic programme, which already took account of the  20 million saving attributable to the shortfall of teachers, would be  9 million.In discussion it was questioned whether the  20 million savingalready included in the basic programme for education should counttowards the  45 million saving now required in that programme. Itwas suggested that, if the basic programme had not already been adjusted to take account of the shortfall of teachers, the totalsavings to be found from it would have been higher than the  45million now required. On the other hand, it was desirable that allprogrammes should be treated for the present purpose on a comparable basis and there was general agreement that, apart fromthe reduction of  20 million already made in the basic programme for education due to the shortfall of teachers, there should be a furthernet reduction in that programme of  9 million after allowing forthe additional expenditure proposed by the Secretary of State for education, the increase in the charge for school meals and the prospective withdrawal of the milk service in secondary schools.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that the programme of expenditure on education for1970-71 should be reduced by  9 million.(8) Invited the Secretary of State for Education and Science inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, toconsider further the substitution of loans for part of student grants.(9) Took note that the Secretary of State for Education and science, in consultation with the Minister of Health, would arrange for an enquiry into the medical implications of withdrawing the free milk service from secondary schools.Health The Minister of Health said that expenditure on the health services should be reduced by some  10- 11 million to take accountof the increase in the price of welfare milk to which the cabinet had agreed at their previous meeting. He was examining thepossibility of reducing expenditure on staff in the health and welfare services, but the likely saving could not be quantified at this stage.There was an urgent need for additional expenditure on a number of services, for example on vehicles for the disabled, for which provisioncould not be made within the basic programme.In discussion it was pointed out that the programme for expenditure on the health service assumed a continuing increase in expenditure on drugs, the annual cost of which would increase by 15 million a year by 1971; and it was suggested that furtherconsideration should be given to the possibility of containing this increase. It was pointed out, however, that the number ofprescriptions resulting from the removal of prescription charges had now ceased to rise and that the Government could not restrict theissue of prescriptions by general practitioners. In part, the increasein cost was attributable to the development of new and moreSECRET8204 B
expensive drugs. The area of possible economy was thereforeconfined to the price paid to the manufacturers for drugs. Thereport of the Committee of Inquiry into the relationship of thepharmaceutical industry with the National Health Service under thechairmanship of Lord Sainsbury on the cost of drugs would shortly be available and was likely to recommend new methods of costingwhich should result in a measure of saving, although requiring theemployment of additional staff. It was suggested that a saving of 10 million a year in the cost of drugs should be aimed at and thepossibility of achieving this saving should be further examined.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the expenditure programme for the health services for 1970-71should be reduced by  10 million to take account of the increasedprice of welfare milk which had been approved by the Cabinet attheir previous meeting. The Minister of Health, in&quot; consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, should arrange for the possibilityof reducing expenditure on drugs by  10 million a year to be further examined. They should report to the Cabinet so that the matter might be considered in the autumn, with the items of remainingexpenditure which the Cabinet had previously remitted forinterdepartmental examination. In considering any proposals for additional expenditure on the health services which might be brought forward, the likely savings in expenditure on drugs could then betaken into account.The Cabinet-(10) Agreed that the programme for expenditure on the health services in 1970-71 should be reduced by  10 million totake account of the increased price of welfare milk.(11) Invited the Minister of Health, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Scotland and the Chancellor of theExchequer, to consider further the possibility of achieving a reduction of  10 million in 1970-71 in the cost of drugs,in accordance with the summing up of their discussion bythe Prime Minister.Local The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it appeared on furtherServicesmental exannnation tnat a cu*: m tne programme of expenditure on localenvironmental services of the order of  20 million would not bepossible of achievement. A more realistic figure would be  10 million.In discussion it was argued that expenditure by local authorities on a considerable range of services was not adequately controlled and that a number of extravagant items, particularly local authoritybuildings, were still being approved. In these circumstances, it was argued that a cut of  15 million should be imposed. It was, however,the general view that, while expenditure in these fields should berigorously examined to achieve the maximum possible saving, theprovision of services must be expanded in line with the expansionof housing; and in these circumstances it would be imprudent to count on a saving of more than  10 million.
The Cabinet-(12) Agreed that there should be a reduction of  10 million inthe provision in 1970-71 for local environmental services.(13) Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to arrange for an examination of expenditure in these fields to ascertain whether further savings could be achieved, consistent with the Governmenfs policies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it had been agreed in previous discussion that officials should examine the remainingfields of expenditure and recommend what savings could be made.Officials should report their conclusions by October. It was doubtfulwhether a higher saving than  20 million total could in fact beachieved, but every effort should be made to obtain a saving of  25million.The Cabinet (14) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for an interdepartmental examintation by officials of theremaining fields of expenditure on the basis that a saving of  25 million should be obtained.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he proposed areduction of  70 million in social security expenditure in 1970-71.This assumed that the uprating of social security benefits in October1969, would compensate fully for increases in prices in the period and in addition give half the increase in real earnings instead of thefull increase, as was assumed in the basic programme. This saving of  70 million would, however, be more than offset by the additional expenditure of  87 million on family allowances which had beenapproved by the Cabinet at their previous meeting.The Minister of Social Security recalled that because of the lower rate of growth of the economy now assumed, and for other reasons,the basic programme for social security already reflected a reductionin expenditure of  124 million in 1970-71 as compared with theestimate which had been made in 1966. A further reduction, involving an increase of benefit in 1969 by less than the amount required to compensate for the increase in real earnings, would seriously reducethe standard of living of retirement pensioners in relation to theworking population. In particular the provision made by the present government would compare unfavourably with the provision madeby their predecessors, who had given increases in benefits as muchas, or more than, the amounts required to maintain the value ofpensions in relation to earnings.In discussion it was suggested that, since retirement pensionershad fewer liabilities than the working population, it was possible tomaintain their standard of living in relation to that of the working population without necessarily increasing benefits fully in line with
increases in earnings. Further, although the Government werepledged to give the old a share in the general increase in living standards, they were not committed to maintain fully the relationship between pensions and the movement of earnings. It was also pointedout that when benefits were increased in 1969 it should be possiblefor the Government to hold out an early prospect of substantial improvement in pension provision with the introduction of the newearnings related pension scheme in 1972. It was further pointedout that so long as pensions had to be financed from the fiat-rate contribution, this imposed a limit on the increases which could begiven; it might, however, be desirable to consider whether a fullyearnings-related contribution could be introduced in advance of thefull introduction of the new pension scheme.Summing up this part of the discussion, the Prime Minister saidthat the Cabinet were agreed that the programme for expenditureon social security in 1970-71 for cash benefits other than family allowances should be reduced by  70 million. For this purpose itwas assumed that the increase of benefits in 1969 would compensatefully for price increases in the period and would in addition give halfthe increase in real earnings, but this did not imply a decision as tothe amount of the increase which would, in fact, be made, since this could only be decided at the time in the light of the fiscal andeconomic conditions then obtaining and in particular of the possibilityof financing the increase otherwise than through the flat rate contribution. After taking into account the additional expenditureof  87 million on family allowances which the Cabinet had approved at their previous meeting, there was a net increase of  17 million in the total social security programme.The Cabinet (15) Agreed that the social security programme for 1970-71should be increased by  17 million on the basis indicated by the Prime Minister.The Minister of Overseas Development said that the aid programme based on the continuation of existing policy ( 225 million)had suffered a heavy cut of  20 million in the previous July. TheChancellor of the Exchequer proposed that this should remain inforce, although it had been agreed that additional provision of 25- 30 million should be made for mitigating aid to Singapore and malaysia and for food aid. This programme was inadequate.Repayments of interest and capital on our aid were running at therate of  60 million a year. The requirement that aid should be expressed in cash terms rather than on the basis of constant pricesmeant a continuing erosion of the programme in real terms. aid from governmental sources (as distinct from private investment)would fall from 0-66 per cent of the gross national product (GNP)in 1964 to 0-50 per cent in 1970-71. It was particularly important to double our contribution to the International development association (IDA) for the reasons that had been developed in earlierCabinet discussion and because only in this way could we hope to achieve international agreement that, contrary to the present proposal
by the United States Government, the additional contributions shouldnot be on the basis of tied aid. But this increase could not be accomodated by a reduction of Our bilateral aid.In discussion considerable doubt was expressed about thepossibility of the United States Government being induced towithdraw their insistence that further contributions to the IDA shouldbe tied. It was, however, the general view that it would be justifiable to offer to double our contribution to the IDA if this would achieveinternational agreement to that effect. If such agreement could notbe obtained, then a lesser increase of 50 per cent of our presentcontribution would be appropriate. In view of the difficulties of cutting bilateral aid to the full extent necessary to accommodatethis additional provision, there was general agreement that the further contribution to the IDA should be covered by an addition to the aid programme of  10 million if our contributions were doubled, or 5 million if it were increased by 50 per cent. The aid programme should however continue to be expressed in cash terms rather thanbe on the basis of constant prices.The Cabinet (16) Agreed that  10 million should be added to the aid programme in order to enable us to double our existingcontribution of  Hi million a year to the international development Association if this would achieveinternational agreement that additional contributions tothe Association should be untied aid, but that, if such agreement could not be obtained, the increase in our contribution should be limited to 50 per cent and  5 million should be added to the aid programme.(17) Agreed that the aid provided in accordance with Conclusion(16) above should be additional to a normal aid programme of  205 million a year in money terms, plus 25- 30 million a year in respect..pf mitigating aid to singapore and Malaysia ( 20- 25 million a year) and food aid to which the Government was committed as part ofthe cereals agreement in the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations ( 5 million a year).The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion as a whole, saidthat the Cabinet had now agreed adjustments in all the main spendingprogrammes. While there should be no detailed announcement oftheir decisions at the present time, it would be useful if opportunitycould be taken to make it clear in public that the Governmenfsreview, so far from entailing a reduction in the current rate of public expenditure, provided on the contrary for a continuing substantial increase in the Governmenfs civil programmes and that totalgovernmental expenditure would continue to rise at approximately the annual rate which the Government had agreed shortly after takingoffice. This would be consistent with an increase in the rate of personal consumption per head of the order of 2-1 per cent per
year even if some increase in taxation proved to be necessary. Thelengthy process of examination by Ministers of the whole field ofpublic expenditure had been greatly assisted by the admirable andexhaustive documentation which had been provided by officials, forwhich great credit was due to them.The Cabinet (18) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th July, 1967.
