CC 72 (67)secret the Prime Minister said that, in the light of the politicalsituation created by Press speculation over the week-end, he had thought it right to give the Cabinet a further opportunity to considerwhether it was still feasible to maintain the decision which they hadtaken on the previous Friday, 15th December, namely that he shouldmake a holding statement in the House of Commons that afternoon,in which a decision on the supply of arms to South Africa would be bound up with decisions on the measures, which the Governmentwere now considering and would be announcing in Parliament afterthe Recess, in order to ensure that the full benefits of devaluation tothe economy and the balance of payments were secured.The Cabinet would recall that, during their discussion of theGovernments attitude to the supply of arms to South Africa on thepreceding Friday, it had become clear the views of Ministers on this issue were divided. The suggestion had accordingly been made thatthe question might be best dealt with in the way suggested at themeeting of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on 8thDecember, namely as one of a series of measures covering expenditure at home and abroad which would be announced simultaneously asthe Governments response to the requirements of our economicsituation. Further discussion had led to unanimous approval by theCabinet of his proposal that he should make in the House ofCommons early in the following week a holding statement in whicha decision by the Government on the supply of arms to South africa should be foreshadowed as part of a range^of decisions on the further measures to be taken in consequence of the devaluation of sterling;meantime, the present policy of the Government on this issue should,of course, stand. It had been recognised by the Cabinet in that discussion that, in the light of the speculation which had already takenplace in the Press, it was essential, if the proposed statement was to succeed in its purpose, that their deliberations.on this issue should remain secret. During the week-end, however, there had beenlarge-scale and renewed speculation in the Press, which appeared tobe based on systematic and tendentious briefing about the cabinets discussion and decision. Unless the secrecy of the Cabinetsproceedings were fully respected, grave damage to the cohesion and authority of the Government was bound to ensue as it had alreadyensued in the present instance, even though the Press reports inquestion were in fact largely inaccurate. For example, they hadalleged that the majority opinion in the Cabinet favoured oursupplying arms to South Africa; but this was not true the balance ofopinion had been different, as he himself had made clear insummarising the discussion. Again, the reports about the divisionof opinion at the meeting of the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee on 8th December had been similarly inaccurate. Further,the accounts which had been given of his own position were bothmisleading and prejudicial. The Press had stated that he had taken the opportunity of the absence of the Foreign Secretary in Brussels* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.SECRET8647 A 2OverseaAffairs*South Africa:MaritimeDefenceEquipment(previous reference:CC (67) 71stConclusions)
to secure from the Cabinet a decision not to supply arms to SouthAfrica, whereas in fact, both at the Defence and Oversea PolicyCommittee and at Cabinet, he had accepted the necessity for deferringa decision in order that the way could be kept open for a solution tobe found in a wider context, in accordance with the compromiseproposals put forward at both meetings. Moreover, he had insisted that a decision should not be reached on this matter in the absenceof the Foreign Secretary, who was attending a meeting of the ministerial Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation in brussels; and the Cabinet had accordingly agreed, first, to postponetheir decision until the evening and, subsequently, when it had become clear that the Foreign Secretary would still be delayed by bad weatheron the Continent, to hold a further meeting on the following day inorder to enable the Foreign Secretary to be present.Nevertheless, inaccurate and tendentious though these reports were, they had now gained wide currency and it was generallyassumed that the Cabinet were critically divided on the issue of thesupply of arms to South Africa. The Opposition would no doubttake full advantage of the opportunities which such reports ofGovernment disunity presented them. He had therefore felt it right,to give the Cabinet an opportunity to consider whether, in all thecircumstances, the decisions which they had taken on the precedingFriday were still feasible and whether his own position was now such that he could reasonably be expected to make that afternoon thestatement which the Cabinet had agreed that he should make. he himself felt that he had now been put into a position in which, asmatters stood, it was very doubtful whether he could make theproposed statement in the House of Commons. Individual ministers had suggested to him during the week-end that the right solution was now to put the issue beyond doubt by reaching a decision on thesupply of arms to South Africa; and he felt no doubt that he wouldbe entitled to require the Cabinet to take such a decision. But he did not propose to do so because he had accepted the Cabinefsconclusion on the preceding Friday that a &quot;decision on this issue shouldbe delayed. He proposed, instead, to ask the Cabinet to stateformally whether they agreed, or disagreed, with his own view thatthe Press statements in question were not true: to authorise arepudiation of these reports on the grounds that they were inaccurate;and to endorse the statement he was to make in the House ofCommons that afternoon as binding on all the members of theCabinet, since it might otherwise be regarded as merely representinghis own view. In this connection he felt that he must make it clearthat he did not himself intervene nor did he expect other ministers to intervene in the preparation of the records of the Cabinefsdiscussions. As a result he had not seen the record of the previous friday&apos;s meeting before it had been issued. But for the sake ofaccuracy he wished to make it clear that the first part of the summing up of the Cabinefs discussion attributed to him was in fact astatement of his own personal view, while his summing up of thediscussion as a whole was contained in the second part of theattributed passage in question.
In discussion there was general agreement that it was nowessential to take immediate action in order to re-establish theauthority of the Government and to restore the confidence of opinion,both at home and abroad, in the Governments determination to takethe unpalatable decisions necessary to strengthen the economy. Forthis purpose it would be necessary to repudiate the inaccurate Pressstatements about disunity in the Cabinet, even though it was unusual,perhaps even unprecedented, for a Government to issue a specificdenial of tendentious Press reports of this kind and the precedent socreated might subsequently prove embarrassing.It was suggested that in the new situation it was also important to take, and to announce, an immediate decision about the supply ofmaritime defence equipment to South Africa. While some Ministersremained of the opinion that a refusal to supply the equipment forwhich South Africa had asked could not be justified either on the merits of the case or on economic grounds, it was generally recognisedthat in the present situation no other decision was politically possible.As regards the desirability of announcing a decision to this effect,however, it was argued that, since public opinion had been led tobelieve that the Cabinet had agreed to postpone a decision, animmediate announcement would further undermine confidence bysuggesting that they had altered their decision in response to political pressure. Moreover, it would be embarrassing to announce a decisionto reject the South African request so soon after giving the SouthAfrican Government to understand that, if they allowed us a littlemore time for consideration, they might possibly receive a favourable response. On the other hand, if it was now clear that no decisionother than a refusal was politically feasible, the balance of advantageclearly inclined in favour of an immediate announcement to that effect.Delay would merely provide further opportunity for public opinion to be mobilised against the Government; and when they finallyannounced their decision they would appear to have yielded to political pressure rather than to have reached a deliberate and considered judgment. But any further erosion of the Governmentsauthority would be intolerable in itself and would also be liable to undermine still more seriously international confidence in sterling;and it would therefore be desirable to put an end immediately to public speculation about disunity in the Cabinet by announcing a firmdecision on the supply of arms to South Africa. At the same time it would be important that this decision should be presented inrelation to the other measures which would be required if the economy was to obtain the full benefit of devaluation, since there was some reason to think that the Governments supporters might adopt a rather different attitude if it became apparent that a refusal to supplyarms to South Africa could not be without effect on the reductions in domestic public expenditure which would have to be secured. Itwould not be appropriate, however, to imply that these two issues were alternatives. While the supply of arms to South Africa would admittedly have yielded a welcome addition to our export earningswhich we must now forgo, it would not have relieved us of the
necessity to secure a very substantial transfer of resources fromdomestic consumption to manufacture for export and would therefore not obviate the need for reductions in public expenditure in orderto ensure such a transfer. It would remain important for theestablishment of confidence that the Governmenfs proposals for thispurpose should be announced firmly and with the minimum of delay.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat, since he did not wish to put the Cabinet in a position in whichthey might feel that he was asking, in effect, for a vote of confidence,he would refrain from expressing any personal view and would acceptthe Cabinefs clear judgment that he should announce in the Houseof Commons that afternoon that the Government had decided thattheir policy on the supply of arms to South Africa, namely to conform to the United Nations Security Council resolution of 18th June, 1964,should remain unchanged. His statement would repudiate, in thename of the whole Cabinet, the inaccurate and tendentious reports inthe Press about the attitude of Ministers, individually and collectively,on this issue. It would also foreshadow, as the Cabinet had agreed,the measures which the Government would shortly have to take inorder to ensure that the economy derived the maximum benefit fromthe devaluation of sterling; and he would arrange for these measuresto be presented for consideration by the Cabinet very early in January.The Cabinet then turned to consider the draft statement to bemade by the Prime Minister in the House of Commons that afternoon in accordance with their decision of Friday, 15th December. in discussion the following amendments were agreed:(a) In the first substantive paragraph it would be appropriate to insert a reference to agriculture as well as to industry and trade.(h) In the sixth substantive paragraph after &quot; shift the emphasis &quot;the words &quot; of the boom which is now developing&quot; should be deleted.(c) In the seventh substantive paragraph, after the secondmention of &quot; personal expenditure &quot; the paragraph should read &quot; thesuccess of the Governmenfs prices and incomes policy is of crucial importance &quot;. Further, the final passage of this paragraph should include a reference to the inter-relationship between restraint of consumption and the success of the prices and incomes policy asfollows &quot; While I cannot anticipate my right hon. Friend&apos;s budget statement nor any other measures which may be needed to restrainconsumption, the severity of such restraint will clearly depend onthe co-operation which the Government receive in implementingtheir prices and incomes policy &quot;.id) In the ninth substantive paragraph, it would be desirable thatthe final sentence (beginning &quot; while I&quot;) should immediately follow the first sentence.(e) The order of the thirteenth and fourteenth substantiveparagraphs should be reversed, in order to allow the former (which made it clear that the Governmenfs review would cover defence and oversea expenditure as well as domestic civil expenditure) to befollowed directly by the paragraphs dealing with the government&apos;s decision on arms for South Africa.
CC 72 (67)(/) The fifteenth substantive paragraph, beginning &quot; Sir, the review &quot; should be amended in its first sentence to eliminate the words&quot; being continually forced &quot;; and in its third sentence so as to read,&quot;In this connection the Government have completed their examination of the question of the supply of defence equipment to south Africa and have decided that their policy on this matter, namely to conform to the Security Council Resolution of 18th June, 1964,remains unchanged &quot;.(g) At this point it would be appropriate to insert the proposedparagraph repudiating the Press reports, the text to run &quot; I should add that I have the authority of the whole Cabinet categorically to repudiate as inaccurate reported statements about the position takenby the Cabinet as a whole, by a Cabinet Committee which met a weekearlier, and also about the position taken by the Prime Minister andother individual Ministers &quot;.(h) In the final paragraph the word &quot; Government &quot; should besubstituted for &quot; Cabinet &quot;, and the concluding sentence should read&quot; They will then call on the House to take its full responsibility inendorsing it&quot;.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet had now unanimously agreed, subject only to anyfurther drafting amendments, the text of the statement which heshould make in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet, by unanimous decision (1) Reaffirmed their approval of the Prime Minister^ proposal that he should make a statement in the House ofCommons in the afternoon, in which the attitude of theGovernment to the supply of arms to South Africa shouldbe presented in the context of a general statement aboutthe measures which the Government were considering inorder to ensure that we obtained the full benefit of devaluation.(2) Agreed that this statement should include an announcement that the Government had decided that their policy on thesupply of arms to South Africa, namely to conform tothe United Nations Security Council Resolution of 18thJune, 1964, should remain unchanged.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to include in his statement, onbehalf of the whole Cabinet, a categorical repudiation ofthe inaccurate statements published in the Press duringthe week-end about the positions taken by the Cabinet asa whole, by the Prime Minister and by other individual ministers on the issue of the supply of arms to SouthAfrica.(4) Approved the terms of the draft of the Prime ministers statement in the House of Commons that afternoon asamended in the course of discussion. (The final text ofthe statement is appended to these Conclusions.)Cabinet Office, S.W.1.18th December, 1967
STATEMENT BY THE PRIME minister in THE HOUSE OF COMMONS ONMONDAY, 18th DECEMBER, 1967Mr. Speaker, with permission I should like to make a statement.1. I feel it right before the House rises for the Recess to makea full statement of the Governmenfs intentions about the way inwhich we are now engaged in deciding on the measures necessary toensure that industry, trade, agriculture, indeed the country as a whole,take full advantage of the opportunity presented by devaluation.2. The Government have made clear that, in order to achieve a progressive and massive swing in our balance of payments over thenext two years, a substantial diversion of resources will be needed to exports, to import replacement and to investment.3. The statement of my right hon. Friend the Home secretary on 20th November outlined the first package of measures directed to this end.4. The Government have made clear that progressively up tothe Budget, and indeed at any time afterwards, when this becomes necessary, steps will be taken to ensure that home demand, includingGovernment expenditure, is not allowed to develop to a point wherethe necessary shift of resources to the priority purposes of earning apayments surplus is for one moment endangered.5. As my right hon. Friend the Chancellor made clear, theintention is to ensure beyond all doubt that as exports, import-savingand investment build up, the resources will be available to meet them.6. It is our intention to maintain economic growth and risingemployment, taking progressively the measures needed to shift the emphasis from a consumer-led expansion to an export-led expansion.At the same time it will be the determination of Her Majesty&apos;sGovernment not to allow that steady expansion, as it develops overthe next year and into 1969, to degenerate into a situation of inflation and excessive pressure on resources and capacity.7. As the policy develops through the period of the Estimates,the Budget and subsequently, it will mean reductions in the growth of personal expenditure and reductions in the growth of public expenditure. On personal expenditure, the success of the government&apos;s prices and incomes policy is of crucial importance.While I cannot anticipate my right hon. Friend&apos;s Budget statementnor any other measures which may be needed to restrain consumption,the severity of such restraint will clearly depend on the co-operation which the Government receive in implementing their prices and incomes policy.8. So far as public expenditure is concerned, the House will be aware, through long experience, that expenditure programmes take several years to mature and that decisions taken at any moment oftime may have little impact on immediate Estimates. But decisions taken now can in certain spending areas have a growing effect in thesecond year and a decisive effect in the third and subsequent years,provided that the decisions are taken now.
9. The examination of spending programmes which this involves is being tackled in a mood of urgency. While I should liketo have given the House all the necessary details before the Recess,hon. Members will I think agree, in view of the important nature ofthe expenditure areas to be considered, that it would be wrong topress on with over-hasty decisions without considering all the implications. Full details will be given to the House and the decisions which have to be taken will be taken in time to govern the 1968-69Estimates, as well as subsequent Estimates.10.  But I should tell the House this.11. First, we are not approaching this expenditure review,whether in respect of home or overseas expenditure, on the basis ofcandle-ends, or simply on the basis of minor administrative economies,though we shall not of course neglect any opportunities here.Neither are we looking for prospects of under-spending or theshifting of expenditure from one financial year to another. We arebringing under stringent review all major areas of policy, both athome and overseas, where substantial expenditure is involved.12. Second, no area of expenditure can be regarded assacrosanct for the purposes of the searching examination we aremaking; no spending commitment whether inherited three years ago,or incurred since.13. Thirdly, it will cover local government expenditure as wellas central government expenditure.14. Fourthly, as I have made clear, the review will coverdefence and overseas expenditure as well as home civil expenditure.15. Sir, the review as a whole is being related to what isessential in expenditure here at homeland to what is appropriate ata time when we have been, and are, re-assessing Britain&apos;s role in theworld.   This must involve overseas policy.16. In this connection the Government have completed their examination of the question of the supply of defence equipment to south Africa and have decided that their policy on this matter,namely to conform to the Security Council Resolution of 18th June,1964, remains unchanged.17. I should add that I have the authority of the whole Cabinetcategorically to repudiate as inaccurate reported statements about theposition taken by the Cabinet as a whole, by a Cabinet Committeewhich met a week earlier, and also about the position taken by thePrime Minister and other individual Ministers.18. When next month the House is given the results of our examination of all the expenditure programmes and indeedthroughout the further development of all our policies I intend toensure that the totality of decisions taken will be fair as betweencitizen and citizen; that while everyone must bear burdens, the burdens will be fairly shared; and that, while established assumptions
and traditional spending commitments will have to be called inquestion and in appropriate cases sacrificed, the questioning and the sacrifices equally will be fairly borne.19. At the end of the day the Government will be responsiblefor achieving a fair balance, whether of economic or politicalsacrifice, and submitting it to this House. They will then call on theHouse to take its full responsibility in endorsing it.
