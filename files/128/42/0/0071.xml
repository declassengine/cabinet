OverseaAffairsSouth Africa:MaritimeDefenceEquipment(Previous -Preference:CC (67) 70thConclusions,Minute 3)secret the Cabinet had before them a note by the Acting Secretary ofthe Cabinet (C (67) 194) covering a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Defence Secretary on&quot; the supply of maritimeequipment to South Africa.The Cabinet considered further the circumstances surroundingthe decision of the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee on 8th December which had led to their discussion on the previous day(CC (67) 70th Conclusions, Minutes 2 and 3).The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet faced a very difficult decision on the reply which was outstanding to an approach to us by the South African Government for the supply of maritime defence &apos;equipment valued at some  100 million. On the one hand if wewere to supply these arms, there would be political difficulties notmerely in Parliament and in liberal circles in this country, but alsoamong Commonwealth countries and in the United Nations. he fully shared the general repugnance for the South African policy ofapartheid, and recognised that many would consider the supply ofarms to South Africa to be morally wrong. On the other hand,there were strong economic and strategic reasons for meeting theSouth African request. Failure to do so would not merely lose us 100 million worth of orders for defence equipment but, in the unanimous opinion of those best qualified to know, would also put at risk a large number of civil orders in our second largest export market in the world. The total loss of trade might well amount to not less than  200 million up to 1980. Our present economic situation was so serious that we could not afford to lose these orders. Weshould also risk losing our naval facilities at Simonstown; we might find that France would not merely replace us as South Africa&apos;s source of arms but also reach a defence agreement with her. The importanceof the Cape route had been clearly demonstrated this year as a resultof the closure of the Suez Canal. The arms to&apos;be supplied wouldnot affect the ability of the South African Government to maintain its policies of apartheid. He believed the United States Governmentwould make no difficulty for us. If we were to supply them, it mightbe that the South African Government, who had shown some limitedwillingness to help towards a settlement in Rhodesia, would co-operate more closely with us. He therefore recommended jointly with the Defence Secretary that we should supply the maritimedefence equipment which South Africa was seeking. A decision could be presented as an extension of our policy of continuing tosupply certain items where we recognised an obligation to do so,and where the ability of the South African Government to enforceapartheid was not increased.In discussion there was support for the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal on the ground that refusal of the South African requestwould cast grave doubts on the will and ability of the Governmentto take, following devaluation, the measures necessary to restore the economy.  Doubts were already being expressed on this score both8643
at home and abroad. If we were seen to be deliberately forgoingfor political reasons trade which on some estimates might amount in total to as much as  300 million, confidence in the Governmentwould be gravely impaired, especially among British exporters on whom we depended to restore our balance of payments. Such adecision might prove disastrous not only for our export industry butalso for the living standards of working people. If we sacrificed this opportunity of improving our balance of payments, it might benecessary to make, in compensation, even more drastic reductions in public expenditure, including that on education and the social services. Although the full benefit of the proposed arms sales to south Africa would not be felt for some years, they would produce in 1968 a sum in foreign exchange equivalent to the saving obtained by withdrawing one brigade from Germany.It was further argued that there was no strong moral issue at stake. The supply of maritime equipment did not imply condonementof the policy of apartheid any more than did our continued tradewith South Africa in civil equipment, e.g., transport equipment.The defence equipment itself could not be used against the Africanpopulation. Public opinion did not feel strongly on this issue. In ourpresent economic circumstances we could no longer afford to actas the world&apos;s conscience. In any case economic embargoes hadrepeatedly been proved ineffective. A decision to supply arms would lead to hostile reactions in the Commonwealth, but feeling on this issue was not so strong as over Rhodesia: and there were indications that some of the newly independent African countries, outsideSouthern Africa, were thinking of trying to improve their relationswith South Africa. If we had to make up for our loss of this trade by reducing our aid programmes, the Commonwealth would suffer.On the other hand it was argued that to supply maritime defence equipment to South Africa would constitute a major change of policy.It would involve going back on the United Nations Resolution andon the Governmenfs own decision of November 1964, which hadbeen taken on moral grounds. If we allowed our policy to bedictated in this way by purely xommercial considerations, we riskedlaying ourselves open to future pressure from South Africa or evenfrom British exporters. The racial question was one of the major issues which was going to determine the future development of theworld. It was of over-riding importance to many young people inthe country. To supply this equipment would amount to liningourselves up on this issue behind South Africa and against the overwhelming majority in the United Nations. There might perhaps be a case for meeting South Africa on this question if we couldthereby achieve an honourable settlement in Rhodesia. But there seemed to be no prospect of this. There was a clear distinctionbetween normal trade and the sale of arms; and it was far from certain that a refusal to supply South Africa with the arms for which she had asked would necessarily have serious effects on our ordinarytrade. Our trade with South Africa over the last three years hadnot noticeably been affected by our decision to suspend the supplyof arms in 1964.
It was suggested that in view of the division of opinion in theCabinet on this issue there would be advantage in postponing adecision until it had been possible to consider the problem of armsfor South Africa in the broader context.of the general review of our economic policy which had become necessary as a result of devaluation. This review might cover all trade in arms, includingarms for the Communist countries and Israel, and extend to allinstances where we had been restrained by political considerationsfrom following our economic interest.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that notonly the Governmenfs political and economic credibility were a tissue but also its moral credibility. To agree to supply the proposedmilitary equipment to South Africa would be contrary to theprinciples for which the Government stood: and if they were to doso in order to carry economic credibility with British industry, theywould risk being pushed into other policies advocated by theOpposition and thus lose all political credibility. They would notonly destroy their standing with liberal opinion in the country, butalso undermine the support of the Parliamentary Labour Partywithout which the Government could not survive. The Governmentwould in the near future face some difficult decisions following devaluation. Drastic measures would be necessary, some of whichwould be distasteful to the Governmenfs supporters in Parliament.It would be much more difficult to secure backing for these essentialmeasures if in the meanwhile Government supporters had beenalienated by a decision to supply arms to South Africa. Opinion inthe Cabinet was divided on the question whether the political disadvantages outweighed the economic arguments in favour of supplying these arms. The balance of opinion was in favour of deferring a final decision until the problem of arms for South Africacould be seen in the broader perspective of the comprehensive reviewof all our policies at home and overseas, which had been madenecessary by devaluation. It would have been preferable to completesuch a review before the Christmas Recess. But this was not possiblein the time. He would therefore propose to make a holdingstatement in Parliament early in the following week. The statement would refer to the comprehensive study of the measures which it wasnecessary to take to ensure that we obtained the full benefit of devaluation. It would make clear that no areas of policy were excluded from review. Arms for South Africa could be coveredtowards the end of the statement in a reference to a review of our policy on the sale of arms generally. It would also be necessary tomake clear in reply to supplementary Questions that pending this general review our present policy on the supply of arms to SouthAfrica remained unchanged, and to defend that policy if theOpposition attacked it. A statement of the kind he had outlinedwould moreover be valuable at the present juncture as showing the government&apos;s determination to grapple with the problems resultingfrom devaluation.

It was essential thatno information should reach the Press about the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note with approval that the Prime Minister wouldmake a statement in Parliament in the following week onthe lines indicated in his summing up.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of the problem of thesupply of arms for South Africa in the light of their general review of policy following devaluation.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th December, 1967.
