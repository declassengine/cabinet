subject the Approach to Europe
CC 14 (67)secret the Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary (C (67) 33) summarising their discussions ontheir recent visits to the capitals of the member countries of theEuropean Economic Community (e.c.). Annexed to it was the record of those discussions.The Prime Minister said that, while the record of thediscussions in each of the capitals of the Six covered much the sameground, there had been a growing concentration on, and narrowingof, the number of problems of major difficulty as the tour continued.These fell into three groups:(i) The common agricultural policy (c.a.p.) and particularly the difficulties arising from the current system of levies.We could not expect to change the basis of the c.a.p.,but once we were a member of the Community we should play an important part in determining its development.In particular the policy would fall due to be renegotiatedin 1969 and if we were a member at that stage we shouldnot be without allies among the Six in seeking lower prices for agricultural products. We should, however,need to negotiate a substantial change of the levy system under the protocol of accession since in its present termsit would have severely damaging and inequitableconsequences for us.(ii) The  problem  of  capital  movements,  particularly  thefreedom of portfolio investment.(iii) The residuum of major Commonwealth problems not already arising in connection with the c.a.p., andparticularly problems relating to New Zealand and theCommonwealth Sugar Agreement (CSA).There were a number of other problems which had appearedto present major difficulties at the outset; these difficulties howeverhad diminished as the tour proceeded. In particular, it now appeared that there should be no substantial difficulty in theGovernment maintaining their present policies relating to regional development, since some at least of the members of the e.c. hadregional problems of similar and in some cases greater magnitude,and had been able to make special arrangements to deal with themwith a considerable degree of freedom.There had also been considerable discussion of issues relatingto the sterling area and our balance of payments. There was a widespread fear that, since the economic troubles of any memberof the Community must affect the rest, any further crisis in relationto the position of sterling (which might for example requiredeflationary measures in the United Kingdom harmful to the economies of the other members of the Community) would seriouslydamage their interests. The concern of the Six had, however, been greatly mitigated by the discussions which had taken place during
the last visits to The Hague and Luxembourg, on the applicationof Article 108 of the Treaty of Rome. He had made it clear thatthe United Kingdom would not seek to use the provisions of thisArticle to seek assistance from the Six in respect of difficulties arising from the role of sterling as a reserve and trading currency,but that these would be handled in the appropriate internationalfora, such as the Group of Ten, or the International Monetary Fund,in the same way as difficulties relating to the Italian balance ofpayments a few years earlier had been handled, i.e., internationallyrather than on the basis of assistance from the other member countries of the e.c..There was a sharp division between France on the one handand the Five on the other in the attitude of the Six towards thepossibility of the United Kingdom joining the e.c.. In discussions in Paris President de Gaulle had not raised difficulties arising from our special relationship with the United States, nor from our north atlantic policy. He appeared to have recognised the force of our proposals relating to technological development in the european community, and of the broader European political developments,both internal and external, to which the Prime Minister had referred in his speech at Strasbourg on 23rd January. General de gaulle had, moreover, acknowledged the difference between the attitudesof the previous and the present Administrations towards our joining the Community and it appeared that he was convinced of the sincerity of our approach. Nevertheless, our entry would clearlythreaten the dominant position which France had hithertomaintained in the e.c. and the close community of interests whichhad grown up between its member countries. For this reasonGeneral de Gaulle would basically prefer that we should not pursue the question of joining the Community at present and would nodoubt seek to deter us by raising difficulties both of substance andof procedure, even although in present circumstances it might wellbe difficult for him to veto the United Kingdom joining theCommunity as he had done in 1963.The Five for their part all wished the United Kingdom to join the e.c. and some, particularly the Benelux countries were extremely anxious that we should do so. For the most part theyhad in their discussions with the Foreign Secretary and himselfsought not so much to raise difficulties on their own account as toget from us explanations of our position which they in turn could use to dispel French opposition. In the last resort, however, theFive would not be prepared to disrupt the e.c. in order to force the French Government to agree to our admittance if the latter were determined to oppose it. In particular, the new federal german Government would not be prepared to take action whichwould threaten the resumption of cordial Franco-German relations,although this relationship would be unlikely to persist for long inthe face of the real attitude of General de Gaulle towards Germany.It might be convenient for the Cabinet if on this occasion theyconfined themselves to an elucidation of the position as it emerged from the discussions he and the Foreign Secretary had had with
their colleagues of the Six Governments, and to some general discussion of the range of issues involved. At subsequent meetings,such discussion could then turn to the consideration of the attitude which the Government should adopt towards each of the major problems and to the course which they should follow on the issueof whether or not we should seek to join the e.c..The Foreign Secretary said that in considering the attitude ofeach of the Six Governments it should be borne in mind that theattitude of the Italian Government, friendly though it was, had been less forthcoming than it otherwise might have been, because theywere the first Government to be visited and at that stage the Sixhad not yet been convinced of the sincerity of our desire to join the Community if we could find the right conditions for doing so.Our sincerity had been recognised in the course of the tour andthis had led to the more forthcoming attitude of the governments which had been visited last.Further evidence was available on the attitude of general de Gaulle from an interview which he had given to our Ambassadorthe previous day. General de Gaulle had made it clear that theproblem was one not of principle, but of timing.Certain issues were now much clearer in consequence of the tour. It was apparent that what mattered to the freedom of actionof the member Governments was not the text of the Treaties, butthe arrangements which had been worked out under them: inparticular, all Governments were determined to protect their vitalnational interests and the regulations made under the Treaties were sufficiently elastic to enable them to do so. It was also clear thatthe Five were conscious of the lack of political leadership in Europebut not unnaturally did not see the French Government providing it:they would accordingly welcome the accession of the UnitedKingdom. Finally, 1969 would be a critical year since a numberof issues were then due either to be renegotiated, such as the c.a.p.,or determined for the first time. If we were not a member weshould then have little or no influence on the course of events, butas a member we should have the same rights and influence as others.Nor should we have to deal with a firmly united Six in thenegotiations at that time. Attitudes and interests ranged widelyamong the Six in relation to the various issues in question, and the pattern of voting would undoubtedly change on our accession andon the accession which would probably occur at the same time ofsome three or four members of the European Free Trade Association(EFTA).In discussion, members of the Cabinet first sought elucidationof a number of issues arising from the tour and the following main points were raised:(a) Had not the attitude of the Federal German Governmentbeen affected by the timing of the visit? In reply it was explainedthat this had taken place immediately after the visit to the UnitedKingdom of the Soviet Prime Minister, Mr. Kosygin, during which
he had attacked German policies in a public speech, and had statedthat Germany would be forced to join a treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons. We had suffered some odium inconsequence. The Federal German Government had been underthe impression that work on nuclear weapons was advantageous,indeed highly important, to the development of civil uses of nuclear power arid hence had been particularly concerned at the effect ofthe non-proliferation treaty on their competitive ability in thelatter field. However, we had subsequently arranged for sir Solly Zuckerman, the Chief Scientific Adviser to theGovernment, to visit Germany for technical discussions and inconsequence of this and other discussions which the Germans had had with the United States Administration and ourselves it appeared that they now recognised that military nuclear work gave littleadvantage in respect of the development of civil uses and were less concerned at this aspect of the problem, although the discrimination against non-nuclear Powers which would inevitably be involved by a treaty of non-proliferation was still an irritant. The dispute over the offset arrangements in respect of the cost in foreign exchange of our forces in Germany was a further cause of difficulty,although it had been accepted on the visit that this should be keptas a separate problem for tripartite discussion with the UnitedStates and should not be related to our joining the e.c..(b) If we should decide to seek to join the e.c., would theproblems arising in EFTA be less than they had been at the timeof the negotiations in 1963? In reply it was stated that denmark and Norway (and the Republic of Ireland) would almost certainlyapply to join at the same time as ourselves and Austria was alreadynegotiating for membership. The attitude of Sweden had so farchanged that she was now also considering applying certainly forassociation, and possibly for membership. Switzerland might also apply for association, and only Portugal was unlikely to do so. in considering the attitude of the member countries of EFTA it shouldbe borne in mind that the policy of General de Gaulle in opposing the supra-national concept of the e.c. had greatly eased the political position of the members of EFTA, and in particular those who were concerned to maintain their political neutrality.(c) What had General de Gaulle had in mind when he had suggested, in the course of the discussions in Paris, that, rather thanpursue the question of the United Kingdom and perhaps othermembers of EFTA joining the e.c., the countries concerned should consider &quot; something new &quot; or some form of &quot; association &quot;? It wassuggested that it seemed improbable that he contemplated an industrial free trade area alone, since this would give the UnitedKingdom a competitive advantage because of our cheaperagricultural imports. It might well be that he had made thesuggestion either to deter the Five from supporting our applicationto join, by implying that this would result in a disruption of theCommunity, or else that he had sought merely to delay or divertan application by us for membership. In any event he had notreverted to this suggestion later.
id) Did the discussions during the tour of the problem ofcapital movements suggest that Article 70 (2) of the Treaty of Romemight provide a framework for arrangements which would meet our concern on the possibility that joining the Community would lead to excessive portfolio investment from the: United kingdom to third countries outside the enlarged Community? In reply itwas stated that a difficult problem still remained, but we might hope to obtain in the context of Article 70(2) an adequate transitionalarrangement until permanent arrangements could be devised tomeet the problems which might arise not only for ourselves but forthe Community as a whole from this issue.ie) Did not the action which General de Gaulle might take inthe event of our applying to join the Community call for furtherconsideration? It was argued that he and the French government as a whole were clearly opposed to our joining at the present timeand that none of the Five were prepared to have a confrontationwith France on this issue. In particular the Federal GermanGovernment, partly because of the nature of the coalition betweenthe two parties forming the Government and partly because of therecent revival of their close association with France, would beprepared to bring pressure to bear on General de Gaulle to accept our application, but not to the point of outright confrontation. Itmust, moreover, be borne in mind that the French Government hadthe right in the last resort under the Treaty of Rome to veto our entry. On the other hand, it was pointed out that there had beena substantial change since 1963 in the attitude of General de Gaulleto the question of United Kingdom accession, in consequence ofthe recent visits of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary. Theeffect of the recent French General Election on the ability of general de Gaulle to carry his opposition to extremes must also be takeninto account. The attitude of the leading members of the federal german Government in private discussions with the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary had, moreover, given good reason to suppose that they would be prepared to&apos; press upon the FrenchGovernment the acceptance of our entry, even although they mightwell think it inappropriate at the present time to bring this pressure to bear publicly. It was also greatly to the advantage of german industry that we should join, since only then would other membersof EFTA join, and the latter formed a major part of the Germanindustrial market, in which otherwise the EFTA preferential tariffwould hamper them. Much was likely to turn on the way in which any negotiations relating to our entry were conducted. Protractednegotiations would facilitate a French veto, but restriction of thenumber of issues which we sought to negotiate before entry, as opposed to settle after entry, might well make it impossible forGeneral de Gaulle in the last resort to impose a veto.In further discussion the Cabinet turned to consideration of the implications of the European talks for the essential British and commonwealth interests which would need to be safeguarded if
Britain were to enter the e.c., starting with the effects which would flow from our acceptance of the c.a.p.Common agricultural policyThere was general agreement that the reiteration in each ofthe capitals of the Six successively of the four main problems withwhich the Cabinet had considered the c.a.p. would confront us hadbeen effective in bringing home to the Six the necessity of makingadjustments in that policy to meet our difficulties. Elucidation wassought, and explanation given, on the following main points;(/) Had it been made sufficiently clear in what had been said about acceptance of the c.a.p., subject to adjustments to meet our difficulties, that this did not mean that we could accept that policysubject only to the concession to us of transitional periods in which to adapt ourselves to the requirements of the policy? In reply itwas stated that at no point had it been said that all our problemscould be solved by the concession of nothing more than transitionalperiods. The Foreign Secretary had stated that our attitude to thec.a.p. was somewhat like our attitude to the Treaty it need notnecessarily be an impediment to our entry provided that ourproblems could otherwise be solved. These problems had then been set out, in each capital, in ascending order of difficulty, startingwith the effects of the c.a.p. on our cost of living, on the pattern ofBritish agriculture, on Commonwealth trade, and finally on thebalance of payments. It had been made clear, particularly in regardto the effect on New Zealand and on our balance of payments, that something more than transitional arrangements would be required.The subsequent discussions had brought out that the importance ofthe discussions which the Six were bound to hold in 1968 and 1969in order to agree permanent financial provisions for the c.a.p., toreplace the present provisions which applied only to the transitional period terminating at the end of 1969. These discussions would afford the United Kingdom an opportunity, if by that time she had become a member of the Community, to negotiate from thatrelatively advantageous position new and more favourable provisions in regard to, e.g., the size of the Agricultural Fund, the amount oflevies to be paid and the amount which might be drawn back in agricultural assistance. Stress had been laid upon this possibilityby our friends among the Six, so that it had become clear that, totake an extreme example, if we were granted in this respecttransitional arrangements for a term of years extending up to 1970,and if wc became members before then, we could negotiate as members the financial arrangements which would apply to us from1970 onwards as part of the enlarged Community&apos;s new financial provisions.(g) Was there, in General de Gaulle&apos;s remark about &quot; somethingnew&quot; in the way of relationship between Britain and theCommunity, and perhaps between the existing members of theCommunity, a possibility which we might pick up and develop, of reaching a relationship with the Community which would not involve our acceptance of the c.a.p.?   If there were, it would be
wrong to disregard this possibility, since even as a member of theCommunity we should find that the basic interests of the Six, asagricultural protectionists who favoured high import prices,conflicted with our own; especially as the implications of this conflictin terms of the burden on our balance of payments were very serious.In reply it was stated that the talks had made it clear that if we were seriously to discuss our entry to the Community, it was meaninglessfor us to say that we could not accept the c.a.p. as such. In the talks we had been highly critical of the c.a.p., and it was interestingthat no member of the Six had supported it-they had rather taken the line that it had only been agreed with great difficulty over a long period of negotiation, and was an accepted part of Communitypolicy and arrangements which could not now be reversed to accommodate a new member. It had been in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s earlier discussions to stress the effects of the levy system as the most harmful single aspect of the c.a.p. for us, and ourestimates of our total payments under it if there were noadjustments, and indeed our argument that substantial adjustmentswould be necessary, had been supported by Dr. Mansholt, the member of the e.c. Commission for Agriculture. How far we could secure adequate adjustments, whether by drawing back substantial sums in respect of Community-approved grants for our agriculture,or by negotiating a ceiling on payments such as the Germans now had, was a matter for negotiation which had rightly not beenpursued at that stage. But we had pointed out that if we were toenter without adjustments both the Community&apos;s total income fromlevies would be increased, perhaps beyond the sum which they required, and that we should be paying a disproportionate part of it,perhaps as much as or more than the rest of the Six put together.In these respects adjustments would be essential. We should findsupport in the Six for such adjustments, but it would be unrealistic to expect that we could obtain any support for wholly reversing thec.a.p. or avoiding its obligations as a condition of our membership.(h) Had there been much discussion of the other effects of thec.a.p.? It would certainly mean a departure from our own systemof support which had been maintained successfully since the war;and it would destroy the pattern of British agriculture, requirestructural adjustments and reduce our imports of food from andtrade with the Commonwealth. In reply it was stated that the Sixhad been left in no doubt about these effects of the c.a.p. ThePrime Minister and Foreign Secretary had in particular explained in some detail, as the records made clear, the distorting effects itwould have on our production as between crops and livestock, andthe.consequences of this for our farmers, particularly small livestockfarmers and those in areas, e.g., in the west and north, which were less suited to cereal growing. It had been made clear that time andfinancial assistance would be necessary for us to meet the problems which would arise in this way; assistance from the Community to finance grants to our farmers could, of course, be one means of drawing back some of the excessive payments we should otherwise
make under the levy system. This suggestion had had a goodreception in a number of capitals of the Six, and it had also beenmade clear that it would be open to us to seek, in the Six&apos;s financial discussions in 1969, some re-negotiation of price levels, though wecould only expect to do this if we had become members and not as a condition of our accession; but the prospects of securingsignificant reductions in price levels were not great.Similarly we had pointed out the effects of the c.a.p. on commonwealth trade in agricultural produce if no adjustments weremade to it, and particular attention had been drawn to the need tomake arrangements which would safeguard the interests of themembers of the CSA: one way of dealing with this would be to prolong the CSA, which at present ran to 1974, pending the achievement of a new world sugar agreement, for which Dr.. Prebisch, Secretary-General of the United Nations conference for Trade and Development (UNCTAD), had been working underthe auspices of that organisation, though this suggestion had notbeen discussed. As regards cereals, the issues turned at present onthe outcome of the Kennedy Round discussions of a new worldagreement; but in so far as the problem remained for settlement with the Six, we should not find them wholly united against us: forexample the total imports of West Germany, Italy and Beneluxwere no more than twice ours, and those of Germany similar toours in volume but drawn much more from other members of theCommunity rather than overseas. Particular stress had been laid on the problems which the c.a.p. would create for New Zealand,and this had elicited a general response from all the Six that NewZealand&apos;s problems would require special treatment. There was noreason to expect serious problems over her supplies to us of mutton and lamb and, while butter presented more difficulty, the dispositionamong the Six to accept that New Zealand was a special caseimplied that her problems would be met if Britain&apos;s entry wasotherwise assured, whether by -a Morocco-type protocol or some form of association.(/) Other points made in discussion of the effects of the c.a.p.were that its application by the United Kingdom would prejudicethat very considerable part of our trade which at present was on a preferential basis with Australia, Canada, New Zealand and SouthAfrica: it would however be necessary here also to take account ofthe extent to which these countries had diversified and werediversifying their trade, and of the effects of the Kennedy Round.It would also be necessary to review the working of the levy system,including the fixing of target and guide prices, in relation to possible future courses of world prices,u and the implications which these factors might have for the future cost of the c.a.p. to our balanceof payments. Further discussion would be necessary on these points at a later stage of the Cabinefs consideration.The Cabinet then discussed what procedure should be adoptedin their further consideration of the problems presented by thedecision whether or not to apply for membership of the e.c.. Forthis purpose it would be desirable to have further studies bringing
out in detail what would be the impact on essential British and commonwealth interests of membership of the Community, on different assumptions as to the conditions which might be expectedto prevail over the next few years. It was pointed out that suchassessments were bound to include a speculative element even if a range of assumptions were taken, owing to the uncertainties as tothe way in which, for example, world prices might change. It wouldalso be necessary to take into account courses alternative to that nowunder discussion and in particular the relative advantages and disadvantages which would accrue if we were able to take part inthe formation of a North Atlantic Free Trade Area, or if we wereto continue our present course in association with EFTA and theCommonwealth without forming radical new relationships with anyother group of countries. In this connection, it would be important to make the best possible assessment of the future state of our economy on various assumptions, with reference both to thepossibilities of development of our economy on each of these three courses and to the implications for the timing of any further discussions with the Community or with other parties of the likelyprogress of our economic recovery.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thediscussion had gone some way to bring out the implications ofwhat had been learned in the talks with the Heads of Governmentsof the Six as regards the difficulties presented by British membership of the e.c., with particular reference to agriculture. It remainedhowever to complete that discussion in relation to the other main difficulties in the way of our accession to the Community, i.e.,freedom of capital movements, and any questions still outstandingon Commonwealth trade, and on regional policies. It would alsobe necessary, to complete these initial discussions, for the Cabinet toconsider the problems which the Six for their part had raised with us during the talks, and the implications these might have for our future policy. This further discussion might conveniently be taken at the meeting of the Cabinet on Thursday, 6th April. Thereafter itwould be right to move to the second stage of the discussion, namely the consideration of the relative merits of the alternative coursesbefore us. This second stage of discussion should be based uponthe further paper concerning the European alternatives which heand the Foreign Secretary, at the meeting of the Cabinet on 9th March, had undertaken to prepare and circulate; and it wouldbe appropriate to take with this paper the reports by officials onthe other possible alternatives, i.e., a North Atlantic Free trade area, and a continuation of our present policies and associations,which the Cabinet at their discussions in October and November1966 had asked to be prepared. The discussion of these reports and of the paper on the European alternatives, might convenientlystart at the meeting of the Cabinet on 13th April; the decisionsinvolved were momentous and it would be appropriate to devotetwo or three meetings of the Cabinet to them. It would be necessaryto bear in mind, in this later stage of the discussion, that the
Cabinefs decisions might well be influenced, particularly as regardstiming, by external events such as the progress of the Kennedy!Round.It would be necessary, whilst these discussions were proceeding,for the strictest confidence to be maintained about them. It was known that the Cabinet were discussing the future policy of theGovernment on these large matters, and public interest would be correspondingly intense. The papers before the Cabinet at thepresent meeting, and those which he had indicated should come before it at future meetings, should therefore be restricted to members of the Cabinet; and any references in Ministerial speechesto the Cabinefs deliberations should be limited to indicating thatthe Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary had reported theresults of their European discussions and that the Cabinet were nowexamining the issues which had arisen from those discussions.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the procedure which the!Prime Minister indicated in his summing up of theirjdiscussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd March, 1967.
