CC1 (67)confidential. The Prime Minister expressed to his colleagues, on theoccasion of the first meeting of the Cabinet in 1967, his good wishesfor a happy and successful year. He extended to Mr. gordon walker, mp, on behalf of the Cabinet, a warm welcome on hisrejoining the Government.Ministers should take this opportunity to remind themselves, andto remind their junior Ministers, of the importance of observing the established rules of procedure which were designed to ensure the prompt and efficient despatch of public business by the Cabinet andits Committees. In particular, punctual attendance at meetings ofthe Cabinet should normally have priority over all other Ministerialengagements; adequate advance notice, of seven days, should begiven in relation to any business which a Minister wished to bring before the Cabinet; and, save in cases of extreme urgency, theCabinet should not be invited to consider a memorandum until twoclear working days after it had been circulated. Henceforward these principles should be strictly observed.They were no less applicable to the conduct of business by cabinet Committees. In addition, a fresh attempt should be madeto ensure the maximum devolution of business from the Cabinet toits Committees; and the Committees themselves should seek to give more positive expression to the concept of collective responsibility in disposing of business by endeavouring to reach final and conclusivedecisions to the greatest possible extent. It should therefore beaccepted that individual Ministers should not, as a normal rule,appeal to the Cabinet against the decision of a Committee unless theChairman of the Committee himself agreed; and exceptions to this principle should not be permitted without the Prime Minister&apos;s ownauthority.Finally, it remained important to take all possible precautionsto preserve the confidential character of the Government^ discussions and decisions in the Cabinet and its Committees. Prematuredisclosures were always discreditable and could, on occasion, be damaging; and it was incumbent upon all Ministers to ensure thatthe necessary precautions to avoid them were instituted and enforcedin their Departments and Offices.secret. The Foreign Secretary said that, despite the limited sources of information at our disposal, it was fairly certain that many of thePress reports about the internal disturbances in the People&apos;s republic of China were exaggerated. In particular there was little evidencethat violence had broken out in Peking and Shanghai on the scalealleged. So far as we could ascertain Mao Tse-tung and his principallieutenant, Lin. Piao, were still in control of the situation; and, sincethe Red Guards who were the main agents of the disturbances were dependent for their facilities on the Army which recognised the7704-1
authority of Lin Piao, the faction led by Mao Tse-tung might eventually prevail. But, whatever the outcome of the internal strugglefor power which was now in process in China, it was improbable that there would be any major change in the main Chinese policies,except in so far as Chinese pressure upon India might ease and theChinese Government might be unable to prevent the SovietGovernment from adopting a rather more positive attitude towardsthe problem of the war in Vietnam.The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the prospects of resolving the conflict in Vietnam remained confused and uncertain;but they were perhaps slightly more hopeful than hitherto. we ourselves were maintaining our efforts, both in public and byconfidential diplomatic discussions with the Governments of theUnited States and the Soviet Union, to promote some form ofmediation between the parties to the dispute; and there now seemedto be some prospect, as the result of recent developments, thatcontact between them might perhaps be established. Meanwhile,although we must continue to deplore the United States bombing of north Vietnam, it would be impolitic to dissociate ourselves from united States policy, especially since we had reason to believe thatthe United States President, although determined not to exposeUnited States prestige to a rebuff, was continuing to resist pressurewithin his Administration for the adoption of more extreme military measures against North Vietnam. Nevertheless, the risk of escalationwould clearly increase if the conflict persisted; and it thereforeremained urgent to take advantage of any opportunity to bring the hostilities to an end.The Foreign Secretary said that the President of Cyprus,Archbishop Makarios, had recently arranged to import into Cyprusseveral consignments of both light and heavy arms from czechoslovakia. This action had probably been taken without theknowledge of the Greek Government; and the nature of theconsignments was clearly incompatible with the Archbishop&apos;s claim that the arms were required only to re-equip the local police force.Action already taken had in fact prevented the export of the secondconsignment; and we were now engaged in trying to prevent thedistribution of the first consignment, which had arrived in Cyprus.The best means of ensuring this would be to secure agreement thatthe arms in question should be put under United Nations control.If, however, this proved unacceptable to Archbishop Makarios andthe weapons were in fact distributed, we must at least try to ensurethat they would be inspected at frequent and regular intervals by united Nations representatives in order to prevent any attempt tomisappropriate them.The episode had naturally caused considerable concern to boththe Greek and the Turkish Governments; and we must, hope that itwould not prejudice the confidential discussions in which they were engaged in a renewed attempt to solve the problem of Cyprus byagreement. Archbishop Makarios would be bound to seek to frustrate these discussions; and so far as possible we should deny himany opportunity of doing so.
Prices andIncomesPolicy(previous reference:CC (66) 67thConclusions,Minute 6)increase of pay forLimb FittersCONFIDENTIAL3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the First Secretaryof State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 1) andthe Minister of Health (C (67) 2) about the course the Governmentshould take in relation to an increase of pay for limb fitters.The First Secretary of State said that in August 1966 (i.e., duringthe period of the standstill on prices and incomes) the firm ofJ. E. Hanger and Company had reached agreement with theAssociation of Supervisory Staffs and Technicians (ASSET) for anincrease of pay of  100 per annum to limb fitters employed by theCompany. Because of the standstill, the increase was not thenimplemented and ASSET had in consequence imposed a work-to-rule in all limb fitting centres. The Company had subsequently agreedto pay the increase from 2nd January and the work-to-rule had been called off on 5th December. The increase could in no way be reconciled with the criteria for increases of pay during the period of severe restraint. The Ministers mainly concerned had thereforeagreed that the question of limb fitters&apos; pay and the related issue of increased productivity should be referred to the National Board for prices and Incomes (NBPI). In order that the Government shouldnot be thought to be acting precipitately in a case where hardship to disabled people might be involved, no Order under the Prices and incomes Act had been made at that stage, but the parties had been requested to defer implementation of the increase until the NBPI had reported. The Company, however, had rejected this request and the .increase had in fact been paid from 2nd January.The question was whether the Government should now make an Order which would have the effect of rescinding the increase fromthe date the Order was made. If this were done, ASSET might againimpose a work-to-rule, though this should not be taken for granted in view of the public criticism they had incurred on the previous occasion. Although only a small number of employees was involved,the difficulties of ensuring general observance of the policy of severe restraint would be greatly increased if the increase were accepted.While the Government^ policy on prices&apos;- and incomes had gaineda wide degree of voluntary acceptance hitherto, this was on the basisof a general understanding that, if the majority voluntarily acceptedthe policy, any minority who chose to defy it would be brought into line by the exercise of statutory powers. It would be particularlydamaging if this were not done in the present case, since it would represent a victory for ASSET which had throughout taken a militantline in opposition to the policy. If other trade unions saw that the tactics employed by ASSET were successful, they might follow thesame course. It would be impossible to make the policy effective ifthe impression were given that the Government were not preparedto withstand industrial action. An Order should therefore be maderescinding the increase.The Minister of Health said that the previous work-to-rule had had a serious effect on the treatment of the limbless and many patientsCC1(67).
had suffered considerable hardship. If the Government were to make an Order now, the work-to-rule would probably be resumed. we might then have to face a protracted period of up to six monthsduring which there would be increasing hardship. Little could bedone to provide alternative arrangements for maintaining thelimb fitting service. This situation would be regarded by the public as the direct result of a deliberate decision by the Government, whowould have difficulty in defending their position. Any question ofmaking an Order should be postponed until after the NBPI had reported.In discussion, it was suggested that the right course would be forthe Government to refrain from making an Order, but to announcepublicly that they were doing so solely on the grounds of preventinghardship to the disabled. The justification for this course would berecognised by the trade unions who would be unlikely to use it as alever to secure further breaches of the policy.On the other hand it was argued that the present case was beingclosely watched by other workers and trade unions and if the increasewere allowed to go unchallenged, there was little doubt that the policyof severe restraint would be seriously weakened. If an Order weremade and the work-to-rule were again imposed, most people would regard this as a calculated challenge to the Government by men whowere prepared to use hardship to the disabled as a means of blackmail.While the Government might be criticised in some quarters, theodium was likely to fall principally on the limb fitters and on ASSET.If no Order were made at present, the Government would face thesame problem again when the NBPI reported in some two months&apos;time, if their report did not endorse the increase. There was nothing to be gained by such postponement and the right course was to make an Order now.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the Government would be justifiedin making an Order rescinding the increase. The public presentation of the decision would be important; it should be made clear that theGovernment were taking this action because they were not preparedto see a minority of workers gaining advantages (and by theobjectionable use of an emotional situation) while the majority werevoluntarily accepting restraint.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State(i) To make an Order under Part IV of the Prices and incomes Act rescinding the increase paid since2nd January to limb fitters employed by J. E. Hangerand Company.(ii) To consult with the Lord President of the Council onthe public presentation of this decision.
CC1 (67)goCONFIDENTIALCommercialPolicy(previous reference:CC (66) 59thConclusions,Minute 4)Statistics ofImportedMachinery4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (67) 4) and by the President of the Board of Trade (C (67) 5) aboutstatistics of imported machinery.The First Secretary of State said that the Economic development committees (EDCs) for the Mechanical Engineering Machine Toolindustries had asked the Government to make available to themcertain information about imports  of machinery which  they considered essential if they were to achieve any success in theirattempts to reduce imports by increasing and improving UnitedKingdom  production.    Previous  discussion  in  the ministerial committee on Economic Development showed that the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Financial Secretary, Treasury, consideredthat, since the information sought by the Committees had been collected under statute by the Board of Customs and Excise solely for revenue purposes, its release to the EDCs would represent a breach of the principle of confidentiality which would be damaging to the efficient operation of the Customs and Excise and, morebroadly, to the Governments collection of statistics from industry.In these circumstances, they believed that a trial should be given toa compromise proposal by which the Ministry of Technology wouldextract the relevant information from that supplied to the customs and Excise and process it in such a way as to give the maximuminformation without disclosing the name of the maker of themachinery. The scheme had been considered by officials so far onlyin respect of machine tools and on an experimental basis.   The,Minister of Technology and he considered, on the other hand, thatthe importance of the work being done by the EDCs on importsubstitution outweighed the disadvantages put forward and that the compromise proposal would not only be laborious and costly in theuse of skilled manpower, but also would be inadequate for its purpose.They therefore considered that the EDCs should be given theinformation they required.   The Attorney-General had, however,now advised that the Board of Customs and Excise would be ultravires in supplying the EDCs with the information required fromdocuments furnished by traders under the Customs and Excise Actand that legislation would be necessary before such action could betaken.   The importance of saving imports was so great that, ifnecessary, legislation should be p asscd, but it was open to questionwhether information obtained by the Government for one purposecould not in fact properly be used for another purpose withoutjustifying allegations that it was illegal or a breach of confidence.In particular the present proposal only involved revealing the names of the makers of foreign machinery which was imported and notthe names of the importers.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had considered whether the information required by the EDCs might be obtained by other means, under the census or the Board of Trade licensing
procedures or from the information collected in the administrationof investment grants. Information obtainable under these variousprocedures would, however, either be inadequate or its disclosurewould be ultra vires. Although the information desired by theEDCs should be of some real value to their work, there was objectionto embarking on fresh legislation to enable this to be providedwithout a further assessment of the need and of the broader effect which such legislation might have on the co-operation of industry involuntarily making information available on the understanding thatit would not lead to any breach of confidence.In discussion it was urged that it would be undesirable to pass legislation to permit the Government to make available theinformation in question, even though this might be helpful to thework of the EDCs on the substitution of imports, since this would put seriously at risk the co-operation of industry in the provision of statistics. This was crucial not only to the effective administrationof customs procedure, but also to the whole field of statistical returns.Furthermore, such action would endanger the effectiveness of currentinternational co-operation in customs procedures, in which UnitedKingdom interests in relation to our exports might be put seriouslyat risk. In these circumstances, it was suggested that a further trialshould be given to the compromise procedure which had earlier been proposed. On the other hand, it was pointed out that not only wasthe compromise procedure highly wasteful of skilled manpower, butit did not yield the information which the EDCs required. It was argued that the need for the substitution of imports was of such importance to the national interest that it should override thepractical and legal objections to making it available. Discussion ofthis issue in the National Economic Development Council (NEDC)had revealed no opposition to the proposal on the part of industryand in these circumstances it seemed improbable that its acceptancewould put at risk the future co-operation of industry in the provisionof statistics. Moreover, failure to co-operate on the part of importerswas inherently unlikely since they had a direct interest in theexpeditious clearance of imported goods. It was also argued that itwas doubtful whether any action&apos;for damages which might be brought by an importer of machinery on the ground that his interests hadbeen damaged by the disclosure of the statistics in question to theEDCs (and hence perhaps to his competitors) could in fact succeed in proving damage. In these circumstances, it was suggested that legislation should not be introduced until such time as the need for itmight be demonstrated by such action in the courts.In further discussion there was general acceptance that theimportance to the national interest of the substitution of imports was so great that the information requested should be made available tothe EDCs. Since, however, the Attorney-General had advised thatthe provision of this information would under existing legislation beultra vires it was clearly necessary to pass legislation in order to validate such action. It was, however, questionable whether early legislation should be passed on this narrow issue or whether it shouldbe delayed until the broader issue of the disclosure of information
c.t. (67)and the voluntary co-operation of industry in the collection of statistics could be reviewed in the light of the consideration currently being given to the means necessary to improve the range of statistical information available to the Government.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were on balance agreed that the information required bythe EDCs in the interests of import saving should be made availableto them and the Chairmen could be so informed in confidence.Further consideration was, however, required of the nature of thelegislation which would be necessary to validate the transmission ofthis information and of its relationship to any wider legislation whichmight possibly be necessary at a later stage on the collection of statistics in a wider field. It might however prove to be necessary for legislation to be passed at a very early date on the immediate issue and also for legislation to be introduced at a later stage covering the broader issue. The terms and implications of legislation on theimmediate issue should now be considered as a matter of urgency bythe Ministers concerned. Until Ministers had taken decisions in thelight of such further consideration and discussion it would not bepossible to announce the decision to make the information availableto the EDCs.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the President of the Boardof Trade, the Minister of Technology and the Attorney-General(a) to consider the terms and implications of the legislation which would be necessary to validate the supply to the Economic Development Committees of theinformation which they sought about imports ofmachinery; and(b) to consider the implications of Conclusion 2 (a) forthe expansion and improvement of the collection and publication of statistics by the Governmentand for legislation which might be required in thatconnection.(3) Invited the First Secretary of State to inform in confidencethe Chairman of the Economic Development committees for the Mechanical Engineering and Machine ToolIndustries that the information about the imports ofmachinery which they required in pursuit of their attempts to save imports would later be made available.CONFIDENTIAL7704-1 n
telecommunications-municationsIndustry(previous reference:CC (66) 52ndConclusions,Minute 5)Pye ofCambridgeLimitedSECRET*5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (.67) 6) about take-over bids for Pye of CambridgeLimited.The Minister of Technology said that an application for exchange control consent for the acquisition of Pye Limited had been receivedfrom Philips Electronic Holdings, which was a subsidiary of PhilipsIndustries which in turn was wholly owned by N. V. Philips ofEindhoven, Netherlands. Thorn Electrical were also bidding forPye, but if Thorn and Philips were left to bid against each other for control Philips would probably win. The latest Philips offer, whichhad been announced but not yet formally put to shareholders, was equivalent to 12 shillings a share, which valued Pye at  30 million.Philips were considering making their offer in a form in which thewhole of the consideration would be cash brought in from overseas.Two alternative courses might be adopted with dealing with theapplication from Philips (i) to refuse exchange control consent to Philips so that Thornwould gain control. Since at present the highest known bidwas that of Philips, no action would on this course be taken until Thorn made known a higher bid; at that pointPhilips would be informed that exchange control consentwould not be forthcoming should they put in a counter-bid; or(ii) to negotiate appropriate undertakings now with Philips asa condition of exchange control consent; subject to theiraccepting such conditions Philips would be left to bidagainst Thorn and if they were successful, exchange control consent would be given.The terms of the undertakings which he proposed should be required from Philips were set out in Annex B of C (67) 6.In his view, the first of these courses was to be preferred. Thiswould not be a case of a foreign, firm bringing in new technologicalexpertise; on the contrary, Pye had an important technological leadin radio telephones and there could be no guarantee that Philipswould not exploit this for their own purposes in a way contrary to theUnited Kingdom interest. Undertakings might be obtained fromPhilips in this matter, but they would be difficult to enforce. It hadbeen suggested that refusal of exchange control consent to Philipswould be a sharp reversal of existing policy, which was to refuseconsent only to protect the balance of payments. It was arguable,however, that a take-over by Philips would adversely affect thebalance of payments in the long term. If the Government allowed a take-over by Philips, they would incur severe criticism especially as this would follow immediately upon the decision to allow thetake-over of Rootes Motors Limited by the Chrysler Corporation ofthe United States.  The Government should, therefore, indicate to* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
7704-1Philips at the appropriate time that exchange control consent wouldnot be forthcoming.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said he doubted whether therewould be any significant public reaction if the take-over by Philipswere permitted. Philips had operated in this country for years andhad assets in the United Kingdom amounting to nearly  150 million.Many people regarded them as a British firm and in fact PhilipsElectronic Holdings would be technically a United Kingdomcompany. The Government could ensure that the national interest was safeguarded by requiring suitable undertakings as a conditionof exchange control consent. A major firm like Philips were most unlikely to attempt to break such undertakings, which would be made public; but if they did, the Government would have means of redress.Philips claimed that one of their motives in bidding for Pye was toprevent the Company falling into United States hands; if Thorn were successful, this was conceivable since there was already a substantialUnited States minority holding in Thorn. Refusal of exchange control consent would not only discourage inward investment intothe United Kingdom, but might also encourage similar action by foreign countries with adverse consequences for British-owned firmsabroad. It would therefore be preferable to put to Philips appropriateundertakings and, if these were accepted, to leave Philips to bidagainst Thorn.In discussion, it was argued that the Government would bejustified in stopping a take-over by Philips whose motives werebasically predatory and who would not be introducing newtechnological or managerial skills. Refusal of consent would leavethe field clear for Thorn, which might be regarded as undulyfavouring an individual firm; but this objection might be overcome by encouraging a British consortium to bid for Pye: this possibility should be explored.On the other hand, it was pointed out that a take-over byPhilips would bring immediate benefit to the foreign exchangereserves. Philips had bigger resources than Thorn which was alsounduly dependent on a single man: there was, therefore, moreassurance that the former would provide efficient management in thelong term. It was also an important consideration that a refusal ofconsent to Philips would be politically embarrassing at a time whenthe Prime Minister and the Foreign Secretary were visiting thecapitals of the European Economic Community to discuss ourjoining it.In further discussion, the following points were made:(a) It was unsatisfactory that the Government had no power toprevent the take-over of a British firm by foreign interests exceptthrough exchange control or by a reference to the monopolies commission under Monopolies and Mergers Act. The formerprocedure limited the grounds on which a take-over could be stopped,and the latter was not always practicable because the Monopoly
Commission would normally take some months to deal with the reference and it was in many cases not possible to delay matters tothis extent. Consideration should be given to the Government takingpower, possibly in the Companies Bill now before Parliament, to stop a take-over by a foreign firm where they judged this to be againstthe national interest.(b) The terms of the proposed undertakings to be required fromPhilips which were set out in Annex B to C (67) 6 might be tooonerous in some respects and should not be such as to frustrateacquisition. In particular, it would be undesirable to insist onPhilips nominating a director of United Kingdom nationality to theBoard of the Netherlands parent Company as proposed in paragraph 4of the Annex, since an undertaking to this effect would set a precedentwhich might adversely affect wider British interests if it were followedby other countries.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that the Government should not seek toprevent a take-over of Pye by Philips through refusal of exchange control consent, provided that reasonable undertakings could be negotiated with Philips. The Minister of Technology, in consultationwith other Ministers concerned, should give further consideration tothe terms of the proposed undertakings in the light of the points madein discussion. In particular we should not seek the appointment of a united Kingdom director to the Netherlands Board. He should endeavour to negotiate suitable undertakings with Philips and should consult with the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of theExchequer, the President of the Board of Trade and himself before these were completed. For the future, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Technology should consider whether theGovernment ought to take power, possibly in the Companies Bill, toprevent a take-over by a foreign firm, which they judged to be contrary to the national interest.The Cabinet  &apos;*(1) Agreed that the Government should give exchange controlconsent to Philips Electronic Holdings if they made a successful bid for the acquisition of Pye Limited, providedthat Philips gave satisfactory undertakings.(2) Invited the Minister of Technology to consider further, inthe light of the discussion and in consultation with theFirst Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequerand the President of the Board of Trade, the terms of theproposed undertakings set out in Annex B to C (67) 6.(3) Invited the Minister of Technology, subject to Conclusion (2),to communicate the terms of the proposed undertakings to Philips Electronic Holdings and to consult the PrimeMinister, the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer and the President of the Board of Tradebefore the negotiations were completed.
SECRET*6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that Mr. Fowler, theUnited States Secretary to the Treasury, M. Debre, the french minister of Finance, and Professor Schiller, the German FederalMinister of Economics, had accepted his invitation to come toLondon for discussions during the week-end beginning 21st January.The main object would be to seek agreement between theGovernments concerned on a general reduction of rates of interest.If the discussions were successful they would substantially assist both our balance of payments and the internal economy of the UnitedKingdom. They would no doubt also range more widely on general international financial policy. An announcement of the meeting would be made during the following week but would not, of course,refer to the intention to discuss rates of interest, since this would encourage speculation.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.confidential . The Home Secretary said that officials of the Departmentsconcerned had met to consider the effects if the Associated society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen should carry out their threat to begin to work to rule from Monday, 16th January. It was difficultto assess the possible duration and extent of the dispute and its effects, but initially the main problem would relate to daily travelinto and out of London and the big cities. Although it was not expected that many trains would be cancelled, they would run lateand journeys would take substantially longer. The ministers concerned were keeping the matter under close observation and ifthe threat to work to rule had not been withdrawn by the afternoon of Sunday, 15th January, the police would be authorised to put intoeffect the contingency plans that had already been made for emergency car parks in London and the big cities and for the* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, the first secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Technology, whether the Governmentshould take power to prevent the take-over of a UnitedKingdom firm by a foreign firm where they judged this to be contrary to the national interest.
cancellation of the start of any new road works which were not essential. No publicity would be given to these arrangements inorder to avoid undue encouragement to travel by road without it being clear at that stage that the railways would not after all be ableto cope with the traffic.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Home Secretary.Europe(previous reference:CC (66) 67thConclusions,Minute 2)Visit to Headsof Governmentof the EuropeanEconomicCommunityCONFIDENTIAL8. The Cabinet had before them a note (C (67) 3) by theSecretary of the Cabinet to which was attached a steering brief forthe visit of the Prime Minister and Foreign Secretary to Rome on16th and 17th January.The Prime Minister said that the steering brief, which had been revised in the light of the discussions of the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy, was in accordance with theconclusions of the Cabinet in respect of the visits to be paid by theForeign Secretary and himself to the Heads of Government of the member countries of the European Economic Community. On thosevisits he and the Foreign Secretary would of course restrict themselvesto the range and nature of the discussions which had been approvedby the Cabinet. They would report the outcome but would not makeinterim reports unless special circumstances arising from any visitmade this desirable. In these circumstances, and having regard tothe length of the meeting that morning, the Cabinet might be disposed to approve the steering brief without further discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statement by the PrimeMinister.(2) Approved the steering brief attached to C (67) 3.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th January, 1967.
