OverseaAffairsMiddle East(previous reference:CC (67) 41stConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the debate on the middle east in the General Assembly of the United Nations was likely to end late that week or early the following week. The objective ofthe Soviet Union, which might be achieved, was to obtain a two-thirds majority for a resolution condemning Israel, calling upon her to withdraw from conquered territory and to pay compensation to the Arab States; although this would have no legal validity, itwould then enable the Soviet Union to take the matter up in theSecurity Council and to press there for sanctions against Israel.A group of States led by Yugoslavia was working for a modifiedresolution which was more likely to obtain the necessary two-thirds majority in the General Assembly; although this resolution wouldbe somewhat milder, it would still open the way for the sameaction to be taken by the Soviet Union in the Security Council.A larger group of European, Asian, African and South american states was attempting to reach agreement on a resolution whichwould take account of all the factors bearing on a solution of theMiddle East problem; although we were not openly taking the leadon this resolution, we were assisting its sponsors and we hoped thatit would be such that we could support it and that it would obtain a majority in the General Assembly. It might then be possible toarrange for representatives of the United Nations to go to theMiddle East and for the United Nations Emergency Force to bere-established in a strengthened form. Although the passage of twoconflicting resolutions by the General Assembly would adversely affect the prestige of the United Nations, if the Soviet resolutionalone were to be passed it would raise the possibility that theUnited States and ourselves might subsequently have to considervetoing a resolution in the Security Council.There were grave problems in the territory occupied by Israelwest of the Jordan River; we were endeavouring to persuade Israelto prevent the further movement of refugees out of the area andto encourage those who had fled to return. Any improvement inthe situation depended very much on the attitude, particularly inrelation to the United Arab Republic (UAR), of King Hussein of jordan, who would be visiting London at the beginning of thefollowing week. Any improvement in the situation would be verydifficult to achieve as long as the Government of Jordan continuedto brand as traitors anyone who had dealings with Israel. Asregards Jerusalem, although Israel had not formally annexed theOld City she had taken action which had the same practical effect and this Would make an eventual settlement much more difficult.8183CONFIDENTIALParliament 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.
Aerial photographs now available of the Suez Canal showed that there were 10 obstacles in it and it seemed clear that the uar had been responsible for most, if not all, of these. It was estimated that it would take the UAR alone two months to clear the Canal. We were working with other countries primarily concerned to secure the re-opening of the Canal; although it was open to us in law to seek an injunction by the International Courtof Justice at The Hague, it would be difficult for us to do so singe,unlike the UAR, we had made reservations about the jurisdiction of the Court in a number of fields. The prospects for re-openingof the Canal were obscure, but some means of achieving it mightbe found when the Special Session of the United Nations general assembly had been completed. The UAR had said that the Canalwould not be re-opened until Israeli forces had been withdrawnfrom its eastern bank, but her economic situation had been seriouseven before the recent hostilities and it was difficult to see howshe could afford the loss of earnings from the Canal, which amounted to between  6-8 million a week, unless the Soviet Uniongave her massive support. The situation inside the UAR wasconfused and President Nasser appeared to be having difficulty infirmly re-establishing his position. Foreign consulates in the canal zone had been closed and since the cessation of hostilities therehad been large deliveries of arms from the Soviet Union to the uar; their nature was not clear but, although there had beenreports that sophisticated weapons such as rockets might beincluded in them, this was not considered probable. It appearedhowever that large numbers of MiG aircraft had been included.Israel was now adopting a relatively moderate attitude towards theterritorial aspects of a settlement in the Middle East problem,provided she could obtain guarantees for her security and essentialrights.Approach to europe(previous reference:CC (67) 41stConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The Foreign Secretary said that we had reliable information that our application to join the European Communities had been strongly supported by the Five at the meeting of the ministerial council of the European Economic Community (e.c.) earlier that week. In the upshot it had been decided that our application tojoin the Community should be remitted for examination and reportby the e.c. Commission by the end of September. France hadnot opposed this but, in pursuit of her policy of raising difficulties and causing delay in considering our application, had prevented the unanimous agreement among member States of the Communitythat was necessary before we could present our case to the Council.The Foreign Ministers of Belgium and Germany had then taken the lead in proposing that we should make our opening statement at a meeting of the Ministerial Council of the Western european union (WEU) (which was in effect a meeting of the Six and ourselves) early in the following week and France had been unableto oppose this.   It was the strong view of the members of the
Community other than France that we should take advantage ofthis opportunity to maintain the momentum of our approach to europe and, subject to the agreement of the Cabinet, he would attend the WEU Council meeting on 4th or 5th July and make afull opening statement. This would be published as a White paper and sent formally both to the WEU and to the e.c.; he hopedthat it would be approved at a meeting of the ministerial committee on the Approach to Europe on 3rd July but, ifnecessary, it would be brought before the Cabinet oh 4th July.In discussion there was general agreement that the foreign secretary should, as proposed, make a statement to the Council ofWEU, since otherwise we should appear to have disregarded theadvice of our supporters in the e.c. and to have accepted theFrench view that the matter was not urgent. The statement shouldbe discussed interdepartmentally in the normal way, on the basis that, although it could be amended as regards points of detail and presentation, its substance should not depart from the cabinet&apos;s earlier decision in principle to seek membership of the e.c.; and,in view of its political importance, the final draft should beconsidered by the Cabinet.Zambia(previous reference:CC (67) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2)The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should make a statement on our application to join the European economic community at the meeting the following week of the ministerial Council of the Western European Union.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to circulate the draft of sucha statement for consideration at their next meeting.The Commonwealth Secretary said that on 14th March theagrement to the appointment of Mr. Simbuleas High Commissioner(Designate) for Zambia in London had been signed. SubsequentlyMr. Simbule had made a vicious attack on the United kingdom in a speech at Dar es Salaam and, although we had sought an explanation of the speech and had asked that there should either be an apology or that Mr. Simbule should be replaced, there hadbeen no direct response from President Kaunda or from the zambian authorities. Despite our request that he should not do soMr. Simbule had in the meantime arrived in this country and was now seeking to present his credentials to The Queen and to obtainour agreement to a statement which dealt with his speech. this statement did not express regret but was to the effect that he hadbeen told that the frankness that he could normally use in talkingto his fellow Africans might have hurt the feelings of some people inthis country and that, if so, he regarded it as unfortunate. If wewere to accept Mr. Simbule&apos;s statement, which would be published,it would mean conceding that we accepted his right to make the attack despite the special relationship which he would have to thiscountry as High Commissioner. It was also clear that there wouldbe strong opposition in Parliament to this, particularly against the
background of recent attacks on our diplomatic representatives inChina and of the fact that in recent months we had decided towithdraw representatives from two Commonwealth countries as aresult of much less justifiable criticism of them by the Governmentsof those countries. We had to bear in mind that a rupture of relations with Zambia might follow if we refused to acceptMr. Simbule and that this might have serious political and economic consequences for us in view of the importance of Zambian copperand of the presence of large numbers of British subjects in Zambia;there was moreover a risk that President Kaunda might lose his power to the Foreign Minister, Mr. Kapwepwe. Nevertheless, he believed that we must insist that the draft statement which mr. Simbule had sent should be amended to indicate his regret athaving made an attack on us and that if he would not agree to this,either because he was himself unwilling or because he was under instructions not to do so, we should Muse to accept him as HighCommissioner.In discussion doubts were expressed at the wisdom of riskingour economic interests in order to secure an explicit expression ofregret from Mr. Simbule. The general view was, however, that thedraft statement which Mr. Simbule had put forward was not satisfactory and that further attempts should be made to agree withhim a modified wording expressing regret at the impression thathis speech had made in this country.The Cabinet (4) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to seek to reach agreement with Mr. Simbule on a redraft of his statement on the lines indicated in their discussion.Oil SupplySituationThe Arab oilsituation:Russian oil andother aspects(previous reference:CC (67) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET*3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of power on the Arab oil situation (C (67) 112) and on petroleumprices (C (67) 113).The Minister of Power said that the situation in respect of available supplies of oil had not altered substantially since theprevious discussion by the Cabinet on this subject. Iraq had started to pump oil but Libya had not yet resumed production despitehopes that she would do so shortly. Nevertheless, the basicproblem now was one of transport and cost, rather than of supply.A limited agreement had been reached in the Oil Committee of theOrganisation for Economic Co-operation and Development whichwould ease co-operation on the equitable distribution of available supplies. Preparations for the introduction of rationing were being pursued in case this should become necessary. Rationing could being early in September if the situation then made it necessary.In discussion on this aspect there was general agreement that unless the situation deteriorated it would be preferable not to seek to introduce rationing during August, particularly as administrative
difficulties made it impracticable to bring the date forward by morethan a week or two. The need for rationing would be considered further at the time. The Cabinet were also informed that developments in Nigeria put at risk the continued availability ofNigerian oil.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Power.Petroleum prices the Minister of Power said that the situation imposed extracosts on the oil industry amounting on an average to at least 2 a ton. The continuation of the present crisis for six monthsmight cost the United Kingdom between  60 and  80 million inextra foreign exchange. The increased costs would have to be metthrough surcharges which, if spread evenly as the leading companiesadvocated, would be equal to 2d. a gallon on all products. It wouldminimise the effect on the economy if the surcharges were such asto bear more heavily on petrol than on other products, but thescope for variation was not large, partly because petrol formed only15 per cent of total sales and partly because of other difficulties ofsupply and in the process of refining. The Government had no power to order specific changes in prices, but he proposed to includesuch powers in new legislation which would be required in thenear future to enable rationing to be introduced without relying on emergency regulations. In these circumstances the best coursewould be to agree to an increase of  2 per ton in respect of crude oil and to weight the surcharge on petrol by increasing the price by4d. a gallon. The surcharge on other main oil products wouldthen be about l^d. a gallon. The leading companies would accepta solution on these lines. It would have to be clear that thesurcharges were temporary and would be kept under review, butwe could not rule out the possibility that costs would rise stillfurther.In discussion there was general agreement that an increase inprices must be accepted. It was, however, urged that it would be preferable to weight the surcharge on petrol more heavily than was proposed in order to lessen the burden upon industrial costs and to discourage private consumption and therefore the total level ofimports and expenditure in foreign exchange. On the other hand,it was argued that there were serious technical objections to making such a relatively large increase in the price of petrol. In any event,it was questionable whether an increase of the order which wouldbe involved of about 6d. a gallon would have any substantial effecton the level of consumption in the summer months. It would,however, have the undesirable consequence of increasing the costof public road transport and the pressure for higher fares.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet on balance took the view that, since theincrease of prices was designed to meet a temporary situation and
in view of the possible effect of the increased price of petrol on thelevel of fares in road transport, the best course would be to accept an even surcharge on all oil products of 2d. a gallon. This would,however, require further examination if the situation continued forany length of time and in particular if it proved necessary tointroduce rationing. The increase should be announced as soon asthe Minister of Power found it practicable to do so and in any event not later than the following day.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that there should be an increase of  2 per ton in theprice of crude oil.(3) Agreed that there should be surcharge on all oil products of 2d. a gallon, on the understanding that this wastemporary and would be kept under review.(4) Invited the Minister of Power to announce the increasescovered by Conclusions (2) and (3) as soon as possible.(5) Agreed that legislation should be introduced before the summer Recess to provide powers in respect of oil prices and rationing on the lines proposed by the Minister of power.Russian oil the Minister of Power said that there had been three main reasons for the embargo which had been imposed in 1959 on imports from the Soviet Union of crude oil and major products.The import of Russian oil offered no advantages to our balance ofpayments; our oil industry already had its own sources of supplyand the import of Russian fuel oil, which was the product mostreadily marketable in this country, would have increased theproblems of the National Coal Board. In considering the possibilityof removing the embargo, we should distinguish between supplies inthe short and long term. The short-term oil supply problem that had arisen as a result of hostilities in the Middle East was primarilyone of tanker shortage; because of the short haul from the black sea ports, any supplies of Russian oil or major products that wecould obtain would ease the situation and, although it was unlikelythat in present circumstances the Russians would make any largequantities of either available to us, we should relax the embargo sothat these could be purchased either by industry or for government stocks; publicity for such purchases should be considered. It wasnot yet clear what the effects on the balance of payments of thepurchase of Russian rather than Venezuelan oil or oil from thePersian Gulf by the Cape route would be, since this would dependon the prices which the Soviet Union charged for it; Russian refined products would be more expensive for the balance of payments thanthose refined in this country.For the long term, the possibility of obtaining supplies of oil from the Soviet Union was one of a number of aspects of ourenergy policy which required examination. The work v/hich had so far been done did not indicate that recent events should lead
confidential. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofState for Wales (C (67) 110) to which was annexed the draft of a white Paper on Local Government in Wales.The Secretary of State for Wales recalled that the Cabinet had agreed that work on the reorganisation of local government in wales should be continued separately from the reorganisation underconsideration in respect of England and Scotland. His predecessorhad undertaken to publish a White Paper on the subject and hewas anxious to redeem this pledge as soon as possible.  The firstSECRET8183 bus to discriminate further against oil but the diversification of oursources of oil supply in order to safeguard ourselves againstinstability in the Middle East, the holding of larger stocks in thiscountry and an increase in the tanker fleet, especially for use round the Cape, were being examined. We had to keep in mind thelarge stake that we had through, our major oil companies in theMiddle East; the reserves of crude oil to which they had rightsequalled the total reserves in North and South America together.As regards the balance of payments, Middle East oil supplies to thiscountry benefited us by  60 million a year and sales overseas byBritish Petroleum and Shell had been worth  160 million to our balance of payments in 1965. Perhaps a third of this total of 200 million was in respect of Arab oil.In discussion there was general agreement with the Ministersproposals. There was also agreement that the embargo on importsof Rumanian oil should be lifted. It was however pointed out thatin considering the longer-term issue of import of Russian oil itwould be necessary to consider the effect on the existing unfavourablebalance of our trade with the Soviet Union.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were in general agreement with the Minister&apos;sproposals, which should be extended to include Rumanian oil. Itwas clear that in the immediate future we should not be able toobtain supplies of oil from the Soviet bloc on the open market, butthe oil companies and Imperial Chemical Industries should be encouraged to import Russian and Rumanian oil products if theycould obtain them. It was essential that this course should be keptstrictly secret at the present stage, but if we succeeded in obtaining supplies the Foreign Secretary would wish to consider what publicity should be given to this. The longer-term issues in respect of importsof Russian and Rumanian oil should now be studiedinterdepartmentally, as proposed by the Minister of Power, as amatter of urgency.The Cabinet (6) Approved C (67) 112.(7) Invited the Minister of Power to take similar action inrespect of the import of Rumanian oil.
CONFIDENTIALfour chapters of the draft annexed to C (67) 110, which had beenapproved by the Home Affairs Committee, discussed the government&apos;s proposals for the reorganisation of local governmentin Wales, presenting them as a means of meeting the urgent and special needs of Wales for a reduction in the number, and anincrease in the strength of local authorities. Chapter V dealt withthe proposals for a Council for Wales. He had originally envisagedan elected Council with some executive functions but, in deference to the views of his colleagues, now proposed that the question should be handled in two stages. At the first, the existing machineryfor advisory and promotional work would be improved by creating a nominated council with wider advisory powers than the existingWelsh Economic Council and with freedom to appoint its ownchairman and publish its reports; and at the second, consideration would be given in the light of the reports of the Royal Commissionson Local Government in England and in Scotland to the possibilityof giving the Council additional powers and responsibility and making appropriate changes in its membership and constitution.These proposals had, by agreement with the Home AffairsCommittee, been considered by the Environmental planning committee and approved. He would personally have preferred tobe able to go further, but he recognised the need to study the welsh situation in relation to proposals for the reorganisation oflocal government in England and Scotland and he believed that theproposals now put forward would strengthen the existing machinery.He intended to consult the local authorities before preparinglegislation and estimated that the considerable amount ofpreparatory work involved would take about two years, leading tothe introduction of a Bill early in 1970.In discussion it was suggested that a substantial body of Welshopinion in the House of Commons would be opposed to theproposals in the White Paper, on the ground there was no need to create a Council for Wales with co-ordinating functions in viewof those already exercised by the Welsh Office. The Council wouldbe likely to rival the authority of the Secretary of State and itscreation, far from satisfying nationalist opinion, would merelyencourage demands for an elected body. A more satisfactory solution of the problem would be the appointment of a SelectCommittee on Welsh affairs. On the other hand it was recognisedthat the Secretary of State was committed to publishing a white paper. It would hardly be practicable to ignore the question of a council for Wales and while it might be preferable, had it beenpossible, to say nothing on the subject until the Government hadbeen able to form a view on the appropriate size and nature of thenew major units of local government in England, the proposals now put forward represented a reasonable compromise and would be unlikely to prejudice future decisions. In particular the respects in which the Council for Wales differed from regional planningboards in England could be justified by reference to differences inthe Welsh situation. The publication of the White Paper early inJuly might stimulate demand for a debate, but this could take placeif necessary in the Welsh Grand Committee.
CONFIDENTIALRoad SafetyDraft white paper(previous reference:CC(65) 70thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (C (67) 111) to which was annexed a draft White paper on &quot; Road Safety A Fresh Approach &quot;.The Minister of Transport said that the White Paper describednew proposals for dealing with road safety which had been forecast in the previous year&apos;s White Paper on Transport Policy. The white paper described a new scientific approach to the problem throughfact finding research and cost effectiveness analysis. It indicated howcentral and local machinery on road safety was to be strengthenedand described particular measures which it was proposedto take in relation to the public, to vehicles and to the road user&apos;senvironment. The White Paper had been approved by the HomeAffairs Committee, subject to further consideration of two principalpoints. She had earlier contemplated the addition of an annexon the application of cost effectiveness analysis in identifying themost worthwhile road safety measures, but had concluded that thework was, as yet, at too early a stage to make it worthwhile or wise to describe it in detail. She had, however, expanded paragraphs 11and 12 of the White Paper to give a fuller description of what hadbeen done so far. Some concern had also been expressed in theHome Affairs Committee that the proposed increase from 16 to 17in the minimum age at which juveniles might ride motor cyclesand motor scooters would result in more of them riding illegallyand coming before the courts for this and other offences. However,she had concluded that the case, on road safety grounds, for raising the age to 17 was overwhelming. The proposals in the White paper would involve some additional Exchequer expenditure, mainly onpublicity; this would be considered in the context of the currentThe Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals in the White Paper in respect oflocal government reorganisation and agreed that the two stageapproach to the problem of a Council for Wales as set out in chapter V was an acceptable compromise. The Secretary of Statefor Wales should consult the Lord President on the timing of publication and on a form of words to be used, should he be pressed to indicate when legislation would be introduced. On this he should avoid commitment but could proceed with preparatory work.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft White Paper annexed to C (67) 110.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Wales to consult the lord president of the Council on the timing of its publication and on the form of words to be used in response to enquiries about the introduction of legislation.
review of public expenditure and could, if necessary, be met from within her Departments existing provision. If the White paper were approved, it was proposed to publish it on 4th July.In discussion it was suggested that the proposal to raise theminimum age for riding motor cycles would be criticised by the motor cycle industry because of the consequent reduction in thehome market; but there would be some saving in imports also.Raising the age limit would have the undesirable result that morejuveniles would be brought before the courts for offences concernedwith illegal riding of motor cycles and motor scooters; and there might be a case for retaining the present age limit for riding motorscooters, which were less dangerous in relation both to the number and the seriousness of accidents. On the other hand, it was pointedout that, while motor scooters were rather less dangerous thanmotor cycles, they were still so much more dangerous than cars that,on any ground of road safety, it would not be possible to justify a lower age limit for them. The raising of the age limit would be popular with parents. Existing licence holders under 17 would not,however, be deprived of their licences.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the White Paper on Road Safety. In particular,they agreed on balance that the age limit for riding motor cyclesand motor scooters should be raised to 17. In deciding the timing of publication of future White Papers, Ministers should bear inmind the introduction by the Independent Television Authority ofa full half hour&apos;s news programme at 9 p.m. There might be advantages in timing the publication of White Papers with a view topublicity in this programme and in the morning Press rather thanin the evening Press as at present. Where, however, publication ofa White Paper was to be accompanied by a statement in the House,it would be necessary to continue the present practice.The Cabinet  -(1) Approved the draft White Paper on Road Safety A FreshApproach, annexed to C (67) 111.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to arrange for its publication in consultation with the Lord President ofthe Council.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,29th June, 1967.
