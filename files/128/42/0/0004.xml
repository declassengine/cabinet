Malta(previous reference:CC (67) 2ndConclusions)CC 4 (67)secret. The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs (Mrs. Hart)said that a serious situation had developed in Malta as a result ofthe announcement of our plans substantially to reduce our forces inthe island, to the level agreed after the Defence Review. the maltese Prime Minister, Dr. Borg Olivier, maintained that we werein consequence in breach of our Defence Agreement with Malta since these forces would be inadequate to defend the island and since wehad failed properly to consult them about the reductions. In his view, therefore, we had forfeited all our &quot; rights, privileges and facilities &quot; under the Defence Agreement and he had called upon usto cease making use of them. He proposed to introduce a Bill to cancel the Agreement accordingly. We maintained on the contrarythat the reduction of our forces had no relevance to our ability todefend Malta and that if the Maltese Government were to deny usour rights under the Defence Agreement they would be in breach of their international obligations. The reason for the extremecourse which the Maltese Government were taking was the level ofunemployment which would result from the reduction of our forces and would reach 14 per cent in 1968-69. There was widespreadsupport in Malta for Dr. Borg 01ivier&apos;s attitude and, unless asettlement could be reached, our international reputation would sufferand the position of our forces in the island would become untenable.Without the facilities in Malta we might also be unable to carry out our commitment to Libya, The provision of fuel supplies for military aircraft was already proving difficult as the Maltese were demandingthat we should pay customs duty, contrary to the Defence Agreement,and refused to release the supplies until we did so. An urgent studywas in hand of the full implications of the situation but it was clearthat if we were to make any impact on the unemployment problemmajor changes would be needed in the defence plans or, alternatively,substantial extra aid would be required.The Defence Secretary said that there was a short and a long-term problem. In the short term a way must be found of enabling usto import stores, including aviation fuel. If this were not done our military aircraft would cease to fly and the base would becomeinoperative. A solution might be to pay the customs duty but tomake plain that this was under duress and that future aid payments would be reduced accordingly. At the same time, and in an attemptto dissuade the Maltese from passing legislation abrogating theDefence Agreement as they intended on the following day, a seniorMinister might visit Malta for discussion or, alternatively, the PrimeMinister might send a message to Dr. Borg Olivier. Malta stood to lose  18 million of payments on the defence account and 34 - 5 million worth of aid if our forces had to be withdrawn but inthe present highly emotional situation, these considerations might notdeter the Maltese Government from pursuing their present course.For the longer term, contingency plans for a total withdrawal from malta should be prepared and submitted to Ministers urgently.
Account would also need to be taken of the repercussions in otherparts of the world, for example, in Aden and Singapore, of any failure to reduce our forces in Malta to the level that was desirable in UnitedKingdom interests, or of any concessions that we might otherwiseconsider making to meet the immediate situation there.In discussion concern was expressed at the level of unemploy-ment which would result in Malta from the reduction of our forces and also at the consequences for our international position and our military facilities should the Maltese Government hold to their viewthat the Defence Agreement was abrogated. Nevertheless, there was general agreement that the Government could not seek a settlement with the Maltese Government by making further substantial concessions on the rate at which our forces in Malta should bereduced to the level agreed after the Defence Review, or in theprovision of aid. A concession on either issue would haveunacceptable repercussions for our position in other countries where our forces were being reduced, such as Aden and Singapore, and where similar claims would be likely to be pressed upon us by thelocal Governments. Furthermore, we could reasonably bear in mind that the level of aid to Malta represented a much higher payment per head of population than in any other country save St. Helena. Thelevel of our aid and the concessions which had already been made in agreeing to slow down the rate of reduction of our forces inthe island at considerable financial cost to ourselves demonstrated that we had not ignored the major difficulties that our action would cause in Malta. As regards the immediate situation the balance ofadvantage lay in our agreeing to pay the customs duty provided thatthis did not have unacceptable legal implications for the defence agreement, since otherwise our forces would be unable to operate,but it should be made clear that such payment would be offset byan equivalent reduction in our future aid to Malta. It should,however, first be ascertained that our payment of customs duty,even in such terms, would not imply that we were accepting that theDefence Agreement was abrogated, since this would have wider legal,financial and military repercussions. We should also take such other action as might prove possible to reduce emotional tensions in malta and there might be advantage in the Prime Minister sending a suitablemessage to Dr. Borg Olivier. In the longer run, however, we couldnot maintain our forces in the face of continued Maltese hostilityand if Maltese labour were withdrawn. We must therefore draw upcontingency plans for the complete withdrawal of our forces fromthe island. The implications of such a course would need detailed consideration by officials in the first instance, including the possibleimplications for our position in Gibraltar in the light of any actionwhich the Spanish Government might be encouraged to take by thesituation in Malta.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that there would be unacceptable consequencesboth in Malta and elsewhere if as a result of the. attitude ofthe Maltese Government and people we were to change our plans forthe reduction of our forces in Malta.

CONFIDENTIALCommercialPolicy(previous reference:CC(67) 1stConclusions,Minute 4)KennedyRound2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C (67) 12) bythe President of the Board of Trade on the prospects in the kennedy round of tariff negotiations.The memorandum stated that the main concern of the UnitedKingdom in the negotiations was to secure significant tariff reductionsfrom European Economic Community (e.c.), the United States and japan, in that order. It would pay us to work for the best possibleoutcome of the Kennedy Round, regardless of whether or not wejoined the e.c. in the near future. If we did not join, a successful outcome would reduce the discrimination against our exports to the eec; if we did, there would still be considerable advantages inthe reduction of tariffs and non-tariff barriers to our exports to theUnited States, Japan and other countries. It was impossible at thepresent stage to foresee what the balance of advantage might be forthe United Kingdom from the outcome of the negotiations.   Itpay the customs duties immediately, provided this would have nounacceptable implications in relation to the abrogation of the defence agreement and provided such payment were offset against future aiddue to Malta. He would also send a message to Dr. Borg Olivier inan attempt to prevent the passage of legislation through the MalteseParliament breaking the Defence Agreement. In the longer termwe might have to face a complete withdrawal of our forces and themilitary, political and economic consequences of such a course shouldbe examined urgently by officials and a report submitted to Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theDefence Secretary and the Attorney-General to arrangefor the immediate payment of the customs dutiesdemanded by the Maltese Government on the basis indicated by the Prime Minister, provided that theGovernment were advised that this would not haveunacceptable legal implications in relation to the abrogation of the Defence Agreement.(3) Invited the Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs tosubmit to the Prime Minister the draft of a message for him to send to the Maltese Prime Minister.(4) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for an inter-departmental examination by officials of themilitary, political and economic consequences of thewithdrawal of all our forces from Malta.
seemed unlikely, however, that significant tariff reductions would beachieved in several important sectors of industry including iron andsteel, motor vehicles, textiles and probably chemicals. There was nevertheless a reasonable prospect of substantial reductions in other sectors, including engineering and consumer goods. The prospects of getting worthwhile concessions on non-tariff barriers from theUnited States were doubtful. The United States regarded it aspolitically essential to achieve a worthwhile settlement in agriculture,particularly on cereals. An international cereals agreement might beof value to the United Kingdom if it secured a reasonable level ofprices for our imports and enabled us to save imports by expandingdomestic cereals production. The negotiating position of the cerealsexporting countries was, however, still widely different from our own.Whether or not a cereals agreement would be acceptable to us would depend not only on the terms of the agreement itself but also on thebalance of advantage in other sectors of the negotiations. Taken asa whole, the Kennedy Round would certainly not fulfil the high hopesoriginally entertained, but it still offered the prospect of a substantialachievement in the lowering of barriers to international trade.In discussion the Cabinet took note of the memorandum and agreed that the detailed issues which it raised should be consideredby the appropriate Ministerial committee.The Cabinet Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the issues raised in C (67) 12 to be considered by the Sub-Committeeon External Relations of the Ministerial Committee onEconomic Policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st January, 1967.
