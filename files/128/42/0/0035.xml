SECRET -3;i       37CC 35 (67)confidential parliament 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Middle East(previous reference:CC(67) 33rdConclusions,Minute 1)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been no majordevelopments in the Middle East situation since the Cabinet had last discussed it. A holding resolution had now been tabled in the security council and support for it was being canvassed. contingency planning was continuing against the possibility that the use of forcemight have to be considered in order to secure the right of innocentpassage through the Straits of Tiran and in the Gulf of Aqaba; andour approaches to other countries to gain support for a declaration in favour of this right would begin as soon as President Johnsonauthorised similar approaches by United States Ambassadors. Inthe meantime a British ship on passage through the Straits of Tiranto Aqaba had not been molested: instructions had been issued thatits time of arrival should be reported to the Egyptian authorities atSuez and that it should if necessary submit to search, but only underprotest. Several other ships, including two bound for Eilat, had passed through the Straits of Tiran without incident since the blockadehad been announced, though none had done so since 27th May andas yet no oil tanker had attempted the passage. The importanceof the reported move of Soviet warships in the Mediterranean hadbeen exaggerated by the Press; our information showed that so farthese moves fell somewhat short of what would be necessary to bringSoviet naval strength in the area up to its normal level and this wouldbe much less than would be needed in a confrontation. Finally, asregards the undertakings which it was thought that Israel might havereceived from President Johnson during the recent visit of the IsraeliForeign Minister, Mr. Eban, to Washington, it seemed clear thatthe United States Administration had not committed themselves anyfurther than we had done: they had undertaken to provide us witha formal record of the discussions.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Foreign Secretary.Oversea AffairsNigeria(previous reference:CC(67) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said thatthe declaration of secession by the Governor of the Eastern region of Nigeria, Colonel Ojukwu, had given rise to a very dangerous situation. The Federal Government had declared a blockade of PortHarcourt and Federal troops were said to have begun to move towards Enugu and to be due to arrive there that day. It did not seem likely that the Federal Government would succeed in an invasion of the Eastern Region from the north or in enforcing the8175
blockade, but the situation might alter if, as was reported, therewas support for the Federal Government from all the other regions of Nigeria. In the meantime the Shell Oil Company would seek the permission of the authorities in Lagos for ships to enter PortHarcourt. The United States Embassy in Lagos wished to begina general evacuation from the Eastern Region of dependents andother non-essential personnel but we had opposed this; although wehad plans to evacuate from the threatened area British subjects, whonumbered about 1,250 of a total of 3,500 in the Eastern Region, nomove would be made unless our nationals were threatened since otherwise such a move might exacerbate the situation and embarrassour own position. As regards recognition of a separate State in theEast, we should wait on developments, and particularly on the action taken by African countries. In the meantime our Deputy HighCommissioner in the Eastern Region (who in view of his statushad diplomatic standing, unlike the representatives of other powers in the Eastern Region, who were Consuls) would continue to dealwith Colonel Ojukwu without prejudice to the question of recognition.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that preparations werein hand to bring to a high state of readiness the forces needed to implement contingency plans to evacuate British subjects fromNigeria. Since however it had been considered unwise to announce that these preparations related to Nigeria, lest this should adversely affect the situation there, they had given rise to alarmist reportslinking them with the Middle East crisis. It was agreed that, inview of the dangerous implications of this development for ourposition in relation to the Middle East, this aspect of the matterrequired further consideration by the Ministers directly concerned.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of State for commonwealth Affairs.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Defence and the Minister of Statefor Commonwealth Affairs, to consider further, in thelight of their discussion, the desirability of announcingthat the military preparations in question related to thepossibility of our having to evacuate British subjects in nigeria.The Minister of Transport said that the announcement in replyto Questions in Parliament of the visits of certain Royal Navy ships to Cape Town, without our insisting that visits by the crews on shorewould only take place if all entertainment were on a fully multi-racialbasis and that the crews did not have to accept the rules of apartheid,had been very badly received by Government supporters inParliament. Unless we could insist on such conditions, the visitsshould be cancelled.In discussion there was general agreement that despite these considerations the balance of advantage was heavily in favour of allowing the visits to take place. Such visits were essential to the continuation of the Simonstown Agreement and the facilities whichSouth Africa(previous reference:CC(67) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2)
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C (67) 90) on whether Government time should be givenfor the completion of the remaining stages of the Medical Terminationof Pregnancy Bill.The Home Secretary recalled that on 11th May the Cabinet had agreed that the question of giving Government time for the MedicalTermination of Pregnancy Bill should be considered by the legislation committee in the light of the prospect that the Bill would be soamended as to make it a workable measure. He had been ableto persuade the sponsors of the Bill to accept the amendmentsconsidered necessary for this purpose and the Legislation Committeehad agreed, the Lord Privy Seal dissenting, that Government time should, if necessary, be found for it.The Bill, as introduced by Mr. David Steel, was designed togive statutory effect to the existing case law permitting abortion on theground of risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman and tointroduce additional grounds, including the potential abnormalityof the unborn child. In Committee the grounds of abortion hadbeen further enlarged to include risk of injury to the &quot; well-being &quot;of the woman, the unborn child or the woman&apos;s other children.This did not make sense in relation to the risk of injury to thewell-being of the foetus and had in addition been criticised becauseof the vagueness of the concept of &quot; injury to well-being &quot;. Thesponsors were now willing to put down amendments to deleteMedicalTerminationof PregnancyBill(previous reference:CC (67) 30thConclusions,Minute 1)we were thereby accorded were of substantial importance to us andwould be of much greater importance if hostilities were to breakout in the Middle East. We must also have regard to the importanceof continuing to persuade the South African Government not tosupport the illegal regime in Rhodesia. Furthermore, thearrangements which had been made for multi-racial entertainment,which had been reported during the Cabinefs previous discussion on this issue, represented a substantial advance on the previousposition and should not be jeopardised. It would also be unreasonable to prohibit the few coloured members of the crewsfrom going ashore if they wished to do so; for example, one memberof the crew was a St. Helenian who wished to visit his relatives inCape Town. It was nevertheless important that these considerations,and in particular the fact that multi-racial entertainment had beenarranged, should be more widely publicised and arrangements hadbeen made for this to be done at a meeting of the parliamentary labour Party.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the visits of Royal Navy ships to Cape Townwhich had been arranged in the near future should takeplace as planned.
references to well-being and to refrain from attempting to bringthe concept back by defining &quot; health &quot; to include &quot; well-being&quot;.So amended the Bill would provide for abortions on only twogrounds:(1) risk to the life of the woman or injury to the physical ormental health of herself or any existing children of herfamily; and(2) substantial risk that the child would be seriously handicapped.The Bill included safeguards not provided by the existing case lawand he and the Minister of Health were satisfied that with theproposed amendments and certain others of a technical characterit would be in a workable form. The issue had now been fullydebated in both Houses and it would be unfortunate if parliament were prevented by shortness of time from reaching a decision upon it.Private Members&apos; Bills upon it would be introduced year after yearuntil a decision could be reached and it would be preferable for time to be found on this occasion. Time on one evening from p.m. onwards, enabling the House to sit through the night ifnecessary, should be sufficient.The Lord Privy Seal questioned whether to make Governmenttime available to the sponsors of the Bill was compatible with theattitude of neutrality towards the principle of abortion which theGovernment had hitherto adopted. Recent articles in the Presssuggesting that the Government proposed to &quot; come to the rescue &quot;of the Bill and to &quot; defeat a filibuster &quot; had created an impression of Government support which would be confirmed in the public mind if Government facilities were now given. This might do harm to the Governmenfs reputation with considerable sections of publicopinion which were by no means wholly Roman Catholic, as wasillustrated by the collection of 500,000 signatures to a petition againstthe Bill which had been organised by a non-Roman CatholicCommittee. Moreover there was considerable difference of opinionon two features which the Bill would still contain, even if it were amended as proposed. The absence of a special qualification for doctors to be permitted to undertake or approve abortions had beenpublicly deplored by representatives of the Royal College ofObstetricians and Gynaecologists and of the British medical association. The inclusion of risk of deformity in the child amongthe grounds for abortion had been criticised by the Archbishops of canterbury and York on the ground that this factor should beconsidered only in relation to a risk to the health of the womanherself. It was not disputed that the Bill as it had left Committeewas unsatisfactory; and it was not clear that the present Bill couldbe put into a workable condition in which it would be acceptableeven to those who favoured reform of the law in principle. It wouldbe preferable therefore to give no Government time for the furtherconsideration of this Bill but to await the production of what mightbe a better Bill in a later session.In discussion it was emphasised that the Legislation Committee&apos;view that the sponsors of the Bill should be given time was basedon the consideration that, when an important social issue had been
thoroughly debated, Parliament should not be prevented from reaching a conclusion on it merely because a Private Member couldnot command the necessary time. The present Bill dealt with animportant issue on which public opinion was much concerned: in announcing that Government time would be given it should be made clear that this was the ground for the Governments decision andthat they maintained their neutrality on the principle of the Bill.Neutrality would be demonstrated by the fact that on a free voteMinisters would vote in different lobbies. On the other hand, itwas argued that merely to give time inevitably involved somedeparture from neutrality since without it the Bill would be unlikely to be passed; and to give facilities for one Private Members bill which were not available to all would be seen as evidence of partiality.The issue was not of such outstanding importance that theGovernment, who had already thought it right in the national interestto take measures which attracted public criticism, need feel boundto risk further criticism in order to give an opportunity for the Billto be enacted in the current session.In further discussion the following points were made (a) Representatives of the medical profession in England andWales including the gynaecologists had at their own request been seen by the Home Secretary and the Minister of Health on theprevious day. They had expressed themselves satisfied with the Bill,amended by the deletion of the concept of &quot; well-being&quot;,notwithstanding that no special qualifications were required of doctorsundertaking or approving abortions.(b) The Secretary of State for Scotland would think it necessaryto make it clear in debate on the remaining stages of the Bill thatthe position in Scotland was satisfactory under the existing law andhe was not therefore in favour of the Bill.(c) While there should be a free vote fpr Ministers on third reading it would be unfortunate if a substantial number of Ministersvoted on Report against the amendments removing the concepts ofrisk to the well-being of the mother and to the future well-being ofthe unborn child which the Home Secretary, with the agreementof the Home Affairs Committee, had persuaded the sponsors toaccept. If these amendments were defeated it might become desirablethat Ministers should vote against the Bill on Third Reading solely on the ground that the Bill was not then in a workable form.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that if the Bill failed to complete its remaining stages in Private Members&apos; time Government time should be given on one evening after 7 p.m. The Lord President in announcing thisdecision later in the day should make it clear that the Governmentwere providing time in order to enable the House to reach a decisionon the Bill and that the Governments attitude of neutrality was maintained. Ministers should be free to vote as they considered rightbut in doing so on the major amendments should bear in mind that
these amendments had been urged on the sponsors as a result of theview of the Home Affairs Committee that they were necessary toput the Bill in a workable condition.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange forGovernment time on one evening after 7 p.m. to be madeavailable to the sponsors of the Medical Termination ofPregnancy Bill, if this proved necessary to enable theHouse of Commons to reach a conclusion upon it, andto take an opportunity of making it clear that this wasthe sole basis of the Governments decision.(2) Agreed that, subject to the considerations indicated in theForeign Secretary&apos;s summing up of their discussion,Ministers should be free to vote as they thought fit inthe debates on the remaining stages of the Bill.leasehold reform Bill(previous reference:CC(66) 11thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (67) 89) on an amendment to the leasehold Reform Bill passed in Standing Committee.The Lord President recalled that in February 1966 the Cabinet,after lengthy discussion (CC (66) 7th Conclusions, Minute 2), had adopted proposals for leasehold reform which were published in a white Paper (Cmnd. 2916) and embodied in the Bill as introduced.It was an important feature of the proposals that the right ofenfranchisement would be confined to leaseholders whose propertydid not exceed the Rent Act limits in rateable value; but in StandingCommittee an amendment to remove these limits had been carried by a majority of 18-1. Its consequences had been considered bythe Ministerial Committee on Legislation on Rent, Land Commissionand Leasehold Enfranchisement, who had identified the four possible courses of action described in the memorandum but had been unableto agree which to adopt. The Committee&apos;s general view was thatthere was no satisfactory solution; it was a choice of evils.Acceptance of the amendment would mean that some leaseholdersin London might obtain windfalls of many thousands of poundsfree of capital gains tax, which would be an absurd consequence ofa Bill designed originally to help the smaller leaseholders in Wales.The Committee recognised, however, the political difficulty of restoring the Rent Act limits and considered that the alternative to accepting the situation might be to adopt the principle ofenfranchisement at the market value of the freeholder^ interest,shown as course (d) in the memorandum.The Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, said that the amendment would have been withdrawnby its proposer upon a Government undertaking to look again atthe question of Rent Act limits. The Opposition members of theStanding Committee had not permitted the amendment to be
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour (C (67) 86) proposing an announcement about the timing of decasualisation of employment in the docks.The Minister of Labour said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s decision, he had announced the previous October that theGovernment endorsed in principle the changes in pay recommended in the 1966 Report of Inquiry under Lord Devlin into the wagesstructure and level of pay (Cmnd. 3104) to accompany decasualisation,but that implementation of these changes must in the Governmenfsview be conditional upon agreement for the elimination of restrictiveworking practices and must be subject to the criteria of the government&apos;s policy on incomes. Since then the LocalModernisation Committees&apos; representatives of employers and unions in each port, had been negotiating on the elimination of restrictive practices, guided by the National Modernisation Committee underthe chairmanship of the Minister of State, Board of Trade (LordCONFIDENTIAL8175 bwithdrawn and it had been carried on a division, the Minister ofState supporting the amendment in view of his agreement that acase had been made out in debate to warrant reconsideration of theclause. As regards the action to be taken, he did not favourenfranchisement at market value. This would be complicated andmight entail the addition of several new clauses to the Bill, it wouldnot satisfy the proprietors of the large London estates who werethe principal opponents of the Bill and it would be unwelcome tothe Governmenfs supporters. The better Course would be to acceptthe decision of the Standing Committee.In discussion there was general support for the view that the rent Act limits of rateable value should be restored in conformitywith the original decision of the Cabinet. It would be possible onReport to secure the reversal of a decision taken by a relatively small number of Members in Standing Committee.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said thatthe Cabinet were firmly of the opinion that the Government shouldnot accept the removal by a Standing Committee of an important feature of their Leasehold Reform proposals. The Minister of state should accordingly table the amendments necessary to restore the rent Act limits of rateable value.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment, to table amendments to the Leasehold reform bill on Report to restore the Rent Act limits of rateable value defining the houses to which the Bill would apply.
Brown). Considerable progress had been made and the Committeehad undertaken to report to him on 1st July about the position thenreached. However, the considerable time which the negotiations had necessarily taken had led to growing impatience in some ports and among some groups of workers. The latest manifestation ofthis was a threat by the tally clerks in the Port of London to strikefrom Monday, 5th June, unless and until an early date was announcedfor the introduction of decasualisation. The London tally clerkshad reached an agreement with the employers in February 1967,which provided a satisfactory basis for decasualisation, but it was essential that decasualisation should be introduced on the same date in all ports. The Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, theprincipal union concerned, was now pressing for an early announcement of this date. In the light of the progress of thenegotiations, he was reasonably confident that the report due to bemade on 1st July would provide a satisfactory basis upon which toproceed. While it would be wrong for the Government to commit themselves unconditionally at this stage to a date for the introductionof decasualisation, the time had now come to make it plain thata definite date for its introduction could now be foreseen, providedthat the progress already made was maintained. It was important to make an early announcement in order to stem the rising discontent among dock workers which might otherwise prejudice not only thesmooth introduction of decasualisation but also the introduction ofnew working practices required by the prospective growth ofcontainer traffic in the ports, particularly at Tilbury. It was nowreasonable to look forward to the possibility that decasualisationcould be made effective on 15th September next and he accordinglysought the agreement of the Cabinet to an assurance being given that, provided the forthcoming report on the elimination of restrictive practices confirmed that the progress made met the Governmenfsconditions, decasualisation would be introduced not later than that date and that the way would then be open for the industry to implement the changes in pay recommended by the Devlin report. If the cabinet approved his proposal, he would speak accordingly to the leadersof the industry that day. While there could be no guarantee thatthis would avert the threatened strike of tally clerks, there was areasonable prospect that it would do so.In discussion, it was suggested that the implementation of theproposed changes in pay would carry some risks for the policy on incomes. The changes involved not only improvements regarded asinescapable consequences of the introduction of decasualisation,which would add some 6 per cent to the wages bill, but also amodernisation payment of  2 a week which would constitute a furtheraddition of some 10 per cent. It was essential to ensure that, inreturn for increases of this order, the maximum progress was madewith the elimination not only of those restrictive practices whichstemmed specifically from the present casual system of employment,but also of other practices such as excessive manning. However,technological developments and especially the spread of containertraffic could be expected to result in the elimination of many of the
8175CC 35 (67)&quot;present wasteful practices. Moreover, a statement in the formproposed by the Minister of Labour would still leave it open to theGovernment to postpone the introduction of decasualisation ifprogress on these matters were not satisfactory.It was also suggested that it might be desirable to seek theagreement of both sides of the industry to a planned reduction inthe size of the labour force as a condition of the introduction of thenew pay scales to accompany decasualisation. It was pointed out,however, that natural wastage over the next few years would of itselfensure a reduction in the labour force of 5-7 per cent per annum;it was expected that schemes for severance payments to men whowere prepared to leave the industry voluntarily would be introduced;and negotiations on a new pension scheme would probably resultin agreement to the retirement of all dock workers over 65 yearsof age. These factors taken together should ensure a substantialprogressive reduction in the labour force. While there was a general expectation among dock workers that there would have to bereductions in the labour force, it would be unwise to introduce further proposals specifically involving redundancy at the present stage of negotiations.In further discussion the following points were made-(a) There had recently been pressure from both employers and unions in London for a guaranteed minimum wage for that port of 17 a week, compared with the figure of  16 originally agreed for london and  15 agreed for other ports. This pressure had now,however, abated and was unlikely to be renewed in the immediatefuture. While the cost to the employers of a guaranteed minimum of  17 a week for London would not be great, if it were concededit would lead inevitably to corresponding increases in other ports and would have unfortunate repercussions on the policy on incomesgenerally. The Government should therefore continue to resist any pressure for a higher differential for London.(b) An early announcement of the probable date for theintroduction of decasualisation would have a useful effect inquickening the procedures for the licensing of port employers underthe provisions of the Docks and Harbours Act, 1966, in those portswhere progress had hitherto been slow. It was nevertheless unlikelythat licensing would be completed in all ports by 15th September,1967: but this would not be an obstacle to the introduction ofdecasualisation on that date.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the Minister of Labour should make anannouncement about the probable date for the introduction ofdecasualisation in the terms proposed in his memorandum. TheMinister should in his further negotiations with the industry take account of the points made in discussion and should report further tothe appropriate Ministerial Committee in the light of the forthcoming report from the National Modernisation Committee on the elimination of restrictive practices.
The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour -(i) to arrange for an announcement about the timing of theintroduction of decasualisation in the docks on the lines proposed in paragraph 9 of C (67) 86;(ii) to report further to the appropriate Ministerial Committeein the light of the forthcoming report from the NationalModernisation Committee on the elimination of restrictive practices.nationalisation of the Ports(previous reference:CC(66) 17thConclusions,Minute 7)confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (67) 80) about the nationalisation of the ports.The Minister of Transport said that the Ministerial Committeeon the Reorganisation of the Docks had recently considered theproposals for nationalisation of the ports which were summarised inthe annex to her memorandum and had approved them as a basis for the consultations which were now necessary with the various interests involved. The Government would not be committed indetail by such consultations to the provisions she proposed: decisions could only be taken in the light of the consultations and these mightwell lead her to propose modifications of the detailed proposals,possibly including matters of some substance. The proposals followedbroadly the recommendations of the Study Group on this questionwhich had reported to the National Executive of the Labour Partyin 1966, but were different in some specific matters, for example in proposing a more selective approach to the number of ports to betaken over at the initial stage of nationalisation. On the questionof workers&apos; participation in the management of the nationalised industry, she was not at this stage putting forward preciserecommendations. It was important to take account of the viewsof the industry on this question and to leave to them reasonablescope to work out detailed arrangements for themselves. Herproposals therefore merely listed, as a basis for consultations, anumber of possible ways in which workers&apos; participation might besecured.In discussion, there was general support for the proposals bythe Minister of Transport, but the following points were made (a) There should be some consideration of the desirability ofaligning the areas to be covered by Regional Port Authorities (RPAs)with the regions into which the country was divided for other purposes such as economic planning. It would also be desirableto consider the relationship between the areas of the RPAs andthe areas which might be covered by the kind of reorganised LocalGovernment units which the Royal Commission on LocalGovernment was known to be considering.  On the other hand, it
was suggested that in the interests of the efficient running of theindustry it was necessary to define the areas covered by RPAs inaccordance with the circumstances of the industry rather than inrelation to regions defined for other purposes. Local government areas were of limited relevance since it was not proposed to leaveany ports under municipal control after nationalisation, despite theobjections which some municipalities could be expected to raise tothis course.(b) The Minister^ proposals would vest the assets of the ports in the RPAs, and they would assume responsibility for the liabilities of the undertakings which they took over; but they would not controlinvestment plans for their areas, which would be decided by theNational Ports Authority (NPA). This division of responsibility on financial issues which were crucial to development might give riseto difficulties and to demands from the RPAs for greater controlover investment programmes in their areas. Against this, it was argued that a strong central authority with effective control overinvestment and finance was an essential feature of the scheme. Itmight, for example, be necessary in the national interest for thecentral authority to give priority to some ports over others,particularly to provide for the concentration of container traffic, andthis might call for the over-riding of local interests.(c) Implementation of the proposal in paragraph 18 of the annex to C (67) 80 that workers&apos; participation might be secured by &quot; some form of representation of port workers on the NPA and /or RPAs &quot;might cause difficulties in a situation where the authority of the portworkers&apos; unions was under constant challenge from unofficialmovements. However, this proposal was only one of a number ofpossibilities which it was proposed to discuss with the industry andthe Government were in no way committed to it. It would benecessary in the further consultations to take account of the reporton workers&apos; participation which was expected shortly from a study group under Mr. Jones of the Transport and General Workers&apos;Union, set up by the National Executive Committee of the LabourParty.(d) The Secretary of State for Wales said there was a case foradjusting the proposed boundary of the Wales and Severnside RPA.He would arrange for his officials to discuss this with the Ministryof Transport.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposals annexed to C (67) 80 as a basis forthe consultations which the Minister of Transport proposed to hold,on the understanding that the Government were not committed tothem at this stage and that no commitments would be made untilthe Cabinet had had an opportunity to consider the matter further in the light of the results of those consultations. The Minister should give further consideration to the points made in discussion and shouldtake account of these in pursuing her consultations and in hersubsequent report to her colleagues.
The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals annexed to C (67) 80 for the nationalisation of the ports as a basis for consultations with the interests concerned.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to consider further thepoints made in discussion, in accordance with the summing up of their discussion by the Foreign secretary and in consultation with the Ministers concerned.Prices and incomes Bill(previous reference:CC(67) 19thConclusions,Minute 5)SECRET8. The First Secretary of State said that the provisions of thePrices and Incomes Bill had recently been approved by ministers and the Bill would be published shortly. He had, however, been urged by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) to alter one ofthe Bill&apos;s provisions and he now sought the Cabinet&apos;s agreement tothis course.Clause 5 of the Bill as now drafted provided for the protectionof employers against legal proceedings by their workers for the recovery of increases of wages due under contractual agreementsbut which had been withheld in deference to the Government&apos;s policy on prices and incomes.   Some employers who were in breach ofcontractual obligations in this way were already covered by theprotection afforded by Section 30 of the Prices and Incomes Act, 1966,since they had followed the procedures which were laid down inthat section; others who had not followed those procedures hadnevertheless been afforded protection as the result of an Order underPart IV of the Act. There remained, however, a number of employers who had withheld increases of wages in deference to government policy by informal agreement with their workers; and it was to extendprotection against legal proceedings to such employers that theprovisions of Clause 5 of the Bill were included.  It was necessary,however, to define the period of time to which the protection underthis clause should be related. As the Bill was now drafted, protectionextended to a breach of any agreement entered into before23rd November, 1966, the date of publication of the White paper on the,Period of Severe Restraint (Cmnd. 3150).   The reason for limiting protection in this way was that it was considered that, afterthe publication of the White Paper, employers would be fully aware of the provisions of the policy and if they nevertheless entered into an agreement which contravened that policy it would not be justifiable to afford them protection from the consequences of their action.The CBI, however, had represented strongly to the Minister of Labourand himself that not all employers had appreciated the fullsignificance of the complicated provisions of the White Paperimmediately it was published, since their interpretation was not inall cases free from doubt.   Some employers after that date hadunwittingly entered into agreements which were contrary to the policy.While a number of these employers had been made the subject ofOrders under Part IV and were thus protected from legal proceedings,others had been persuaded, usually by the Minister of Labour or
confidential the Economy 9. The Cabinet considered two memoranda by the Secretary01 ; of State for Wales (C (67) 84 and 85) to the former of which wasDraftWhitePaperannexed a draft White Paper on the economy of Wales.The Secretary of State for Wales said that the Government hadan obligation to publish a document on the economy of Wales andhe had accordingly undertaken to present a White Paper before thehis officers, not to implement the agreements in question. TheGovernment would be open to criticism if employers who hadconformed with the policy as a result of such persuasion were notprotected from legal proceedings for breach of their contractual obligations. Moreover, if the Bill did not extend protection to employers in this position, the CBI were likely to advise them topay their workers the increases withheld rather than to risk legal proceedings; if they did this, then employers who were protectedfrom proceedings by the statutory provisions would in turn come under pressure from their workers to pay the increases which hadbeen withheld.It would be possible to extend protection to the employers inquestion by relating the protection under Clause 5 of the Bill tobreach of agreements entered into either before 30th June, 1967, whichwould be the end of the period of severe restraint, or before thedate of publication of the Bill in early June. It was desirable to limit the scope of this retrospective provision as far as was consistent with protecting those employers who deserved protection and hewould therefore favour relating protection to agreements enteredinto before the earlier of the two possible dates i.e., the date of publication of the Bill. It was possible, however, that to frame theprovision in this way would give rise to difficulties of drafting andin that event the provision should be related to agreements enteredinto before 30th June, 1967. It would be preferable to amend theBill in this way rather than to introduce the amendment during its passage in response to pressure.In discussion there was general agreement with the proposal by the First Secretary of State.The Cabinet-Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the prices and Incomes Bill to be so amended as to provide that theprotection to employers against legal proceedings for breach of contractual agreements by withholding increases of wages in deference to the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes should extend to breaches of agreements enteredinto before the date of publication of the Prices and incomes bill, or, if that were to give rise to difficulties of draftingto breaches of agreements entered into before 30th June.1967.
Summer Recess. A draft White Paper had been prepared in collaboration with all the Departments concerned and had beenapproved by the Ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning,subject to a numbef of amendments which had now been incorporated in the draft annexed to C (67) 84. He now sought the agreementof his colleagues to the publication of the White Paper, subject tofurther amendments which would be needed to take account of the cabinet&apos;s decision on 25th May to introduce a Regional employment premium (CC (67) 32nd Conclusions, Minute 2), and any further amendments which might be needed to take account of developments and decisions reached before the date of publication.These proposals were generally agreed.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for Wales (i) to arrange, in consultation with the Ministers concerned, forthe draft White Paper annexed to C (67) 84 to be amended to take account of the Governmenfs decision to introduce a Regional Employment Premium and of any otherdevelopments or decisions reached before the date of publication;(ii) to arrange, subject to (i) above and in consultation with theLord President of the Council, for the publication of theWhite Paper.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,1st June, 1967.
