 EconomicSituationDevaluationof SterlingCC 66 (67)TOP secret the Prime Minister said it would be necessary for the Cabinetto put aside the items of business on the circulated agenda, whichcould be dealt with later in the meeting, if time permitted. he proposed, instead, to invite the Chancellor of the Exchequer to address the Cabinet on an issue of great importance and extremesecrecy, which had so far been discussed only among the ministers immediately concerned.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he recommended tothe Cabinet that sterling should be devalued on the followingSaturday, 18th November, to a new fixed parity of $2 - 40 to the pound.It had not been easy for him to decide to make thisrecommendation to his colleagues, since in one sense it marked theend of the economic strategy which the Government had beenpursuing hitherto; and he was prepared to draw the necessaryconclusion as regards his personal position. But, although we stillhad considerable reserves of foreign exchange and were not beingcompelled to devalue by sheer insufficiency of liquid resources, therehad nevertheless been serious speculation against the pound in recent weeks, which on particular days had reached grave proportions. Ifwe attempted to hold the present parity, therefore, we should be liable to exhaust the reserves still available and should then be unable to defend even a reduced parity. The stability of the currencydepended partly on confidence abroad and the general climate ofopinion about the present parity. But our position had beenundermined on both these counts; and this had intensified the more fundamental difficulties stemming from our unsatisfactory balanceof payments prospect. There had been persistent advocacy of devaluation in some sections of the Press and in other quarters; andthis, too, had created a climate in which confidence could no longer be sustained. Industrial disputes, notably the seamen&apos;s strike of1966 and the recent dock strike, had further aggravated our difficulties; and we had suffered heavily from the crisis in the middle east and from the closure of the Suez Canal, which now seemed likelyto continue for a substantial period. The operation of all these various factors had created a position in which we could avoiddevaluation only by securing international support for sterling on a scale which would be quite unprecedented; and there was no prospect that such support would be provided.If the Cabinet decided in principle to devalue the pound, theright time to do so would be the evening of Saturday, 18th November.It should be possible to prevent premature disclosure of our intentions(which would have the most damaging financial consequences) up tothat time. We were doing nothing to discourage the prevalentimpression that further arrangements for support of the poundmight emerge from the current discussions in Paris under the auspices of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation andDevelopment (OECD); and so far we had had reasonable success10802A 2
in maintaining the position of sterling despite the adverse tradefigures for October. The discussions in Paris, however, would finishat the end of the week; and, if devaluation were postponed for afurther week, there was a serious risk that the situation would passout of our control. It would be imperative to preserve completesecrecy about our intentions right up to the time of the public announcement on the evening of 18th November, particularly sincethe financial markets in the Middle East did not close on that dayuntil 3.30 p.m.During the two preceding weeks he had arranged for confidentialsoundings to be taken about the probable reactions of other countriesif we devalued sterling. The United States authorities were unlikely to follow us. While the reactions of the French Government wereuncertain, strong pressure would be brought on them to maintain their parity by the other members of the European economic community, who would not wish to devalue their own currenciesprovided that the reduction in our parity was not excessive in amount.Most of the African countries were likely to devalue, with theexception of Zambia. The Caribbean countries would follow us.So would Pakistan; but, probably, not India. New Zealand would be liable to devalue; but it was more doubtful whether Australia would do so. Their reaction would depend to some extent on that of Japan,which would be pressed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF)to avoid a devaluation.He had maintained close contact with the United states authorities at the highest levels. While they had at first seemedready to accept a devaluation of sterling with reasonable equanimity,they had more recently shown greater anxiety and had put increasing pressure on us not to devalue. But they were motivated primarily by concern about the United States dollar; and.there seemed no prospect that they would be prepared to offer support for a sufficiently long period and on the scale which would be necessary to enable usto avoid devaluation.It might be possible for us to obtain further short-term support from the international monetary community and to maintain theparity for a few months on this basis. This, however, would not be acceptable. When the short-term credits were exhausted we should again be faced with the same situation as at present; and we shouldalso require considerable standby support from the IMF, which wecould only hope to secure if we were prepared to accept conditionsinvolving an unacceptably stringent international surveillance of our economic policies.It was for these reasons that he proposed a devaluation of just under 15 per cent. Anything less than this would raise doubtsabroad about our ability to maintain the new parity; and we should then incur the danger of a second devaluation. On the other hand to devalue by more than 15 per cent would involve the risk that other major countries would devalue in turn. Moreover, if wecarried out a more drastic devaluation, we should run the risk offorfeiting the international support which we should need in the
coming months. The new rate which he proposed should give ourexporting industries an adequate opportunity to increase theircompetitiveness to the required extent.He had concluded, after full consideration, that it would be wrong to offer any guarantee at the new parity to the holders of sterling balances. To do so would be unnecessary at this stage,although we might need to reconsider the matter later in the light ofreactions in the countries concerned.It would be necessary for the Government to throw their unitedefforts into the creation of confidence in the new parity in order toensure that we should avoid a second change. The aim of the devaluation would be to improve our balance of payments position by  500 million in 1969. Even so, we should probably still be in deficit in the first half of 1968, possibly to the extent of  100 million in each of the first two quarters; and we should therefore needinternational support during that time. If we were to secure such support, it was essential that the Government should take, andshould be seen to take, adequate action to free productive resources for exports and import saving. Some of the measures required forthis purpose would begin to operate immediately; but their maximumtotal effect would be achieved in 1969. They would be designed toredeploy our resources and not to bring about further deflation.In fact, the economy was probably now expanding at a faster rate than was commonly realised and was likely to grow at the rate ofA\ per cent or more over the next 12 months, unemployment falling to 1-8 per cent by autumn 1968 and perhaps further in the following year. Even if there had been no question of devaluation, this situation would have called for action next year to reduce demand to the extent of some  200- 300 million. But, making allowance for devaluation and taking into account the consequent need both toimprove the balance of payments and to restrain inflationarypressures, it was estimated that demand would have to be reduced bysome  850 million in 1969. Of this sum the increase in pricesresulting from devaluation would automatically yield a reduction ofsome  350 million; but special measures would be needed to securethe balance.It would be essential to seek to strengthen the incomes policy,although it would probably be impracticable to introduce further legislation and we should have to rely on voluntary co-operation.It would be difficult to restrain excessive growth in incomes, since we faced the prospect of a rise in the index of retail prices of up to6 per cent, of which 2^-3 per cent would represent the consequences of devaluation. It would be very important, however, to preventincreases in incomes from whittling away the advantages of devaluation.He proposed the following measures to restrict demand:(i) Bank Rate should be increased to 8 per cent simultaneously with the devaluation.  It should be possible, however, to reduce it
again after a short period, as soon as confidence in the new parityhad been established. Monday, 20th November, would be a bank holiday; and the Stock Exchanges too should be closed on that day.(ii) Restrictions should be imposed on bank credit and shouldbe concentrated on personal loans and advances; priority would begiven to credit for exports, import substitution, agriculture and thedevelopment areas on the same lines as had obtained before therecent credit relaxations. The effect of these restrictions on demand,coupled with the increase in Bank Rate, would be a reduction of 100 million.(iii) We should restore hire purchase regulations on motor-carsto the position obtaining before September 1967 i.e., a requirement for repayment over a maximum of 30 months and a minimumdown-payment of 30 per cent. There should be consultations withthe motor firms to ensure that they switched resources to exports tothe maximum extent in order to take advantage of the favourableopportunities which devaluation would present.(iv) The fuel oil tax should be increased either by 50 per cent(1 - Id. per gallon) or by 100 per cent (2-2d. per gallon), which would yield an increase in revenue of  40 million or  80 million respectively.An increase of 50 per cent would be preferable. The increase would represent a measure of protection for the coal industry in additionto the protection which would be afforded by the increase in thecost of oil imports which would result from devaluation.(v) Corporation Tax should be increased from 40 per cent to424r per cent, yielding additional revenue of  85 million. This shouldbe announced immediately but would have to be implemented inthe next Budget. Devaluation was likely to increase the profits ofmany firms; and it might be necessary to consider later the possibilityof a larger increase in Corporation Tax. There would be no advantage in introducing a tax on dividends, since the same resultcould be achieved more effectively by increases in Corporation Tax,combined with the operation of the Capital Gains Tax.(vi) The premium of 7s. .6d. payable under the selective employment Tax (SET) to manufacturing industry should be withdrawn, except in the development areas. The premium was originally designed as a concealed export subsidy and would nolonger be appropriate in the circumstances of devaluation. Thiswould produce a saving of  100 million.(vii) We should announce immediately that the export rebatewould be abolished in the next Budget. The rebate had causedresentment in other countries and would no longer be justified afterdevaluation. This would save  100 million.(viii) He had. been discussing since last August with the defence secretary the possibility of further cuts in defence expenditure. TheDefence Secretary had now indicated that he could secure reductions of  110 million in the planned expenditure for 1968-69. A reductionof this order would bring the total expenditure on defence in thatyear below this year&apos;s expenditure in money terms; and this wouldbe the first time that we should have achieved a year-to-year reductionof this kind.
,,:   - ,. , CC 66 (67)(ix) He proposed reductions in investment by the nationalised industries totalling some  87 million, to operate in full in 1969. Itwould be necessary to consider with the Ministers concerned how this total should be constituted; one major contribution might beobtained by deferring the new power station planned for SeatonCarew.(x) He proposed reductions of  55 million in civil public expenditure. This was composed of a number of small items andtwo major ones. First, we might save  30 million by holdingexpenditure under the rate support grant to the present level, insteadof increasing it, as planned, in 1969-70. Second, it was forconsideration whether we should defer the raising of the school-leaving age from 1971 until 1975, with a saving of  25 million in1968-69 and  40 million in the following year.These proposals in aggregate would secure a reduction in demand of some  450 million. But this was insufficient; and the balance would have to be made good by increases in taxation, e.g. an increaseof 3d. or 6d. on the standard rate of income tax or an increase inSET. It would be undesirable, however, to announce specific taxincreases now, since more time was needed to determine what formthey should take and to assess the psychological reaction of the publictowards devaluation. We should announce immediately, however,that we intended to abolish the export rebate and the SET premiumat the next Budget.,The Cabinet might wish in due course to consider whethersupplementary measures of a wider character should be takenfollowing devaluation, e.g. action in the field of industrial relations.These, however, could not be regarded as an alternative to theproposed measures to restrict demand.The preliminary action necessary to effect a devaluation on18th November had been put in hand; and it would be necessaryfor the Cabinet to reach a final decision that day.The Prime Minister said that he agreed with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer that devaluation was now necessary. The main riskin this course was that too many other countries, particularly France,would also devalue. If the United States devalued the dollar, allthe major countries would then follow and the objects of our owndevaluation would be completely frustrated. The holders of sterling balances might then conclude that we should be forced into a seconddevaluation; and a serious flight from sterling would result. But,from the soundings which had been taken it seemed likely thatdevaluations by other countries would not be so extensive as to frustrate our own intentions The only alternative course which wecould contemplate would be to secure international support on sucha scale as would assure the stability of the pound for a period ofthree to four years. There were no signs that support of this kind could be obtained; and in any event it was likely to be subject tounacceptable conditions which would inhibit the conduct of our social
and economic policies. It was possible, alternatively, that we could obtain sufficient fresh support to enable us to hold the present parityfor a few more months; but this Would simply be to repeat theexperiences of the past and would mean that we should again face the prospect of devaluation when the support was exhausted. It was arguable that our economy was not in fundamental disequilibrium;and the increase in our exports to the most competitive markets overthe last two years was evidence of this. The basic problem, however,was orte of confidence we had now reached a point at which therewas continued speculation about our economic position, our everyaction was closely scrutinised and adverse developments such asstrikes were given a disproportionate significance in assessing the stability of sterling.As regards the reception of devaluation by the public and bythe Governmenfs supporters in Parliament, the first reaction mightwell be one of relief, coupled with a feeling that we could now makea fresh start. Much would depend on the way in which the decision was presented. It would be necessary to emphasise that devaluationwould mean that we should be more in control of our own destinyand less at the mercy of foreign opinion. Some of the presentanxieties which beset us, in particular the fear of prolonged unemployment and balance of payments constraint on our economic growth, should be largely removed, since devaluation should enable us to maintain a higher growth rate while moving at the same timeinto a period of export-led boom. While prices would increase,earnings opportunities should also increase (e.g. as the result ofadditional overtime) and should help to prevent any reduction in real incomes. In some quarters there might be a sense of shock atthe domestic measures with which the Government proposed tobuttress devaluation, since a large body of popular opinion supposedthat devaluation was a panacea which would transform our economic prospects without more ado. On the whole, however, given carefulpublic presentation, the Government should be able to count on a wide measure of support.The Cabinet should consider first the basic question whether weshould proceed with devaluation; second, whether, if we did so, weshould move to a fixed or floating rate; third, if we were to move toa new fixed parity, what that parity should be; and finally, how themeasures to be taken in order to reduce demand should be selected.In discussion there was general support for a devaluation, tobe effected on 18th November. A change in the parity shouldfacilitate the maintenance of an acceptable growth rate in the economy; and the accompanying measures which would have to betaken would primarily be directed not to holding back growth butto securing the necessary shift of resources into exports and import saving. While it would be necessary to acknowledge that devaluationwas a setback to the policies which the Government had pursuedhitherto, it would be essential to present it not as a step whichnullified the motivation of those policies but rather as an opportunityfor the country to break out from the balance of payments constraintwhich had inhibited them.
10802BCC 66 (67)The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet were unanimously agreed that sterling shouldbe devalued on 18th November.The Cabinet then considered the question whether the newparity should be a fixed or a floating rate of exchange.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that several argumentsfavoured a floating rate. In particular, it might provide us withsome protection against the possibility of devaluations by othercountries, since it would enable us to ensure that our rate would remain below theirs. Nevertheless, the objections to a floating ratewere overriding. It would run counter to the basic philosophy ofinternational exchange rates and would therefore incur the activehostility of the IMF and the international monetary community, whowould not be prepared to give us the support which we should need to control the situation. In those circumstances the rate might sinkto an unacceptably low level; and even though it might eventuallyrecover, the damage to the system of international trade and payments in the interim could be very grave indeed. The risks of a floating rate were too great; and we should therefore move to a newfixed parity.In discussion it was argued that, despite the risks, serious consideration should be given to a floating rate. If we moved to anew fixed rate, the Government would still be in the position ofbeing obliged to give priority in their management of the economy to the maintenance of a fixed parity and, therefore, to accept the consequential need to maintain a policy of deflation. Moreover, therise in prices which would result from devaluation would entail, ifthe Governments incomes policy were maintained, a reduction in real wages. In the light of these considerations the Governmentcould not afford to pay too much regard to the susceptibilities of theinternational monetary community and should, riot be deterred onthat account from moving to a floating rate. In any case it was arguable that we should adopt a floating rate for a temporary period in order to establish by experience the right level for a new fixedparity.On the other hand it was argued that there was a fundamental difference between the restricted posture which the Government hadbeen compelled to adopt for the last three years and the position which they could hope to enjoy after devaluation, when they wouldbe defending the new parity in a context of full employment and freedom from balance of payments constraint. To adopt a floatingrate, however, would be to ensure the hostility of other countries;and, if they too adopted floating rates in retaliation, we should be prevented from reaping the advantages of a lower parity. If, as aresult, sterling sank to very low levels in terms of other majorcurrencies, the very steep rise in domestic prices which would result might not quickly be reversed. The main argument in favour of a floating rate namely, that it offered some protection against the
loss of the advantages of a lower parity as a result of competitivedevaluations by other countries was nullified by our confidentialsoundings, which suggested that relatively few other countries ofimportance were likely to react in this way. The decisiveconsideration was the fact that our reserves of foreign exchange were inadequate to control the situation which might develop if weadopted a floating rate and that we should not be able, in the face of the hostility which we should have provoked, to secure thenecessary international support. Nor should we be assisted in establishing the right level for a new fixed parity by allowing therate to float temporarily, given the uncertain and artificial conditionswhich this would entail.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said the Cabinet agreed that we should move to a new fixed parity.The Cabinet then considered the level of the new rate. It was arguable that this should be lower than the $2-40 proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer. While our exports were basicallycompetitive, it was essential to make them substantially moreprofitable if we were to secure the necessary shift of resources fromdomestic consumption to exports. A devaluation of the order of20 per cent would be more effective for this purpose than theproposed devaluation of 14-3 per cent; and the effect on domesticprices would still not be unmanageable. On the other hand, it wasthe general view that, if we were to devalue by as much as 20 per cent,this would almost inevitably entail competitive devaluations by other major countries. Moreover, they would be likely to devalue not simply by the 5 per cent necessary to reduce the relative devaluationof the pound to 15 per cent but possibly by 10 or 15 per cent; andwe should then be in a worse position than if we had devalued by15 per cent and other major countries had either not devalued at all or had devalued by only a small amount. Moreover, a devaluationin excess of 15 per cent would be liable to antagonise the IMF, on whom we should still be dependent for support of the new parity.Finally, the more drastic the devaluation, the more severe would need to be the additional measures to restrain domestic demand,since the shift of resources required to exploit the devaluation wouldbe correspondingly greater.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed that we should move to a new fixedrate of $2 - 40 to the pound.Accompanying measures the Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to discuss the economic measures which should accompany a change in the parity of theorder now agreed. These measures should be designed to have adual effect first, to create confidence that the new rate of exchangecould be maintained; second, to permit the Governmenfs decisions as a whole to be presented positively, as affording a new opportunityto break out of our basic economic constraints, rather than in a form which might exert a depressing effect on confidence.  It would also
b 2be necessary to include measures to alleviate hardship to the poorersections of the community, such as an increase in supplementary benefits and, perhaps, additional assistance for large families. Butaction of this kind in the field of social security must not be allowedto undermine confidence that the new rate could be held; and itwould therefore be necessary to include appropriate measures toreduce public expenditure on the lines proposed by the Chancellorof the Exchequer.In discussion it was suggested that, if devaluation were accompanied by additional restrictive measures, it would be opento criticism as a repetition of the Governmenfs previous deflationarypolicies, intensified this time by a devaluation. The proposed measures should therefore be examined separately to see whethereach was essential and whether it was necessary to announce it atonce. While it was not disputed that devaluation would require aconsiderable shift of resources to exports, public opinion might reactagainst the imposition of restrictive measures to that end at a timewhen there were clearly unused resources which should be broughtinto production. Similarly, although it was now generally accepted in informed circles that a future growth rate in excess of 4 or 5 percent was in prospect, the public at large was not yet aware of this and was conscious only of the margin of resources at present unused.It might therefore be preferable to introduce the proposed measures in a phased progression, only as and when the pressure of demandmade them necessary. On the other hand the main purpose of the devaluation would be frustrated if it were not seen to be accompaniedby measures which would decisively ensure the necessary shift of resources into exports and import saving. Otherwise, a resumptionof attacks on the new parity was inevitable.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that it would be necessary to announce measures which in theaggregate would yield a convincing impression of the Governmenfsdetermination to extract the maximum of advantage from the devaluation, even though their effect would be cumulative and progressive over the next 18 months or so, as the slack in the economy was gradually taken up.The Cabinet then turned to discussion of the individual measures proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer.(a) As regards credit restrictions there was general acceptanceof the proposal that Bank Rate should be raised to 8 per cent onMonday, 20th November, and that further credit restrictions shouldbe introduced at the same time, on the understanding that prioritycredit facilities would continue to be provided for essential purposessuch as exports, import saving, and agricultural production. these measures of credit restrictions should be announced at the same time as devaluation.(b) Hire Purchase Restrictions in respect of motor cars wouldin any event have to be intensified in the next three months; and itwould therefore be advisable to introduce the necessary regulations
forthwith in order to exert pressure on the industry to increase theproportion of output which was exported. It was suggested that a sudden reversal of the easement of hire purchase restrictions whichhad been announced only the previous September would be a seriousblow to the industry and that it might therefore be preferable to seek to negotiate with the motor manufacturers an arrangement whereby they would undertake to increase their export effort to theextent desired on the understanding that, at the point at which thisresulted in a shortage in the home market, the necessary measuresto curb demand would be taken. On the other hand such anarrangement might result in attempts to forestall the impendingrestrictions and would also be liable to imperil conviction that theaccompanying measures would be sufficient to enable the new parityto be defended. It was therefore agreed that, on balance, the right course would be to introduce and to announce forthwith hire purchaserestrictions on a scale designed to achieve a reduction in hire purchasedebt of  100 million.(c) The tax on fuel oil for industrial purposes should also beincreased; and if the increase were announced at once, it should take immediate effect in order to avoid forestalling. Whether the increase should be 50 per cent or 100 per cent required further consideration;but neither amount should prejudice the Governments fuel policy,while either would be politically advantageous in relation to opinion among the miners, who could be expected to welcome an increase inthe cost of imported oil. On the other hand an increase in the duty would be liable to have an adverse effect on industrial costs,particularly since it would be superimposed on the surcharge whichhad been introduced a few months earlier as a result of the recentwar between Israel and the Arab States, and the resultant closure of the Suez Canal and interruption of Middle Eastern oil supplies.An additional burden on industry would therefore be likely to beself-defeating as regards exports; and small businesses in sectors ofthe economy where fuel oil accounted for a considerable proportionof manufacturing costs would be particularly hard hit. On the otherhand only the steel, glass, pottery and cement industries would be significantly affected; the tax did not affect fuel oil for transport;and the &quot; Middle East surcharge &quot; could be expected to be reduced in the not too distant future. It would therefore be reasonable toincrease the tax as part of the measures to accompany devaluation,although the extent and timing of the increase should be further considered by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in consultation withthe Minister of Power and other Ministers principally concerned.(d) An increase in major taxes might also be necessary if theaccompanying measures were to be adequate in their totality. Therewere several possibilities in this respect. Thus, the standard rate of income tax might be increased by 3d. or 6d.; the Corporation Taxmight be increased by 1\ per cent; and the Selective employment tax (SET) might also be increased or, alternatively, the 7s. 6d.premium under SET for manufacturing industry outside development areas might be withdrawn. It was arguable that increases in majortaxes should be reserved for the Budget and that, in particular, a
change in income tax should not be made without careful priorconsideration of its implications in terms of the changes which mightbe required in the related structure of personal allowances.Moreover, it would be liable to act as a disincentive to further effort;and international opinion would be critical of it on this score. Anincrease in SET would also be disadvantageous in the light of itsinevitable effect on prices, since experience had shown that thesuppliers of goods and services were apt to use it as an excuse forunnecessary or undue price increases, frequently in areas where theseaffected the public directly. On the other hand it would not bepossible to assemble a convincing aggregate of accompanyingmeasures without some increase in the major taxes. Withdrawalof the SET 7s. 6d. premium (save in development areas) would therefore be justified, since the indirect subsidy to exports which hadbeen the main purpose of this premium should become unnecessaryonce the parity had been changed. An increase in Corporation tax would also be appropriate, in the light of the increase in industrialprofits which must be expected over the next few years as a resultof the industrial recovery which was now clearly in progress andwould be reinforced by the change in the rate of exchange. In thesecircumstances it would be both reasonable on merits and defensibleas a measure of public equity to increase the tax on distributions of profit; and, since Corporation Tax had been introduced in order to differentiate between distributed and undistributed profits and aspecial tax on dividends appeared to be impracticable, an increasein Corporation Tax would be wholly justified. Indeed, in the lightof the considerable increase in profits now in prospect, a case couldbe made out for a larger increase than the proposed 2\ per cent. Onthe other hand if the measures to accompany devaluation were seen to include two increases in taxation (i.e., on fuel oil and on profits)both of which could be argued to affect industry adversely, an increaseof more than 2\ per cent in Corporation Tax might be held to be excessive and, therefore, to depress industrial morale. On balance,therefore, the wisest course would be to abolish the SET 7s. 6d.premium, save in development areas, and to increase CorporationTax by 2\ per cent. These changes would be made in the 1968 Budgetbut should be announced at once as part of the measures in supportof devaluation.: (e) The Export Rebate had been designed to provide, as far as was possible consistently without international obligations, an exportsubsidy. But it had been severely criticised by many countries; andits retention after a devaluation of 14 - 3 per cent could not be justified.It should therefore be abolished. Legislation would be necessary forthis purpose. But, provided that the decision was announced at onceas part of the measures accompanying devaluation, statutory action could be taken in the 1968 Finance Bill.(/) Reductions in defence expenditure had been under discussion between the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary of Statefor Defence since the summer, with the purpose of achieving a saving of some  60 million. In present circumstances it would be right to
substitute a more exacting target, particularly since the restrictivemeasures consequential upon a change in the parity would not be politically acceptable without further economies in defence expenditure. An additional saving of some  50 million, making atotal of some  110 million in all, could be achieved without significantchanges in foreign commitments and policy, mainly by reductions in the rate of re-equipment of our forces and in research anddevelopment expenditure. A reduction of this size would bringdefence expenditure in 1968-69 not only below the target set for 1970but also below probable actual expenditure in 1967-68.(g) Investment in the nationalised industries should make a contribution to the reduction of demand. The Treasury had drawnup provisional proposals for reductions totalling  87 million in1968-69, equivalent to a reduction in demand of  75 million. the specific reductions to be imposed would need to be discussed withthe Ministers concerned as soon as security requirements permitted;, but among the proposals which should be considered were thefollowing: cancellation of the Seaton Carew power station, due tobe started in 1968, with a saving of associated expenditure ondistribution of electricity; a slowing down of investment in theintroduction of North Sea gas ( 10 million); a reduction in investment in collieries ( 7 million); a deferment of work on port installations( 2 million); a reduction in the investment programme of the british steel Corporation (up to  10 million); a reduction in railwayinvestment ( 5 million); economies in the replacement of buses bythe publicly-owned companies; a deferment of the extension of theBrixton underground line; an extension in the waiting list fortelephones; a reduction in Government building; economies inairports, sound broadcasting and investment by the Atomic energy authority; and a decision against development of the BAC 2-11aircraft.It was not proposed that expenditure under the forthcomingCoal Industry Bill should be affected. The interests of thedevelopment areas should be safeguarded so far as possible in determining the programme of reductions.(h) Reductions should be sought in civil public expenditure.These should comprise a few major items rather than a larger numberof small savings.  Two major items were discussed:(i) A saving of  30 million could be secured by holding therate support grant in 1969 to the present level, instead ofincreasing it in that year as was at present planned. in discussion it was suggested that this would simply reduceCentral Government expenditure by transferring theburden to local rates, which would make it more difficult for local authorities to avoid increases in council houserents and would do nothing to divert resources intoexports and import saving. In any event, since themeasure would not take effect until 1969, there would beno advantage in announcing it now. On the other handif was argued that, if the grant was not increased in 1969,this would imply that the Government would need to
CC66(67)reduce their demands on local authorities at that timeand the latter would then have an incentive to reduce their expenditure in order to avoid increases in rates, thusreleasing real resources. In further discussion, there was general agreement that the Government should seek tosecure a saving of  30 million in the local authority fieldin 1969; and it was agreed that the Lord President of theCouncil, the Secretary of State for Scotland and theMinister of Housing should consult with the Chancellorof the Exchequer with a view to deciding as soon aspossible whether this saving should be achieved by holding the rate support grant to its present level orwhether there were other preferable means of securing an economy of this order in local authority expenditure.Whatever means were finally approved, credit should betaken for a saving of  30 million in this respect in theannouncement to be made after devaluation.(ii) It was suggested that the raising of the school-leaving ageshould be postponed from 1970 to 1975. On the otherhand it was urged that it would be wrong to seek to decidea major issue of this kind without more matureconsideration, particularly since, if the critical date wasonce deferred, it might prove to have been postponedindefinitely. There was general agreement that thereshould be no reference to this measure in theannouncement after devaluation but that the cabinet should reconsider the matter at an early date thereafter,bearing in mind the overriding need to convinceinternational opinion that the measures to be taken would suffice, in their totality, to exert adequate restraint on domestic demand (after allowing for any improvement in social security benefits which might be agreed) to securethe necessary diversion of resources to exports.(/) It was agreed that it would be essential to include in theannouncement some indication that steps would be taken to assistthose sections of the community who would be most adversely affected by price increases. These might include increases insupplementary benefit and / or family allowances. The First Secretaryof State, in consultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer andthe Minister of Social Security, should consider the terms in whichthis issue should be dealt with in the announcement following devaluation.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the measures which the Cabinet had now approved (including an economy of some  30 million in the field of local authority expenditure but without prejudice to the decision on the defermentof the raising of the school-leaving age) should effect a reduction of demand in the region of  450 million. The means by which this figure could, if necessary,  be increased could await further
consideration. The Cabinet should now consider the timetable ofaction required to give effect to their decisions.It would be necessary to announce the decision to devalue at about 9.30 p.m. or 10 p.m. on Saturday evening, 18th November,when financial markets throughout the world, including the criticalarea of the Middle East, would be closed. He would be expectedto make a television broadcast at that time; and he would alsoarrange, with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, to meet appropriaterepresentatives of the Press on the following morning, Sunday,19th November. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would need tomake a formal statement in the House of Commons on Monday afternoon, 20th November. Thereafter it would be appropriate toprovide time for a two-day Parliamentary Debate on Tuesday andWednesday, 21st and 22nd November. An Opposition Motion of censure could clearly be expected; and this should be countered bya Government Motion inviting the House of Commons to approve the Chancellor of the Exchequers statement. The order ofGovernment speakers in the debate should be agreed in the normal way.In discussion there was general agreement with the timetablesuggested by the Prime Minister1. Since the House of Lords did not normally meet on Mondays, there might be a demand for it to be recalled on 20th November. If so, it would be right to accede to this demand and to arrange business accordingly.In further discussion it was emphasised that it would be essentialto present the Governments decision to change the parity positively,in a spirit of optimism and confidence, and to explain clearly thenecessity for the supporting measures which the Government wouldbe proposing. The situation which made these measures necessaryhad arisen to a considerable extent from causes outside theGovernments control; and all the measures to improve and stabiliseour economic and financial position, including those agreed at thepresent meeting, had been taken with the full authority of theGovernment as a whole. The Cabinet were unanimous in payingtribute to, the efforts which the Chancellor of the Exchequer had made, and was making, to strengthen the country&apos;s economy andthe balance of payments and in expressing their wish that he should remain in office in order to maintain those efforts, in which he wouldhave their united support.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was prepared totake responsibility for the devaluation operation but that thereafterhe might feel compelled to consider his position in the light of the pledges which he had given in the past to holders of sterling thattheir balances would not be devalued.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that whileit was for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to reach his own decision as regards his personal position, the pledges which he had given tothe holders of sterling balances had been given with the full authorityof the Cabinet as a whole, just as the Cabinet now endorsed his recommendation for a change in the parity of sterling and for
appropriate accompanying measures to divert resources to exports and import saving in order to take advantage of the freshopportunities in these fields which the devaluation would provide.It had been agreed that further consideration should be given tocertain consequential questions; and these should be pursuedbetween the Ministers concerned. At the same time all possible care should be taken to prevent premature disclosure of the Governmenfsdecisions; and no information about the course of the cabinets discussion should be given, before the public announcement, to anyindividuals other than those directly concerned. There had been general agreement that the Governmenfs decisions should be presented positively, as affording the country a new opportunity tobreak free from the continuing economic constraints of recent years;and he would discuss with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and other ministers how such a presentation might best be achieved. Finally,the Cabinet should make a united stand, in both public and private discussion, to defend their new economic policy and to reassert their political authority in face of the hostile criticism which was to beexpected from the Opposition and some sections of the Press.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with unanimous approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion of the devaluation of sterling and the necessary consequential measures.(2) Agreed:(a) that the parity of the pound sterling should bereduced to a new fixed rate of $2 - 40 to the pound,representing a devaluation of 14-3 per cent;(b) that measures should be introduced to free resources on a scale designed to secure an improvement ofat least  500 million on the balance of payments;subject to the right of the Chancellor^ the Exchequer to invite the Cabinet to reconsider these decisions if, before they were announced, there should be major internationaldevelopments justifying such action.(3) Agreed that, otherwise, these decisions should be announced in the late evening of Saturday, 18th November; thatthey should be formally communicated to Parliament onMonday, 20th November; and that arrangements shouldbe made for a Parliamentary debate as soon as possible thereafter.(4) Agreed that the measures to reduce demand set out in the annex should be introduced as appropriate and shouldbe announced together with, or as soon as possible after,devaluation.(5) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider theextent and timing of such further tax increases as mightbe required in order to bring the reduction in demandeffected by the measures in the Annex to the prescribedtotal.
(6) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council, the Secretary of Statefor Scotland and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment, to consider how a saving of some  30 million in expenditure by local authorities could best be made,whether by withholding any increase in the Rate support grant or by other means yielding an equivalent saving.(7) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Scotland, the Ministers ofTransport, Power and Technology, and (after devaluationhad been announced) with the Chairmen of the Boards ofthe Nationalised Industries (including the Post Office), toconsider the best means of securing a reduction (in demand terms) of some  75 million in 1968-69 in the investment programmes of those industries.(8) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Secretary of State for Education and Science and theother Ministers principally concerned, to arrange forfurther consideration to be given to the advisability of postponing the raising of the school-leaving age to1974-75.(9) Agreed to give further consideration, at a subsequent meetingof the Cabinet and in the light of their decision ondevaluation, to the memoranda by the First Secretaryof State, the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of Technology on British European AirwaysRe-equipment (C (67) 176, 177 and 178).(10) Agreed in principle that the Governmenfs decision toprotect those members of the community who would be most adversely affected by devaluation should be announced at the same time as the decision ondevaluation itself; and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer, in consultation with the First Secretary ofState and the Minister of Social Security, to consider theamount and form of possible measures to this end.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,16th November, 1967.
