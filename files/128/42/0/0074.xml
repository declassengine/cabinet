IndustrialDisputesDocks: LondonWeeklyGuarantee(previous reference:CC(67) 63rdConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Cabinet considered a note by the Minister of Labour(C (67) 200) to which was attached a memorandum by the Minister,which had been considered on the previous day by the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes, about the agreement in theLondon docks for an increase in the weekly guarantee payment todock workers.The Minister of Labour said that the report by Lord Devlin ondecasualisation in the docks had recommended that there should bea weekly guarantee payment for dock workers of  15, and negotiations in London for an additional differential of  1. Theemployers in London, however, had signed an agreement with theunions as part of the negotiations for decasualisation providing fora weekly guarantee in London of  17 instead of the  16 indicated bythe Devlin report. He had since then resisted pressure from boththe employers and the unions for implementation of this agreement on the grounds that this would inevitably lead to pressure for thelevel of the guarantee in other ports to be raised from  15 to  16.However, there had been increasing pressure by the unions, bothofficially and unofficially, for implementation of the Marchagreement, and the London Docks Committee of the Transport andGeneral Workers Union (T &amp; GWU) had now applied to the Union&apos;general Executive Council for plenary powers to enable them totake industrial action if the agreement were not implemented earlyin January. In face of this pressure, the London employers had now decided to pay the  17 weekly guarantee from the 8th January, andthis could be prevented only by a reference to the National board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) and a direction under Section 15 ofthe Prices and Incomes Act of 1966.He emphasised that what was at stake was an agreement not fora wage increase but only for an increase in guarantee payments. Theeffects of allowing the agreement to be implemented would beinsignificant in money terms, amounting to an addition of one-quarterof 1 per cent to the wage bill in London. Only 5-6 per cent of thelabour force were affected at any one time by payment of theguarantee, both in London and in the ports generally. Moreover,the significance of the guarantee payment would diminish further asa consequence of decasualisation as dockers generally were takeninto permanent employment. The extra cost of the agreement inLondon would be some  60,000 a year and it was not intended toincrease any port charges to meet it. Although payment of thehigher guarantee would thus be insignificant in terms of additional cost, the T &amp; GWU were determined to secure the increase becausethey believed that only by showing results on this issue could theyreassert their precarious control over their membership in the face of threats by the unofficial elements in London to resume industrial action from 1st January if their demands were not met. If theGovernment prevented implementation of the agreement, therewould certainly be an unofficial stoppage and possibly an official8694a 2
strike; and it was clear that, if there were again a stoppage, some employers would feel obliged to suspend men who were not themselves on strike but for whom no work could be found: thiswould be likely to lead to an official strike in the lighterage sectionof the Port of London. On the other hand, if the higher guarantee in London were conceded,  17 might come to be regarded as aminimum wage which the Government had accepted, and therewould, be repercussions on wage claims now pending in other important sectors of industry. On balance, however, and havingregard to the serious consequences for the economy of a stoppagein the docks, he recommended that the London employers should beallowed to implement the March agreement; it would then be important to limit the repercussions on the Governmenfs incomes policy by presenting the decision in the best possible light. At their discussion on the previous day, a majority of the ministerial committee on Prices and Incomes had supported this view.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs said he accepted that, if implementation of the agreement were not allowed, therewould inevitably be trouble in the docks, though it was not possibleto foresee how extensive this would be: it was possible that anyunofficial action might not last long in view of the extended stoppagein October and November. There was also the danger of an officialstrike, though the London Docks Committee of the T &amp; GWU hadnot yet obtained the plenary authority which they had requestedfrom the Union&apos;s Executive, and the latter in considering this requestwould have to take account of the fact that the Union had lodgeda national claim, including a claim for a  16 guarantee payment inall ports, on which negotiations had not yet taken place. In theevent of a strike, the Government would have to decide whether tomove troops into the docks; if they did, there would be danger ofa national dock strike. If strike action were taken after the making of a direction under the Act, it might well be necessary to use penalsanctions against the dock workers. Above all, there was the effectof a strike on exports and the economy generally. But on the otherhand there could be no possible justification in terms of the government&apos;s incomes policy for allowing the agreement to go through. If this were done, there would be a widespread impression that the Government had accepted  17 a week as a minimum wage.The dock workers would be getting a further increase in pay within four months of the increases they received on the introduction ofdecasualisation. An increase in the weekly guarantee could not bejustified on grounds of increased productivity or of low wageearning. There would inevitably be pressure from other ports forcorresponding increases in the guarantee. If the Governmentallowed the agreement to be implemented, this would be widelyinterpreted as a retreat under pressure and would cast doubt on the government&apos;s&apos; determination to sustain the incomes policy. Whilethe consequences of either course of action would be serious, toallow the agreement to be implemented would amount toabandoning the incomes policy and the right course was therefore to refer the matter to the NBPI.
In discussion there was support for the view expressed by theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs. It was argued that the dock workers had benefited from a generous settlement very recentlyand if they were now allowed a further improvement in conditions,this would have serious repercussions on wage claims in otherindustries, particularly in engineering and buses where there hadbeen no recent increases. If the Government were not prepared touse their statutory powers in such a flagrant case, it was difficult to envisage their ever being used and it would be impossible to stand firm against other claims. The repercussions on incomes policy might be such that it would no longer be possible to rely on thepolicy to make a significant contribution to the restraint of demandwhich was essential following devaluation, and this would mean evenmore severe measures of other kinds. Moreover, negotiations had yet to take place on a national claim for an increase in the weeklyguarantee in the docks and the National Association of port employers were opposing the claim; it would be unprecedented inthese circumstances for the Government to prejudice the nationalnegotiations by allowing the London agreement to be implemented.On the other hand, there was wide support for the course recommended by the Minister of Labour. January would be acritical month for the economy and the Government could not afford to risk, a major strike, which would have a disastrous effect on confidence. The use of troops to operate the docks could have onlya limited effect and would almost certainly lead to stoppages in otherports, particularly Liverpool and Hull. To allow the implementation of the London agreement would undoubtedly weaken prices and incomes policy, but there would be no question of its completelywrecking that policy. While other unions would certainly make useof the increase in the weekly guarantee in furtherance of their ownwage claims, the effect on other claims was unlikely to be dramatic,and it was misleading to suggest that the result would be to encourage the adoption of  17 a week as a minimum wage standard; there hadbeen no tendency to regard the present guarantee of  16 a week in this light. It was widely recognised in the trade union movementthat guarantee payments were a peculiar feature of conditions in the docks which were justified by the intermittent nature of the work.Moreover, even if the Government did not use their statutory powers in this case, it was all too likely that the powers would have to beused later in respect of wage claims by engineering and bus workers.But it was essential that the Government should be sure of theirground, both in substance and as regards presentation, before they made use of these powers. In the present case there was some justification for increasing the differential in guarantee payments asbetween London and the rest of the country; a recent report by the nbpi had endorsed a differential of over  2 a week as between london and the provinces for public service employees. If it became necessary for the Government to engage in a majorconfrontation with the unions, this should be done on a much more substantial issue than the present one.
In further discussion, it was suggested that the present casepointed to the need for a much tougher incomes policy possibly acomplete wage freeze backed by extended statutory powers, and serious consideration should be given to this.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised that they were faced with a choice of evils, but their view on balance was that the worse evil would be to hold upthe implementation of the London agreement and thus run the riskof a strike in London and possibly in the ports generally at a timewhen this would be disastrous for the economy. They fully recognised that this decision was dictated by expediency rather thanby principle. The Minister of Labour should accordingly beempowered to inform the parties concerned that the Governmentwould not press its objections to the implementation of the Londonagreement. It would be essential to give careful thought to thepublic presentation of this decision, and in particular to emphasise that what was at issue was not a wage increase but an improvementin the special guarantee arrangements in the docks. The Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs should give further consideration tothe case for a tougher incomes policy backed by extended statutory powers.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Labour should be empowered toinform the parties concerned that the Government wouldnot press further their objections to the implementation of the agreement of March 1967 for a guarantee paymentof  17 a week in the London docks.(2) Invited the Minister of Labour, in consultation with theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, to take accountof the points made by the Foreign Secretary in his summing up in publicly presenting the government&apos;s decision.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the other Ministers concerned, toconsider the case for a tougher incomes policy backed byextended statutory powers, and to report to hiscolleagues.RacialDiscriminationRace RelationsLegislation(previous reference:CC (65) 31stConclusions,Minute 3)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home Secretary(C (67) 196) and the Minister of Labour (C (67) 199) on legislation to make racial discrimination in various fields unlawful.The Home Secretary recalled that in July the Home AffairsCommittee had approved in outline proposals for legislation tostrengthen the Race Relations Act, 1965, which had been putforward by his predecessor. Since then these proposals had been further developed in the light of inter-departmental discussions.
Their main effect would be to make discrimination on racial groundsunlawful (a) in respect of places and services open or available to thepublic at large;(b) in employment or trade union activities, except temporarilyfor the purpose of preserving a balance between racialgroups in a labour force, and subject also to an exception for domestic employment and employers of fewer than10 workpeople;(c) in the disposal of house or other property, with someexception for shared accommodation and lodgings;(d) in the provision of insurance and credit facilities;(e) in the form of discriminatory advertisements.There would be special provision for voluntary machinery establishedby industry to attempt conciliation in the first instance; the race relations Board (RRB) would be empowered to seek injunctions ordamages in specially designated county courts sitting with assessors(with corresponding arrangements for Scotland) and the national committee for Commonwealth Immigrants would be replaced by a statutory Board. It was proposed that, with appropriate exceptions,the provisions of the amended Act should bind the Crown.He recognised that these provisions would be difficult to enforce,but enforcement was not their prime object. The purpose of theBill was to establish the principle that discrimination was contraryto the public interest; to educate public opinion; to encouragepeople of goodwill to stand out against discrimination; and toprovide machinery for conciliation. For these purposes the legislationmust be comprehensive and a remedy in the courts must be availablein the last resort. It was also essential presentationally and politicallythat the Crown, as employer and as a provider of public services,should be seen to be bound by the Bill. The most difficult andcontroversial of his proposals was that relating to&apos;the sale of a houseby a private owner-occupier, where it might be said that the privatecitizen should not be required to satisfy an outside body about aprivate transaction that injunction procedures would seldom be effective, and that damages would be difficult to quantify. Housingwas, however, the touchstone of the sincerity of the government&apos;s policy on race relations. Any measure which could prevent thedevelopment of residential ghetto areas for the coloured community would be valuable, and, since most people obeyed the law, theinclusion of private housing in the new legislation would have animportant effect.The Minister of Labour said that it would not be appropriate for the industrial conciliation machinery, to which his department would refer complaints about discrimination in employment, to dealwith complaints against the Crown. A procedure modelled on thatof the Parliamentary Commissioner might be more suitable, but,since procedural modifications might weaken the impact of the Bill,
it would be preferable for the Government to give an undertaking that the Crown, though not bound by the Bill, would submit to the scrutiny of the RRB. It was also desirable to consider what theposition of the police would be. The exemption for small employersmight be removed progressively by a provision in the statute itself,and it would help to ensure the confidence of industry in themachinery for handling employment complaints if the President ofthe Industrial Court were made ex officio Vice-Chairman of theRRB responsible for the machinery established for this purpose.In discussion there was general agreement that industry shouldbe given an opportunity to deal by means of its own machinery withcomplaints of discrimination in employment, and that as anadditional measure it would be useful for the President of theIndustrial Court to be made Vice-Chairman of the RRB with responsibility, subject to the agreement of the Board as a whole, forthe arrangements for the Board to handle complaints of discrimination which nevertheless came to it. The position of thepolice should be examined further; they were not employees of theCrown, but it was for consideration whether discrimination by apoliceman should be dealt with under the police disciplinary code orunder the Act. A similar problem arose in relation to members ofthe Armed Forces.In further discussion of the application of the proposed Bill tothe disposal of owner-occupied houses, it was argued that the ability to buy house property was considered by the immigrants themselves and by the organisations interested in their welfare to be of crucial importance. If owner-occupied housing were not covered, theGovernment would not be thought to be seriously attacking theproblem, and there would probably be pressure to exempt localauthority housing as well. Moreover, without the proposed provision,it would be difficult to deal with cases of conspiracy, such as had recently arisen, to induce an owner-occupier to sell his house to a group of white neighbours rather than tp a coloured man. On theother hand, it was pointed out that a white house-owner who for good reason wished to sell his house to a white man would be liableto be the subject of a complaint by a disappointed coloured man who could bring him before the local conciliation committee and causehim to be subjected to public criticism for an act of discriminationwhen in fact his action was not discriminatory and would not be soregarded by the RRB or the courts. While in some circumstances it might be valuable to shame persons guilty of discrimination byconfronting them with the complainant, it would not always be clearwhere right lay. Was an owner to be criticised for refusing to sellto a coloured man who offered a high price for the house with theintention of overcrowding it with compatriots? It was suggestedthat there was a risk that public opinion might be affronted bycomplaints against white house-owners who were exercising a legitimate freedom to dispose of their own property and were notactuated by racial prejudice. This might nullify the intendededucational effect of the measure. It was also open to doubt whetherit was wise to use the law as a means of declaring principles which if! -&apos;.: :   :      secret :   - - ;
TheatreCensorshipRepresentationof livingpersons(previous reference:CC(67) 53rdConclusions,Minute 3)confidential. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home secretary and by his predecessor on the representation of living persons in the theatre (C (67) 197 and 186).The Home Secretary recalled that the Cabinet had previouslyagreed to accept in principle the recommendations of the Joint SelectCommittee on Censorship of the Theatre that pre-censorship shouldbe abolished and the law on obscene publications adapted to coverstage plays; and they had invited his predecessor to consider howprovision could be made to deal with the problems of the representation of living persons on the stage. His predecessor had indicated in C (67) 186 that he considered that there was no satisfactory way of prohibiting the representation of living personswithout introducing a stricter censorship than that now operated bythe Lord Chamberlain. He himself had now had an opportunity of considering proposals subsequently put forward by Lord Goodmanfor dealing with this matter, but they were also unsatisfactory andhe agreed with his predecessor^ conclusion that the best course wouldcould not be adequately backed by sanctions, and it was far fromclear that the courts could take effective action even if a case of discrimination were made out. It would be unusual to give thempower to issue a mandatory injunction compelling an owner to sell toa particular purchaser, and the power to award damages would be of little value since the damage suffered by an unsuccessful purchasercould hardly be identified. He might recover his expenses, forexample, a surveyors fee, but no more.In further discussion it was suggested that the issues raised bythe proposals, and in particular by those relating to house property,ought to be considered by the Home Affairs Committee. Since theywere largely of a political character it would be necessary to bring them back to the Cabinet, but they should be more thoroughlydiscussed first.The Lord Advocate indicated that he would wish to be involvedin discussion of the legal aspects of the Bill.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not yet ready to reach a decision on the application ofthe Bill to house property. The issues raised should be discussed further by the Home Affairs Committee and their advice should bebrought before the Cabinet in the New Year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the HomeAffairs Committee to give further consideration to theHome Secretary&apos;s proposals, with particular reference tothe application of the proposed Bill to the sale of owner-occupied houses.- (2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later date.
be to make defamation in a play (as on television) a ground for an action for libel. Mr. Strauss, who had been Chairman of the joint select Committee on Censorship of the Theatre, had been successful in the ballot for Private Members&apos; Bills, and proposed to introduce a Bill to give effect to the recommendations of that Committee.Mr. Strauss had indicated that he was not prepared to include provision to prohibit the representation of living persons. In viewof Mr. Strauss&apos; attitude and of the difficulties of such provision he proposed that the Government should provide Mr. Strauss with thedraft of a Bill implementing the recommendations of the Joint SelectCommittee, including the recommendation that defamation in playsshould be made a ground of action for libel. Mr. Strauss should,however, be told that the Government should not be taken ascommitted to rejecting the inclusion of some prohibition of the representation of living persons, or some other means of dealing withthe problem, at a later stage of the Bill. The Cabinet could considerthe matter again in the light of the views expressed in the Houseof Commons in the debate on the Second Reading of the Bill.In discussion it was pointed out that the Lord Chamberlain had indicated that he would see objection to a prohibition that was limitedto representation of The Queen, and in view of the difficulty of devising a general prohibition of representation of living persons thatwould not operate more restrictively than the present censorship bythe Lord Chamberlain, there seemed to be no satisfactory alternative- to relying on the application of the law of libel notwithstanding thatthis could operate only after the event.The Cabinet Approved the proposal to hand Mr. Strauss a draft Bill onthe basis indicated in C (67) 197. -confidential. The Foreign Secretary said that negotiations between King Constantine of Greece and the Greek military regime, which had followed the King&apos;s flight to Rome, had run into difficulties. Butthe regime did not apparently wish to break entirely with the Kingnor the King with the regime. The regime was taking steps to giveitself a more civilian character, and was treating with leniency thoseinvolved in the King&apos;s abortive coup. He had been impressed bythe Greek Foreign Minister, M. Pipinelis, whom he had met at themeeting of the North Atlantic Council in Brussels. AlthoughM. Pipinelis clearly belonged to the Right wing, he was opposed tothe military junta and favoured a return to constitutional rule. Noquestion of formal recognition need arise so long as there was no final breach between the regime and the King; but the question would arise if such a breach occurred. Several of our allies, includingGermany, France, the United States and Turkey, were in varying degrees already transacting business with officials of the regime; andGermany and Turkey were thinking of formal recognition. If were fused to have any contact with officials, we should be precluded from doing any official business or helping British nationals inOverseaAffairsGreece(previous reference:CC(67) 70thConclusions,Minute 3)
The Cabinet Approved the policy proposed by the Foreign Secretary.aid programme(previous reference:CC (67) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)Economic aid for singapore and MalaysiaSECRET5. The Foreign Secretary said that at a meeting that morning,the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had considered proposals by the Minister of Overseas Development on aid to mitigate theeffects of our military withdrawal from Singapore and Malaysia.We were committed to give such aid; the points for decision werethe amount of aid and the timing of our decision and of itscommunication to the two Governments. The figures before theCommittee for the period up to 1970-71, which would be the mid-point in a military withdrawal to be completed by 1975, were 30 million for Singapore and  23 million for Malaysia, nearly halfof which would not be required until 1970-71. It was proposed thatour negotiators should initially indicate our readiness to provide upto  5 million less than these amounts in each case, but that theyshould have freedom to increase the offers to this extent if necessary.In addition there would be other forms of assistance (including theprovision of inducements to British firms) and provisional authority was sought to commit up to  12 million for Singapore and  5 million for Malaysia on these. All these figures had been worked out afterinvestigations in the two countries and some discussion with their governments in relation to the existing timetable for withdrawal from the Far East. Negotiations were due to begin early in the NewYear.We now faced a new situation in that we might have to decide to accelerate our withdrawal from the Far East to make the necessarycuts in expenditure. For Singapore this would greatly worsen an employment prospect that was already extremely serious. ForMalaysia it would mean breaking our Treaty commitments. when we came to take our decisions early in lanuary, there would be verylittle time in which to consult with the two. Governments and it was important therefore that the atmosphere for these consultations should be as favourable as possible.Greece. He therefore sought the agreement of his colleagues to apolicy of continuing to withhold contact at Ambassadorial level, but of authorising the conduct of day-to-day business with officials onthe understanding that it did not involve any act which could beconstrued as formal recognition of the regime. He thought thesituation could be held for a time on this basis, although it might benecessary to change our policy if there were another crisis in Cyprus.In discussion the following points were made- (a) If King Constantine did agree to return, he would toall intents and purposes be a tool of the regime.(b) It was most important that we should if necessary be ableto exert our proper influence in the event of a new crisis in Cyprus;and we could do so only if we had contacts with the Greek regime.
Against this background the preponderant view in the defence and Oversea Policy Committee had been that, whatever might havebeen true in relation to the existing withdrawal plans, the amounts of aid proposed were the; smallest price that we could expect to payif we wished to accelerate our withdrawal from the two countries and that the only reasonable prospect of obtaining the acquiescenceof their Governments in a faster rundown lay in deciding now onthese amounts of aid and on informing them quickly.There had, however, been two minority views in the Committee.The first was that, despite the difficulties that would be involvedin discriminating in our treatment between Malaysia and Singapore,we should take account of the fact that the former was much strongereconomically and was faced with much less serious problems as aresult of our withdrawal; we should not therefore commit ourselvesas heavily to Malaysia as to Singapore. The other minority view was that, as a matter of principle, we should not decide this issue in advance of general decisions on savings and expenditure as awhole and in particular until we knew what we could afford. Butthe preponderant view had been that both the savings which wewere looking for in our defence expenditure in the Far East and the safety of our troops might be put at risk if we did not approvenow the amounts of aid proposed and communicate them to theGovernments of Singapore and Malaysia before we had to tell them of our intention to withdraw even more quickly than they had hitherto been led to believe. If the Cabinet were to endorse thisview, it was for consideration whether the decision should be passed to the Prime Minister, who would be meeting the Prime Minister of singapore, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, and the Deputy Prime Minister of malaysia, Tun Razak, in Australia, on the occasion of the memorial service later that day for the late Prime Minister of Australia,Mr. Holt. This would enable the Prime Minister to communicate the decision to them, if he thought fit, at the same time as he gave them a general warning that we might accelerate our withdrawal from the area.In discussion the view was expressed that, since we might haveto inform the Governments of Singapore and Malaysia within a fewweeks of our intention to withdraw our forces from their countriesmore rapidly than had been planned hitherto, it would be better asa matter of tactics to delay until then giving them any indication ofthe amounts and mitigatory aid that we had in mind. Otherwisewe might find that the two Governments would be encouraged toask for additional aid when they were informed that we planned towithdraw our forces more quickly. We should delay a decision onthe aid to be given to Singapore and Malaysia until we could look at this in the light of the full programme of reductions inGovernment expenditure. The two countries had not been helpful to us in the context of the devaluation of sterling and had failed togive us arty assurances about their future actions in this respect.On the other hand it was argued that if we did not now offeraid on the scale proposed, the prospect for an orderly and safewithdrawal of our forces at the faster rate that might soon be decided
Oil Prices:Devaluationand Surcharge(previous reference:CC(67) 68thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Prime Minister should, if he judged itdesirable to do so, indicate to the Governments of singapore and Malaysia that we were prepared to make available as mitigatory aid up to 1970-71 sums of theorder of  25 million for Singapore and  18 million forMalaysia.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange for thePrime Minister to be informed of Conclusion (1).secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of power (C (67) 198) about the effects of devaluation on oil prices.The Minister of Power said that immediately after devaluationthe oil companies had informed his Department that their costs andthe price of oil products would be affected. He had requested themto make no change in prices until the effects of devaluation had beenupon would be seriously prejudiced.    We had given the twoGovernments to understand that we would inform them, by aboutthe end of the year, of the aid that we were prepared to offer inrelation to the existing withdrawal plans  up to  1970-71 in preparation for negotiations early in the New Year. We had brokenour undertakings about defence commitments to these countries on two previous occasions and the fact that we might now intend towithdraw our forces more quickly had become known to them.  Ifwe could not give firm assurances about mitigatory aid, theforthcoming negotiations with Singapore and Malaysia, which wouldin any event be difficult, would become much more so. The task of withdrawing 35,000 servicemen, their wives and families and largequantities of military stores, was very large and complex; and stability in the two countries, together with the co-operation of the local governments, would be essential to its success.  The Prime minister would be having discussions with Lee Kuan Yew and Tun Razak.and there would be advantage in his being free, if he judged itnecessary, to indicate the amounts of mitigatory aid that we had inmind.   It would be important, however, that no indication shouldbe given that we might be prepared to increase these amounts, sincedecisions on the aid that would be appropriate to a more rapidwithdrawal of our forces would need to be worked out and consideredagainst the background of our financial situation generally.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of the PrimeMinister, if he judged it desirable, indicating in his discussions withthe Prime Minister of Singapore and the Deputy Prime Minister of malaysia that we were prepared to offer sums of the order of 25 million and  18 million respectively to their countries as mitigatory aid up to 1970-71. He would arrange for a message to be sent to the Prime Minister to this effect in the light of their discussion.
examined and a further review had been undertaken of thetemporary surcharge on oil prices which had been introduced as aresult of the war in the Middle East. It would be necessary to givethe companies a decision within a month of their notification, inaccordance with the early warning procedures for prices generally;the month would expire on 22nd December. Devaluation would affect the companies differently according to the foreign exchangecontent of their costs. It would not, however, be possible to setdifferent prices for different companies. The average price increase which would be needed to offset the increase in costs due todevaluation worked out at 0-9d. a gallon or about  1 a ton. Anincrease of this amount would mean that many foreign companies would suffer by devaluation, whereas the companies that were mainlyBritish-owned would gain and would have their competitive positionstrengthened. But an increase of  1 a ton would fairly reflect theeffects of devaluation on the companies as a whole.At the same time, however, it was necessary to review the levelof the temporary surcharge which now stood at about  2 a ton.Again, the circumstances of the companies differed Widely, but takingan average of the estimates for the main companies, in his view a lower surcharge of 27s. 6d. a ton would be justified to enable thecompanies to meet up to 31st March, 1968, the additional costsarising from disruption of Middle East supplies: this would be adecrease of 16s. from the present level. However, if a surcharge atthis level was allowed in addition to an increase of  1 a ton because.of devaluation, some increase in oil prices would be necessary. Hehad therefore considered whether a further reduction in the surchargeto  1 a ton could be imposed on the companies without undue risk to oil supplies. This was a matter of judgment, but he had concluded that, given the desirability of avoiding any increase in oil prices abovetheir present levels, we should be justified in taking a calculated riskby insisting on this further reduction. This increase due todevaluation would then be balanced by the reduction in the surchange and maximum prices would thus remain unchanged.As regards the prices of particular oil products, there was thepossibility of securing a small decrease in the price of oil fuel in orderto benefit industry: it would be possible to balance a decrease of1-25d. per gallon on fuel oil by an increase of Id. per gallon onmotor spirit. However, an increase in the price of motor spiritwould be particularly undesirable at the present time from the pointof view of the Governmenfs prices policy and he therefore recommended that product prices should remain unchanged. If theCabinet approved his proposals, it would be desirable to announcethem before Christmas.In discussion it was pointed out that the British petroleum and Shell companies would be able to meet the increased costs dueto devaluation by an increase of no more than 15s. a ton in the priceof oil. These companies together accounted for 45 per cent of our supplies. It was wrong to concede an increase of  1 a ton simplyin order to accommodate the remaining companies. The situation was closely parallel to the recent applications for increases in the
price of newsprint, where the Government had authorised for thewhole industry only the lowest of the various bids for price increasesput forward by individual companies; the same course should befollowed in the present case. While the surcharge was a temporary arrangements, a concession on price to meet the increased costs dueto devaluation would be permanent and could not be rescinded ata later stage. It should not be assumed that the proposals by theMinister of Power were satisfactory simply because they avoided anincrease in oil prices; in view of the widespread increases in pricesgenerally which must be expected following devaluation, it was essential to secure price reductions wherever possible. In any event the Government should insist on some reduction in the price of fuel oil, which was of particular importance in many sectors of industryand in agriculture, and should also require a reduction in the priceof naphtha, balancing these reductions by an increase in the priceof motor spirit. The right course, however, was to refer the matter to the National Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI).On the other hand it was argued that by insisting on a reductionof the surcharge to  1 a ton the Government would be putting themaximum degree of pressure on the oil companies compatible withthe maintenance of our oil supplies; even on this basis, the companies would run down their stocks during the winter so that by March1968 stocks were expected to be some 15 per cent below the normallevel. &quot; While any attempt to secure a reduction in oil prices wouldnot lead to the major companies withdrawing completely from theBritish market, they might well withhold co-operation in building up stocks and divert scarce products to more profitable outlets onthe Continent.  In particular, it would be most imprudent to insist on a decrease in the price of naphtha, of which there was alreadyan acute shortage.   Moreover, if the Government could not immediately reach a settlement with the oil companies, they wouldbe in danger of losing control of the situation: the companies couldnot be prevented from changing prices where the relevant contractscontained devaluation clauses; they would also be free to withdrawrebates incorporated in present contracts as these began to run out from 1st January, 1968.   It was therefore likely that to attempt atthis stage to negotiate a reduction in oil prices with the companies would in practice lead to  an increase in prices  which  theGovernment would be unable to prevent.  There was a widespreadpublic expectation that following devaluation oil prices would increase; if they could be held to their present level, this would bea satisfactory outcome.  It would be inopportune to refer oil prices to the NBPI at present; but the position should be reviewed in the spring.The Foreign Secretary, summing up, said that the Cabinet hadbeen put in some difficulty by being obliged to consider this issue at short notice. With some reluctance, they agreed with the proposals by the Minister of Power that maximum oil prices and the prices ofparticular products should remain unchanged, with an increase of 1 a ton for increased costs following devaluation being offset by
a reduction in the surcharge by the same amount. The cabinet agreed to this course on the understanding that oil prices would be reviewed in the spring with the object of securing the maximum possible reduction, taking full account of the points made in discussion about the size of the allowance for increased costsfollowing devaluation.The Cabinet Agreed, on the understanding referred to by the foreign secretary in his summing up, that maximum oil prices andthe prices of the main oil products should remain unchanged, with a reduction of the surcharge to  1 a tonbalanced by an increase of  1 a ton on account of devaluation.Prices andIncomesPolicyScottishTeachers&apos;Salaries(previous reference:CC (66) 2ndConclusions,Minute 3)confidential . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C (67) 201) on Scottish teachers&apos; salaries.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the salaries of scottish teachers were due to be revised with effect from 1st April,1968. Negotiations with the teachers would begin in January. in response to the teachers&apos; claim for an average increase of more than20 per cent over a two-year period, he wished to offer an increase of ^-8 per cent and to introduce in addition a scheme of inducementpayments for understaffed areas, on lines already approved by theCabinet, at a cost of about 0 - 75 per cent of the total salary bill. Thiswould give an extra  100 per annum to the teachers in these areaswho would number some 4,000 or one-tenth of the total number of scottish teachers. These proposals had been discussed the previous day by the Ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes which had decided, himself dissenting, that the maximum offer should be a7 per cent average increase inclusive of the cost of the scheme forinducement payments. In his view .,such an offer would beimpossible to justify and would inevitably have a most adverse effecton the Scottish teachers and on Scottish opinion generally.The shortage of teachers was worse in Scotland than inEngland and Wales and the scheme for inducement payments was intended to meet this problem in areas such as Glasgow andRenfrewshire where the position was particularly bad. There was no justification for financing these payments at the expense of scottish teachers outside these areas. Many Scottish teachers were paid onScale 7 which ran from only  680 to  1,340 a year and was  120lower at the starting point than the equivalent scale in England andWales. The Scottish Scale 7 needed to be substantially improved and there could be no question of asking teachers on such low rates to contribute to the cost of the inducement scheme. It was most unlikely that it would even be possible to persuade the employers to make an offer on the basis proposed by the Ministerial Committeeon Prices and Incomes. If it would enable agreement to be reachedhe would be prepared to agree to an offer of only 7 per cent exclusive
of the inducement scheme payments. This could perhaps be defended as being the same as the increase which English and Welshteachers had received at arbitration earlier this year provided that theinducement scheme payments were additional. Anything less than this would make his position untenable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that an offer of more than per cent inclusive of the inducement scheme payments could notbe justified. This would give the same percentage increase as theEnglish and Welsh teachers had received in July 1967. It was truethat the salary structures in Scotland differed from those in Englandand Wales and there were no doubt anomalies between them whichmight with advantage be looked at by the National Board for prices and Incomes at a later stage; but these anomalies did not justify apay increase higher than 7 per cent. The Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes had discussed a possible alternative offer of a4 per cent pay increase over one year only. This would have theadvantage of bringing the salary negotiations of the two countriesinto phase in April 1969. However, the Secretary of State forScotland had not thought that this would be an acceptable alternative.In discussion there was a wide measure of support for theconclusions reached by the Ministerial Committee on Prices and incomes. It was suggested, however, that Scottish interests had recently suffered some setbacks, for example over decisions of regional policy, and that there was some substance in the belief thatthe Government^ incomes policy had on occasion operated in a way which seemed to discriminate against Scotland. These considerationsmight be held to justify some concession to Scottish opinion in this case. It was also pointed out that if the claim went to arbitration,the award might exceed the offer favoured by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland. In that event, however, it might be necessary for theSecretary of State for Scotland to refuse to approve it. Since a reference to arbitration appeared probable it would be advisable tomake an open offer below the agreed maximum offer in order notto inflate the lower limit of any arbitration award.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that a decisive majority agreed with the conclusions reached by the ministerial Committee on Prices and Incomes on the pay of scottish teachers.The Cabinet Endorsed the decision of the Ministerial Committee on prices and Incomes that Scottish teachers should be offered a pay increase of 7 per cent over a two-year period from 1st April, 1968, inclusive of payments under the proposedinducement scheme.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd December, 1967.
