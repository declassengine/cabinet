secret. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that theForeign Secretary had had a very lengthy meeting on 16th April withthe United Nations Mission to South Arabia. He had succeeded,though with great difficulty, in reaching agreement with them on ajoint statement about the current situation in South Arabia and abouthow the United Nations might still help in finding a solution to theproblems there. The Mission still adhered rigidly to their own viewof their terms of reference and seemed quite unsuitable for their task.They were returning to New York that day and could be expectedto make a critical report to the United Nations on the situation inSouth Arabia; they were not expected to go back to Aden. TheMinister without Portfolio (Lord Shackleton), who was in Aden, was still endeavouring to arrange a meeting with the nationalist leadersAl Asnag and Mackawi but so far without success.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, until theSpanish Government had tabled with the International Civil AviationOrganisation (ICAO) their precise proposals for the area nearGibraltar in which they had announced their intention of prohibitingaircraft from flying, the effects of such a ban would not be clear.It was important to know how far the area extended over sea as wellas over the land. It appeared that we were likely to be in a strong position to resist the proposed ban in ICAO. There was no immediate prospect of resuming talks with Spain: these had not formally been cancelled but only postponed.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the recent attemptedcoup against the National Liberation Council in Ghana had failedand the situation in Accra was now quiet. The cause of the attemptappeared to be purely internal dissension not related to the previousregime. It appeared that only a small element of the Ghanaianforces had been affected and that the attempt would probably nothave taken place but for the preoccupation of the National LiberationCouncil with the possibility of an attempt on the part of the formerPresident, Dr. Nkrumah, to return to power.The Commonwealth Secretary referred to a virulent attack on theUnited Kingdom in a recent public speech by Mr. Simbule, the zambian High Commissioner Designate in London. Although hehad agreed some weeks ago to the appointment of Mr. Simbule itwould now be necessary to reconsider this, even though to refuse toaccept Mr. Simbule might lead to a break in our relations withZambia.In discussion there was agreement that the Government couldnot appear to ignore this attack and should be seen to react strongly to it.
The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary^ statements.DispersalPolicyLocation ofDecimalFactory andNew RoyalMintSECRET2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (67) 51) on the location of a decimal factory and the re-location onthe same site of the Royal Mint.The First Secretary of State said that it had been agreed thata temporary factory to produce decimal coinage should be sited ina development area and that the Mint itself should subsequently move to the same location. The choice of site had been narrowed downto Llantrisant in Wales, Cumbernauld in Scotland and washington in the Northern development area. When this question had beendiscussed by the Ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning,it had been recognised that a strong case could be made on employment grounds for each of the three areas, and the Committeehad taken the view that in these circumstances the deciding factorshould be the views of the management of the Mint. The managementconsidered that resistance to dispersal on the part of their employeescould jeopardise the successful completion of decimalisation of thecoinage and might injure the valuable export trade of the Mint; andthat the choice of Llantrisant would minimise these risks. the ministerial Committee had accordingly agreed on balance, with theSecretary of State for Scotland dissenting, that the choice should fall on Llantrisant.The Committee had taken into account two other major dispersalprojects which were relevant; it had recently been decided that theMinistry of Transport vehicle and driver licensing and test-bookingcentre should be established at Swansea; and it was likely that certainMinistry of Defence supply and production staffs, in respect of whom a decision would shortly be needed, would be dispersed to SouthWales. It had been argued in the Committee that, if the Mint were also to be moved to Wales, Wales would be getting a disproportionateshare of dispersal projects. If the whole period since 1963 were takeninto account, the number of jobs created under the dispersal policyin Wales, with a population of 2,700,000, was nearly 9,000, includingthe Ministry of Transport centre; the corresponding figure forScotland, with a population of 5,200,000, was 6,560; and for theNorthern development area, with a population of 3,300,000, 3,900.This meant that Wales had fared best over the period, while theNorthern development area had fared worst. But it would be unwise to allow the principle of seeking to share such projects fairly between different regions to determine decisions on dispersal. There were many other factors to be taken into account, notably the effects ofthe choice of a particular site on the operational efficiency of theorganisation concerned. The Ministerial Committee in consideringdispersal questions should have available information on the effects of the policy on the different regions since its inception and this wasbeing arranged; but if the need to share projects between different
areas were allowed to become the overriding factor, the policy wouldbe brought into disrepute.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that dispersal policyunder the present Government, leaving out of account cases wherethere was no alternative to dispersal to Scotland, had resulted in thecreation of only 65 additional jobs in Scotland. Unemployment inScotland had over a long period been heavier than in any other partof Great Britain, even though the true position had been masked bya heavy rate of migration to the rest of the country. The presentnumber of unemployed in Scotland was double that in Wales andwas increasing against the seasonal trend. There was a prospect ofunemployment exceeding 5 per cent during the next winter. Theunemployment problem in the Rhondda Valley, which was relevant to the Llantrisant site, had arisen only relatively recently throughpit closures and there were many places in Scotland where a comparable level of unemployment had persisted for longer periods.The reduction in employment in coalmining had been more severein Scotland than in Wales and the prospective reduction over thenext two years was 7,000 as compared with 4,000 for Wales. Thenumber of vacancies in coalmining, to which redundant minersmight move, was much greater in Wales than in Scotland. TheGovernment^ policy for distribution of industry had also been less effective in Scotland, where 8 - 2 million square feet of factory space,providing 20,000 jobs, had been created in 1966, compared with9 - 2 million square feet providing 22,800 jobs in Wales. The choice oflocation for the Mint should not be allowed to turn on the preference of its present employees; when their representatives had visitedCumbernauld, they had had no contact with the New TownCorporation or with his Department and had therefore been in noposition to take account of future provision of amenities such ashousing, medical services and schools. It would not be practicable for the Ministry of Defence production and supply staffs to be moved to Scotland and it would be indefensible to Scottish opinion if theMint, in addition to the other two major dispersal projects, were tomove to Wales.  The Cumbernauld site should therefore be chosen.The Minister of Housing and Local Government urged theclaims of Washington. If the Mint, in addition to the other two major dispersal projects, were to go to Wales, the result would bethat the number of jobs created there under the dispersal policy wouldbe twice as great as the number created in the Northern development area. There was a high level of unemployment in the Washingtonarea and with the decline in basic industries such as coalmining and shipbuilding this was likely to continue. A suitable factory was already available on the Washington site and communications to thearea were excellent. There would also be the advantage ofco-operation with the New Town Corporation, which was one ofthe most efficient in the country.The Secretary of State for Wales said that, while he accepted that the other areas had difficult unemployment problems,unemployment in the Rhondda Valley, which was within commuting
distance of Llantrisant, presented the most intractable problem inthe United Kingdom. Male unemployment was now over 10 per cent and two pits employing 16 per cent of the male population were dueto close by 1970. If nothing were done to alleviate the situation,unemployment in the area might well reach 15 per cent by that time,despite a continuing high rate of migration. Because of the characteristics of the area it was difficult to attract new industry toit. It had been agreed by Departments that in Wales as a whole the male working population would be some 675,000 by 1970, whileopportunities of employment would be only 640,000-650,000. Theindustrial area of South Wales accounted for some 80 per cent ofthe total working population and might therefore have a shortageof some 20,000 jobs by 1970, implying unemployment of over 5 percent. The benefit to Wales of the establishment in Swansea of theMinistry of Transport centre should not be over-estimated since thecentre would employ mainly women whereas the need was for employment for men. It was misleading to consider dispersal policyin isolation from other forms of assistance to the regions, and onthis broader basis it could not be said that Wales had received a disproportionate share of help. The total of loans and grants underthe Local Employment Acts for the five years to 1966 was only 3 - 7 million for Wales as compared with  30 million for England and 44 million for Scotland. The previous Administration hadconcentrated their efforts on assistance to the North of England and scotland, while most of Wales had been removed from the schedule of development areas; this policy had not been reversed until 1964-65.The present and prospective level of unemployment was so serious that some major measure of assistance, which would constitute an act of faith in the industrial future of Wales, was now needed; tomove the Mint to Wales would fulfil this need and the decision of the ministerial Committee in favour of Llantrisant should therefore be endorsed.In discussion, there was some support for the view that if theMint were to be moved to Llantrisant then, taking account of other decisions on dispersal, this would mean that Wales was receiving anunjustifiable degree of preference,, over other areas. Theunemployment problem in Scotland was likely to be more acute thanin Wales both in the immediate future and in the long term, and was far greater in terms of absolute numbers than in any other area. Onthe other hand, if the decision were to turn on ensuring a fair sharebetween the regions of employment opportunities created bydispersals, this would point to the choice of Washington. Althoughthe preference of the Mint employees was for Llantrisant, this shouldnot be allowed to decide the issue: it would be impossible to maintain a rational dispersal policy if staff preferences were given such priorityand it was relevant that the move of the Post Office Savings Bankto Glasgow, which was the major example of dispersal to Scotland,was effected against the opposition of the staff.It was argued on the other hand that it was wrong to considerthe dispersal of the Mint and the other two major dispersals togetheryet in isolation from other measures to stimulate employment in development areas, simply because they happened to coincide in time.
The distribution of dispersals between the different regions even overa longer period was only one of the factors which should be takeninto account. In particular, considerable weight should be given tothe views of the management concerned. This would accord withthe Government^ policy towards private industry where the choice of location was normally left to the management concerned, provided they were prepared to move to a development area. The views of themanagement were particularly important in the case of the Mintsince the success of the decimalisation programme was dependent onthe willingness of a substantial proportion of the present employees to transfer to the new location. These employees, even where theywere established civil servants, did not in practice accept the sameliability to move to different areas as the Civil Service generally.If a location other than Llantrisant were chosen, there was a serious danger that resistance on the part of Mint employees would inpractice make it impossible to implement the decision.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) The representatives of the Mint employees who had visited the possible sites had insisted on making their own arrangements forthe visits. Any attempt to stipulate that they should meet the localauthorities in the course of these visits would have been likely onlyto increase resistance to any dispersal at all. On the other hand, itwas difficult to see how the visiting parties could properly assessconditions in the different areas without being informed by the localauthorities about future plans for provision of the main amenities.(b) It was too late to reverse the decision to establish theMinistry of Transport licensing and test-booking centre at Swansea.(c) It would not be justifiable to move the Ministry of defence production and supply staffs to a location in Scotland. These staffsneeded constant access to defence establishments in the South and west of England and to the staff already dispersed to Bath; to transferthem to Scotland would involve unacceptable expense and wouldrisk the danger of a breakdown in operational efficiency.(d) In the administration of dispersal policy generally, it was essential that decisions on major projects should not be prejudiced by commitments to particular sites or by undertakings to the partiesaffected or even by discussion with them before the issues were considered by Ministers.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet on balance endorsed the decision in favour of Llantrisant.The Secretary of State for Scotland had, however, made a strong case for further Government action to reduce unemployment in Scotland;indeed, the Cabinefs discussion had emphasised the need for similar action in all development areas. A reduction of the disparity inlevels of unemployment as between these areas and the rest of thecountry would permit a faster rate of growth in the economy as awhole without the recurrence of balance of payments difficulties andsuch a reduction was therefore an essential part of our wholeeconomic strategy.  The scheme for special employment premiums
under the Selective Employment Tax, on which the Government had recently published proposals, could make a major contribution to thisend and the Cabinet would have an opportunity to discuss theseproposals in the light of the public reaction to them soon after the whitsun Recess. But that scheme would assist employment in thedevelopment areas as a whole; further measures should be considered to deal with the problems of particular districts within thedevelopment areas where unemployment was especially severe andemployment unresponsive to more general measures of assistance.The Ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning shouldcommission a study which would identify the districts where suchproblems now existed or were likely to arise within the next two orthree years and should formulate proposals for action. Among other measures, the Committee should consider how far the provision ofmore and possibly bigger advance factories could meet the need;also whether a contribution could be made by the suitable location of new industrial projects directed to the saving of imports and basedon nuclear or other forms of cheap power. In formulating their proposals the Committee should give the fullest consideration to theneeds of districts with particularly high unemployment in Scotland.The Cabinet -(1) Agreed that the site for a decimal factory and for the subsequent re-location of the Royal Mint should be atLlantrisant.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State to arrange for the ministerial Committee on Environmental Planning toconsider further measures to assist districts in thedevelopment areas with particularly serious unemploy-ment problems, on the lines indicated by the PrimeMinister in his summing up of their discussion.Approach to europe(previous reference:CC (67) 20thConclusions,Minute 2)SECRET(i) A possible White papers. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 55) to which was attached a memorandum by officials on the possibility of issuing a White Paper on the Approach to europe.The Prime Minister said the Government were now committed to publishing the speech made by the Foreign Secretary to theParliamentary Labour Party on 6th April and his own forthcomingspeech to the Party on 25th April. It was for consideration whether these speeches should be supplemented by a summary of thenon-confidential information which they had obtained during their recent European tour and whether the resulting document should beissued as a White Paper or in some other form. Whether it wasdecided that the speeches in question should be published as a white paper or otherwise, the Cabinet might take the view that there would
- 9CC 21 (67)be little advantage in publishing in addition the non-confidential information resulting from the tour, since this was already fullysummarised in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s speech. In the light of thedecision on this aspect the Cabinet would also wish to considerwhether there should later be a further White Paper containing thestatement the Government would make to Parliament about their decision on the approach to Europe and whether this should befollowed by the publication of the draft booklet which had beenprepared by the Central Office of Information (COI) describing the institutions and policies of the European Economic Community(e.c.) and the corresponding United Kingdom arrangements and policies.In discussion it proved to be the general view that there wereconstitutional and political objections of principle to publishing asa White Paper speeches made in the first instance to a parliamentaryparty: it would therefore be preferable for these speeches to be madeavailable to Parliament as a whole by other means. There was some support for the view that, when the Government had takentheir decision on whether or not to seek membership of the e.c., itwould be desirable to publish simultaneously with the statement inParliament on that decision, or very shortly thereafter, a White paper which might consist of a brief reiteration of the decision and of thereasons for it, together with a number of more detailed appendiceson various aspects of the problem. There might for example be an appendix on the Common Agricultural Policy (c.a.p.) based on thememorandum prepared by the Ministry of Agriculture for submission to the Select Committee on Agriculture. Having regard to the repercussions of any documents on this issue which were published by the Government in the near future, it would be preferable that anypapers submitted in future to the Select Committee should first beconsidered by the Cabinet. It was also the general view that, if in theevent it were decided to publish a White Paper, there would also be advantage in publishing the COI booklet.The Cabinet -(1) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation with theLord President of the Council, would arrange for the speech by the Foreign Secretary to the parliamentary labour Party on 6th April and for his own speech to that body on 25th April to be published, though not as a white Paper, and to be made available to Members ofParliament.(2) Agreed to give further consideration to the issue of a white paper simultaneously with or very shortly after thestatement of the Governments decision on the approach to Europe.(3) Agreed that no further papers relating to the approach to europe should be presented to Select Committees of theHouse of Commons until they had been considered indraft by the Cabinet.
(4) Agreed that, in the event of the publication of a white paper in the light of Conclusion (2), the booklet by theCentral Office of Information should be publishedsimultaneously.(ii) Consultations with the European Free Trade Association, theCommonwealth and the Irish republic the Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 54) to which was attached a memorandum by officials on consultations with the European Free Trade Association (EFTA).the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic.The Prime Minister recalled that at the recent meeting of the ministerial Council of EFTA at Stockholm the Government had accepted a commitment to discuss their approach to Europe with theother members of EFTA after the discussions by the foreign secretary and himself in the capitals of the e.c. and before any final conclusions were drawn from them. There were three possible ways of carrying out this commitment to consult EFTA. The first,a meeting at which we indicated the line the Government expectedto take before the Cabinet had taken a decision was clearlyimpracticable since no such indication could be given before thedecision had in fact been taken; and anything said at such a meeting would be bound to become known. Secondly, a meeting could beheld at which EFTA could be consulted on a purely hypotheticalbasis and thereafter, when the Cabinet had taken their decision inthe light of the views expressed by the other EFTA Governments atthis meeting, those Governments could be informed of it immediately before it was announced. This however would merely be to repeatwhat had happened at the meeting of EFTA held in Lisbon at theend of the previous year and our EFTA colleagues would find It most unsatisfactory. Furthermore, the news of the arrangements forsuch a meeting would be taken publicly as implying a decision by theGovernment to apply for membership of the e.c. and might be seized upon by the French or by the Community as an excuse to reconsider or withdraw offers already made in the Kennedy round of tariff negotiations. The third course would be to approach otherEFTA Governments now through diplomatic channels, say that were recognised our obligation under the Stockholm communique to holda further Ministerial meeting with them before we came to a finaldecision, but point out that any conceivable way of meeting this obligation had grave disadvantages for all members of EFTA, forthe reasons that he had indicated in describing the other two courses.If nevertheless all other EFTA Governments urged us to meet our undertaking by holding a conference for consultation on ahypothetical basis, we would endeavour to do so; but we consideredthat it would be preferable for the main consultation to be carriedout in the first instance through bilateral contacts and possibly at alater stage at one of the regular meetings of the EFTA Council. Wewould then hope, if our decision were to apply for membership ofthe Community, that there would be a Ministerial meeting of theEFTA Council to consider the situation and consult together shortly after the Governmenfs decision had been taken.
Commonwealth interests lay more in the terms that we should seek if we applied for membership than in the question of our application as such. We were committed to a continuing process of consultation, but there was no need to assemble representatives ofall Commonwealth Governments at the same time either before or after our decision was taken or announced. There would beopportunities for consulting some Commonwealth Governments, inthe course of Ministerial discussions which were due to take placeshortly in any event and discussion with other commonwealth governments could best be initiated by a telegram at the same time as the proposed telegram was sent to other member Governments of efta. This telegram might say that a decision was expected shortlyand that in reaching it the Government would wish to take fully into account any general considerations which commonwealth governments wished to put forward at this stage on the hypothesis that we were considering applying to enter the Community, subjectto safeguards on essential Commonwealth interests. The government wished to allow adequate time for full consultation with commonwealth Governments and if their decision were to prove tobe in favour of applying to enter the Community there would be full opportunities for such consultations during the coming months.As far as the Irish Republic was concerned, a meeting with theTaoiseach should if possible be held before the Cabinet reached their decision.In discussion there was general agreement with these proposals.It was recognised that, if in the light of these consultations the othermembers of EFTA were to press for a meeting of EFTA ministers to be consulted on a purely hypothetical basis about our approach to Europe, it would be politic to accede to their request. Thefollowing points were also made:(a) It might prove advantageous for the Minister of State forForeign Affairs (Mr. Mulley) to pay a visit to some or all of thecapitals of the other members of EFTA in order to supplement the consultation initiated through diplomatic channels.(b) In addition to the Ministerial discussion with certainCommonwealth Governments which would in any event take placeon the basis of meetings which had already been arranged for other purposes, consideration should be given to the desirability of a ministerial visit to some other Commonwealth countries, includingTrinidad.(c) It appeared probable that the conclusive stages of the kennedy Round would now be further delayed and would not bereached until about the end of the second week of May. It would benecessary to consider later the relevance of this to the timing of the government&apos;s decision on whether or not to make an application tojoin the e.c.. It was the general view that there was strong objectionto an announcement of the Governmenfs decision before the decisivestage of the tariff negotiations had been concluded, since we might otherwise be blamed, however unfairly, if those negotiations were notsuccessful.
The Cabinet (5) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Mulley)to consider in the light of the discussion the desirabilityof visiting the capitals of some or all of the other membersof EFTA for consultations in respect of the Governmentsconsideration of their approach to Europe.(6) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to consider in the lightof the discussion the desirability of a Ministerial visit tosome members of the Commonwealth other than those whose Ministers would in any event be consulted in thecourse of the immediately forthcoming meetings.(7) Subject to Conclusions (5) and (6), approved the proposals put forward in the memorandum by officials attached toC (67) 54 on the manner in which consultations withEFTA, the Commonwealth and the Irish Republic shouldbe carried out.(iii) Legal and constitutional  implications of: United kingdom membership of the European CommunitiesThe Cabinet resumed their discussion of the legal and constitutional implications of our membership of the e.c..The Lord Chancellor said that the report by officials which hadbeen before the Cabinet on the occasion of their previous discussion(E (66) 7) had brought up to date the wide-ranging report which hadbeen carried out under the auspices of the previous administration in 1962, in which the Government had been advised by eminentlawyers both inside and outside the public service. It had not beenopen to officials on this occasion to take the opinion of judges,lawyers or organisations outside Government circles and in thesecircumstances it was particularly desirable that the Law officers should now themselves undertake a review of the report.The Cabinet (8) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for the Law officers to consider and report on the report by officials attachedto E (66) 7.(iv) Agriculture and the Common MarketThe Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C (67) 44) to which was attached a report by officials on the common agricultural policy (c.a.p.) of the e.c. and on the possibilities ofeasing the difficulties we should encounter if we were to accept it.The Minister of Agriculture said that the memorandum provided in Part I the factual material necessary for a judgment of our attitude to the c.a.p. and in Part II proposals for easement of the difficultieswhich acceptance of it would cause us. The basis of the c.a.p. wasthat the farmer sold his produce for what he could get on a market which was regulated at the consumers&apos; expense by means varying from commodity to commodity, including levies on imports, subsidies
CC 21 (67)on exports, and intervention by support buying or storagearrangements. The system discriminated in favour of cereals and against livestock products in two ways. The prices for cereals were too high both absolutely and relatively to those of livestock products;and the arrangements for regulation of the markets for livestock products were less comprehensive, e.g., for pigs, eggs and poultrythere were no intervention arrangements to provide a minimummarket price, so that no real security of return was afforded to the producer. The c.a.p. was therefore radically different from our ownsystem, in which the farmer sold his produce for the best price hecould get on a relatively free market and in addition receiveddeficiency payments and direct grants at the expense of the taxpayer.Our system of import restraints also gave overseas suppliers a greaterdegree of assurance of a market in the United Kingdom than did theCommunity system of variable levies on imports. Consequently, ifwe were to accept the c.a.p., our own system and the 1947 and 1957Agriculture Acts, under which it had been developed, would have tobe abandoned. The results for British agriculture would be to distortthe pattern of production and to reduce farmers&apos; security, so thatthe industry would be less soundly based and less well-balanced.There would also be important consequences for commonwealth trade, which were set out in the memorandum.It would not be right to assume, as had been suggested, that theconsequences for us of accepting the c.a.p. might be mitigated becauseworld prices over the coming years might be expected to riseto the level of those of the e.c.. There was no sound basis for suchan assumption, and no guarantee if it were in fact realised that the six would not in consequence raise their prices. Moreover a 10 percent increase in world prices would save the United Kingdom only 50 million of the much greater additional cost to our balance ofpayments involved in accepting the c.a.p. Further, the forecastswhich had been made of the effect of the c.a.p. on our cost of livingdid not take account of likely increases in margins of profit in manufacturing and sales, and to that extent were under-estimates;nor was it safe to assume that there would be any&apos;significant savings in total to the Exchequer as a result of the abandonment of our ownsystem and reliance could not therefore be placed on suggestions that these might be used to mitigate the effects on our cost of living.It would therefore be against our interest to accept the c.a.p. atall, unless in other fields compelling reasons for doing so were established. Even so, serious damage to our agricultural industryand heavy burdens for our balance of payments would be involved.The second part of the memorandum therefore, whilst recognising that it was not possible radically to alter the c.a.p., set out certaineasements in his view the minimum of easements which wouldhave to be secured before we could accept the c.a.p. First, it wouldbe essential to secure a long transitional period. The Six hadeffectively had some seven years to make ready for the full impact of the c.a.p. and we should accept no less: we should therefore start by asking for 10 years as the term necessary for us to complete the
adjustment of our agricultural industry, of the cost of living and ofthe balance of payments to the new circumstances set by the c.a.p.It would not be sufficient to link the transitional period for agriculture with similar transitional periods in respect of industrialtariffs or other Community regulations: agriculture should be treatedas a special case. Second, it would be necessary to secure special arrangements in respect of certain major commodities. The wholeEEC system for milk was quite different from our own, being basedupon the sale of manufacturing milk for milk products, instead of sales of liquid milk as our system was. Adoption of their system would alter the seasonal balance of our production and lead toshortages of liquid milk during the winter. Both for that reasonand because of the higher costs of food resulting from Communitycereal prices, the profitability of our whole industry over the year asa whole would be reduced. Moreover it was doubtful whether underCommunity regulations regarding monopolies the Milk MarketingBoard would be able to carry on its activities and, since dairying was so large a part of our agricultural industry, this would accentuate the regional imbalance implicit in the Community&apos;s excessively highcereals prices. Similarly if we were to accept the Community regimefor sugar it would be necessary to re-negotiate our own arrangementsfor both Commonwealth and United Kingdom producers, takingaccountwnter alia of the effect of the higher Community prices on production in our own sugar beet industry. For pigs, our minimum requirements, but no more, might be met if the Community were tointroduce the market intervention arrangements they were nowdiscussing. For these and other reasons it would be necessary for usto use any transitional period to replan and refinance agriculturalenterprises in the areas most affected by our acceptance of the cap.In certain areas, particularly in Scotland and Wales, and parts ofEngland, where small milk producers would be adversely affected,these adjustments would present great difficulty; and it was essentialthat the cost of projects for achieving them should be met from theCommunity&apos;s Guidance and Guarantee Fund or, if not, from theExchequer. Similarly the burden which the c.a.p. would impose onour balance of payments would make it imperative that we should negotiate some relief, whether in the form of smaller levycontributions, finance for adjustment and production grants from central agricultural funds, or by some other means. Finally, it wouldbe essential for us to negotiate arrangements for the Community tohold a full Annual Review of agricultural policy as we did. Theirpresent procedure provided for little more than an annual collectionof information and did not provide for the planned development ofthe industry. The c.a.p. must therefore be regarded as inferior toour own system and acceptance of it as preventing the fullachievement of the agricultural objectives of our National Plan.The Prime Minister said that the memorandum seemed to envisage that our acceptance of the c.a.p. might be conditional upontransitional arrangements only. He recalled that, when the cabinet had discussed the basis for the recent visits to the Heads ofGovernment of the e.c., the Foreign Secretary had specificallyprovided that we should reserve our freedom to seek adjustments in
SECRET -   15   150CC 21 (67)the field of agriculture going beyond transitional arrangements,particularly with respect to the payment of import levies across theexchanges. During these visits there had been support from membersof the e.c. for our view that the impact of their present levyarrangements on the United Kingdom would be inequitable. in discussions on this point it had been brought out that, if we entered the e.c. under their present agricultural arrangements, our levycontributions might double the income of their agricultural funds,even if we made no budgetary contribution; and this opened up the &quot;&apos;&apos;possibility that the contributions of all countries should be scaleddown and the burden on our balance of payments reducedaccordingly. It had also been accepted that it would be wrong forus to pay into the funds as much as the Six countries put together;and there was a precedent, in the form of the ceiling fixed for Germancontributions, for us to argue either for reduction in some paymentsor for a ceiling to be set to them. A further alternative suggestion was made in the memorandum that the Community agricultural fundmight in suitable cases provide finance for our production grants andso reduce the burden on our balance of payments. We should therefore ask for a reduction in the burden which the c.a.p. would impose on our balance of payments by some combination of these methods: and we should not accept suggestions from the Six thatwe should await the outcome of the review of their agriculturalfinancing arrangements in 1969-70, unless it were clear that in thatreview we should be in a position effectively to defend our interests.The memorandum comparing the position of the United kingdom with that of the countries of the e.c. as importers of cereals(C (67) 49) lent force to the arguments for some easement of thepresent c.a.p. arrangements in this respect. The comparison showed that the Community were, proportionately speaking, importers ofcereals from third countries to almost the same extent as we wereand as such it should be to their interest to modify their policy oncereals, which was also bound to have adverse effects on livestockproducers in all countries it might affect.In discussion the following main points were made:(d) It would be unrealistic to think that the French would agreethat we should enter the Community without prior agreement on thearrangements for financing the common agricultural policy after1970. Indeed the French were likely to use the difficulties these arrangements caused us as a means for delaying and extending any negotiations for entry of the United Kingdom.(e) If the Milk Marketing Board and its operations were declared by the Community to be inconsistent with their policies, the result would be a serious disruption of British agriculture. The distributiveoperations of the Milk Marketing Board, and its importance toBritish agriculture as the only provider of a regular monthly income to many farmers were such that the structure of much of ouragriculture outside East Anglia was dependent on the continuedfunctioning of the Board. It was further urged that any suspension of the Board&apos;s operation would have serious consequences for the
consumer in leading to shortages of winter milk in the UnitedKingdom. On the other hand it was urged that it would hardly beto the interest of the Six to insist upon a reversal of our milk marketingsystem which would lead it to concentrate upon milk for manufactureinstead of milk for liquid consumption. It was to their advantage to sell us as much as possible of the milk products upon which theirown production was concentrated; and they would clearly be better able to do this if we continued to produce for liquid consumption and so leave the bulk of our manufacturing market open to themand to New Zealand under the special arrangements they seemwilling to negotiate for that country. Similar considerations applied in the case of mutton and lamb, which did not constitute a significantitem in the continental diet.(/) It was important to see the agricultural issues in their properperspective as only one part, albeit an important one, of the questionof United Kingdom membership of the common market, bearing that mind the number employed in agriculture relative to otherindustries and occupations. The most serious of the difficulties withwhich the c.a.p. presented us was its impact on the balance ofpayments and the assumptions of constant world prices which hadbeen made on this head were not justified on a long-term view.Recent years had seen a formidable increase in Russian and Chinesedemands for grain and in addition the demand of a rapidly risingworld population had to be taken into account. Moreover from recent trends it seemed likely that in the long run commonwealth countries other than New Zealand would so far as necessary be readily able to find other markets for their products. If world food prices were to rise and if this in turn led to a rise in Communityprices, the effect of this would be to bring into production additional land which under present circumstances was only marginallyeconomic and so to increase supplies and also to improve the relativeprofitability and competitiveness of British and European agriculture.(g) It would be wrong to overlook the fact that the c.a.p. was still in its infancy, and that adjustments in it were inevitable. It wasinconceivable that it would not be modified if new members wereadmitted of the agricultural importance of the United Kingdom and denmark. During the European visits the Six had not sought todefend the whole of the present c.a.p., though all of them had saidthat, now that it had been agreed, it would be impossible to changeit fundamentally. Some countries had said that we could only hope to secure transitional arrangements but others had appearedresponsive to our suggestions that more far-reaching adjustments,particularly in respect of the size of our levy contributions, might benegotiable. Even so, it would be realistic to assume that the french would wish to settle the agricultural financing arrangements for1969-70 before agreeing to British entry: the other members of the six knew this and would be influenced by it.The Cabinet (9) Agreed that in any negotiations for entry to the e.c. it wouldbe necessary for us to seek adjustments to the c.a.p. otherthan transitional periods, notably with a view to lightening
secret. The Cabinet considered a note by the President of the Boardof Trade (C (67) 53) to which was attached a report on the progressof negotiations in the Kennedy Round by Sir Richard Powell, thePermanent Secretary, Board of Trade, and the senior UnitedKingdom representative in the negotiations.The President of the Board of Trade said that the report annexed to his Note set out the probable timing of the final phase of thenegotiations and the position in the main sectors. It was now expected that negotiations would be concluded in substance duringthe following two weeks. The Cabinet had already considered the implications of this for the timing of decisions on possible entry intothe European Economic Community (e.c.) in their discussion of theprevious item. In the concluding stages of the negotiations, our objectshould be to safeguard our national interests to the maximum extent possible, without-carrying this to the point where we could reasonably be accused of wrecking the negotiations as a whole.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The report indicated that we were likely to maintain our offer of reductions in tariffs on man-made fibres even though theUnited States and the e.c. would probably reduce their offers on those products. A small reduction in our present high tariffs wouldprobably be justified if it ensured reductions by the United States andthe e.c. in their tariffs on cotton. It would, however, be important to ensure that the interests of the United Kingdom textile industry were adequately safeguarded. -(b) In the negotiations for a cereals agreement, we were likely tohave to accept a self-sufficiency ratio below the 75 per cent which wehad originally proposed. It would, however, be important to secureas high a ratio as possible, even if this meant accepting that theagreement would run for a longer period of years than we would otherwise wish.(c) Ministers would shortly be considering a proposal that weshould offer to liberalise our quotas for imports of some citrus fruitsfrom the dollar area in order to strengthen our position in negotiationsfor the removal of certain United States non-tariff barriers. It wouldbe necessary to consider carefully the effects of such an offer on the economy of the West Indies.(d) Australia and Canada had made offers to the United Statesand Japan which involved the reduction of our trade preferences intheir markets. In some cases we had contractual rights to thesepreferences, but it would be difficult for us to raise objection on thatthe burden of the c.a.p. on our balance of payments onthe lines indicated by the Prime Minister during their discussion.(10) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.
particular ground (though we should seek to secure adequatecompensation for them) since we ourselves were proposing to makeoffers which would similarly infringe contractual rights, subject to obtaining the consent of the countries concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that sir Richard Powell was to be congratulated on the clarity of thereport on these complex negotiations. Our initial offers in the kennedy Round had been generous in comparison with those of our major negotiating partners and we were therefore entitled to take a firm line in defence of our national interests in the remaining stages of the negotiations.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of C (67) 53.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,18th April, 1967.
