Rhodesia(previous reference :CC (67) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)CC 60 (67)secret. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C (67) 162) covering a memorandum by the Secretaries of State forForeign and Commonwealth Affairs on Rhodesia to which was attached a note by officials.The Commonwealth Secretary said that, in preparation for his forthcoming visits to African Commonwealth countries and to rhodesia, the Defence and Oversea Policy Committee had in theprevious week considered a report in which, on instructions fromthe Foreign Secretary and himself, officials had undertaken an appraisal of our present policies towards Rhodesia and of allconceivable alternatives.The prospect was a sombre one with little room for manoeuvre.Economic sanctions had not so far brought about the politicalchanges in Rhodesia at which they were aimed, and with SouthAfrica supporting the Rhodesian economy there was no immediate prospect that they would do so even if, as was not the case atpresent, economic sanctions were fully enforced by member countries of the United Nations. We had ruled out the use of force againstthe illegal regime, and the practical and political arguments for thisdecision were if anything growing stronger; equally we could not afford to become involved in a confrontation with South Africa. Atthe other extreme we could not contemplate a settlement of the rhodesian problem on any terms that currently seemed likely to be acceptable to the illegal regime, since this would mean going backon our declared principles and breaking public pledges. there seemed therefore to be no acceptable alternative to continuing withour present policies for Rhodesia while seeking to make existingeconomic sanctions more effective. In this connection various possibilities had been considered, including ways of enlisting the help of Commonwealth countries, of stopping gaps in existingsanctions, especially as regards oil, and of stepping up psychologicalpressure on the regime by, for example, forbidding the export of television material to Rhodesia. On his visit to Africa his object would be to convince both African Commonwealth countries andthe Rhodesian illegal regime that, while we were ready to reach ajust and honourable settlement, we stood firmly by our principles and were prepared, if necessary, to face a long haul. He would try to persuade Commonwealth countries that they could best help the policy of sanctions by bringing pressure to bear not on us but,in conjunction with us, on third countries. In Rhodesia he wouldaim to fortify the Governor^ resolution and to ensure that, if therewere no progress towards a settlement as a result of his visit, the blame was seen to be Mr, Smith&apos;s and not ours.In discussion there was general agreement that the line proposedby the Commonwealth Secretary should form the basis for discussionsduring his visit to Africa, but that it would be necessary tore-examine our policy towards Rhodesia on his return.8467
The view was expressed that the effectiveness of our sanctionspolicy had been undermined by our concern to keep the door opento an honourable settlement. Our readiness to enter into discussions with the regime had been misinterpreted as weakness by the europeans in Rhodesia and had thrown doubt on our determination to persevere with the policy of sanctions. Sanctions were not beingeffectively applied by many of our allies. The Secretary-Generalof the United Nations had now received reports on their operationbut seemed reluctant to take action on these reports. For our partwe had made representations, sometimes at the highest level,whenever we had reason to believe that sanctions were not beingstrictly applied. It had always been recognised that the flow of oil to Rhodesia through Mozambique was a weakness in our sanctionspolicy. But mandatory action could not be taken against Portugalin the United Nations for fear that it would lead to a demand for similar action against South Africa. At one time there had seemedto be a possibility that Portugal might voluntarily accept anarrangement whereby supplies of oil to Mozambique would berationed to those necessary for Mozambique itself, and for the transit trade to South Africa, Malawi, Zambia and Botswana. Thisproposal had, however, required the co-operation of the Frenchcompany, the Cornpagnie Francaise de Petroles (CFP), which wasMozambique&apos;s main supplier of oil; and in spite of all our efforts,including a personal approach from the Prime Minister to president de Gaulle, the French had refused to co-operate. It was now proposed to try to bring indirect pressure to bear on CFPthrough African Commonwealth countries in all of which thecompany operated; it might also perhaps be possible to make useof the fact that Iraq and Algeria were two of the company&apos;s majorsuppliers of crude oil. In considering the effectiveness of oil sanctionsit must be borne in mind that oil played a much less important role in Rhodesia than in many countries; oil only supplied about 25 percent of Rhodesia&apos;s energy requirements.In further discussion it was agreed-^ that there was need for more information about the working of sanctions and especially for better intelligence about individual transactions, which were oftencarried out through third countries. It was also important to havea reliable up-to-date assessment of the net cost to the UnitedKingdom of our sanctions policy. Some doubt was expressedwhether it would be desirable to intensify sanctions if the only resultwere to inflict further damage on our economy without producingany further significant effect in Rhodesia. It must be admitted thatour original hope that sanctions would produce an internalrevolution in Rhodesia had been disappointed. On the contrarytheir effect had been to rally the European community behind the illegal regime. The question was now whether economic sanctions would induce the illegal regime to negotiate an acceptable settlement;this would need to ^be examined on the Commonwealth Secretary&apos; return. We. had in the past been ready to enter into talks withthe illegal regime because it was possible that Mr. Smith might be induced to jettison the extremist members of his Cabinet.   If, as
now seemed increasingly probable, he was the captive of his Rightwing, there would be ground for reconsidering our attitude towardsnegotiations. Public opinion in this country, however, was on thewhole in favour of a negotiated settlement. Meanwhile, it was important to emphasise to the Europeans in Rhodesia that &quot; noindependence before majority rule&quot; did not mean immediatemajority rule. It was evident from the Foreign Secretary&apos;s recentconversations with the South African Foreign Minister, Dr. Muller,that this was understood by the South African Government andthat they also realised the dangers of action against South africa in the United Nations. Our hope that the South african government would use their influence in favour of an honourablesettlement had been made plain to Dr. Muller. But their attitude was not yet clear. There were attractions in Mr. Malcolm Macdonald&apos;s proposal in his memorandum attached to the paperby officials that an honourable settlement might be based on an understanding that there would be &quot; no independence before majority rule &quot; and that there would be no majority rule before another10 to 15 years during which efforts would be made to prepare the africans for responsibility. But this was unlikely to be acceptable to the illegal regime.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were in general agreement with the proposals of theCommonwealth Secretary on the conduct of his visit to Africa. Someof the assumptions supporting our policy towards Rhodesia had changed; and the Cabinet would wish to reconsider our policies inthe light of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s findings. In themeantime it was desirable for the Cabinet to have further detailed information about the general effectiveness of sanctions.The Cabinet  -(1) Took note of the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s statement and invited him to be guided by their discussion in his talksduring his forthcoming visit to Africa.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion on the commonwealth secretary&apos;s return.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer,the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs, to examine and report on thepresent operation of mandatory sanctions against rhodesia, dealing in particular with:  (i) The extent to which they were being generallyenforced.(ii) Their effect in Rhodesia.(iii) Their cost to the United Kingdom.

The Minister of Labour said that, following the decisionof the National Union of Railwaymen on 21st October to withdraw the ban on the performance of second-man duties by the guards ofgoods trains, an uneasy peace had been reached on the railways.He had that morning seen representatives of the British railways board and of the Executive Committee of the union, and the two sides had agreed to open negotiations that afternoon on a newbonus settlement for the guards. He would see them again in aweek&apos;s time if they had not reached agreement.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.The Minister of Labour said that a formula for the settlementof the dispute in the Liverpool docks had been agreed on Saturday morning after all-night negotiations, under the chairmanship ofMr. A. J. Scamp, between representatives of the Transport andGeneral Workers&apos; Union and of the employers, and the ultimateintervention of the Prime Minister. There had not, however, been sufficient time before a meeting of the men later in the morning toexplain the settlement fully to those members of the unofficial strikecommittee who had not been present during the negotiations, andsome confusion had ensued. In the event the meeting had voted tocontinue the strike and to hold a further meeting on Wednesday.In the meantime Mr. Jack Jones, the Assistant Executive Secretaryof the union, would explain the agreed formula fully to the strikecommittee and seek to obtain their united support in commendingit to the men. There now seemed to be a prospect that they would return to work on Thursday.The Prime Minister said that, being in Liverpool on other business, he had thought it right, in view of the serious effect whichthe strike was having on the country&apos;s economy, to remain whilethe negotiations were going on. He had made it clear that he wouldnot concern himself with the issues in&apos;dispute, but when it became apparent that the employers were going to break off negotiations inthe early hours of Saturday he had insisted that they should continuethem, if necessary over the weekend. Had they broken off at that point there would have been no basis for a return to work and themen might have been prepared to maintain the strike for several weeks. He had been impressed by the men&apos;s appreciation of thehumane way in which the Minister of Social Security had handledthe claims for supplementary benefit arising out of the strike, andthis might well be a factor in securing their return to workimmediately after the meeting on Wednesday rather than at thebeginning of the next week.In discussion attention was drawn to the fact that overseaopinion was being given the impression that Britain was sufferingfrom a wave of strikes and that our record in this respect was particularly bad, whereas in terms of lost man-hours our record was better than that of many industrial countries. The significantfeature of the strikes in this country, however, was not so much their
Reference toIndustrialRelations inThe Queen&apos;sSpeech onthe Openingof Parliament(previous reference :CC (67) 58thConclusions,Minute 4),ill CC 60 (67)extent as the fact that the great majority of them were unofficialand symptomatic of the weakness of the trade unions in failing tohold their members to agreements made on their behalf.In further discussion the Home Secretary said that theEmergencies Committee had considered arrangements forproclaiming an emergency and drafting troops into the docks. Itwas now assumed that there would be no need for this unless themeeting in Liverpool on Wednesday failed to result in a return tov/ork. It was unlikely, therefore, that after allowing for thenecessary time to move the troops there would be any question ofproclaiming an emergency before 30th October.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theMinister of Labour.(3) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for the emergencies committee to review the situation in the light of developments during the week.The Prime Minister said that, in view of the interest in theimprovement of industrial relations stimulated by the recent strikes,it would be desirable to include a statement in The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament that when the Government hadreceived the report of the Royal Commission on Trade Unions and employers&apos; Associations they would bring their conclusions beforeParliament. This could be done in the form of a White Paper,since there would be no opportunity for legislation in the coming session.The Cabinet-(4) Took note that the Prime Minister, in consultation withthe Lord President and the Minister ,^of Labour, wouldinsert in the draft of The Queen&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament a passage on the lines he had proposed.HomeInformationI ServicesCommitteeon HomePublicity(previous reference:CC (66) 54thConclusions,Minute 3)confidential.
