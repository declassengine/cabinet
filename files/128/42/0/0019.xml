ParliamentParliamentaryProcedure(previous reference:CC (66) 58thConclusions,Minute 3)CC 19 (67)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (C (67) 45) on Parliamentary procedure.The Lord President said that the Ministerial Committee on parliamentary Procedure had considered the recommendations madeby the Select Committee on Procedure in their First, Second andFourth Reports of the current Session.The Ministerial Committee recommended the adoption of theproposal of the Fourth Report of the Select Committee for an experiment in having a voluntary timetable for the Finance Bill. Thiswould be backed by a new Sessional Order which would allowMinisters, if agreement could not be reached through the usual channels on a voluntary timetable or if the House failed to adhere to it, to move a resolution, which would be debatable for a limited time only, to set up a Business Committee of the type provided forin Standing Order No. 43, with power to determine the number ofdays to be allotted to the Bill and its further stages and the allocation of time within those days. The Government would be in a majority on the Business Committee, whose recommendations would besubmitted to the House and put to the vote without any furtherdebate. It was likely that the experiment would be acceptable tothe Opposition and, if adopted, it would represent an importantdevelopment which would be capable of extension to other Bills.The Select Committee had also discussed the possibilities ofcommitting the whole of the Finance Bill to a Standing committee or of dividing it between a Standing Committee and a Committeeof the whole House; both were controversial and were open topractical objections as well as objections of principle. The ministerial committee had concluded that consideration of the need for more drastic changes in the handling of Finance Bills, in order to reducesubstantially the time taken on the Floor of the House, should await the outcome of the experiment in a voluntary timetable.The Ministerial Committee also recommended that as an experiment the Speaker should be authorised by a resolution of theHouse to declare at any time in any debate that he intended to limitall speeches to a specified length during a specified period. He had ascertained that the Speaker would be willing to operate such anarrangement. The Select Committee had proposed more specificallythat speeches by back-benchers should be limited to 15 minutes, andthat front-bench speakers should be invited by resolution of theHouse to limit themselves to half-an-hour. The ministerial committee, however, were opposed to this proposal on the grounds that it appeared to create a distinction between first-class and second-class Members.The Ministerial Committee further recommended the adoptionof the proposal in the Select Committee&apos;s Second Report forshortening the period of notice of the subjects of Private Members&apos;motions, but thought that the Select Committee&apos;s other proposals,which would increase the frequency of debates on matters of urgency
under Standing Order No. 9 and increase the opportunities given tothe Opposition and back-benchers to raise debates on topical matters,should be deferred until the Select Committee had completed their work and a balance could be struck between changes which would work to the benefit of Government, Opposition and back-benchersrespectively.In discussion there was general agreement that advantage shouldbe taken of the recommendation of the Select Committee for an experiment in a voluntary timetable for the Finance Bill. This, ifsuccessful, would go far to remove the present criticism of finance bill procedure arising from its uncertainty and the frequency of latenight sittings; the experiment would also pave the way for laterextension of timetables to facilitate legislation generally. It wouldbe important, however, that the experiment should not be presented in such a way as to suggest that the Government were seeking to restrict debate, and it should be made clear that the Governmentwould hope to avoid the use of the power to impose a timetable underthe new Sessional Order. It was desirable that the Liberal party should be included in the discussions to settle the timetable. It waspointed out, however, that difficulty might be caused whereback-benchers failed to observe the agreed timetable. Where this happened, the House would rise at the time previously agreed andwould have to catch up with the programme of business on thefollowing day. It was suggested that such difficulties could be resolvedthrough the usual channels and that in the last resort it would bepossible to move a resolution to enforce the timetable. agreement on a timetable would leave Government supporters freer to speakthan was the case under existing procedure but it was desirable thatthey should exercise restraint to avoid allegations that the opportunities for Opposition speakers were thereby curtailed.In discussion of the proposal to give the Speaker discretion to limit the duration of speeches, it was suggested that the matter was better left to the general sense of the House and that the normalprocess of debate should continue. Informal arrangements were already operating satisfactorily, for example, in relation to the duration of speeches winding up debates. On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the matter was one on which there was strong feeling among back-benchers, and it was suggested that furtherconsideration should be given to the Select Committee&apos;s proposalto establish limits of 15 and 30 minutes for back bench andfront bench speakers respectively. A distinction could properly bemade between the two on the basis of their functions, and it wasto the advantage of the House that front bench speakers should begiven more time than back-benchers. It would, however, be necessaryto allow the longer period to back-benchers when opening debates,for example, on statutory instruments. A specific allocation of time,as proposed by the Select Committee, was likely to work more easilyin practice than a procedure which left the imposition of limitsentirely to the Speakers discretion. It would also avoid the risk thatthe Speaker might be pressed to impose the same limits on government spokesmen as on back-benchers and the risk that, iftime limits were enforced during certain periods only, a different
CC19(67)style of debate would develop during those periods. On the otherhand, it was suggested that inflexible rules were unlikely to operatesatisfactorily and would unduly handicap the back-bencher who hadan important contribution to make to a debate. It would, therefore,be preferable to give the Speaker discretion, as proposed by the ministerial Committee, in the light, for example, of the number ofMembers wishing to speak in any particular debate. Such a systemalready operated informally and there was no reason to suppose thatthe Speaker would have difficulty in operating a more formalarrangement in the light of his sense of the feeling of the House,which tended to favour strict handling of such matters. It wouldbe understood that the Speaker would not impose limitations on frontbench speakers, but it was suggested that it would be preferable thatthere should be a limited period, for example, between 6 p.m. and p.m., during which the Speaker would be able to impose limitations on the length of speeches for a period of an hour or two. It was important that he should be able to extend the time limit to compensate for interruptions to a Member&apos;s speech.In discussion of the Select Committee&apos;s recommendations onurgent and topical debates, it was suggested that these would conferimportant advantages on the Opposition and should only be conceded in return for concessions from the Opposition, for example, on thetimetables for Bills and on the taking of censure motions in Oppositiontime. There was general agreement that a decision on these recommendations should be deferred until the work of that committee had been completed, apart from the recommendation to shorten the period of notice which had to be given of the subjectof Private Members&apos; motions.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that an experiment should be conducted in a voluntarytimetable for the Finance Bill on the lines proposed by the SelectCommittee. In recommending this proposal to the House, however,it would be important to avoid suggesting that the Government were seeking to restrict discussion. The Cabinet also agreed with theproposal of the Ministerial Committee that, as an experiment, the speaker should be given discretion by a resolution of the House toset a time limit on speeches, but considered that the exercise of thisdiscretion should be limited to a specific period, say, between thehours of 6 p.m. and 9 p.m. The Cabinet further agreed that apartfrom the proposal to shorten the period of notice of the subject ofPrivate Members&apos; motions, a decision on the recommendations ofthe Second Report of the Select Committee relating to urgent andtopical debates should be deferred until the Select Committee had completed their work.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the discretion to be given to the Speaker to seta time limit on speeches should be limited to a period to be specified by him between the opening and the closingspeeches.
(2) Subject to Conclusion (1), approved C (67) 45 and invited the Lord President of the Council, in presenting theproposals to the House of Commons, to be guided bythe Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.ParliamentAttendance ofMinistersbefore select committees(previous reference:CC(67) 15thConclusions,Minute 1)confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C (67) 47) by theLord President of the Council about the attendance of Ministersbefore Select Committees.The Lord President said that the new Specialist Committees,which would be concerned with matters of policy, would expectMinisters to appear before them, and the Select Committee on nationalised Industries were inviting Ministers to give evidence onthe relationship between Ministers and the Nationalised Boards.Attendance before Select Committees might become an important part of a Minister^ responsibility to Parliament and it was desirableto work out a code of practice for dealing with matters which mightbe sensitive in one department but not in others. The ministerial committee on Parliamentary Procedure proposed that Ministerscalled before a Select Committee should submit a writtenmemorandum of evidence and that a convention should be established that subsequent questioning would normally be confined to the scopeof the memorandum. Ministers should normally give evidencethemselves only where issues of policy were being raised. No simplerule could be laid down on whether Ministers should appear in public or in private session and, if the latter, on whether they should give evidence for the record or confine themselves to excluding specificpassages from publication. On delicate matters such as relationship with Nationalised Boards it might be unwise to give evidence in public; but on some other matters there would be no objection toa Minister giving public evidence if he so wished. It would befor the Select Committees to consider whether they would derivemore benefit from evidence given informally with no record taken;and Ministers should not appear to be striking a bargain on this point.The Ministerial Committee considered that the Cabinet shoulddefine certain topics which Ministers snould not discuss in givingevidence: information obtained in confidence on the private affairs of individuals, companies or institutions; information affectingnational security; matters which were the subject of sensitivenegotiation with Governments or other bodies; cases where theMinister had a quasi-judicial or appellate function and matters onwhich Government policy had been decided and legislation was shortly to be introduced. If the Cabinet agreed on the conventionsto be adopted he proposed to see the Chairman of the select committees and explain the conventions to them.In discussion doubts were expressed about the wisdom of givingSpecialist Committees opportunities to question Ministers on policy.A Ministers appearance as a witness would enable members of theCommittee to examine him more closely and persistently than was
possible either at Question Time or in debate. This would be advantageous to members of the Opposition, but it was doubtfulwhether it was compatible with good government, particularly withthe purposive style of government to which the present administration was committed, or with the maintenance of the principle of collective responsibility. Specialist Committees might be less willing in examining Ministers than Select Committees had hitherto been in examining officials to accept a refusal to answer embarrassingquestions; they might seek to elicit evidence revealing differences ofopinion within the Government and Ministers might be under sometemptation to seek the support of a Committee for their departmentalpoints of view. On the other hand it was argued that the appearance of Ministers before Specialist Committees would provide valuableopportunities to explain Government policy, to removemisconceptions and to answer points made by earlier witnesses, forexample, chairmen of nationalised industries discussing the relationship of their Boards with Ministers. Moreover if Ministersrefused to appear before Committees or were unduly cautious in giving evidence they would lose the benefits which they had hoped to obtain by involving Private Members of the House of commons in the formulation of policy and would expose themselves to criticism and misunderstanding. It was not clear, for example, how theGovernment could justify discussing their policy with such bodiesas the National Economic Development Council before announcingit to Parliament if they were unwilling to be equally frank withSpecialist Committees; and the anxieties which had been expressedmight well be proved by experience to be as unfounded as thosewhich had preceded the establishment of the Select Committee on nationalised Industries. Since the experiment with SpecialistCommittees had been launched it must be carried through; if theresults were unsatisfactory the Committees could be discontinued.Meanwhile in view of the risks that had been mentioned it was important that Ministers should consult one another before givingevidence on topics which concerned more than one Department.They should make it a rule that they would give evidence only on matters covered initially in a written memorandum and should insist on being given sufficient time to prepare the memorandum to allow for consultation with other Ministers concerned. They should not allow themselves to be drawn into discussion in giving oral evidence on matters on which Ministerial opinion was divided.In further discussion the following points were considered Publication of evidence(a) It was suggested that, although experience of the public accounts and Estimates Committees gave no reason to suppose thatthe Specialist Committees could not be relied upon to preserve the secrecy of information given in confidence, it would be wise not togive such evidence in the presence of the Press and the public even with a specific request that it should be regarded as not for publication.Ministers should indicate in their initial memorandum what parts of
their evidence they would wish to give in private and, if they were asked in public session a question to which the answer wasconfidential, they should offer to submit a further confidentialmemorandum on which they could be questioned in private.Evidence on matters under negotiation(b) It was suggested that the rule proposed in paragraph 4 (3) ofC (67) 47 should apply to matters &quot; which are the subject or may become the subject of sensitive negotiation &quot;. There should certainly be no discussion with a Specialist Committee of, for example, theextent to which the Government might be prepared to make concessions in negotiation and it might on occasion be embarrassing to discuss even the Governmenfs objectives while negotiations werepending. On the other hand the rule might be too restrictive inrelation to domestic affairs if topics likely to be the subject of negotiation, for example with industry, were excluded. ministers could be relied on to use their own discretion in withholdinginformation about particularly sensitive areas of negotiation withoutexcluding the whole topic from their evidence. The risk of embarrassment could be obviated by prior consultation. The rule should accordingly run as follows: &quot; Matters which are or may become the subject of sensitive negotiation with Governments or other bodies should not be discussed without prior consultation with theForeign Secretary or, in relation to domestic matters, the ministers concerned.&quot;Evidence on legislation(c) The purpose of paragraph 4 (5) of C (67) 47 was primarily to prevent members of Specialist Committees from anticipating theSecond Reading debate on a Bill; but the rule might have theundesirable effect of limiting the part which Specialist Committeescould play in the formulation of the policy to which a Bill was designed to give effect. It was pointed out, however, that there had recently been occasions for example in relation to the leasehold reform Bill when, after decisions on policy had been taken,insuperable difficulties had been discovered in the process of draftingand it had been necessary to reconsider the policy. If in the meanwhile a Minister had disclosed the original decision to a SpecialistCommittee the Government would have been exposed to considerableembarrassment. Moreover if a Committee were given priorinformation about the content of a Bill the House itself might beaffronted and the ultimate impact of the publication of the Bill on public opinion would be reduced. If therefore a Minister wished todiscuss proposals for legislation during the course of the drafting ofa Bill he should ensure that the proposals were first made public by means of either a White Paper or a statement in Parliament. Itwas suggested that a distinction should be drawn between topics, notthe subject of party controversy, on which the Government proposedto introduce legislation but had not formed views on the content ofthe Bill and wished to consult a Specialist Committee before reaching decisions, and Bills designed to implement the Governmenfs ownpolicies. On the latter there should be no discussion with a Specialist
CC 19(67)Committee during the period between the submission of the proposed policy to the relevant Cabinet Committee and the introduction ofthe Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that Ministers should be free to accept invitations to give evidence on matters of policy before the Specialist committees or the Select Committee on Nationalised Industries and should seek to establish conventions on the lines proposed in C (67) 47. Inparticular they should first submit to the Committee a memorandumof evidence and should normally limit their oral evidence to theground covered by the memorandum. Where more than oneMinister was concerned With the topic before the Committee a minister should consult his colleagues both on the memorandum andon the content-of his oral evidence. A Minister should indicate toa Committee which parts, if any, of his memorandum he wished tobe treated as confidential and should ask that oral evidence on those parts should be taken in private. If confidential matters were raised in public session he should offer to submit a memorandum on them.Evidence should not be given before the Committees on the mattersindicated in paragraph 4 of C (67) 47, subject to the revision ofparagraph 4 (3) on the lines indicated in discussion and to furtherconsideration by the Ministerial Committee on parliamentary procedure of the rule in paragraph 4 (5). The Lord President should submit to that Committee a further draft of this rule in the light ofthe discussion. Thereafter he should explain to the Chairmen of the specialist Committees the practice which Ministers proposed tofollow in giving evidence before them.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord President of the Council to arrange forthe Ministerial Committee on Parliamentary Procedure toconsider a draft rule on evidence about impendinglegislation revised in the light of their discussion.(2) Subject to (1) above and to the revision of the rule inparagraph 4 (3) as agreed in their discussion, approved the proposals in C (67) 47.(3) Invited the Lord President of the Council to explain to the chairmen of the Specialist Committees and the SelectCommittee on Nationalised Industries the practice which ministers proposed to follow in giving evidence beforethem.confidential. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that there hadbeen little change in the position in relation to Aden since the previous day, except that he was now more hopeful that the United NationsMission would visit London for discussions and he did not rule outthe possibility that they might even be persuaded to return to Adento pursue their enquiries.
DefenceExpenditureStudies(previous reference :CC (67) 16thConclusions,Minute 3)SECRET*4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of memoranda by theSecretary of State for Foreign Affairs and the Secretary of State for defence (C (67) 40) and by the Secretary of State for commonwealth affairs (C (67) 41) on the defence expenditure studies.The Foreign Secretary said that the proposals which he and theDefence Secretary had jointly put before the Cabinet should be presented to our allies as a major change of policy not as a reductionof forces dictated by economic considerations alone. Otherwise weshould be under pressure to keep commitments and we should thenbe unable to make the reductions in defence expenditure that were needed, since these depended on a decision to leave the mainland ofAsia and on giving up the capability to intervene there, withreinforcements. The advice of our Ambassador in Washington wasthat it might not be too difficult to obtain United States acceptanceof our plans, but it was essential that, in the consultations whichhe would initiate with our allies at the time of the forthcoming council meeting in Washington of the South East Asia Treaty Organisation(SEATO) there should be some flexibility on the dates for reducing our forces by half in Singapore/Malaysia, on the date for complete withdrawal from these two countries, and on the extent of the maritime and air presence that we might maintain in the Far Eastafter 1975-76. The latter might be crucial to obtaining the aquiescence of our allies in our change of policy.The Commonwealth Secretary said that he had felt it necessaryto set out in a separate memorandum the grave effects whichacceptance of the proposals of the Foreign and Defence Secretarieswas likely to have on the Commonwealth countries concerned.During the past year a series of Ministerial statements had been madeboth in this country and in the Commonwealth countries concernedbased on the expectation, following the Defence Review, that weshould accelerate the rundown of our forces in the Far East between now and 1970. Australia and New Zealand had accepted this since they were not so much concerned with the size of our forces in theFar East as with our maintaining military presence there. But therehad been no suggestion that we had it in mind to withdraw altogether from Singapore/Malaysia by 1975-76 and if we were to say inthe next few months that it was our intention to make this major change in our policy, their attitude was likely to be very different,particularly if this were to coincide with an application on our part to join the European Economic Community (e.c.). So far asSingapore, and to a lesser extent Malaysia, were concerned theconsequences of the complete withdrawal of our forces in thetimescale proposed would be very serious indeed and would involvelarge expenditures on aid to be set against savings in the defence budget. Singapore already had a high level of unemployment andthis would be greatly increased as a result of our withdrawal.Although the Singapore Prime Minister, Mr. Lee Kuan Yew, was atpresent in control of the situation, there was a strong Communistelement in the island which in these circumstances would be likely* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.
to gain significantly in strength. In view of our experience in Malta,where we had progressively been forced to make concessions on our original timetable for running down our forces, the best course inthe Far East would be to decide now to reduce our forces in singapore /Malaysia by about half by 1970-71, leaving the questionof complete withdrawal for later discussion. In any event we should present our proposals as being necessary on economic and not politico/military grounds and we should be flexible in accepting the need toadopt our proposals in the light of the views of our allies.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the requirements ofour defence strategy overseas and those of our economic strategyat home were in conflict. We were carrying a much heavier burdenof governmental oversea expenditure than other comparable countries and this was seriously inhibiting our efforts to achieve our economicand social programmes. We needed to make a saving of  300 million on defence expenditure as a contribution to a saving in present planned programmes of public expenditure as a whole of  500 million by 1970-71 in order to achieve a viable economic strategy. he supported the proposals of the Foreign and Defence Secretaries inrespect of the Far East but on this basis it appeared that total savings on the defence budget by 1970-71 would not be greater than  200million. This would entail correspondingly higher reductions in the planned programmes of civil expenditure in 1970-71 and we should therefore consider what other savings in defence expenditure couldbe achieved, including the possibility of disbanding forces withdrawnfrom Germany rather than earmarking them for assignment to theNorth Atlantic Treaty Organisation.In discussion there was general agreement that in presentingproposals on these lines to our allies it would be necessary to useeconomic and politico/military arguments, since both were relevant.Some support was expressed for the view that at this stage we shouldnot discuss with our allies plans beyond a reduction by about halfof our forces in Singapore / Malaysia by 1970-71, particularly in viewof the line which Ministers had taken publicly about our policy inthe Far East in the recent past, and of the likelihood that, if we wereto go as far as was now proposed, we should be unable to sustainour proposals in the event. We might in fact find that we didnot enter the e.c. and at the same time we had succeeded inestranging ourselves from the United States and from the old commonwealth countries.Against this is was argued that unless we began now to plan on leaving Singapore/Malaysia at least by 1975-76 and to give up any capability to intervene on the mainland of Asia withreinforcements, there was no possibility of achieving savings in defence expenditure of the order that, subject to further examination,seemed possible under the proposals of the Foreign and DefenceSecretaries. The question was not whether these proposals wenttoo far but whether they went far enough, particularly in view ofthe relatively small savings in defence expenditure that would accrue from them during the lifetime of the present Parliament.   It was
secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the first secretary of State and Secretary of State for Economic Affairs(C (67) 46) on the question of taking further statutory powers inpursuance of the Governmenfs policy on prices and incomes.The First Secretary of State said that at their previous discussion the Cabinet had taken the view on balance that, while the Governmentshould activate Part II of the Prices and Incomes Act before the expiry of Part IV and should seek further statutory powers for aPrices andIncomesPolicyStatutoryPowers(previous reference :CC(67) 16thConclusions,Minute 2)important also to know whether the proposal to maintain a smallmaritime and air presence in the Far East would prevent us from making substantial economies in the equipment programme of theService, for example in the purchase of the Fill aircraft, and toleave open the possibility of making greater savings than were nowbeing suggested when final decisions on the defence programmecame to be taken in June and July. It would be more logical todecide to withdraw altogether from the Far East than to maintain amaritime and air presence in Australia.In further discussion it was pointed out that major difficultiesarose in effecting such large changes in our overseas policy,particularly where these might, like those now in question, have such grave consequences for our allies. Moreover the rate ofdisbandment which would be involved would present serious difficulties for the armed forces and consequential problems in theUnited Kingdom for additional housing and in other respects.Adequate time for planning and carrying out these reductions both at home and overseas was essential.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that consultations on our Far East policy should be initiated with our allies on the basis of the proposals ofthe Foreign and Defence Secretaries. The consultations musthowever leave open for decision in June/July the date of our eventualwithdrawal from Malaysia and Singapore and whether or not wewere to maintain maritime and air forces using facilities in Australiaafter our withdrawal from Singapore/Malaysia and, if so, of whatsize they should be. The Cabinet would be able in June /July totake decisions on our defence programme as a whole including the size of the armed forces and the equipment they would require. TheForeign Secretary would, during the forthcoming SEATO council meeting, initiate consultations with the United States Government,with Mr. Holyoake, the New Zealand Prime Minister, and with theAustralian Minister for External Affairs. He would himself write to the Australian Prime Minister at the same time about our proposals.The Defence Secretary would then initiate consultations with theMalaysian and Singapore Governments dn his forthcoming visit tothose countries.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.
temporary period thereafter, those further powers should not include a power to prevent retrospective payment of increased wages following the imposition of a standstill on the wages in question. He remainedof the view that the omission of- this power would weaken theproposals for statutory powers as a whole: these proposals should nevertheless be pursued. The powers under Part II to delay increases of prices or wages for up to four months would not be sufficientto control the situation in the second half of 1967, in view of the pressures for increases of wages in that period which were alreadymounting. The Government should therefore take power to enablethem, at their own discretion, to implement recommendations by theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) that an increase in price or in pay should be deferred (or implemented in part or ininstalments) for a further period after the Board had reported,subject to a maximum of six months from the date of reference tothe Board. Power should also be taken to secure a temporaryreversion of an increase either of pay or in price which had already occurred but which merited examination by the NBPI; and provision should be made by amending Section 30 of the Act to remove thecause of actions for breach of contract against employers who haddeferred increases of wages in accordance with a request by theGovernment during the periods of standstill and severe restraint.However, if the proposal for a power to prevent retrospectivepayments of increased wages were to be abandoned, it would bea necessary consequence that the proposal previously considered fora power to enforce reductions of prices should also be dropped;otherwise, it was clear from his previous discussions with the confederation of British Industry (CBI) that management would regard the proposals as a serious disturbance of any reasonable balance between the treatment of prices and pay, the more so becauseretrospective increases of prices were in most cases quite impracticable.The proposal for a power to enforce reductions in prices should therefore not be pursued.In discussion, it was argued that the Government would bejustified in seeking such a power even if the proposal for a powerto prevent retrospective payments of increased wages were abandoned.It was not necessary to preserve equality of treatment as betweenprices and wages: prices were determined unilaterally whereas wages were fixed by collective bargaining, and there was a significantdifference in the attitude of the public towards controls over price as compared with controls over wages. A power to enforce reductions in prices would be a useful instrument for stiffening the resistance of employers to excessive wage claims and so supporting the efforts of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) to control movements of wageson a voluntary basis. Productivity agreements would be an important element in the policy on incomes and it would be necessary to ensurethat part of the benefits of such agreements accrued to consumers;a power to enforce reductions in prices would enable the Governmentto secure this. The taking of such a power would not in itselfnecessarily provoke strong opposition from employers; they would
be more influenced by the way in which the power was exercisedand they could be assured that it would only be used after the fullestinvestigations.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, even without a power to enforce reductions in prices, the proposed powers wouldbe substantially more extensive in respect of prices than in respectof wages, since there would be no power to prevent retrospectiveincreases of wages whereas retrospective increases in prices were not normally practicable. To take power to enforce reductions in prices would enhance this imbalance. It would moreover not merelyprovoke a hostile reaction from the CBI but would constitute aserious blow to the confidence of management in industry generally,who would see the Governmenfs proposals as portending increasedpressure on margins of profit. The effect of this would be to discourage industrial confidence and investment at a time when the primary need of the economy was to encourage them. If there were no power to enforce reductions in prices it would still be possiblefor the Government to refer cases to the NBPI where such reductionsmight be justified and for the Board to recommend reductions; thevalue of the role of the NBPI, in this as in other respects, did not depend primarily on the existence of statutory powers to enforce the Board&apos;s findings.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that further statutory powers should be sought fora temporary period after the expiry of Part IV of the Act in theterms now proposed by the First Secretary of State. The first secretary of State should now arrange to inform the CBI and the tuc of the Governmenfs intentions and to make a statement inParliament, probably on Monday, 17th, or Wednesday, 19th April;he should consult further with the Lord President and the chief whip on the Parliamentary handling of the Governmenfs decision.It would not be necessary to issue a White Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Government should activate Part II of thePrices and Incomes Acts before the expiry of Part IVand should seek the further temporary statutory powers over prices and incomes proposed in paragraph 5 ofC (67) 46.(2) Invited the First Secretary of State (i) to inform the CBI and TUC of the governments intentions as in Conclusion (1); and -(ii) to announce the Governmenfs intentions toParliament at an early date and to consult further with the Lord President of the Council and theChief Whip on the timing of the announcement andthe Parliamentary handling of the matter.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,11th April, 1967.
