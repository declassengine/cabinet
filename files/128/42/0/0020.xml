CC 20 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.secret. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the approach to europe. They had before them a memorandum by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign Secretary (C (67) 33) on the outcome of their visit to the capitals of the member countries of the European economic community (e.c.), a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet (C (67) 48),to which was attached a report by the Official Committee on the approach to Europe on the implications of entry into Europe for the mobility of labour and for immigration policy, and notes by theSecretary of the Cabinet (C (67) 44 and C (67) 49) to which were attached respectively a memorandum by the Official Committee onthe Approach to Europe on the common agricultural policy of the eec and its implications for British agriculture and a table of comparative figures of imports of cereals by the United Kingdom andthe e.c..The Prime Minister said that since the Cabinefs last discussionhe had been giving further thought in consultation with the foreign secretary to the timetable for their future discussions. It would bedesirable on many grounds for the Cabinet to complete these in timeto reach and announce a decision and to hold a Parliamentary debate on it before the Whitsun Recess, which was at present planned to start on 12th May. If this were not possible, three weeks would be lost, since the Recess would be for a fortnight and in the following week he would be visiting Canada and the United States. He had considered the possibility of postponing the Recess for one week, but many Members of Parliament had made arrangements for the Recesson the basis of earlier intimations that it would start about 12th May.There were also difficulties in recalling Parliament for the last week of May, while the Foreign Secretary would then be making his visit to the Soviet Union and to delay or curtail it might have undesirableconsequences for our foreign relations. Moreover, the second week of the Recess immediately preceded the Bank Holiday weekend. Onthe basis that it was hardly possible to postpone the Recess, the cabinet&apos;s future programme might be on the following lines. Afterthe completion of the agenda for the present meeting, the cabinet should consider on 20th April the substantial report on an AtlanticFree Trade Area and on a policy of abstention from any widerassociation, as alternatives to entry into the Community, and also thememorandum for which they had asked on the impact of entry onour physical planning arrangements. On 27th April they might consider the report being prepared-on the impact of entry on our balance of payments as a whole, the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;smemorandum on the future of the Commonwealth, and any other papers which Ministers might wish to submit, together with thememorandum he had earlier undertaken to circulate on the
alternative courses before them if the approach to Europe were to be pursued. Thus by 27th April the Cabinet would have available allthe papers which were relevant to their decision. Time for their full consideration was essential and he had suggested at the last meeting of the Cabinet on this issue that it might be advantageous to hold a meeting of the Cabinet throughout Sunday, 30th April, at chequers. This might follow the procedure of the Ministerialmeetings held there in October arid Novefnber, 1966, as a meeting ofmembers of the Cabinet with officials and advisers present inthe morning, and a meeting of the Cabinet in the afternoon and, ifnecessary, in the evening. The time available, for discussion might thus in total be the equivalent of about 10 ordinary meetings of theCabinet. It would not be appropriate to take a decision at theChequers meeting, but to reach a stage where the decision could betaken at a normal meeting of the Cabinet in the following week; anyfurther prolongation of discussion might be unfruitful and might prejudice the Governments position nationally and internationally.The Cabinet would need to bear in mind as regards timing thatthe date for ending the definitive part of the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations, which had now been set for 30th April (though the7th May was more probable) could be still further delayed; and theywould need to examine carefully the impact which the announcementof the Cabinets decision on the approach to Europe might have onthe negotiations if these had not been completed in principle at thetime when the decision was announced.   While those negotiations should not be prejudiced by any decision we might make, it would clearly be best for them to be concluded as quickly as possible; andwe should instruct our representatives to exert all the pressure theycould for an early conclusion. It would be possible, but not desirable,to postpone a Parliamentary Debate on the Governments decision until after the Recess.  The procedure followed in 1961 before theproposed negotiations for entry had set a clear precedent. A furtherrelevant factor which he had discussed with the Foreign Secretary wasthe nature and timing of consultation with the European Free trade association (EFTA) and it would be necessary for him to consult theCommonwealth Secretary on similar problems in regard to theCommonwealth; but it was clear that these consultations could befitted into the programme he had outlined. If during the latter partof the programme it were to appear for any reason that it would be a mistake to seek a decision and a debate before the Recess, this couldbe reviewed in the light of the new circumstances.In discussion of future procedure the following main points weremade (a).Whilst from many points of view it would clearly be advantageous to reach a decision on the approach to Europe and tohave it debated in Parliament before the Recess, this would entailsome compression of the considerable programme of discussion beforethe Cabinet, and it might well be that external events such as the critical phase of the Kennedy Round and the proposed meeting of the heads of Government of the member countries of the e.c. wouldalso make such a timetable impracticable. It would moreover be important that if such a timetable were adopted it should not become
CC20(67)public knowledge, since this might itself give rise to new factors which would complicate the Cabinefs discussions. On the otherhand it was pointed out that it. might be disadvantageous to prolongthe Cabinefs discussions unduly and that the resulting delay mightbe taken publicly as implying serious difficulty in reaching a decision;this would be undesirable in relation to both domestic and foreignopinion, particularly that in the e.c.. If further time for discussion were required, it would be possible to hold the proposed meetings at Chequers over two days rather than one, i.e., 29th and 30th April.(b) If the Cabinet were to decide to develop our approach to europe in some way, the tactics to be pursued would be of greatimportance and indeed would have a bearing on the issue of principle.It would, therefore, be important that tactics should be discussed not later than the proposed meeting at Chequers. The proposed programme provided for this, however, since the memorandum on alternative means of pursuing the approach to Europe would be circulated to Cabinet in time for their discussion on 27th April. Itwould inter alia have to cover such questions as whether or not tomake an early application for negotiations for entry; or alternativelyto seek further exploratory discussions with the Six with or without adeclaration of intention to join; whether such exploration should bebilateral or multilateral; and what type of negotiations should besought.(c) It was suggested that, if a meeting at Chequers were to beheld, officials and advisers should be present for the first part of the session. A wide range of subjects would have to be covered and ministers might wish to be able to consult their officials on questionsof fact; there was more than one precedent for such a procedure.On the other hand it was urged that a better procedure might be forfactual questions to be put forward by Ministers and the necessaryanswers to them prepared by officials, before the definitive stages ofthe Cabinefs consideration. In any event Ministers would themselvesdeal with any questions of opinion. However it was suggested thatany requirements for further factual advice could be reconciled withconstitutional precedent and propriety if in appropriate cases eachMinister so concerned were accompanied for this purpose by anofficial to whom he might himself wish to refer as he thought fit;attendance at the Cabinet meeting of others than Cabinet ministers would, in accordance with constitutional usage, be for decision by thePrime Minister.(d) Consultation with EFTA and the Commonwealth presented a difficult problem; our commitment to EFTA was to consult them before a decision had been taken by the Cabinet and we were alsocommitted to the closest consultation with the other members of theCommonwealth. It must however be regarded as certain that any advance intimation of a decision or of a pending decision by theCabinet would become public knowledge before it could be announced to Parliament; and it would therefore be necessary thatany meeting of EFTA Ministers should not be held before such adecision: consultation with the Commonwealth seemed to present
less difficulty since the other members were concerned primarily withthe negotiation of safeguards for their own interests if we were toenter, rather than with our decision to seek entry as such. The right course would be for the Cabinet at an early date to consider amemorandum setting out the problems and the alternative means bywhich they might be solved.(e) A number of Ministers were proposing to make foreign visitsduring the course of the proposed programme for consideration ofthe approach to Europe. It would be for Ministers to considerwhether to make such visits in view of the difficulties of timing theCabinet had discussed, since it would clearly not be possible to delay the Cabinefs programme oh that account. Ministers who wereunavoidably absent from the meetings of Cabinet would, however, beable to follow the proceedings in the Cabinet records.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the general view was that the Cabinefs further consideration ofthe approach to Europe should pursue the course he had outlined atthe outset of their discussion, with the object of reaching a decisionduring the first week of May, unless such circumstances were to arise as would require the programme to be reviewed. He would consider further the arrangements for a meeting at Chequers on the weekendof 29th/30th April and would also arrange for the Cabinet to consider at an early date a memorandum on consultation with theCommonwealth and EFTA.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the procedure the PrimeMinister had indicated.The Cabinet then turned to discussion of the papers before them.SterlingThe Prime Minister said that sterling^ role as a world currencyhas been extensively discussed during the European visits. the growing strength of sterling had nowhere been questioned: indeed the French Prime Minister, M. Pompidou, had disclaimed the reportscurrent the previous July of doubts he was alleged to have expressed on this score; and on all the visits tributes had been paid to the efficacy of the measures Her Majesty&apos;s Government had taken toimprove our balance of payments. Although there had been fulldiscussions of sterling&apos;s role as a world currency, it was not until the visit to The Hague on 27th and 28th February that the real anxietiesof the Six on this had emerged. Under Article 108 of the Treaty of rome a member country of the e.c. in balance of payments difficulties as a result either of overall disequilibrium &quot;or of the kinds of currency at its disposal &quot; might, in taking measures to overcome itsdifficulties, either give rise to deflationary repercussions on the economies of the other member countries, or become entitled to assistance by them. The Six were concerned lest a sterling crisisarising not from an imbalance in the oversea payments of the UnitedKingdom, but from external causes related to sterling^ role as a worldtrading and reserve currency, should have such consequences for the
CC20(67)other members of the Community. Article 108 had been drafted ata time when the currencies of several members of the Community werenot fully convertible and it would be outwith the intentions underlying the clause for it to be invoked, as it could conceivably be, if a crisisarose from circumstances concerning sterling&apos;s role as a reserve and trading currency and not as a result of the balance of payments of theUnited Kingdom itself. In the discussion in The Hague of this problem our view had been that, when an important currencyencountered major difficulties, it would be right for assistance to begiven under wider international arrangements such as were providedby the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Basle Agreements.This indeed had been the case recently when Italy had encounteredfinancial difficulties; the other members of the Community hadparticipated in the wider arrangements for assistance as well as theUnited States, ourselves, and other countries. We would thereforeexpect, if sterling were to encounter difficulties arising from its worldrole and not from an imbalance in United Kingdom payments, thatany necessary assistance would be provided by international arrangements on the wider basis; in such a case we would not expect to invoke Article 108. In The Hague and in Luxembourg we had been told that an understanding of this kind would entirely remove the anxieties expressed by the Six, and the news of these discussions had gone far to reassure the legitimate anxieties of France, though this didnot mean that the world responsibilities of sterling would not be used by the French as a political argument that we were insufficientlyEuropean.In discussion the following points were made (/) If sterling and our economy were strong, it would beimmaterial whether we were a member of the e.c. or not. But if our balance of payments were adverse as a result of our entry intothe e.c., should we then be able to invoke assistance under Article108? In reply it was pointed out that we should presumably not agree to enter on terms which were likely to entail an unacceptableburden on our balance of payments; and we coujd reasonably expect to negotiate transitional arrangements and other easements whichwould prevent this. But if we did encounter difficulties as a resultof the obligations of membership, we should certainly be entitledto invoke Article 108. The Six might be unwilling to admit us tothe e.c. if this were in prospect, but the Prime Minister and foreign secretary had said on the European tour that we should regardourselves as being on the same basis as the Six in regard to Article 108.Doubts in some circles of the Six were directed not so much to thepossible consequences of sterling&apos;s roles as a reserve and tradingcurrency, but rather to our ability to maintain the strength of our economy as being basic to the strength of sterling, a course which itwas in any event essential for us to pursue.(g) While it was unlikely, in view of the favourable opinions heldin world financial circles of our entering the Community, that entrywould cause a lack of confidence in sterling, it might nevertheless be unwise for use to renounce, as part of negotiations with the e.c.,
any rights we might be able to claim under Article 108. Moreover,it would be wrong to forgo by such a renunciation any oppertuinities which might arise out of negotiations for entry to make international arrangements to relieve us of such burdens as the sterling balancesimposed on us. We should need to be clear on the help the Six wouldgive us if we did encounter balance of payments difficulties afterentry. It was pointed out however that this was what had beendiscussed during the European tour, namely the negotiation ofarrangements which would define our rights under Article 108, havingregard to the world role of sterling. We had also made clear that,if the Six wished to discuss with us the possibility of new international arrangements for relieving us of the burden of the sterling balances,we should be glad to co-operate: no option had been closed in thisrespect.(h) There was some prospect that our application for entry tothe Community, if we decided to make one, and any subsequent negotiations, might unfortunately coincide with the development of critical difficulties in the current international monetary discussions,in which the French were playing a devious role. They had started by insisting upon the establishment of a new international reserveunit as a solution to the problems of world liquidity, and we hadpersuaded the Americans to support this; but the French had subsequently reversed their position and were now insisting upon arival solution by means of increases in drawing rights under theInternational Monetary Agreement (and so of their voting power under the IMF) in opposition to Anglo-American support of a newreserve unit. Our objective was to reach a solution to the problem of world liquidity and it would be wrong for us, for the sake of appearingmore European during our approach to the Community, to changeour attitude in the monetary negotiations in response to the changingFrench manoeuvres. To avoid unnecessary friction however we had asked the Federal German Government to find out what was the true French position and were in close touch with the United States.(/&apos;) It was suggested that our entry into the Community would be bound to impose a considerable burden on our balance of payments;moreover we should have to renounce the freedom and powers we now had to regulate our balance of payments. In the long term,whether as a member of the Community or otherwise, we could not hope to avoid occasional periods of economic or financial difficultyin which we should need those powers. It would be difficult to rely upon assistance from the e.c. under Article 108 both because we might have on joining to renounce some rights we might otherwiseenjoy under it and because in any event it would be difficult to distinguish between the international and national causes of anybalance of payments difficulties. On the other hand it was urgedthat such a view exaggerated our problems. If we were a member ofthe e.c. it would be in their interest to help us in any difficulties we might encounter, since otherwise they would put themselves at riskfrom the consequences for the enlarged Community as a whole. Theyhad as members of the international financial community given usassistance in the sterling crisis the previous year and it wasinconceivable that the Six would treat us worse as members than
SECRET,a 138they would as non-members; and if we were members, we should clearly be in a position to bring other powerful pressures to bear on them. Moreover experience suggested that some of the freedomsand powers referred to were not in practice open to us, because ofthe adverse international reactions and consequent damage to our interests that would ensue if we were to use them.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, said there would be an opportunity to consider these questions further inthe later stages of the programme of discussions the Cabinet hadearlier approved.Mobility of labour and immigration policy the Home Secretary said that our entry into Europe and acceptance of the provisions of the Treaty of Rome and theRegulations made under it in respect of the mobility of labour might result in some increase in the entry into the United Kingdom oflabour from Europe. It seemed improbable however that this wouldbe substantial. The right of free movement within the Communitywas based on nationality, not on residence or previous employment and applied only to nationals of the European territories of theCommunity: for example even workers from French OverseaDepartments did not qualify in this respect. There would be certain technical problems for us relating to the machinery for the controlof movement but the contrast between on the one hand the systemof control in the member countries of the e.c., based primarily on internal controls, and on the other hand our own system, basedprimarily on the control of immigration at the point of entry, was notin practice as clear cut as this difference of principle might suggest.Moreover our own system might well in any event have to be modified as a result of the consideration which was currently being given to theright of appeal against a refusal to admit entry and modificationsmade for this purpose would be likely to make our system morecompatible with that in the e.c.. Admittedly there was the difficultyof principle that entry into the e.c. would involve giving priority for immigration to nationals of member countries of the e.c. overthe nationals of Commonwealth countries but.an practice moreEuropean nationals than Commonwealth nationals were alreadyadmitted to the United Kingdom under our existing system. the major difference was that a large proportion of the latter wished tosettle in this country, whereas by far the greater part of theEuropean nationals came for temporary employment and returnedhome on its conclusion. It would moreover still be open tous to give nationals of Commonwealth countries priority forimmigration over the nationals of foreign countries other than themembers of the e.c.. The regulations within the e.c. relating to the admission of dependants were somewhat more favourable than ourown regulations restricting the admission of the depandants of commonwealth immigrants and it might well be necessary to bringthe latter into line with the former. However the present high rateof admission of dependants was primarily due to the entry of the largenumber of dependants still outstanding of immigrants admitted before
the institution of our present immigration controls and might beexpected to diminish sharply fairly soon. It might well prove possibletherefore to bring our practice in respect of our Commonwealthdependants into line with that of the e.c. without this resulting in anysubstantial increase in the admission of Commonwealth dependants.In discussion the following main points were made-(/&apos;) It was argued that the acceptance of the provisions of theTreaty of Rome relating to the mobility of labour would result in a major change of principle in our present immigration policy whichwould be highly embarrassing to the Government, since the priority for immigration which would be given to nationals of the eec countries over Commonwealth nationals was contrary to theGovernment&apos;s present declared policy of giving preference to commonwealth nationals. Furthermore we should then be facedwith a problem either of giving European nationals priority even overthe nationals of the Old Commonwealth countries, which would createpolitical difficulties both in the latter and in the United Kingdom,or else of differentiating between nationals of the Old commonwealth countries and those from the New Commonwealth countries, sointroducing the principle of colour differentiation into our immigration policy. On the other hand it was pointed out that, while the latterdifficulty would admittedly remain, the basic change of policy asbetween nationals of e.c. countries on the one hand and commonwealth nationals on the other was more apparent than realin view of the existing pattern of immigration to which the HomeSecretary had referred. Moreover not only did it seem probable thatthe change might lead to some improvement in the rules regardingthe admission of dependants of Commonwealth immigrants but alsothe latter would, it appeared, obtain the right of entry into the other member countries of the e.c.. While such a right would not extend to Commonwealth immigrants into the United Kingdom who were notcitizens of the United Kingdom, it was in practice relatively easy for those who were not already United Kingdom citizens to be naturalisedafter five years&apos; stay in this country. Entry into the e.c. might welltherefore be advantageous to Commonwealth immigrants who hadsettled in this country, some of whom might well be attracted byemployment in Europe. It also appeared that the right of entry into member countries of the e.c. would be conferred upon UnitedKingdom nationals at present resident elsewhere in theCommonwealth, such as the large number of Asian United kingdom nationals resident in East African countries. This aspect should befurther investigated.(k) The Trades Union Congress (TUC) were concerned at thepossibility of an influx of European labour. It appeared that anentry permit to take up employment could not be denied withoutreasonable cause to nationals of other e.c. countries and, althoughmember states might give priority to home nationals for a period oftwo weeks in any occupation or region where there was a considerablesurplus of labour, this did not apply to foreign workers who had beenemployed within the country in question for a minimum of one year:and the next Regulation under the Treaty might provide for the
unrestricted right of entry. Furthermore the fact that a supplementary benefit was under present United Kingdom legislation more freelyavailable than comparable assistance within the e.c. might well attractan additional influx of foreign labour. On the other hand it waspointed out that the anxieties expressed by the TUC were now much less acute than those which they had previously expressed: indeed it did not appear that there was now really serious concern on this aspect. Furthermore there was no surplus of labour now availablewithin the e.c. and, apart from the extent of the availability ofsupplementary benefit, the current level of social benefits in the EECwas in general higher than that available in the United Kingdom. Itmight prove necessary to amend our own practice regarding the availability of supplementary benefit for immigrant workers, but thisshould not present a serious problem and it did not appear likely thatthere would be difficulties in respect of the admission of foreign workers which could not adequately be dealt with by the negotiation of transitional provisions. It would however be of advantage tocarry out a fuller study of the current position in one of the moreprosperous members of the e.c. regarding the problems arising fromthe admission of foreign workers and the way in which these werehandled and to consider further the machinery which would berequired in the United Kingdom for the control of admission and movement. Such an enquiry should elucidate the extent to which under the Treaty of Rome and Regulations made under it it wouldbe open to the Government to deport foreign immigrants.The Cabinet (2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for a reportto be made by officials on the experience of the mobility of labour under the provisions of the Treaty of Romeof a member of the e.c. where conditions were broadlycomparable with those in the United Kingdom, on themachinery for the control of immigration and movementwhich would be required in the United Kingdom, on thepossibility that the e.c. would accord unrestrictedfreedom of movement within the Community to EECnationals, on the extent (if any) to which the UnitedKingdom would have the right to deport e.c. nationalsand on the implications for the right of entry into other member countries of the e.c. of United kingdom nationals of Commonwealth origin, including those nowresident in other countries of the Commonwealth.Legal and constitutional implicationsThe Prime Minister recalled that, in discussion the previousautumn of the possibility of the United Kingdom seeking to join the eec, the Cabinet had considered a report on the legal and constitutional implications which had been circulated to the ministerial Committee on Europe as E (66) 7 and had also been circulated to all members of the Cabinet. This report had been reviewed to ensure that it still represented an up-to-date survey of
the problem in so far as information was available from UnitedKingdom official sources and no change had been made in it.The Lord Chancellor said that the wide range of issues dealtwith in the report were summarised in paragraph 85. The major political aspects related to the extent to which our entry into the EECwould involve a loss of sovereignty. Some loss would admittedly be involved but this was true in respect of every international treaty which we ratified and which subsequently restricted our freedom ofnational action and the issue was therefore one of degree, not ofprinciple. Entry to the e.c. would of course involve much important new legislation; and some aspects of the problems which would arise from our entry had not yet been resolved and would require further review at such stage as the Government felt free to take the opinionof judges, lawyers or organisations outside Government circles. Inparticular, it was yet uncertain whether acceptance of the Treaty of rome implied the right subsequently to withdraw. One further issue which was not considered in the report, and of which the cabinet should be aware, was the extent to which the Government were notat present fully equipped, legally speaking, to enter the e.c.. Suchentry would involve numerous and far-reaching legal problems andthe legal members of the Civil Service were already insufficient in number to fill present establishments and to meet the Governmenfscurrent requirements. Admittedly it would on entry be open to theGovernment to seek legal assistance outside Government circles, butit would be important and urgent that adequate legal staff should be recruited at the earliest possible moment. Other legal problems would also have to be met, such as the need for authorised Englishtexts of e.c. legislation.In discussion it was argued that there was a difference of principle in the extent of the restriction on our sovereignty imposed by entry into the e.c. on the one hand and the signing of other internationaltreaties on the other hand. The latter clearly specified the extentto which our subsequent freedom of national action was restricted by signature of the treaty and this restriction was not thereafterincreased except by an amending treaty. If we were to become amember of the e.c. however there would be a progressive limitationof our national sovereignty through the legislation which theCommunity was empowered to pass and we should, therefore, not know at the time of entry how extensive the restrictions on oursovereignty would subsequently prove to be. Furthermore, there wasno national representation on the European Economic Commission,which itself had the power to legislate. It was, however, pointed outthat the Commission itself was effectively subject to the power ofthe member Governments of the e.c.. As regards the power of thelatter to legislate, present practice provided for unanimity in votingand we need not, therefore, be concerned that our entry into theCommunity would result in subsequent restriction of our nationalsovereignty except with our agreement. It might well prove to be inour interest, however, later to accept that decisions of the community should be taken by majority vote since we could be confident of sufficient support under a system of majority voting to be able to resist legislation which we judged to be contrary to our national
CC20(67)interest, once not only we but some of our present partners in EFTAhad become full members of the e.c..The following main points were also made (/) In addition to the problems of substance arising from theextent to which we might accept the Common Agricultural Policy,entry into the Community would involve the extensive amendment ofour present system of agricultural legislation, with consequent legal and practical problems.(m) It seemed probable that the development by the community of a common transport policy might be on lines which would be contrary to those which the Government were currently considering.The Community policy was likely to be based on a system of rigidcontrols and restrictive quotas for motor transport, whereas our own policy was moving towards a much more flexible system of controlbased on qualitative rather than quantitative regulation. On theother hand it was argued that definitive Regulations and decisions togive effect to a common transport policy had not yet been made;that, provided we observed any quotas we might negotiate for ourselves as an island, we might seek to do so by qualitative means;and that the barrier posed by the Channel to the free movement of motor transport from the United Kingdom, as compared with thegeographically unfettered freedom of movement of road transportwithin the member countries of the e.c., put us in a substantiallydifferent position from the present member countries. It would beopen to us, particularly in the light of this factor, to negotiate onentry an adequate national quota which it should then be open to usto enforce by qualitative rather than quantitative regulations.The Cabinet (3) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting.secret the Third 3.   The Cabinet considered a note by the President of theLondon Airport Board of Trade and the Minister of Housing and Local GovernmentDraft White     (c (6?) 5Q) tQ which wag annexed a draft White Paper on the provisionPaper 0     ....      ,of a third London airport.The President of the Board of Trade said that a decision was nowneeded urgently on the site of a third London airport. With the expected increase in traffic, it was estimated that the combinedcapacity of Heathrow and Gatwick airports would be fully used bythe mid-1970s and possibly earlier. The French were seeking toestablish Paris rather than London as the leading centre for european air travel and they might succeed if an early start on a third airport were not made. The proportion of the increased traffic which would need to be brought to the London area made it inescapablethat the third airport should be sited in the South East, thoughconsideration would soon need to be given to the provision of a fourthmajor airport and it would be important to ensure that this was sitedoutside the South East. The previous Administration had published
SECRET.the report of an Interdepartmental Committee in 1964 and hadendorsed its conclusion that the third airport should be sited at stansted. The report of a public inquiry into this proposal in May1966 did not give a firm recommendation either for or againstStansted, but recommended that a further review of the whole problem should be undertaken. It would however serve no useful purpose to set up further public inquiries into particular alternativesites, since local opposition could in each case be expected to produce a negative result. The Departments concerned had carried out a full examination of the alternatives, but had concluded that Stanstedpresented the fewest disadvantages. The best of the alternatives froma civil point of view would be a site in the area of Silverstone, midwaybetween London and Birmingham; but the construction of a majorairport on this site would involve the closure of eight military airfields in the Midlands and the cost of their replacement elsewhere would beof the order of  100 million. The Minister of Housing and he were satisfied, after searching inquiries, that this result could not be avoidedand that any conceivable future changes in defence requirements would not alter the position. The other suggested sites all presenteddifficulties on grounds of cost or for other reasons. The Governmentshould therefore announce a decision to site the third airport at stansted and should publish a White Paper in terms of the draft annexed to C (67) 50 explaining their reasons.The Minister of State, Ministry of Housing and LocalGovernment said there was an urgent need to announce a decision onthe site, since important developments in regional planning, includingthe New Towns programme, were being delayed because of the uncertainty.In discussion, considerable doubts were expressed about the urgency of providing a third airport. A new airport could be built in three to five years, and it seemed likely that a longer period than this would elapse before the combined capacity of Heathrow andGatwick was fully used. The previous Administration had givencertain assurances that Gatwick would not be expanded into a majorairport; it was not clear whether these assurances were still inhibitingplans for its development. It appeared that Gatwick was at present working to only some 50 per cent of its capacity. In particular, it seemed possible that an extension of the existing runway and provision of a second runway might enable Gatwick to absorb for aconsiderable period traffic which Heathrow could not take and thatthe provision of a third airport could accordingly be deferred.Construction of a new airport would make considerable demands oneconomic resources and public expenditure; and it was not evidentthat an early start on the project would be in accordance with reasonable economic priorities in the immediate future.Doubts were also expressed whether Stansted was the rightchoice. An airport on that site would create a considerable problemof noise and would involve an extensive loss of good agricultural land. The possibilities of developing a major airport at Luton werenot dealt with in the draft White Paper. There were serious objectionsto creating a third major airport which would be land-locked: many
itSECRET -    15 xof the major capitals abroad had their principal airports flanked on one side by water, thus reducing the nuisance from noise. Furtherconsideration should therefore be given to a site near the thames estuary where this problem would be minimal. The objection hadbeen made to a site in that area that it would be too close to existingairports, but there were examples, for instance in the United States,of major airports operating successfully at a distance from each other of as little as eight miles.On the other hand, it was argued that, while it might be possibleto defer the start of work on a third airport, the choice of site shouldbe announced without delay so that regional planning would not beheld up. Because of the physical limitations of the Gatwick site, itwas improbable that even with the maximum possible extension of facilities it would be able to absorb the growing excess of traffic fromHeathrow to an extent which would justify deferment of the thirdairport beyond the time envisaged in the draft White Paper. Theview of the British Airports Authority and of the major airlines wasthat work on a third airport should be started without delay if theprobable increase in traffic were to be successfully absorbed.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were not satisfied on the evidence before them that the case had been made out for an early start on the construction of a third london airport or that Stansted was the best site. The President ofthe Board of Trade and the Minister of Housing should consider further the doubts which had been expressed in discussion and should circulate a further memorandum to the Cabinet in due course givingtheir views on them.The Cabinet Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to circulate a further memorandum in the light of their discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th April, 1967.
