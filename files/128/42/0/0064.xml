ParliamentLegislativeProgramme,1967-68(previous reference:CC (67) 39thConclusions,Minute 5)CC 64 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that the progress of the Governmenfslegislative programme for the new Session was being endangeredbecause Bills which Ministers had undertaken to have ready for introduction early in the Session were not yet available. Severalmajor Bills which should receive Second Reading before Christmaswould not in fact do so, and the Transport Bill could be availablein time Only if he could arrange for an extra draftsman to work on it at the cost of delaying some other Bill required after Christmas.The result of failure to bring major Bills forward early was that time available for legislation at the beginning of the Session was in effectbeing wasted. As a consequence it would be necessary either to prolong Parliamentary sittings into August, or to bring the Houseback earlier than would otherwise be necessary in October. If neither of these were acceptable, some Bills would have to be dropped fromthe programme. The delays appeared to arise largely because themain policy decisions were not taken early enough and subsidiaryquestions of policy were not resolved quickly thereafter.The Prime Minister said that the situation disclosed by the lord president was serious, particularly in view of his own request earlier in the year that Ministers should make themselves personallyresponsible for seeing that adequate time was allowed at all stagesfor the preparation of Bills. It would be unreasonable to ask parliament to sit longer in the summer because the Government hadbeen unable to have their Bills ready in time, and in future it mightbe necessary to stipulate that if Bills were not ready when they were required they would have to be dropped. The Future legislation committee should review the current programme and decide whether any Bills would need to be deferred until a later Session, and, if so,which.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the statements by the Lord President and thePrime Minister.(2) Invited the Lord President to arrange for the future legislation Committee to review the legislative programme and to decide whether any Bills would need to be deferred to a later Session, and, if so, which.OverseaAffairsMiddle East(previous reference:CC (67) 63rdConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that two alternative draft resolutions on the Arab/Israel conflict had been tabled in theSecurity Council. One was a United States draft which we and israel could accept but to which the Arab States were opposed; andthe other an Indian draft which we and the Arab States could acceptbut which was not acceptable to Israel and the United States.Neither draft looked like commanding a majority. He was discussing
South Arabia(previous reference:CC(67) 62ndConclusions,Minute 2)Vietnam(previous reference:CC (67) 57thConclusions,Minute 2)Greece(previous reference:CC (67) 30thConclusions,Minute 2)Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (67) 61stConclusions,Minute 3)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3)with the United Kingdom Representative at the United Nations,Lord Caradon, what attitude we should take in the face of thisdeadlock. One possibility was that we might table a resolutionourselves.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The Foreign Secretary said that the National Liberation Front(NLF) had publicly announced on 8th November that we mustformally recognise it as the sole representative of the South Arabianpeople before negotiations on the transfer of power in South Arabiacould begin. The High Commissioner, Sir Humphrey Trevelyan,favoured such recognition. But if we were the first to recognise theNLF in this way, we might be accused by other Arab States, suchas Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, of preventing the formation of abroad-based Government, and we could not be sure of a satisfactory response from the NLF. Meanwhile our withdrawal was proceedingaccording to plan. The most probable date for final withdrawal was22nd November, but if negotiations could be started with the NLF,it might be postponed until 30th November.In discussion the point was made that it was important not tomiss any chance there might be of negotiating with the NLF; butthat an early decision was necessary if our final withdrawal was tobe postponed until 30th November.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and thepoint made in discussion.The Cabinet (3) Agreed  to take an early opportunity  to  review the government&apos;s policy in regard to Vietnam and Greece.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that on 8th November the Commonwealth Secretary had had four hours&apos;discussion in Salisbury with Mr. Ian Smith about a possiblesettlement. They had not reached deadlock, but although Mr. smith had clarified his position on a number of points in regard to theproposed Constitution, he seemed to be going back on several aspectson the settlement provisionally agreed on HMS Tiger in December1966. The talks were continuing that day with officials present.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that at a press conference in London on 7th November representatives of theEastern Region had called on the Commonwealth Secretariat to initiate talks between the Federal Government and the EasternRegion.  Their object seemed to be either to destroy the chance of
talks taking place or to bring pressure on the Federal Governmentto compromise. Nevertheless the Commonwealth Secretariat were still trying to find a basis for the two sides to meet.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said thatthere had recently been two meetings, both on the Chinese side ofthe frontier, between the Hong Kong authorities and Chinese frontierofficials. Provisional agreement had been reached on the return ofthe Inspector of the Hong Kong Police who had been abducted bythe Chinese in October. But the Chinese had then raised furtherunspecified points. It was now hoped to resume the talks.The Cabinet-(4) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State for commonwealth Affairs.confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Presidentof the Board of Trade and the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment about the third London airport (C (67) 173).The President of the Board of Trade said that since the cabinet had approved the choice of Stansted there had been a number of developments which made it desirable for them to reconsider thematter. It had been discovered that realignment of the runways at stansted would greatly diminish the disadvantages of the site; recentcost/benefit studies had suggested a possible alternative site; and itwas apparent that there would be strong opposition to Stansted inthe House of Lords. Of the alternatives set out in the memorandum the practical choice lay between postponing the laying of the SpecialDevelopment Order (SDO) for upwards of two months in order toconsider the realignment of the runways at Stansted, and a fullindependent public inquiry into the best site for the third london airport. The other possibilities mentioned a further inter-departmental inquiry with or without publication of its findings, andan independent inquiry limited to sites in the Stansted area had noattraction.He suggested that the case for a full independent inquiry wasthat, despite many years of investigation, new facts affecting the issuehad recently come to light which cast serious doubts on thethoroughness of previous investigations. If the Government wereto announce that they had now discovered since the debate in theHouse of Commons in June-that a realignment of the runways at stansted would markedly improve the site, this would simplyreinforce existing anxieties and doubts on the part of a powerfulbody of informed public opinion quite independent of the Stanstedlobby about the thoroughness of the Governmenfs examinationof the whole matter. The siting of the airport was a crucial decisionaffecting a great many people and a wide area of country for manyyears ahead, and there would be a favourable public reaction to theCC 64(67)
announcement of an inquiry to meet the legitimate doubts whichhad been so widely expressed. The main case against the inquiry,apart from the charge of Government vacillation which could be satisfactorily answered, appeared to be the cost involved in delay.However, if the independent inquiry found in favour of Stanstedthe airport would be ready when it was needed. It was only if anothersite was preferred that there would be delay. An inquiry lasting18 months followed by six years for construction would brin(g thethird airport into operation in mid-1975 and the costs of delay wouldin that event be insignificant. If pn the other hand inquiry and construction together took 9\ years, i.e., to mid-1977, the cost of delay would be  10 million. A reasonable estimate might be thatan airport on an alternative site, recommended by the inquiry, wouldbe operational by mid-1976, in which event the cost of delay wouldbe  2 million. He thought it would be generally agreed that 2 million would be a reasonable price for finding the right site andfor satisfying public opinion that the right site had been found. he therefore favoured an immediate announcement to the House ofCommons that a small independent committee, consisting of perhapsthree or four persons, would be established forthwith to advise onthe siting of the third airport.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that although, as Minister responsible for planning, he had never likedthe choice of Stansted, he. had been persuaded after thorough and prolonged examination that there was no practical alternative. the issues involved had been considered by Ministers collectively on anumber of occasions and the Government had firmly announced its decision in favour of Stansted both in a White Paper (Cmnd. 3259,May 1967) and in the debate in the House of Commons on 29th June,1967. Since then cost/benefit studies had reaffirmed that Stanstedwas the best site and that realignment of its runways would make iteven better than they had thought in June. The alternative siteproposed at Nuthampstead was no better than Stansted with runwaysrealigned. Although the South-East &quot;Economic Planning council had not been consulted, and had been opposed to the decision, theirchairman had now publicly recognised that the decision must be implemented, and without delay. The East Anglian economic planning Council favoured the choice of Stansted as did a significantnumber of the local inhabitants. A good deal of the opposition had come from quarters influenced by special interests and he didnot think that there was now widespread opposition amongwell-informed, independent public opinion. There was no reasonto suppose that further enquiry would produce a better site thanStansted and it was important that the Government should notappear at this stage to vacillate: vacillation on this issue would leadto increasing pressures on the Government to reverse their stand on other, even more important, questions. Finally the Governmentwould be able to take credit for the realignment of the runways at stansted, which would be evidence of the attention they had paidto the views of the critics, particularly the local authorities and other organisations whom they had undertaken in the White Paper to
CONFIDENTIALconsult. He therefore favoured delaying the SDO to give time toconsider runway realignment at Stansted.In discussion the following principal points were made:(a) There had been a large number of investigations over theyears and all of them had come down in favour of Stansted. Thelatest interdepartmental cost /benefit study showed that allowing for possible margins of error Stansted had a significant advantage over its nearest competitor. On the other hand, Ministers had beeninformed in the summer that the matter had been so exhaustivelystudied that nothing new would be elicited by further studies. Butit now transpired that no cost/benefit analysis had in fact been made until after the Governments decision had been announced, and two new possibilities Nuthampstead and the realignment of the runwaysat Stansted-had now come to light following a necessarily hurriedanalysis. It was not possible to be sure in these circumstances that even now all the relevant facts were available to Ministers.(b) It seemed that, unless Stansted were chosen, the minimumdelay caused by an inquiry would be some nine years if anon-estuarial site resulted; and perhaps 11 years for an estuarialsite. Table 5 of Appendix C to the memorandum showed thediscounted costs of delay. But the actual costs incurred by delayif the airport were not operational until mid-1977 or mid-1978 were 18 million and  44 million respectively,(c) There was strong opposition in the House of Lords to the choice of Stansted and it would be helpful if the Government felt able to take account of this by instituting an inquiry, particularlyin view of the possible repercussions of conflict over Stansted in thenegotiations on reform of the House of Lords. However, in thelatter connection, the delay in bringing the SDO before parliament which would result from a decision to examine realignment of theStansted runways might be of some help.(d) The main case for an inquiry now was that it would meetpressures for further public examination of the issues involved andfor more published information about them. Moreover, theGovernment would be ill-advised to press on with a decision, which seemed at the least a doubtful one, simply in order to avoid any suggestion of vacillation. On the other hand if an inquiryrecommended a site on the London/Birmingham axis or near theShoeburyness gunnery range, the Government would then be facedwith equally difficult and time-consuming problems of re-sitingexisting military airfields and the gunnery range. The delays whichwould be involved in reopening the question had probably been seriously under-estimated. The publication of a refined version ofthe latest cost/benefit analysis would go some way to meet the public demand for more information. No one was seriously expecting theGovernment to change the decision.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas broad agreement that the balance Of the argument pointedagainst a public inquiry and in favour of considering the realignment
of the runways at Stansted. The President of the Board of Trade,together with the other Ministers concerned, should considerwhether a refined version of the cost/benefit analysis might be madeavailable in some form to interested parties. Meanwhile, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Housing andLocal Government should decide, in consultation with the lord president, whether a statement about the third London airport shouldbe made that day to the House of Commons, and if so what form itshould take.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the realignment of the Stansted runways shouldbe considered.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government, in consultation withthe other Ministers concerned, to arrange for therealignment of the runways to be examined; and meanwhile to postpone laying the Special DevelopmentOrder before Parliament.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to consider, withthe other Ministers concerned, whether a refined version of the latest cost/benefit study might be made availableto interested persons outside the Government.(4) Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Housing and Local Government to consider, inconsultation with the Lord President, whether a statement about the third London airport should be made that day to the House of Commons, and if so in what terms.IndustrialPolicyIndustrialExpansionBill: draft white Paper(previous reference:CC(67) 61stConclusions,Minute 6)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Economic Affairs (C (67) 175) to which was attached areport by officials on outstanding policy issues relating to theIndustrial Expansion Bill, and a draft White Paper on industrial expansion.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs recalled that at their discussion on 26th October, 1967, the Cabinet had invited him toconsider further with the Ministers concerned the outstanding policy issues on the Industrial Expansion Bill. The report by officialsannexed to his memorandum incorporated the conclusions reached on these issues at a meeting which he had held with his colleagues,and made recommendations on certain other points on which it had seemed desirable to have further study and legal advice.The report recommended that the composition of the proposedAdvisory Committee to evaluate projects promoted under the Billshould not be confined to members of the Industrial reorganisation corporation (1958-59) and the National Research and Development
Corporation (NRDC). It was desirable that the Advisory Committeeshould be serviced mainly by these bodies instead of establishing new machinery for which there might not be an even flow of work; itwas also important to associate the 1958-59 with the Advisory Committeesince there would be a close relation between the normal functionsof the 1958-59 and action taken under the Bill. But the composition ofthe Advisory Committee should be such as to reassure industry thatthe financial and technical appraisal of projects would be competentand thorough, and from this point of view it would be undesirable to restrict its composition to members of the 1958-59 and NRDC. Itwas recommended that reference of projects to the AdvisoryCommittee should not be mandatory.It was proposed that the powers under the Bill should be availablenot only to finance individual projects but also to enable a minister by Order under the Bill to set up a Board to advise on and perhapssupervise a series of related projects to be undertaken within a singleindustry. Such Industry Boards should be set up only where therewas a continuing industry-wide operation to be carried throughcomparable with the action now being taken in shipbuilding by the shipbuilding Industry Board. It was further proposed that boards should be. set up only after there had been a preliminary inquiry intothe industry concerned. The Boards should not have spending powerof their own and their proposals for expenditure would be subjectto approval, within the limits of a general Order, by the minister concerned. A reference to Industry Boards should be included inthe White Paper.As regards the scope of the Bill, the report recommended that itshould provide for support of eligible projects in any industry(including transport, distribution and other services) in the private sector. On the question whether the powers should extend toassisting projects in the public sector, it could be argued that, if thepublic sector were to be covered by the Bill, this would intensify theopposition to the Governmenfs proposals as a whole. On the otherhand, it would be politically difficult to defend the exclusion of the nationalised industries. There was a case for a compromise whereby the main activities of the nationalised industries would be excluded,since they were governed by existing legislative provisions and bythe policy set out in the recent White Paper on the Economic andFinancial Objectives of the Nationalised Industries (Cmnd. 3437 of1967); but the subsidiary manufacturing activities of the industries would be included and would thus be treated in the same way as private industry, as they already were for a number of other purposes,such as payment of investment grants.The report further recommended that the Bill should provide in a separate clause the necessary authority for Government assistanceto the Cunard Company; this would avoid expending parliamentary time on separate legislation. The Bill should also provide in aseparate clause the authority needed for financing the production costs of the Concord aircraft; there should be a limit of  100 million
with provision to increase the amount by Order by  25 million. TheBill should also incorporate a financial limit on expenditure generally,excluding the provision for assistance to Cunard and for theproduction costs of Concord; and the limit here should be 100 million with provision for an increase by Order by  50 million,either once (to  150 million), or twice (to  200 million); he himselffavoured the latter.The Cabinet considered in turn the recommendations in thereport by officials.Advisory CommitteeIn discussion there was general agreement with therecommendations of the report, subject to the modification, proposedby the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs in his covering memorandum, of the reference in the last sentence of paragraph 4 tothe role of the Advisory Committee in advising on the extent to whichprojects involved discrimination between competing firms.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the. composition of the proposed AdvisoryCommittee should not be confined to members of theIRC and NRDC and that reference of projects to theCommittee should not be mandatory.Industry BoardsIt was suggested that for the Government to take power toestablish Boards on the lines proposed would increase the suspicionwith which industry already regarded the Governmenfs plans. Onthe other hand, this method of proceeding might have advantagesfor a number of industries, and it was possible that industry wouldbe less apprehensive about industry-wide projects if they wereadministered through Industry Boards than if they were administereddirect by the Minister concerned. There was general agreement thatBoards should only be set up after a preliminary inquiry into theindustry concerned, though the inquiry need not necessarily take theform of an independent committee on the lines of the geddes committee for shipbuilding; it would be acceptable to establish aBoard following other forms of inquiry, for example a report by theEconomic Development Committee of the industry concerned.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the Industrial Expansion Bill should include provision for the setting up of Industry Boards asproposed in paragraph 7 of the report by officialsannexed to C (67) 175.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, inconsultation with the Minister of Technology, to incorporate a reference to Industry Boards in the white paper on Industrial Expansion, reflecting as appropriatethe points made in their discussion.
Scope of the BillThere was general agreement that the Bill should cover industriesgenerally in the private sector, including transport, distribution andother services, but excluding shipbuilding which was already coveredby recent legislation. It was argued that power should also be takento assist projects in the nationalised industries since it might fromtime to time be desirable for these industries to undertake projects which, though justified in the national interest, would not be consistent with their financial obligations. On the other hand, itwas argued that to include the nationalised industries would confusethe main purpose of the Bill, which was to help the private sector,and would increase hostility towards the Governmenfs proposals.An attempt to distinguish in the Bill between the main and ancillaryactivities of the nationalised industries would lead to great difficulties.The powers available under existing legislation were sufficient toensure that the nationalised industries could undertake any projects which it was desirable they should undertake in the national interest,though in considering projects which did not come within their mainactivities it would be important to have regard to the need for theavailable managerial capacity in the industries to concentrate ontheir main functions. Where the nationalised industries undertookprojects jointly with private interests, such projects would in anycase be eligible for assistance under the Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said the Cabinet agreed on balance that the nationalised industries should be completely excluded from the Bill.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the Industrial Expansion Bill should cover all industries in the private sector (including serviceindustries), except for shipbuilding.    &apos;(5) Agreed that the nationalised industries should be excludedfrom the Industrial Expansion Bill.CunardIt was suggested that it would be undesirable to provide in theBill for Government assistance to Cunard, since this was a rescueoperation of a kind quite foreign to the main objects of the Bill, andto provide for it in the Bill would tend to substantiate fears that theBill would be used to support projects which were not viable. Onthe other hand, it was the general view that it was desirable to avoid the loss of Parliamentary time which would be entailed if separate legislation on Cunard had to be introduced, and that the inclusionof provisions relating to Cunard should be defended on the grounds that it was reasonable to use the Bill in this instance as a vehicle for implementing a past commitment.
The Cabinet-(6) Agreed that provision for assistance by the Government tothe Cunard Company should be included in a separateclause in the Industrial Expansion Bill.Aircraft projectsThe Cabinet-(7) Agreed that authority for financing the production costs of concord should be provided in a separate clause of theIndustrial Expansion Bill, with a financial limit for expenditure on Concord alone of  100 million with provision to increase it by Order by  25 million.Financial limits the Cabinet (8) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs toconsider further with the Minister of Technology andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, the limit to be incorporated in the Industrial Expansion Bill on expenditure under theBill, other than expenditure on assistance to Cunard andon the production costs of Concord.The Cabinet then considered the draft White Paper annexed toC (67) 175. There was general agreement with the substance of thedraft, subject to the amendments and additions which would benecessary following the Cabinets decisions on the outstanding policy issues. It was noted that the Ministers mainly concerned would wish to propose a number of drafting amendments.There was general agreement that it would be desirable to deferpublication of the White Paper until shortly before the publicationof the Bill itself. If the White Paper were published not more than about 10 days before the publication of the Bill, it would then bepossible to resist any pressure for a Parliamentary debate on theWhite Paper separately from debate on the Bill.The Cabinet- (9) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs (i) in consultation with the Lord President, the Presidentof the Board of Trade, the Minister of technology and the Chief Secretary, Treasury, to revise thedraft White Paper annexed to C (67) 175 in thelight of their discussion, incorporating any drafting amendments which seemed desirable, and to clear the relevant passages with the 1958-59 and NRDC as envisaged in his memorandum;(ii) in consultation with the Lord President and theMinister of Technology, to arrange for publicationof the White Paper, subject to revision as at (i)above, and to be guided as to the timing of publication by the relevant part of their discussion.
TransportPolicyThe Transportof Freight:Draft white paper(previous references:CC(67) 48thConclusions,Minute 2, and cc(67) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)EconomicSituationBank Rate(previous reference:CC(67) 28thConclusions,Minute 5)CC 64 (67)secret. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (C (67) 174) to which was annexed a draft White paper on the Transport of Freight.The Minister of Transport said that her proposals for theestablishment of a national freight organisation had been approvedby the former Ministerial Committee on Economic Policy and announced to Parliament earlier in the year. Her colleagues had also approved her proposals for revision of the road haulage carriers&apos;licensing system. These two sets of proposals formed the basis forthe White Paper on policies for freight transport which she proposed should be published in advance of the forthcoming Transport Bill.She hoped to lay the Bill before Parliament at the beginning ofDecember. The draft White Paper also included reference to thenew charges to be imposed on lorries in respect of abnormal loadsand wear and tear, in pursuance of the decision by the Cabinet on20th July, 1967, in the course of their review of public expenditure.In preliminary discussion, it emerged that a number of specificpolicy issues had not yet been satisfactorily resolved between departments. The Ministry of Agriculture wished to discuss further with the Ministry of Transport the possibility of fixing the limit for goods vehicles exempted from carrier licensing above the limit of30 cwt. unladen weight specified in paragraph 43 of the draft white paper. There were also points which had not been resolved relatingto the proposed charges on goods vehicles.The Prime Minister said that in the circumstances it would be preferable for the Cabinet to postpone consideration of the draft white Paper until their meeting on Tuesday, 14th November. TheMinisters concerned should ensure that the necessary consideration was given before then to the issues outstanding. The aim should beto publish the White Paper on Thursday, 16th November, but theCabinet would wish to take a final decision on this at their meetingon 14th November.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Ministers concerned to arrange for any outstanding policy issues affecting the draft White paper on Transport of Freight to be discussed with the Ministryof Transport before Tuesday, 14th November.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of the draft White paper on that date.secret . The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatBank Rate would be increased that day from 6 per cent to 6\ per cent.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,9th November, 1967.
