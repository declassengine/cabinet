parliament the Queen&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament(previous reference:CC (67) 60thConclusions,Minute 2)Debate onthe AddressCC 61 (67)confidential, The Cabinet discussed the final text of The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Cabinet considered arrangements for the Debate on the address.IndustrialDisputesDocks(previous reference:CC (67) 60thConclusions,Minute 2)confidential. The Minister of Labour informed the Cabinet that at ameeting on the previous day the dockers in Liverpool had refused toreturn to work. Mr. Jack Jones, the Assistant Executive Secretaryof the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union, had not been permitted to address the meeting, and the men had apparently been influenced by six dissident members of the unofficial strike committeewho advised them not to accept the settlement reached with theemployers on the previous Saturday. There was to be a further meeting the next day, and Mr. Jones was endeavouring both to secure unanimity in the strike committee and to inform the men,by advertising in a local newspaper, of the details of the agreementaccepted by the Union. If, at the next meeting, the men still refusedto return to work, it seemed probable that the strike would continue for some time.There was also a risk that the dock strike in London would be aggravated by an unwise decision of the employers to dismissunofficial strikers, and that sympathetic strikes might occur elsewhere.He had asked the employers&apos; organisation to discuss this at theMinistry of Labour on the following day.In discussion it was pointed out that the confusion in Liverpoolindicated that both the unions and the unofficial strike committeehad lost control of the men. There was reason to think that theCommunist Party was acting in concert with Trotskyist elements andthat there was increasing violence and intimidation. In view of theserious consequences of the strike for the economy, and of the riskof increasing unemployment, the Government should consideremploying troops at Liverpool if no decision to return to work were taken on the following day. Although the practical effect of theintroduction of troops would not be seen until they had becomeaccustomed to handling the dockside equipment, their presence might bring home to the men that a continuation of the strike would notprocure further concessions and hence result in a drift back to work.It would be useful to let it be known in Liverpool that both employersand the unions had been warned during the negotiations that if the
PrintingIndustry(previous reference:CC (65) 68thConclusions,Minute 7)unrest continued the Government might find it difficult to justify their decision to approve large development schemes for the docks.If it became necessary to proclaim a state of emergency before theOpening of Parliament it might be desirable to insert a reference tothe proclamation, in The Queen&apos;s Speech.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Home Secretary-(a) To  arrange for the  Emergencies  Committee toconsider, after . the strikers&apos; meeting on27th October, whether immediate arrangements should be made for the employment of troops in liverpool.(b) To report to the Prime Minister on whether a reference to the proclamation of a state ofemergency should be added to The Queen&apos;s speech on the Opening of Parliament.The Minister of Labour reported that there was a risk ofindustrial action by the printing unions in London if the employersdismissed men who were refusing to work overtime. The unrestwould be felt in the first instance by firms undertaking Governmentprinting, but there was a risk that the newspapers also would beaffected. He would continue to keep in touch with both sides, butthe outlook was not promising.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.OverseaAffairsApproachto Europe(previous reference:CC (67) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that he would be making astatement in the House of Commons that afternoon on our positionfollowing the consideration of our application for membership ofthe European Economic Community (e.c.) by the ministerial council of the e.c. in Luxembourg on 23rd/24th October. his statement would follow closely the lines of the Answer given by thePrime Minister in the House of Commons on Tuesday, 24th October.The Ministerial Council of the e.c. had adjourned furtherconsideration of our application until 20th November, and the main point of his statement would be to emphasise that we did not regard the objections to our application which had been raised by the french foreign Minister at the Luxembourg meeting as amounting in effectto a veto on our application.The Prime Minister said that pending the next meeting of the ministerial Council we would maintain pressure on our friends in theCommunity to support our application. It was of particular importance that, in so far as it was necessary for Ministers to referpublicly to the difficulties raised by the French in regard to our economic and financial position, they should follow closely the speech
Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (67) 60thConclusions,Minute 1)Nigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)Middle East(previous reference:CC(67) 58thConclusions,Minute 2)which, the Chancellor of the&apos; Exchequer would make at the lord mayor&apos;s Banquet for Merchants and Bankers of the City of london that night. This speech should therefore be circulated to all membersof the Cabinet. If consideration of our application by the e.c. wereunduly delayed, or a veto or some equivalent obstacle were imposed,we would need to consider how to protect our own interests in the interim, and how far we might make use of our national advantages in the technological field to maintain and develop support for our application. He had accordingly given instructions for officials to explore these possibilities urgently.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the statements of the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make availableto Ministers the text of his speech to the Lord Mayor&apos;sBanquet for Merchants and Bankers of the City ofLondon.The Foreign Secretary said that he had no reliable information about the conversations between the Prime Minister of South Africa,Mr. Vorster, and Mr. Ian Smith at their meeting in Pretoria on21st October. But there were grounds for thinking that the meeting had resulted from the talks which the South African Foreign Minister,Dr. Muller, had had with the Prime Minister and himself in Londonand that its purpose had been to impress on Mr. Smith the importanceof reaching a settlement.The Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs said that as aresult of an initiative by Mr. Arnold Smith, the Secretary-General ofthe Commonwealth Secretariat, talks were due to open in london on Monday, 30th October, between representatives of the federal government and of the Eastern Region under the auspices of the secretariat. The latter claimed that they would have full powers tonegotiate on the substance of the dispute as well as on procedure.The leaders of the Eastern Region seemed to be anxious to starttalks before the Region had been completely defeated. Even ifhostilities stopped immediately it would be several months beforeNigerian oil could begin to flow again. The oil terminal at Bonnywould probably need repair; the Bonny Channel would need to bedredged; and it would be necessary to check the oilfield installationswhich might have suffered from disuse even if they had not been damaged.The Cabinet (3) Took note of the statements by the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of State for Commonwealth Affairs.The Foreign Secretary said that attention in the United nations was now focused on the two recent breaches of the cease-fire the sinking of the Israeli destroyer Eilat by Egyptian missiles on21st October and the Israeli bombardment of Suez on 24th October.It was not certain whether, as alleged by the United Arab Republic
(UAR), the Eilat was within Egyptian territorial waters when it wasfired on; but in patrolling up and down the coast it had beenprovocative. There was little doubt that in the second incidentIsraeli forces had opened fire first. The Soviet Union was continuing to supply all arms except heavy bombers to the UAR. It was hard to believe that the Soviet Union were deliberately encouraging the uar to resume hostilities; but their support for the UAR gave addedurgency to the search for a solution in the United Nations. Therecent incidents had increased the difficulty of reaching agreement in the Security Council on a balanced resolution providing not only for Israeli withdrawal from occupied Arab territory but also for recognition by the Arab States of israels right to exist. The IsraeliForeign Minister, Mr. Eban, whom he had seen on 21st October,had said that Israel was still opposed to a resolution of this kind andwould prefer one confined to appointing a Special Representative ofthe Secretary-General of the United Nations to go to the Middle East.Israel appeared to hope that time would either oblige the presentGovernments in the UAR and Jordan to agree to direct negotiationsor bring about their replacement by more moderate regimes. Butit was more likely that successor regimes would be more extremist.There was still a good hope of securing a balanced resolution in theSecurity Council. We should be in a better position to influence theArab States to this end, and perhaps also to prevent further incidents,if we resumed relations with the UAR. As a result of Sir HaroldBeeley&apos;s recent visit to Cairo it was clear that the UAR were willingto resume relations. There were no obstacles in the way and the uar had discussed the matter with the other African States whichhad broken off relations with Us at the same time. Relations could probably be resumed early in December.In discussion the view was expressed that a resumption of relations between ourselves and the UAR might be misunderstoodby opinion in this country and elsewhere; and, especially if it tookplace when tension was rising, might be regarded as taking sides inthe dispute between Israel and the Arab States. The UAR had been responsible for breaking off relations with us. But now we were taking the initiative in seeking their resumption. Our interest wasto secure the reopening of the Suez Canal. A necessary conditionwas Israel&apos;s withdrawal from the banks of the Canal. It was opento question what effect our resumption of relations with the UARwould have on israels assessment of her own security andconsequently whether it would contribute towards reopening the canal. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the UAR had broken relations on account of Rhodesia and not of the Middle East,and their resumption could not therefore be regarded as taking sidesin the dispute between the Arab countries and Israel. The IsraeliForeign Minister had not reacted unfavourably to the proposal to resume relations although he feared it might strengthen the positionof President Nasser. It was a British interest that we should be ableto exert influence in the UAR and thus help towards the reopening of the Suez Canal and a Middle East settlement. The presentsituation was dangerously inflammable and israels behaviour was
NationalisedIndustriesEconomic andFinancialObjectives:Draft WhitePaperSECRET4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (67) 167) to which was attached a draft white paper on the Economic and Financial Objectives of the nationalised industries.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the draft white paper set out the principles which the nationalised industries were expected to adopt in settling their investment and pricing policies,and the purpose and method of operation of the system of financialtargets. The draft had been circulated to all Departments concerned as well as to the Confederation of British Industry (CBI), the TradesUnion Congress (TUC), and the chairmen of the boards of the nationalised industries. The draft now before the Cabinet had been revised to take account of the comments which had been received.In discussion the following points were made:(a) The TUC had suggested that more emphasis should beplaced on the contribution which the nationalised industries could make to the Governments economic strategy, for example in furthering the Governments regional policy. It would be helpful ifoften provocative. It was of urgent importance to make the firstmove towards a settlement. Israel did not want to keep her forces on the Canal and accepted the need for withdrawal, provided it didnot involve going back to the former armistice lines. It would benecessary to proceed by stages. The first step might be a balancedresolution in the United Nations which might lead in due course tothe withdrawal of Israeli forces, some act of recognition of Israel bythe Arab States and possibly a four-Power guarantee of any final settlement. There was no reason why work on clearing the Canalshould not proceed at the same time as action in the United Nations.There was no evidence to suggest that the resumption of diplomatic relations with the UAR would set back the reopening of the Canal.Our hand might be strengthened if it became clear that we were taking steps to make ourselves less dependent on the Canal.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement that our primary interest was to secure there opening of the Suez Canal and that our policy should be directed to that end. The Cabinet would wish to have an opportunity toconsider this question further before an announcement was made about the resumption of diplomatic relations with the UAR.Meanwhile it was important to discourage speculation about theattitude of the Government on the question.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and invited him to circulate at an appropriate time a memorandumon the resumption of diplomatic relations with the UAR.
the White Paper stated that, in so far as this was compatible withtheir other obligations, the nationalised industries would be encouraged to take account of the Governmenfs regional policies inmaking their purchasing and investment decisions. On the otherhand, it was urged that the White Paper was not concerned with the role of the nationalised industries in the national economy but withthe relatively limited issues of their economic and financial objectives,and accordingly it would be inappropriate to make more than a briefreference to regional policy in this White Paper.(b) The White Paper might refer to the need for the nationalised industries to draw up longer-term corporate plans of the kind whichwere commonly prepared in large, well-managed companies in private industry. On the other hand, it was argued that this was an area in which the nationalised industries in general were probably more advanced than private industry and no reference to this was called for.(c) The Steering Committee on Economic Policy had suggestedthat the presentation was not easy to follow and the intendedmessage was not brought out as clearly as it might be; and this criticism still seemed valid. The presentation would be considerably improved if paragraphs 37 to 40, which did set out the issues involvedvery clearly, were brought forward to the beginning of the white paper.(d) The section on prices referred to the need to avoidundesirable cross-subsidisation. British European Airways (BEA)found cross-subsidisation necessary, for example to maintain itsservices in Northern Scotland. It would be helpful if the draft couldindirectly cover the circumstances of BEA by amending the second sentence of paragraph 17 to read: &quot; The circumstances of different industries vary greatly; much depends on the competitiveenvironment in which they operate.&quot;(e) It was suggested that paragraph 26, which described thearrangements for formalising consultation with Ministers about theprices charged by nationalised industries, should be qualified to take account of the special position of the air transport corporations. the fares charged on international routes were determined by international agreement and the Air Transport Licensing Boarddetermined internal air fares. It was suggested that the first line ofparagraph 26 should therefore be amended to read as follows:&quot; Arrangements for consultation with Ministers on prices, wherethere is no statutory or international procedure,. . . &quot;. On the otherhand, while it was agreed that the international control of overseasair fares was an exceptional circumstance, the qualification relatingto statutory procedures for other products of nationalised industries,such as domestic air fares, should not be included.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consideramendments to meet the points made. He added that the TUC, incommenting on the draft White Paper, had asked to be consulted about the targets for the gas industry and the Post Office before theywere sent to the National Board for Prices in Incomes. In fixingtargets for the nationalised industries the Government needed to
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of power (C (67) 165) to which was attached a draft White Paper on fuel Policy.The Minister of Power said that the draft White Paper had been revised following discussion in the Steering Committee on economic policy on 18th October, 1967; in accordance with the suggestion made by that Committee he had also arranged for a popular version of the White Paper to be prepared. He had given furtherconsideration to the criticism, advanced in the Steering CommitteeFuel PolicyDraft WhitePaperconsider a great many issues, for example taxation. If the TUCexpected to be brought into full consideration of these matters itwould be extending the bounds of consultation beyond reasonable limits. Moreover, the TUC might well prefer not to be consulted about some targets, for example those based on assumed rates of manpower reduction. Accordingly he proposed to inform the TUCthat it was for the Government to fix the level of the targets for the nationalised industries.In discussion there was general agreement with this view, though no doubt the TUC might be informed of the targets for the gas industry and the Post Office at the same time as the National board for Prices and Incomes. If the TUC considered that any particulartarget was too high it would be open to them to seek to discuss thematter with the Minister concerned.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that therewas general agreement with the White Paper, and the Chancellorof the Exchequer had undertaken to consider the inclusion in thedraft of the points raised in discussion. The Chancellor of theExchequer should consult the Lord President about timing of thepublication of the White Paper, which should be considered inrelation to that of the White Papers on Fuel Policy and on theRailways. The way was now open for the National Board for prices and Incomes to be informed of the financial targets for the gas industry and for the Post Office.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Lord President, to amend the White Paper in the lightof the points made in discussion and to arrange for its publication.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to informthe National Board for Prices and Incomes, and theChancellor of the Exchequer to inform the Trades UnionCongress at the same time, of the financial targets whichthe Government had set the gas industry and the PostOffice.
on Economic Policy, that while there was very full supportingargument in respect of most of the issues discussed, this did notapply to the same extent in respect of oil because of the national security interests involved. He accordingly proposed the additionat the end of paragraph 5 of the draft of the following sentence:&quot; The calculations and argumentation are in many cases complexbut it has been felt desirable in this White Paper to provide as full information as possible in explanation of the Governmenfsconclusions, except where this would run counter to the national interest as on certain aspects of the security and cost of oil supplies.&quot;There was general agreement with the addition proposed by theMinister of Power. The following further points were made in discussion:(a) The White Paper contained a large number of detailedforecasts of the future pattern of demand and while this greatlyincreased its usefulness it correspondingly gave hostages to fortune;it was for consideration whether the warning in paragraph 6 of thedraft, that some forecasts would prove wrong, was entirely adequatein the circumstances. It was the general view that the White Paperneed not be amended to deal with this, but that the Minister of power should underline this warning both in presenting the White Paper tothe House of Commons and in his subsequent Press conference.(b) It was not wise to give an assurance- even in the qualifiedform which it took in the sentence at the bottom of page 38 that the oil tax would not be increased. The Minister of Power undertook toconsider whether to delete entirely the last complete sentence onpage 38 or whether it would be better to replace it by a sentence tothe effect that no reasonable increase in the oil tax would reduce theconsumption of oil.(c) Paragraph 107 as at present drafted appeared to contradictparagraph 39, which stated that oil was gaining markets at the expenseof coal despite the oil tax. This point might be met by substituting&quot; there is the protection afforded by the 2s. 2d. a gallon ...&quot; for&quot; coal is helped by the 2s. 2d. a gallon . . &quot; in the second sentence of paragraph 107.(d) In the third sentence of paragraph 123 Cumberland shouldbe included among the development areas listed; and in the sixthline of paragraph 125 &quot; and Cumberland &quot; should be added after&quot; Scotland &quot;.(e) The fuel industries were very large purchasers of goods and services from other industries and they should therefore be encouraged to place their contracts so far as possible, and consistent with their commercial obligations, with companies situated in thedevelopment areas. The White Paper should make clear that theGovernment expected the fuel industries to pursue procurementpolicies consistent with the Governmenfs regional policies.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theMinister of Power, in consultation with the Secretary of State for economic Affairs, should insert in the White Paper a section to cover the point at (e) above and make the amendments necessary to meet
IndustrialPolicyIndustrialExpansion&apos;Bill: draft white Paper(previous reference:CC (67) 59thConclusions,Minute 2)secret . The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 168) on the Industrial ExpansionBill, to which was annexed a draft White Paper on industrial expansion.The Secretary of State for Economic Affairs recalled that at their meeting on 12th October the Cabinet had invited him, in consultationwith the Ministers mainly concerned, to consider a number of outstanding policy questions on the Industrial Expansion Bill and to circulate a draft of the White Paper on Industrial Expansion revised in the light of the Cabinefs previous discussion. The draft white paper annexed to his memorandum took account of the points madeby the Cabinet. As regards the outstanding policy issues, theMinisters concerned had agreed that the proposal to setup a select Committee to examine schemes promoted under the Billshould be abandoned: prior references to a Select Committee wouldinvolve unacceptable delays, and references made after a projecthad been otherwise agreed might well involve sensitive issues not appropriate for examination by a Select Committee. parliamentary control of action under the Bill would, however, be ensured by a requirement that schemes involving the use of the new powers conferred by the Bill should in all cases be subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament. As regards the aircraft industry, theMinisters concerned agreed that the Bill should deal specifically withexpenditure on the Concord aircraft, and that it should be so draftedthat the new powers could be used for the acquisition of the BeagleAircraft Company, and if need be (and subject to the satisfactory conclusion of negotiations with the companies concerned) for theproposed merger of the major firms in the airframe industry. Itwas desirable to establish some form of advisory machinery to evaluate schemes promoted under the Bill: this would help to allay the concern&apos;felt by industry about the Governments intentions. Itwas therefore proposed that there should be a panel of advisersdrawn from members of the Industrial Reorganisation CorporationCC 61 (67)the other points made in discussion. He should also consult withthe Lord President about the timing of the publication of the white paper, which would need to be considered in relation to the otherWhite Papers which were coming forward for publication at thesame time.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Power to amend the draft white paper in the light of their discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Power to arrange, in consultationwith the Lord President, for the publication of the white paper and of its popular version.
(1958-59) and the National Research and Development Corporation(NRDC). It was not necessary to make statutory provision for this machinery, nor should the Government be committed to using the panel for every scheme. It would be necessary to clear this proposal,if the Cabinet approved it, with the 1958-59 and the NRDC. It wouldalso be desirable to clarify with the 1958-59 the relation between their normal functions and action under the Bill: while they would continue to be concerned primarily with securing the rationalisation of industry through mergers, the Government would wish to make full use of their expertise in respect of schemes under the Bill. TheMinisters concerned proposed that there should be a single financiallimit on expenditure under the Bill for all purposes, including expenditure on aircraft projects. He invited his colleagues to endorsethese proposals and to approve the text of the draft White Paper,subject to clearance of the relevant passages with the 1958-59 and theNRDC, for publication as soon as possible after The Queen&apos;s Speech.In discussion it was pointed out that a number of major policy issues, in addition to those referred to by the Secretary of State for economic Affairs, still remained unresolved. It was essential that before the White Paper was published Ministers should be agreed on the line to be taken on these issues so that they could deal fully and consistently with the questions and criticisms which the white paper would provoke. While it was desirable that the White paper should be published as soon as possible in order to put the government&apos;s case fully and to remove misconceptions about their intentions, it would on balance be preferable to defer publicationuntil the main policy issues were resolved.In further discussion the following points were made:(a) There was general agreement that the proposal for a SelectCommittee to examine schemes promoted under the Bill should be abandoned, and that all schemes under the Bill should, as proposedin C (67) 168, be subject to affirmative resolution in Parliament:though it was contemplated that a single Order might be made tocover a group of like projects.(b) There was agreement in principle that advisory machinery to evaluate schemes under the Bill should be established on the lines proposed in C (67) 168. Further consideration should, however, begiven to the questions whether reference to the advisory panel of allschemes under the Bill should be mandatory, and whether it mightbe desirable to keep open the possibility that membership of theadvisory panel should not be confined to members of the 1958-59 andNRDC but might include other representatives of industry, especially if the Confederation of British Industry became prepared to considerconstructively the Bill and schemes to be made under it.(c) It would be necessary to decide before publication of theWhite Paper which industries should be covered by the Bill, inparticular whether the nationalised industries and distribution and service industries should be within its scope.(d) There was general agreement that it would not be acceptable to fix a single financial limit for all expenditure under the Bill: sucha limit would have to cover the cost of the development of Concord
and this would necessitate such a high limit that suspicions of the government&apos;s intentions for action under the Bill generally wouldbe intensified. The Bill should therefore incorporate a separatefinancial limit either for expenditure on Concord, or for expenditureon aircraft projects generally.(e) It was necessary to decide whether the provisions in the bill relating to expenditure on Concord should cover the costs of full production in addition to the costs of producing the prototypes; itwas arguable that the decision to proceed with full production was too far-reaching to be implemented merely by Order.(/) The Board of Trade had proposed that legislative provisionfor the further assistance to the Cunard Shipping Company recentlyagreed by the Government should not be included in the industrial expansion Bill but should form the subject of separate legislation:the Board argued first, that it would give an unfortunate impression of the aims of the Industrial Expansion Bill if one of the first projects to be promoted under it was directed not to industrial expansion butto helping a firm in financial difficulties; and second, that furtherfinance would need to be made available to Cunard before the bill was passed. On the other hand it was argued that the immediatefinancial needs of Cunard might properly be met by advances fromthe Civil Contingencies Fund once the Industrial Expansion Bill hadreceived a Second Reading; that the Governmenfs assistance toCunard (to which special considerations applied) was unlikely to be criticised on merits; and that it was important to prevent furthercongestion of the Parliamentary timetable by introducing separate legislation of a kind which the Industrial Expansion Bill was designedto avoid.(g) The latter part of paragraph 14 of the draft White Paperannexed to C (67) 168 should be reconsidered. It was doubtfulwhether it was wise for the Government to appear to be defendingthemselves in advance against criticisms which might be made;moreover, the paragraph as now drafted might tie the Governmenfshands too closely if they should wish to bring influence to bear onfirms receiving assistance under the provisions of the Bill.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said the cabinet agreed that there were a number of major policy issues which shouldbe resolved before the White Paper was published. The Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs should arrange for a group of officials of the Departments principally concerned to consider these issuesurgently; in particular, they should consider:(i) The membership of the proposed advisory panel and thequestion whether references to it should be mandatory.(ii) The industries to be covered by the Bill.(iii) Whether the separate financial limit on expenditure on aircraft projects which the Cabinet had approved shouldrelate to expenditure on the Concord only or to expenditure on all aircraft projects.
(iv) Whether the Bill should cover the full production costs ofthe Concord.(v) Whether the Bill should cover Government assistance to the cunard Shipping Company.The group of officials should make clear recommendations on thesematters and on amendments required to the draft White Paper inconsequence of their recommendations and in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion. Their report should be considered at a meetingof the Ministers mainly concerned, under the chairmanship of theSecretary of State for Economic Affairs, who should circulate a note of their conclusions for consideration by the Cabinet. It should bethe aim to circulate the note not later than Wednesday, 1st November,for consideration by the Cabinet on the following day: this would still leave time for the White Paper to be published soon after the queen&apos;s Speech, which was desirable provided the outstanding issuescould be resolved in time. If, however, it proved impossible to adhere to this timetable, the report to the Cabinet should beconsidered as soon as possible after 2nd November and the timing of publication of the White Paper would have to be determinedaccordingly. All Ministers should ensure that any points they wishedto raise on the outstanding policy issues or on the drafting of theWhite Paper were conveyed urgently to the Secretary of State for economic Affairs so that they could be considered before the further report was made to the Cabinet.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for Economic Affairs to reportto the Cabinet the conclusions of the Ministers concerned on the outstanding policy issues relating to the industrial expansion Bill and on the drafting of the White Paper, asindicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.*During their discussion of the memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Economic Affairs (C (67) 168) on the Industrial ExpansionBill, the Cabinet were informed that the Minister of Technology was considering putting to his colleagues proposals for a change of policy on the future of the airframe industry. These would involveabandoning the policy hitherto agreed for a Government minorityholding in a single airframe company formed by merging the majorfirms concerned, and proceeding instead to the complete public acquisition of these companies: this would amount to nationalisation of the airframe industry. A decision on this matter would fall to betaken later, but if it were decided to go for outright public ownership,it would not be acceptable to make the necessary legislative provision in the Industrial Expansion Bill and separate legislation would be needed. If on the other hand the Government adhered to the existing policy for a merger of the major companies, the necessary provisioncould be made in the Industrial Expansion Bill. In view of thesealternative possibilities, any reference to the aircraft industry in theWhite Paper should be in guarded terms so as to avoid committing the Government to a definite course of action at this stage. It would
PublicExpenditurePreviousReference:CC (67) 50thConclusions,Minute 3)SituationReportSECRET7. The Cabinet considered a report by the Chancellor of theExchequer (C (67) 166) on public expenditure.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that his memorandumshowed how policy decisions taken during recent months, togetherwith rephasing of some expenditure and revised estimates of the costof some agreed policies, were combining to pre-empt the contingencyallowances for future years which were fixed as a result of the cabinet&apos;s review earlier in the year of public expenditure programmes to 1970-71. Even over such a brief period commitments to future expenditure had increased substantially. On the basis of the presentexpectation that the economy would expand at an annual rate ofabout 3 per cent, the level of public expenditure now in prospectmight well necessitate higher taxation. He had circulated his memorandum to apprise his colleagues of the position, since it was important that the background should be kept in mind when furtherspecific proposals for expenditure came to be considered. he proposed to circulate similar reports to the Cabinet from time to time.In discussion the following points were made:(a) There was a danger that new proposals for expenditure which were brought forward after the completion of the main annual review of expenditure programmes would in effect be at an advantage over proposals scrutinised in the main review since they were considered in isolation and might therefore not be subjected to therigorous comparison with other projects which took place duringthe annual review. It was in the main inescapable that new projectsshould be considered individually as they arose, but it was essentialthat they should be looked at no less rigorously than proposalsbe necessary to ensure, pending a decision on future policy, that theprovisions of the Bill (including the financial limits) were adequate to cover the action the Government would need to take if they decidedto adhere to the present policy for a merger of the airframecompanies with a Government minority holding.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the cabinets discussion, said that the group of officials who were to considerpolicy issues outstanding in respect of the Industrial Expansion Billshould examine the provision to be made in the Industrial ExpansionBill for action in respect of the aircraft industry, and what should besaid on this matter in the White Paper, having regard to the proposalsfor a possible change of policy on the airframe industry which theMinister of Technology was considering.The Cabinet (2) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of this part of their discussion.
covered by the annual review, and should not start with an advantagederiving solely from the timing of their presentation.(b) On present plans, the increase in public expenditure wouldbe much sharper in 1968-69 than in the following two years, thoughthe plans for the later years could be expected to expand as time went on. The Treasury were exploring the possibilities of postponingexpenditure from 1968-69 to later years, but the scope for this was now limited.(c) Part of the increase in planned expenditure was due to revised estimates of the cost of agreed measures. All estimates were carefullycriticised by the Treasury at the time they were first made, butrevisions resulting from later information were sometimesunavoidable.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had taken careful note of the position revealed in C (67) 166.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would shortly be reporting to theCabinet the results of the examination by officials, following the cabinet&apos;s main review of future programmes earlier in the year, ofthe possibilities of securing a reduction of  25 million inmiscellaneous heads of expenditure which were not considered indetail during the main review. It would be useful if this report couldbe accompanied by an up-to-date survey of future commitments, set against the programmes to 1970-71 agreed by the Cabinet in themain review. It would also be useful as a continuing arrangementif reports similar to C (67) 166 were circulated to the Cabinet fromtime to time.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forfurther reports on public expenditure to be circulated tothe Cabinet as indicated in the Prime Ministers summing up.PublicExpenditureLong-termFinancialAssistancefor OverseasStudents(previous reference:CC (66) 58thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C (67) 163) on long-term financialassistance for overseas students.The Chief Secretary, Treasury, said that when the fees of overseas students undertaking higher and further education courses in this country had been increased following a decision of the Cabinetin November 1966 a number of short-term measures had been takento avoid hardship to existing students. The Committee on overseas development had recently discussed a long-term scheme forscholarships to help future students not financed by the UnitedKingdom; the cost would be  500,000 a year. Treasury ministers were not opposed to such a scheme in principle, but considered thatit should be financed either out of money already allocated to the aid programme (since it was a form of aid), or by transfer of an
appropriate sum from the total allocated for education to that provided for aid. In view of the difficulty, which was alreadyapparent, of keeping expenditure in 1970-71 within the agreedlimits, there should be no increase in total public expenditure and noencroachments on the estimated long-term saving of  5 million a year in expenditure on education announced in December 1966.The First Secretary of State said that the Committee on overseas development had been firmly of the view, subject to the position ofthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, that the proposed scheme oughtto be financed by an addition to public expenditure, and not by drawing on the sums allocated to either the Ministry of overseas development or the Department of Education and Science. Theyhad been led to this view partly by the fact that the previous Secretaryof State for Education and Science had undertaken to review theposition of overseas students in the light of evidence of the effect ofthe increase in fees. While not much evidence was yet available,our High Commissioners in developing countries had reported thatan increasing proportion of students was coming from the wealthierfamilies. Undoubtedly the issue would be raised at the forthcomingCommonwealth Education Conference.In discussion it was pointed out that the saving achieved by increasing the fees of overseas students had been regarded as a saving on the Education Vote, and it would consequently be unfair that the aid programme, which was already fully committed, should also bear the cost of long-term measures to mitigate the effects of the increase.On the other hand, if the cost were to be met out of sums at presentallocated for education, less would be available to meet our owneducational requirements.The Foreign Secretary, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were reluctant that the cost of the new scheme should bemet out of the money which it had been agreed in the course of thePublic Expenditure Survey should be devoted, on the one hand, to education, and, on the other, to aid, and were on balance agreed thatthe necessary money should be treated as a net addition to public expenditure.The Cabinet Agreed that the cost of the proposed long-term scheme forscholarships for overseas students should be regarded asan increase in public expenditure over and above the sumsallocated in the Public Expenditure Survey.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,   .26th October, 1967.
