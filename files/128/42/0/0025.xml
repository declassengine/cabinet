approach to Europe(previous reference:CC (67) 24thConclusions)ScottishAgricultureand theCommonMarketCC 25 (67)SECRET(i) The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for Scotland (C (67) 64) on Scottish agriculture and theCommon Market.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that his memorandumsummarised the possible implications for Scottish agriculture of accepting the common agricultural policy (c.a.p.) of the european economic Community (e.c.) as it stood. The effects would be particularly damaging for hill and upland farms which constituted40 per cent of the full-time farming units in Scotland. These farmswere entirely dependent for their net income on the relevantproduction grants the hill sheep, hill cattle and winter keep grants which could not be expected in their present form to be compatible with the c.a.p. There were few alternative types of production whichwere open to the hill and upland farms. Any decline in their presentproduction would have a pronounced impact on farming systems inthe lowlands since these latter areas would then increasingly haveto breed and rear their own store cattle and store sheep. The effects of acceptance of the c.a.p. would be less drastic on dairy farms andsome 60 per cent of these would probably be able to survive, though with reduced profitability. The smaller dairy farms however wouldbe in considerable difficulty and many might be forced out of business.There might well be difficulties under the conditions of the c.a.p. in maintaining an adequate milk supply, particularly to the WesternIsles, bearing in mind that it was impossible to assess what price levels for milk might result and that the future of the Milk MarketingBoard must be in doubt.. The arable farms should on balance gainand their main problem; would be one of adjustment to the new conditions, for which a reasonable transition period would benecessary. The intensive farming units specialising in pigs, poultryand horticulture would meet increasingly severe competition, butgiven the necessary scale of production and efficiency of managementthey should mostly be able to meet the challenge.The vital safeguards which would need to be negotiated forScottish agriculture were the retention of the hill production grants,whether in their present form or in some other form of equivalentworth; replanning grants to assist with problems of adjustment;maintenance of existing arrangements for liquid milk; and a transitional period of at least seven years.The Secretary of State for Wales said that he supported therecommendations of the Secretary of State for Scotland. Hill andupland farms constituted a substantial proportion of farms in Wales.If substitutes for the present production grants, such as grants forstructural improvements, mechanisation, and farm roads, could besecured, this would help the position; but a substantial transitional period would in any case be essential.In discussion, there was general recognition of the importanceof securing assistance for the hill and upland farms which would8148K 2
Effect of Entryon UnitedKingdomBalance ofPayments(previous reference:CG (67) 24thConclusions,Minute 2)compensate for the discontinuance of the existing production grants,if that had to be accepted. The expansion of forestry in these areasmight help the position, if assistance analogous to production grantscould be secured. It was argued however that under the rules governing the Agricultural Guidance and Guarantee Fund grants for forestry would not be possible since they would representassistance to a particular commodity and would therefore be held todistort the conditions of competition. On the other hand, it wassuggested that the talks with the Six had shown that the overriding consideration with the Community would be the net contribution which the United Kingdom would make to the Agricultural Fund. Ifthis were substantial, it should be possible to secure a comparablelevel of assistance in various forms from the Fund which would helpin meeting the difficulties likely to arise for farmers in Scotland and elsewhere.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat the Cabinet recognised that acceptance of the c.a.p. as it stoodwould entail even more dislocation of the present pattern ofagricultural production in Scotland than in England, though manyof the factors affecting hill and upland farming in Scotland would apply also to the North of England. The Cabinet would wish tobear these issues in mind in their later discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C (67) 64.(ii) The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the note by theSecretary of the Cabinet (C (67) 61) to which was attached a note bya group of Permanent Secretaries covering a report by officials andEconomic Advisers on the effect of entry into the e.c. on the UnitedKingdom balance of payments.In discussion, it was argued that the estimates of the effects of entry on the balance of payments presented in the report attachedto C (67) 61 made it clear that there would be an extremely seriousadditional burden amounting to some  600 million. The switch of resources necessary to cope with this situation would inevitably mean a period of considerable austerity and restraint of personal consumption. Further, the introduction of a value-added tax, towhich we should be committed, would mean a considerable increasein the cost of living above that which would result from acceptance ofthe c.a.p. and these factors together would involve a serious deterioration in the standard of living. The calculations in the reportimplied that the necessary shift of resources into exports and importsubstitution might be secured by a relatively slight increase in theannual rate of growth of the gross national product (GNP). Put inthis way, the requirement might seem modest. But an additional burden of  600 million on the balance of payments was a majoradditional commitment; and to accept it on the basis proposed wouldbe out of all proportion to the efforts which we were currently makingto achieve relatively small savings on the other side of the account by, for example, economies in oversea expenditure on defence whichmight entail very significant changes in our foreign policy.
8148Against these quantifiable adverse effects, there could only beset the argument that access to a larger market and the stimulus of competition which entry into the Community would bring might leadto increased productivity in the long term and enhance our competitive ability. It could not, however, be assumed that the merefact of lodging an application for entry would in itself act as a stimulus to industrial investment. Negotiations following such an applicationmight well encounter delays and difficulties which would rapidlyerode any initial increase in confidence on the part of industry. nor was there any real evidence that entry into a larger market would of itself stimulate industrial investment. The present decline in investment had resulted not from the limited size of the market opento our industry, but from the deflationary measures taken by theGovernment. The additional burden on the balance of payments which would result from entry into the e.c. was likely to requireeven more far-reaching deflationary measures which were likely to depress industrial investment even further.It was also unjustifiable to discount the estimates in C (67) 61 ofthe adverse effects of entry on the balance of payments on thegrounds that they were based on assumptions which were uniformlyunfavourable. On the contrary, several of the assumptions couldbe argued to be unduly optimistic. It was, for instance, assumed that the United Kingdom economy would be fully competitive priorto entry, with an adequate surplus in the balance of payments andlabour costs maintained at a level adequate to preserve this surplusafter entry; in fact, however, we were far from having reached this position and there was no guarantee that we should reach it beforeentry if application were made at an early date. Similarly, thereport by officials and Economic Advisers made due allowance for anincrease in the level of our exports to the e.c., while ignoring the adverse effects on the cost of living of the introduction of a value-added tax and the effects on industrial costs of the increased social security contributions by employers which were likely to be necessary.Finally, the estimate of losses to our exports through the abolitionof Commonwealth preferences was considerably lower than recentestimates which had been put forward by the Australians.We had been able on the basis of existing policies to make progress towards solving our balance of payments problems only atthe cost of a high level of unemployment, cuts in desirableprogrammes of social expenditure and acceptance of a growth rate which was unsatisfactorily low. In order to sustain the extra burden on our balance of payments which entry would entail, all these policies would have to be intensified. If this prospect were not acceptable it might be necessary to contemplate more far-reachingchanges in existing policies if we were to decide to apply for entry.On the other hand it was argued that, quite apart from otherobvious objections to any fundamental modifications of theGovernments economic policies at the present time, there was no need to assume that entry into the Community would necessarily
entail the consequences suggested in the report by officials andEconomic Advisers. It was essential in assessing its estimates to bearin mind that we should not feel the full effects of membership until1970 at the earliest and that, given a reasonable transitional period,we could expect that the full impact of e.c. conditions would not be felt until about 1975. The report assumed that we should have toaccept the c.a.p. as it stood; but if we succeeded in joining theCommunity by 1969 we should be able to influence the futured development of the c.a.p. and it was inconceivable that we shouldfail to secure some amelioration of its effects on our economy. Weshould also be able to influence decisions on taxation: there had as yet been no agreement as to the rates or the coverage of a value-addedfax and complete harmonisation was still a distant objective. Afurther factor of which the report took insufficient account was that by pursuing our present policies we should have secured a majorreduction in Government oversea expenditure by 1975, with a consequent easement of our balance of payments problem. But evenif the pessimistic assumptions on which the report was based were accepted, the resulting estimate that the adverse effects of entrycould be overcome if the annual rate of growth of the economy couldbe accelerated by about one-half of 1 per cent showed that the task,while difficult, was by no means.unmanageable. The basic need wasto increase the efficiency and competitive ability of industry; this task would remain whether or not we entered the Community.The Cabinet (2) Took note of C (67) 61.Value added tax(previous reference:CC (67) 24thConclusions,Minute 1)(iii) The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C (67) 71) covering a report by officials on thearrangements for a value-added tax (TVA) in the e.c. and their implications for the United Kingdom in the event of our entering theCommunity.In discussion of the agreement of the e.c. Council of ministers to two directives providing for the adoption by members of theCommunity by 1st January, 1970, of a TVA in replacement ofexisting turn-over taxes, it was argued that the adoption of such asystem by this country, which was inevitable if we joined theCommunity, would bear heavily on the poorer families. The reportby officials stated that although existing directives on a TVA didnot relate to agriculture or the retail trade, it was inevitable, once thesystem was introduced, that it would sooner or later be extended toall commodities and all traders. Unless this were done traders,including the agricultural community, would not be able to recoupthe taxes paid on their own purchases from other industries for thepurposes of their business. On the most favourable assumptions,including a lower basic rate for the tax on necessities and alsocompensating reductions in excise taxes, there would be an increaseof 2\ per cent in the cost of living in this country if we were to adoptTVA and a considerable shift in the incidence of taxation to the disadvantage of larger and poorer households.
1 R ?- 7    x o -*...   CC 25 (67)On the other hand it was pointed out that although the principleof TVA would have to be accepted if we were to join the Community,the precise manner in which it would apply and in particular therates of tax would be for negotiation after our entry. We should thenbe able to exert our influence on all decisions taken in this respect and these had to be unanimous. It was moreover likely to be anumber of years before the system came fully into effect, allowingparticularly for a transitional period. It also had to be borne inmind that large changes would have to be made elsewhere in ourtaxation system and in our arrangements for social benefits if wewere to adopt TVA and that the tax itself would produce largerevenues which could be used to offset its social impact.The Cabinet (3) Took note of C (67) 71.(iv) The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 70) covering the text of the communique issued atthe conclusion of the meeting of the Ministerial Council of theEuropean Free Trade Association (EFTA) in London on 28th April,1967.The Foreign Secretary said that the consultations with our partners at the meeting of the EFTA Council on 28th April hadtaken place on a hypothetical basis in respect of our entry to the eec. Our partners had shown understanding of our position and a willingness to help both in and after the Ministerial meeting. AllEFTA members, apart from Portugal, favoured an application for entry on our part and considered that we should not delay thatapplication, though there were varying degrees of optimism among them about our prospects of success. A salient feature of the communique which had been issued at the end of the meeting wasthat the London Declaration, which effectively-gave a veto to ourEFTA partners in respect of our entry into the e.c. unless all othermembers of EFTA also entered, or concurred in the terms of our entry, was recognised as no longer valid. It had been replaced by astatement that it would be the purpose of EFTA Governments that,should it be necessary in order to give reasonable opportunity toother partners in the Association to conclude negotiations, sufficienttransitional periods should be provided for with a view to avoidingdisruption in European trade patterns.In discussion the importance was stressed of maintaining theexistence of EFTA as a working organisation which we could maintain should we attempt without success to join the e.c.: thiswas in the interests of all EFTA members, whose attitude to joining the Community themselves would largely be governed by the successor failure of any attempt that we might make. It seemed on balanceprobable that no other member would succeed in obtaining entry into the Community if we were to fail in an application, even shouldEuropeanFree trade association
any of them then decide to apply, though it would be imprudent onour part to regard such an outcome as certain. It was important alsoto do all that we could not to lose the benefits to ourselves and to european trade as a whole of the tariff reductions which had beenmade in EFTA. So far as individual countries were concerned, itwas likely that Denmark and Norway would quickly follow us in applying to join the e.c. should we decide to do so and thatapplications to join, either fully or as associated members, would bemade in due course. by Sweden and Switzerland; Austria hadalready applied to join and Soviet objections to her doing so mightwell be removed if we ourselves had become a member. The general view of our EFTA partners was that if we were able to join the EECour best course would be to do so quickly and in as clear and simpleterms as possible.The Cabinet (4) Took note of C (67) 70 and of the Foreign Secretary^statement.InformationfromOverseasPosts onthe Attitudeof ForeignCountriesmostconcerned(previous reference:CC (67) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)(v) The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C (67) 68) covering reports from Overseas Posts on theattitude of the foreign countries most concerned to an application by the United Kingdom to join the e.c..The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that, followingdiscussion in Cabinet on 20th April, our Ambassadors to eec countries and to the United States had been asked to report on the likely reactions of these countries to various alternative courses onour part: a decision to apply immediately for entry to the e.c., adecision not to do so and a decision to delay while seeking furtherinformation in bilateral consultations. The memorandum beforethe Cabinet set out the results of these enquiries, together with theview of the Head of our Delegation to the Communities in Brusselson the likely attitude of the e.c. Commission. The advice was that apart from France, whose policy had yet to be decided, all concerned would be opposed to further bilateral discussions and in favour ofan application on our part to join the e.c.. Most of the repliesexplicitly favoured an early application, though the United Statesand the e.c. Commission had expressed no view on timing.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that the attitude of allthe leading members concerned in the United States Administration,in contrast to that of their Heads of Delegation in the Kennedy Roundnegotiations, was that the timing of an application on our part tojoin the e.c. should not be influenced by that of the concludingstages of the Kennedy Round. The Cabinet were also informedthat the interests of the Irish Republic would be covered by a meeting between the Prime Minister and the Taoiseach on the following day.The Cabinet (5) Took note of C (67) 68.
LikelyReactionsofCommonwealthCountries(previous reference:CC (67) 22ndConclusions,Minute 2)Programmeof Work(vi) The Cabinet considered a memorandum by theCommonwealth Secretary (C (67) 66) describing the likely reactions of Commonwealth countries to an application by the UnitedKingdom to join the e.c..The Commonwealth Secretary said that in general Common-wealth countries regarded our possible entry to the e.c. as inevitable,at least eventually, but looked to us to safeguard their essential interests and to consult them on the terms of any application that we might make to join. They were aware that no question of veto onour entry arose so far as they were concerned, but they could beexpected to press their individual cases very hard in the course of detailed consultation. This would apply particularly to New zealand and Australia, the more especially in view of the breakdown which now seemed probable in the cereals negotiations in the kennedy round.The Cabinet (6) Took note of C (67) 66.(vii) The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet might agree thatin the afternoon session the best course would be to have a general debate following an opening statement by the Foreign Secretary. Itwould be open at that stage for any member of the Cabinet to raiseany matter including, for example, the timing of a possible applicationto join the e.c. and the conditions on which we might do so. Atthe end of the session he would sum up the sense of their discussions as a whole, but no decision whether or not to make an applicationto enter the e.c. should be made until the Cabinet met at downing street in the following week.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,30th April, 1967.
