CC 41 (67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.secret. The Prime Minister said that his discussions with president de Gaulle had ranged widely over world affairs. As regards theMiddle East, the President maintained his view that there could beno settlement without Four Power discussions. He had recognised the importance of France and ourselves taking the same line in them,but, particularly in consequence of his earlier talks with the SovietPrime Minister, Mr. Kosygin, when the latter was on his way to new York, had been disillusioned about the prospect of such discussions being able to achieve any early settlement and the implications this carried for the inability of France herself, or adisunited Europe, sufficiently to influence world events. He had recognised that the British position vis-a-vis the United States and europe had changed substantially in the last two years, but he was still concerned at the extent to which our position made us liableto be involved in American policies. In particular, he was concerned at the continuation of hostilities in Viet-Nam, which in his viewmade it impossible to achieve any rapprochement between theUnited States and the Soviet Union or easing of world tensions. Inthe course of the discussion he himself had made a brief referenceto our defence policy. The President had welcomed our decision not to buy Poseidon missiles; but he had not raised the general question of nuclear policy, which had not been discussed.In the course of their discussion of African affairs he had drawnthe President^ attention to the continuing damage caused by thesituation in Rhodesia and in this connection had made it clear thatit was French opposition which stood in the way of an oil rationing scheme for Mozambique. The President had undertaken to examine further the French position in this regard.In their discussions on Europe the President had made muchof the danger that the European Economic Community (e.c.) would,if we were to join it, pursue an &quot;Atlantic &quot; policy, since our entrywould encourage existing tendencies in that direction on the part ofthe Benelux countries, Italy and the Federal Republic of Germany.He himself had urged the need for a quick decision about our entry.His reiteration of the importance of developing technologicalco-operation within Europe had made a considerable impact on thePresident, who had shown himself concerned at the economic difficulties which France was at present undergoing and the consequent need to reduce governmental expenditure in variousfields. He himself had pointed out that, while the concept of a wideassociation of Atlantic and perhaps Pacific Powers had not yet reached the stage of practical politics, long delay in a decision about our membership of the e.c. might well lead to pressures for such an
association acquiring considerable momentum. We had made ourchoice in favour of Europe: it was now for France to make herchoice.The attitude of the President had been friendly throughout andhe had not been unreceptive to suggestions that closer Anglo-french -operation would enable the two countries and Europe generally to play an effective role in world affairs. But the President had shown himself tired and depressed at his realisation that recent events, and notably his recent discussions with Mr. Kosygin, haddemonstrated the failure of his policy of placing France in the role of intermediary between the Great Powers. His prevailing moodhad been one of apocalyptic gloom about the state of the world andthe need to reconsider and reconstruct French policies.In discussion it was suggested that the outcome of the PrimeMinister^ discussions with President de Gaulle indicated that negotiations for our membership of the e.c. would be prolonged and, in the end, nugatory. From an economic point of view, some delay would not necessarily be a serious disadvantage since it wouldgive further time for our economic recovery to show its full effect,but politically the constraints which would be imposed on our policies throughout a period of prolonged uncertainty would be disadvantageous. In these circumstances, it was questioned whether,in the light of France&apos;s repeated suggestions that some form ofBritish association short of full membership would, at any rate forthe present, be the right solution, we should not consider furtherwhat our attitude to these suggestions should be.On the other hand, it was argued that the discussions with thePresident did not justify so pessimistic a conclusion in respect ofthe outcome of negotiations for our entry into the Community. ThePresident had not contested the Prime Ministers explanation of theUnited Kingdom position in respect of capital movements, nor hisexposition of the view that the position of sterling did not presenta major problem. The President had, furthermore, shownconsiderable interest in the possibilities of building a Europe whichwas technologically advanced and had recognised the major change which had taken place in recent years in our position vis-a-vis theUnited States. Moreover, it might well be that if the President feltthat Germany might, after his death, come increasingly to dominate Europe, he would wish to see the United Kingdom join the Community; and there was some reason to think that, in any event, he was more reconciled than hitherto to the prospect of our entry within the course of the next three years or so being more orless inevitable.In further discussion on the question of association it was pointedout that it was important to distinguish between the three different forms which these suggestions had taken. As regards the first,association proper under Article 238 of the Treaty of Rome, there could be no question but that this would be inappropriate and unacceptable for us. The second proposition might be described as&quot; probationary membership &quot; under which we might have a status as an associate member for a period of years, with the possibility of
&quot;     2735OverseaAffairsMiddleEast: (previous reference:CC(67) 40thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that the debate on the situation in the Middle East in the Special Session ofthe United Nations General Assembly was not likely to end untilthe middle of the following week. Various groups of States wereattempting to formulate compromise resolutions but the outcomewould not be clear for several days. The Soviet Union, as part ofher endeavour to restore her prestige with the Arab countries, hadtabled resolutions strongly condemning Israel and was continuing to allege that we and the United States were giving full backing toour being accepted as a member at the end of that period, providedour behaviour had been satisfactory. This solution too would be quite unacceptable. The third proposition was for a &quot; treaty of transition &quot; under which we should have a period of years to reorientour policies closer to those of the Community, but would be formallyassured of membership at the end of that period. While this lastproposition was clearly of a different character from the two preceding ones, it would not necessarily prove on further examinationto accord with our interests and in any event it would be tacticallyfatal to let it appear at the present stage that we were interested inanything less than full membership.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that his conclusion from his talks with the French President, upon whom he had exerted all possible pressure for a quick decision on thequestion of British entry into the Community, and who was nowreviewing his whole position, was that we should continue to pressour application for membership of the Community; it might be that by the autumn we should have further indications of the attitudeof the Six and that would be the time to review where we stood.Basically, the President was still unconvinced that our entry into the eec would not introduce an unacceptable degree of &quot; Atlantic &quot;influence. But he recognised, and found encouraging, the extent towhich we were seeking industrial and technological independence ofthe United States: and in his now strikingly fatalistic mood aboutworld affairs and his depression about the possibility of Francemaintaining the role in Europe and in the world which he had sought for her, it seemed probable that he was now prepared to recognise the inevitability of our membership. If, therefore, we maintainedour pressure as he himself had indicated to the President that we intended to do he felt more definitely than before his visit thatthere was a reasonable prospect of our succeeding.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers statement on his talks with President de Gaulle and of his summing up of the discussion.
Israel. The speech by the Foreign Secretary in the debate, whichhad stressed the urgent need for relief of suffering in the Middle Eastand for United Nations mediation there, had been well received.His objective had been to make it clear that we had not given, andwere not giving, full support to either party in the recent conflictand to begin the process of improving our relations with the arab states, which was essential if our oil supplies from them were to be resumed. He had stated our belief in the right of Israel to exist asa State but, at the same time, had supported strongly the principleenshrined in the United Nations Charter that territorial aggrandise-ment should not come as a result of war. This did not mean thatsome rectification of frontiers was not essential as part of a general settlement. The Foreign Secretary had particularly asked that Israelshould not take pre-emptive legislative action, before a settlement ofthe situation, to incorporate the whole of Jerusalem in her territory.Our view had long been that Jerusalem was a special case in which some kind of international status might be appropriate. Copies ofthe full text of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s speech would be circulated to members of the Cabinet.In discussion, considerable disquiet was expressed at theinterpretation which was being given in the United Kingdom press to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s speech; this interpretation was to the effectthat the Government would support a settlement in the Middle Eastinvolving the re-establishment of the frontiers between Israel andthe Arab States which had existed before the recent conflict. Thepoint was made that these frontiers were not such as to provide abasis for an enduring settlement in the Middle East, nor indeed hadthe Arab States themselves ever accepted them. This interpretationby the Press had led to a strong adverse reaction on the part of the government&apos;s supporters in Parliament and it was essential quicklyto correct any impression that, in order to secure our oil supplies from the Arab countries, we were prepared to see the frontiersbetween Israel and the Arab States settled on the basis of a complete withdrawal of Israel behind her previous frontiers. There was,however, general agreement that any corrective action could be besttaken by background guidance to the Press, which would distinguish between a declaration of principle in respect of territorial aggrandise-ment as the result of war and an expression of views on the kind of settlement that might emerge through negotiations about the middle east. Further statements of policy should, so far as possible, be avoided, since our interests would be best served if we did not takethe initiative publicly, at any rate at this stage, about the nature ofa settlement in the Middle East.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that there seemed no prospect of an early settlement in the Middle East; before this could become possible there would have to be a relaxation of tension in the area and neither the Soviet Union nor the Arab states were yet ready to accept this. It was the view of the Cabinet thatthe settlement in the Middle East must, if it were to endure, involve some adjustments in the frontiers between Israel and the Arab states as these had existed before the recent conflict. The Minister of State
SECRET&quot; n    274SouthArabia(previous reference:CC(67) 30thConclusions,Minute 3)The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State for Foreign Affairs to be guided by the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs said that there hadbeen a mutiny in a section of the Federal Republican Army (FRA)and grave disorder in the Crater district of Aden. A number ofBritish soldiers had been killed. The situation was still serious andwas likely to remain so for a day or so. The current military position was not entirely Clear. The mutiny had arisen from tribaljealousies in the Federal forces; this had been dealt with quickly bythe Federal forces themselves but in the meantime violence hadspread to the Crater where Arab police and supporters of the Frontfor the Liberation of Occupied South Yemen and the national liberation Front had become involved. The Crater had been sealedoff by British troops and the problem now was how to restore orderthere without further loss of life; there was no confirmation thatRoyal Marines had captured the district.The Defence Secretary said that the situation in South Arabiahad been made much more difficult by recent events in the middle east and in particular by the allegations of collusion by ourselves and the United States with Israel, which had affected Arab morale.The most important feature of the situation for us would be how theFRA would react to this situation. A particular problem would arise if, as had happened during earlier operations in the Radfan,we were, to find that troops who had been killed during the recent disturbances had been mutilated, since relatives now had the rightto have their bodies brought back to this country.In discussion it was noted that the Government^ policy on south Arabia had been made clear, in accordance with the cabinets discussion, in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement in the House ofCommons on the preceding Monday. This had made clear our intention to grant independence to South Arabia on 9th January1968 and to withdraw our forces from the territory itself then. Thiswas a major change from the policy pursued by the previous administration.The Cabinet (2) Took note of the statements by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs and the Secretary of State for Defence.for Foreign Affairs should inform the Foreign Secretary urgently ofthe misleading interpretation which had been put publicly on his speech in the General Assembly. This should be corrected bysuitable background guidance to the Press but in doing so we should avoid becoming publicly identified through further statements ofpolicy with a particular view on the nature of a settlement in theMiddle East.
IndustrialDisputesRailways(previous reference:CC(67) 40thConclusions,Minute 4)confidential. The Home Secretary said that the Official Committee on emergencies had met the previous day and would meet again that afternoon to consider what emergency action was required to dealwith the situation arising from the unofficial strike at a number ofLondon railway freight depots in consequence of-thie dispute over theStratford terminal. . Supplies to London had not so far been seriously affected; and as long as the strike did not spread topassenger services it did not appear that there would be occasion for action to be taken by the Government to ensure the continuation of supplies or services. There would be no business which would justify calling a meeting of the Ministerial Committee on emergencies, but it was for consideration whether a meeting shouldbe arranged and whether this should, contrary to normal practice, bemade known, in order to demonstrate the determination of theGovernment to deal firmly with the situation.The Joint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said thatthe industrial situation that morning did not appear to be quite asgloomy as had seemed probable the previous day. It was reportedthat there was considerable reluctance in some depots to come out on strike and as long as the strike was not declared an official one bythe National Union of Railwaymen (NUR), it seemed unlikely to spread much more widely. No meeting of the Executive of the NURhad yet been called and it was known that the General Secretary wasin sympathy with the action being taken by the Board of british railways. In these circumstances the balance of advantage lay in not calling a meeting of the Ministerial Committee.In discussion there was general agreement that, as long as thesituation did not deteriorate, there was no reason to hold a meetingof the Ministerial Committee on Emergencies. The best coursewould be for the Government, while maintaining a firm line inrespect of the dispute, to avoid overt action except where this wasnecessary to maintain supplies or services.The Cabinet  ^Took note of the statements by the Home Secretary and theJoint Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd June, 1967.
