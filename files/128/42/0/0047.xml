It would be forconsideration in the light of their present discussion whether it wouldbe helpful for the Chancellor of the Exchequer to circulate a furtherpaper on which the definitive discussion at the further meeting mightbe based.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in his memorandum c (67) 125 he had sought to set out the broad plan of the way inwhich the necessarily considerable savings in public expenditure could be made, whilst allowing the Governmenfs social andeconomic programmes to go forward at a substantial rate. He had assumed that the proposed saving of  200 million a year on defence expenditure would be made; indeed it was to be hoped that moremight be saved, but it would be premature to count on it.As regards his proposals for savings on particular blocks ofexpenditure, he had discussed with the Minister of Transport the
proposal that a saving of  50 million should be achieved on theestimated expenditure in 1970-71 on roads and other expenditureon transport, other than the railways deficit, and had invited her toconsider how this could best be achieved. The proposed savingwould be in respect of the total estimated expenditure on these items,i.e., on the basic programme of  844 million plus the  50 million ofadditional expenditure on the new proposals put forward by theMinister which had not been included in the basic programme. TheMinister might make the proposed saving partly by scaling down the additional expenditure of  50 million, partly by making newcharges for the use of roads and partly by reductions in the road programme. In considering the possibility of charges for the useof roads it would be important that the Minister should distinguish between charges directly related to road usage, e.g., in respect of excessive wear and tear caused by heavy lorries, and revenue chargesproper, e.g., for road licences, since this was too important a fieldto admit the principle of hypothecation of revenue proper. He also proposed that there should be a saving of a further  30 million by reduction of the railway deficit, on which the Joint Steering group of representatives of British Railways, the Ministry of Transport andcertain industrialists, who were evolving a new financial structurefor the railways, had submitted a report containing useful proposalsfor savings, including also however proposals for the writing-off ofcapital. The proposed saving was somewhat uncertain in that the out-turn of British Railways on current account was liable tofluctuate for many reasons outside their control, e.g., the state of the economy, changes in demand for particular traffics and the timing of price and wage changes. Nevertheless, if determined efforts weremade to improve productivity and efficiency he was satisfied thata reduction in the expected deficit for 1970-71 of  30 million couldbe achieved; and this should certainly be made an aim of policy.As regards housing, he had proposed a saving of about 3 percent ( 33 million) in 1970-71 on the programme for Great Britain;this would imply a reduction in housing starts in the public sector in1970 from 242,000 to 232,000. There would need to be some reduction in starts in the intervening years?. He proposed that theMinister of Housing should advise what measures might be takento stimulate private sector housing so as to offset the reduction inthe public sector programme as far as possible. The performance of the private sector should be greatly helped by the introduction ofthe Governmenfs scheme for option mortgages in April 1968. Thecalls on the funds available to the building societies for mortgagelending would increase when the Leasehold Reform Bill came intoeffect. He was however examining both public sector borrowingarrangements and suggestions for increasing the volume of funds available for mortgage lending. It might be necessary to accept thatthe achievement of the target of 500,000 houses would have to be deferred for a short time beyond 1970; however, if we could secure a change of emphasis from public to private housing, it should stillbe possible to come near to the original objective in that year. Asregards Scotland, he did not propose any formal cut, as it seemed likely that the Scottish housing target would not be achieved.
CC 47 (67)Public expenditure on education presented particularly difficult problems, as the Secretary of State&apos;s memorandum (C (67) 129) made clear, and he was prepared to look at alternative proposals to the postponement of the raising of the school-leaving age and thesubstitution of loans for part of student grants, as a means of achieving the net saving of  45 million in 1970-71 which he had proposed. The Cabinet should bear in mind, in consideringexpenditure on education and also on health, the considerabledemands on manpower which these programmes involved. on present plans, increased employment in the public services wouldtake some 500,000 employees out of the labour market by 1970-71,which, taken together with the expected reduction of some 400,000consequent on the raising of the school-leaving age, would leave theprivate sector of the economy with a labour force almost 1 millionsmaller by that year. Thus, other things being equal, there was a prospect of a manpower shortage over the next few years.As regards local and environmental services, a reduction ofapproximately  20 million in 1970-71 should be the aim; it shouldbe sought mainly in reducing the capital element on the lines suggestedin C (67) 102.As regards the large number of lesser blocks of remainingexpenditure set out in paragraph 13 of C (67) 125, on which spendingwas rising fast, officials should be instructed to examine thepossibilities of making net savings, which he would put to hiscolleagues for approval before the end of October, totalling 50 million after making any necessary allowance for new proposals.As regards social security, on the assumption that the nextuprating after October 1967 would be in October 1969, and that inthose two years real earnings would increase at 3 per cent per annum,the compensation provided by the uprating should be given half-waybetween the estimated increase in prices and that in earnings, ratherthan equated with the rise in earnings. This would 8lve a saving ofsome  70 million in 1970-71; but this would be partly offset byadditional expenditure on new measures for family endowment; andif changes in the cost of school meals were also taken into account,the net saving would be between  20 million and  60 million,dependent on the precise decisions which were taken.As regards the aid programme, the aim for 1970-71 should beto continue the normal aid programme of some  205 million in cashterms, together with some  20- 25 million mitigating aid to singapore and Malaysia in consequence of defence cuts there and a further 5 million to which we were committed as part of the cerealsagreement in the Kennedy Round. Total aid expenditure on the&quot; existing policy &quot; figure of  225 million would therefore be increased in 1970-71 by some  5- 10 million.The total reduction in public expenditure he was proposing for1970-71 would be between  425 million and  475 million, dependenton the net saving achieved in respect of social security and on thepossibilities of saving by means of additional charges, on which a paper was about to be circulated.
Transport The Minister of Transport said that she was prepared to acceptthe Chancellors target for a reduction of  30 million in the railwaydeficit on the understanding that public policy in other fields did nothinder the achievement of this target.  In addition to the uncertainfactors   which   the   Chancellor   mentioned,   there  were  otherimponderables, such as future fuel policy (and its effect on railfreightage of coal), which might affect the achievement of this target:in this connection, for example,, it should be remembered that proposals she had previously put forward for reducing the deficit by increasing fares and charges had not been approved.  nevertheless the report of the Joint Steering Group offered a fair prospect of amuch needed tightening of financial control over the railways as wellas progress with the problem of capitalisation: the best hope for savings lay in track rationalisation.  For transport items other thanthe railway deficit, the suggestion had been made that the proposal in effect to absorb the  50 million of additional expenditure she had proposed within the existing programme of  844 million wouldunduly reduce the share of the total reduction of expenditure to beborne by transport services.   This was not so, since all this expenditure had been approved in principle and a large part of itappeared in its present classification solely as a book-keeping transferof items previously classified as investment by the nationalised industries. It would in any event be an extremely serious matter toattempt to reduce expenditure on roads by as much as  50 million,save perhaps in so far as this could be done by making new charges.The roads programme had to be considered in the light of the considerable increase in the volume of traffic which would complicatean already difficult situation. It was clearly not possible substantially to reduce the likely increase in traffic without grave consequences forthe motor vehicle industry.  A substantial saving could however beachieved by the introduction of new types of charges, while avoiding the pre-emption of normal sources of revenue; and two of these charges could be incorporated in the Transport Bill.   First, there could be a &quot; wear and tear &quot; supplement to the fees charged forcarriers&apos; licences for heavy lorries, which might produce a saving ofsome  25- 30 million and would be distinct from the excise revenue from the normal vehicle licence duty. The incidence of these charges should be graduated according to the wear and tear likely to be caused by particular types of vehicle, which had been costed. Therewas a further justification for such a supplementary charge in that heavy lorries were not at present paying a share of the road chargesproportionate to that of other road users (though all users taken together were currently paying in charges some three times theirestablished track cost).   The incidence of the charge per ton milewould vary with the graduated scale of charges, but would be no more than between one-fifth and one-tenth of a farthing per ton mile.The second type of charge she had in mind was also eminentlyjustifiable, i.e., a special charge for the movement of abnormal loads,which had to be escorted and, apart from wear and tear, did not paythe full cost of their transit. There were approximately 30,000 such,oads a year and a suitable levy on them might raise some  3 million.There might well be an indirect benefit in the pressure such a charge
would exert on suppliers to consider assembly of the load on the site to which it had to be delivered instead of, as at present, at thefactory. The third type of charge was road pricing: but this wasa complex problem, the report on it would not be ready for some18 months. Any significant proposals would involve controversiallegislation and any additional revenue resulting could thereforehardly be obtained in the period under review to 1970-71. In sum,while it was accepted that savings must be made, it should berecognised that the foreseeable increase in the volume of traffic would require the road programme to be maintained; and indeed itwas only on that basis that further and inevitably controversialcharges could be justified.In discussion it was suggested that the principle of charges foruse which underlay the Minister of Transport^ three proposals should be applied comprehensively, perhaps through the petrol duty,in substitution for, and not as a supplement to, the present basic taxeson vehicle ownership. It was also suggested that in any event the vehicle duty on lorries needed to be raised in many cases it was only50 per cent higher than the rate established in 1933. It was, however,pointed out that changes of this nature fell to be considered as partof taxation policy; and that in this country there were substantialdifficulties in the way of charges such as turnpike tolls because thevery large number of access points to our major roads made it inevitable that the administration charges for the collection of tolls,would absorb a quite disproportionate part of the receipts. Thequestion was raised whether further road charges such as had beensuggested might have a disproportionate economic effect in development areas, especially where in those areas tolls on bridges,tunnels, and ferries were already in force; but it was pointed out thatthe tolls levied on these facilities did not offset the fuel and othersavings these facilities made possible for the vehicles using them;and that some of the charges in question were limited by existing legislation. It was also pointed out that current public investment in transport, e.g., on freight liner trains, would be of benefit to thedevelopment areas; and that in any event it was essential for those areas that the road programmes should be maintained and therefore that the financial measures necessary to that end should be taken.The question was also raised whether the additional  50 million of expenditure over and above the  844 million programme could infact all be disbursed within the period under review; and whether in any event some of it could not be deferred. It was however pointedout that all this expenditure had been approved in principle and that much of it appeared under its new heading as a result only ofbook-keeping changes, notably a large part of the  29 million inrespect of &quot; infrastructure &quot; grants. These grants would facilitatetighter financial control; and much of the expenditure had beenapproved some time ago as part of nationalised industry programmes which had social as well as economic justifications. For the mostpart, therefore, these &quot; additional &quot; proposals represented either newmeans of financing existing schemes already approved, or important
new schemes, e.g., to save manpower on the buses, and in any eventwould be considered, with the items in the main programme, as partof the review of the means by which savings in public expenditure on transport could be achieved, There could be no question ofhypothecation for additional expenditure on transport of any fundsraised by new road charges. But in so far as such new sources offinance could be found, that would provide an additional reason for considering further expenditure on the roads. At present, on thebasis that road pricing could make no contribution before 1970-71,almost half the proposed saving of  50 million was still uncertain.Housing The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theproposal in paragraph 8 of C (67) 125 was for a reduction in thepublic sector housing programme for 1970 of 3 per cent. This wasa greater proportionate reduction than the average 2 per cent reduction proposed for other programmes.   In money terms, thereduction would amount to  33 million, and if this were accepted itwould be difficult for the Government to claim that they were givinghousing the priority which they had in the past undertaken to give it.It was suggested that the reduction of  33 million could be achieved by reducing the number of local authority housing starts in 1970by 8,000 in England and Wales, on the assumption that theprogramme in Scotland would fall short of the target by some 2,000houses: this would mean a total reduction for Great Britain of10,000 starts. But in the absence of any changes in general housingpolicies, the saving from a reduction in starts of this order would amount to only  13-1 million in 1970-71.  A saving of  33 million would only result if the assumption were made that all the housesaffected by the reduction would have been begun and completed within the year 1970-71, but this was clearly impracticable.  Inorder to save  33 million in 1970-71, there would have to be areduction in starts of over 20,000 between the present time and march 1971.   Such a reduction would almost certainly mean thatthe target of 500,000 houses by 1970, to, which the Government werepledged, would be unobtainable. Even on the basis of existing plans,the total of completions in the public sector in 1970 would be only237,000, compared with the 250,000 which would be required to make sure of building 500,000 houses in 1970 in the public and private sectors together.  It was clear that housing needs were no less thanthey were when the target of 500,000 houses was fixed.  Indeed a recent survey of the housing stock showed that we now had  -8 million slums (where it had been previously supposed that therewere only about 1 million) and some 3 million houses which wereincapable of improvement. The latter would have to be demolished and new houses to replace them could only be provided from the programmes of the local authorities.  We were devoting a smaller proportion of the national product to housing than most european countries. The limitations of the existing programme meant that wewere having to restrain the local authorities in the priority areas from building to capacity and local authorities in other areas were subject to even more severe restrictions.   Any reductions in the forward programme would immediately become apparent to localauthorities and would undoubtedly give rise to severe criticism.
If any reduction were to be imposed on the public sectorprogramme, the most that should be contemplated was to plan for,000 fewer completions in 1970 than were envisaged under thepresent programme. This would mean a slight reduction in thenumber of housing starts in the intervening years, totalling some7,500 for the years 1969-70. There would then be a steadyprogression in the programme, designed to secure 232,000 completions in 1970 compared with 237,000 under the existing programme.It had been suggested that measures could be taken to ensurethat building in the private sector expanded sufficiently to offset any reduction in the public sector. But it had to be borne in mind that private sector housing did not cater for the most acute housing needs.While there were signs of recovery in the performance of the private sector, the rate of completions was still lagging and it was by nomeans certain that the private sector&apos;s contribution would be suchas to enable us to reach 400,000 completions this year. The private sector programme was affected by many extraneous factors andthere could be no assurance that it would reach any given level.There were, however, a number of measures which might be takento stimulate private building. First, it would greatly help to sustainhousing demand if there could be some easement of the presentlimit on mortgage lending by local authorities. The present ceilingon such lending of  130 million had already had the effect that some local authorities had been obliged to refuse mortgages and this had given rise to widespread dissatisfaction. Bearing in mind thatmortgage repayments to local authorities were already nearing thepoint where they would equal outgoings and that they wouldprobably exceed outgoings by 1969-70, there was a strong case for raising the present ceiling of  130 million on lending by a further 10 million, i.e., cumulatively, in each of the years 1968, 1969 and1970. Secondly, earlier action might be taken to bring into effectthat part of the Government^ option mortgage scheme which related to guarantees. The mortgage option scheme would come into effect in April 1968. It was a part of the scheme that the Governmentwould make arrangements with the building societies to guarantee100 per cent mortgages to house buyers who chose to take out an option mortgage. Hitherto it had been envisaged that this guarantee element would come into operation some time after themain scheme. If, however, it could be introduced in April 1968, withthe main scheme, this would help to maintain the sale of houses inthe private sector. The cost over the next year would be less than 1 million. It would be necessary to consult the building societiesbefore this action could be taken.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that it would be quitewrong to envisage any reduction in the public sector programme inScotland. That programme envisaged the completion of 38,000houses in 1970 and there was indeed a case for an increase to 40,000because of the likely shortfall in the performance of the private sector. There was no ground for assuming that it would be impossibleto achieve the present programme and this should remain theGovernments objective.SECRET8201 b
In discussion, it was argued that housing should be given higher priority than the other social services since it catered for even morebasic needs. The recent survey of the housing stock had shown thatwe were making insufficient progress in meeting housing standards which were still unacceptably low. The housing programme had little effect on the balance of payments. The Government were fullypledged to the target of 500,000 houses in 1970 and should not retreatfrom this. On the other hand it was argued that it was necessary tomaintain a reasonable balance between housing and the other social programmes. It was, for instance, not possible to increasehousebuilding without a parallel increase in accompanying services such as roads. To complete 500,000 houses in 1970 would call for additional taxation amounting to about  100 million in order toprevent excessive pressure of demand. Bearing in mind that it wasimpossible to determine precisely the number of houses built by private builders, the Government could scarcely be accused of bad faith if we were to fall short of the 500,000 target by, say, 10,000 oreven 20,000 houses.In further discussion it was suggested that some reduction in theprogramme of local authority houses built for renting need not imply that the Government were abandoning the 500,000 target. It mightwell be that the private sector would make good any reduction in thelocal authority programme. There were now strong signs of recovery in the private sector and the introduction of the option mortgagescheme would provide a further stimulus. Moreover, the characterof the housing problem was now changing. After 1970, it was clearthat the overall shortage of houses would be overcome, thoughshortages would persist in particular areas. The emphasis wouldthen shift to slum clearance and the improvement of the housingstock and it would probably be wise in many areas to increase theproportion of houses built for sale at the expense of those built forletting. There might be advantages in beginning this switch of emphasis before 1970. This might be done by authorising localauthorities to build houses for sale to the,extent necessary to offsetany reduction in their programme of houses for letting. This would help to cater for the increasing demand which was evident in some areas from young people who did not want to rent a local authorityhouse, but were not in a position to buy a privately built house. Theadvantage of an increase in the number of houses built for sale bylocal authorities over leaving the private sector to secure this increase was that there would be a definite assurance that the local authorities would complete any agreed programme, whereas there could be nosuch assurance as regards the private sector. A house built for saleby a local authority could be expected to involve a smaller cost tothe Exchequer than a house built for letting. If the consequentsaving to the Exchequer were appreciable, it might be possible to achieve adequate savings on the housing programme while stillmaintaining the total size of the local authority programme, with areduction in the number of houses built for letting offset by anincrease in those built for sale. It would be necessary to make anestimate of what the saving to the Exchequer would be if there were a reduction of, say, 10,000 in the programme of houses for letting
SECRET&quot;l 1     314accompanied by an increase of 10,000 houses built by the localauthorities for sale.It was suggested, however, that local authorities might not beprepared to co-operate in a major expansion of building for sale; atpresent they were building only some 1,500-1,800 houses per annum for sale. The private builders would be likely to oppose an expansion of local authority building for sale and might claim thatthis would be a breach of undertakings given by Ministers that localauthorities would not enter this field on any major scale. On theother hand, the private builders should benefit from an increase in local authority building for sale since the actual construction of thehouses would fall to them. Moreover, such an increase could resonably be presented to the private builders as a measure designedto maintain continuity of demand and the momentum of the housing programme, which was their primary concern.The following points were also made:(a) It was suggested that the creation of a National HousingLoans Corporation to undertake mortgage lending, particularly topurchasers of old houses where the building societies would not normally be prepared to give mortgages, might be a useful means of stimulating housing in the private sector without incurring the extra cost to the Exchequer which would be involved in raising the presentlimit on mortgage lending by local authorities. The Lord president had circulated proposals on this matter to the Ministerial steering committee on Economic Policy.(b) The dissatisfaction which had been caused by localauthorities refusing mortgages because they had reached the limitimposed on their lending might be mitigated if early agreement couldbe reached on the limit on lending for next year and if the localauthorities, instead of refusing mortgage applications outright, wereto follow the practice of the building societies and place the applicants on a list for mortgages to be made available as soon asfunds permitted.Education The Secretary of State for Education and Science said that expenditure on education over the next few years would necessarilyincrease because of the increase in the number of pupils. this situation would continue until the early 1970s, when there would be some reduction in numbers. The present programme made no special provision for the extension of comprehensive schools withthe result that unsatisfactory arrangements such as split schools were having to be accepted. The provision in the programme for replacement of sub-standard schools was smaller than it had beenunder the previous Administration and was extremely low whenmeasured against the backlog of requirements. Only slow progress was being made in the reduction in the size of classes and we were unlikely to reduce the average size to 30 until the 1980s. In the universities, the problem was also one of increasing numbers andthe estimates of student intake in the Robbins Report were being
exceeded. There was also a number of further proposals for expenditure, some of which had already been discussed by Ministers,which were not included in the basic programme but which shouldbe taken into account. They included action to implement therecommendations of the Plowden Report on educational priorityareas and other matters, at an estimated cost of  45 million, including expenditure of  11 million for which the need was urgent; proposalsfor the Open University; provision for new Medical Schools whichwould certainly be recommended by the Todd Commission due toreport early in 1968; provision to enable more students to get intothe universities, for research computers, educational technology andthe retraining of teachers. The Government were publicly committed to implement some of these proposals. The estimate of expenditureon education in 1970-71 in the basic programme already showed areduction of  20 million resulting from a revised forecast of the futuresupply of teachers. This was in contrast to the position on the programmes for transport and housing, where it was proposed that account should be taken in the current review of expenditure whichhad not been included in the basic programmes. The Cabinet hadalready agreed to an increase in the price of school meals from Is. toIs. 6d., conditional upon the introduction of a satisfactory scheme of family endowment. The school meals service was an integral partof the education service; it had always been considered as part of educational expenditure in previous reviews and any savings from anincrease in charges here should count against the savings to beachieved on the educational programme. A saving of  5 million in1970-71 could be achieved by the withdrawal of the free milk service from secondary schools; there was now a considerable body ofopinion in favour of this. Any saving here should also count againstthe savings to be secured from the education, programme. He was opposed to postponement of the raising of the school-leaving agebeyond 1970-71. A pledge to raise the age in that year had beenimplicit in the 1945 Education Act and had subsequently been endorsed by the Crowther and NeWsom Reports, by the previous administration and by the present Government. It would be politically indefensible to propose postponement at this stage. Hewas ready to consider the feasibility of securing savings by replacinga part of the present grants to university students by loans, butlegislation would be required and it would not be possible to secure any appreciable savings by 1970-71. He was also prepared toexamine the possibilities of some savings on student support.Probably the best way to secure savings here would be to refrain from increasing the present level of grants and to allow their value tobe eroded by rising prices. There were other possibilities of savings which could be examined, including some limit on the increase in manpower by measures to improve productivity, and a possibleextension of increases in student fees beyond those which he hadalready introduced. He could not, however, attempt to quantify thetotal savings which might be achieved until he knew the views of hiscolleagues on the extent to which expenditure should be authorisedon the further proposals he had mentioned which were not includedin the present basic programme.
The Secretary of State for Scotland said he did not favour anypostponement of the raising of the school-leaving age. Theproportion of pupils staying at school beyond the age of 15 had been steadily increasing in Scotland so that, if the leaving age were raised in 1970-71, there was unlikely to be a large sudden increase in numbers. It would be politically indefensible to postpone the raising of the leaving age on the grounds of financial stringency.Postponement would have a particularly adverse effect on the children of poorer families since the proportion of such children who stayedon voluntarily beyond the age of 15 was much smaller than theproportion of children in better-off families. Changes had alreadybeen made in the school-building programme on the assumption thatthe leaving age would be raised in 1970-71 and any postponement would cause considerable disruption. There was a strong case forsecuring savings on student support, bearing in mind particularly the considerable numbers of students who went to work in other countriessoon after leaving university. Savings here would be likely to be acceptable to the general public. The minimum grant of  50 a yeartowards university fees which was paid irrespective of parentalincome was no longer justified and should be abolished. An increaseof 6d. in the price of school meals would be acceptable in Scotland,quite apart from the provision for family endowment, bearing in mind that there was already remission of charges for those in need.In discussion the following points were made:(c) Strong opposition was expressed to any postponement ofthe raising of the school-leaving age. The fact that the proportionof children staying at school voluntarily beyond the age of 15 was increasing meant that the cost of raising the leaving age would bereduced and also made it more important to raise the age, becauseif this were not done the dwindling minority of children leaving atthe age of 15 would come increasingly to constitute a separatedepressed class of society; and the general effect would be to increasesocial divisions. Postponement would be seen as an attack on Stateeducation and could be expected to stimulate the growth of privateeducation. If action were deferred in 1970-71, this would strengthen the hand of those who were opposed to raising the leaving age at anytime; and there would be a real danger of indefinite postponement.Postponement would not help to reduce the average size of classes in the long term: the only effect would be to defer a reduction inprimary schools for a few years.(d) There was support for the view that any savings on school meals and milk should count against the savings to be achieved onthe education programme. But if savings on school meals werecounted in this way, they could not also be reckoned as offsettingthe cost of family endowment.(e) If the free milk service were withdrawn from secondary schools this would have an adverse effect on milk producers; the selective expansion programme in agriculture was geared to thecontinuance of the demand for milk in schools.   There was no
consensus of medical opinion on whether the withdrawal of free milkin secondary schools would have adverse nutritional effects.(/) It was suggested that when the Cabinet came to considerfamily endowment it would be worth examining the desirability of supplementing any endowment scheme by relief from charges for school meals for example by the issue of vouchers for free meals-for those in need. It was pointed out, however, that there were already arrangements for the remission of charges for school mealsfor poorer and larger families.(g) Some savings could be looked for in expenditure on the universities and this would be particularly necessary if it were decided not to postpone the raising of the school-leaving age. It was suggestedhowever that it would be difficult to secure reductions in expenditure,though it might be possible to allow the number of university studentsto increase above the estimates in the Robbins Report without incurring additional expenditure.Health The Minister of Health said that it would be difficult to makereductions in the staffs forecast for hospitals and for local authoritywelfare services. It was in the nature of these services that a high proportion of expenditure was on wages and salaries and the staffscould not be cut without damaging the services themselves: it was indeed questionable whether the approved establishments were adequate to provide a satisfactory level of services. He hoped,however, that some saving could be made in the number of ancillarystaff in hospitals in the light of the recommendation made by theNational Board for Prices and Incomes (NBPI) that there might bea cut of the order of 10 per cent in the number of staff as part of aproductivity bargain. This implied, however, that the reduction in expenditure would fall short of 10 per cent. Recruitment was in anycase difficult for all the health services because of the shortage of skilled manpower and relatively low rates of pay for unskilled grades.A number of studies were being made of the way in which manpowerat all levels could most economically be used and he would pursueenergetically all the possibilities of savings which might emerge fromthe recommendations of the NBPI and from the further studies.In discussion reference was made to the demands made uponskilled manpower by all the Governmenfs programmes ofexpenditure. It was questionable whether qualified men and women would be available in sufficient numbers to enable these programmes to be carried out.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that theproposals of the Chancellor of the Exchequer for a saving on thisblock of expenditure of  21 million amounted to a cut of 5 per centon expenditure which had already been heavily cut in July of theprevious year. The cut of 5 per cent was higher than the averagewhich was proposed elsewhere and might have damaging consequences on the provision of water supplies, sewerage and refusedisposal, as well as restricting the Governmenfs policy for thedevelopment of the countryside and for encouraging sport.Expenditure on town centres would also be restricted, with particularconsequences for the development areas.    It was doubtful ifLocalEnvironmentalServices
CC47(67)expenditure could be cut on all these services by more than some 8- 10 million.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer involved a relatively small cut in expenditure on sewerage and otherwise related solely to cuts in expenditure on parks and baths, planning (i.e., town centres andother redevelopment) and miscellaneous items, mainly involvinglocal authority offices and their equipment. It was the general viewthat there was considerable scope for the restriction of local authority expenditure in many of these fields, though it was urged that particular care should be taken not to restrict unduly expenditure onthe development of the countryside and on town centres in development areas.Remaining The Home Secretary said that the largest blocks of expenditureExpenditure jn j^jg were on Home Office Vote. It might well be possibleto make some saving in expenditure on civil defence, particularly ifthe Territorial and Army Volunteer Reserve could be run down.The heaviest expenditure was, however, on police and prisons.Expenditure on police was not increasing at a rate above the generalaverage and could not be restricted unless local authorities wereprevented from recruiting up to the level of their approvedestablishments. This would involve legislation, a course whichcould hardly be contemplated. The only way in which it might bepossible to reduce the requirements for numbers of police in later years was by increasing expenditure in the near future on additionaland improved equipment. The additional expenditure which was involved on prisons was for the most part outside the Governmenfscontrol, since even after taking account of the effect which thepassing of the Criminal Justice Bill might have in reducing prisonsentences and of other measures which the Government were taking to that end, it was estimated that the prison population would increase from the present figure of some 35,500 to about 41,500 in1970-71. It would clearly be unacceptable that the Governmentshould declare themselves unable to imprison those who had been properly sentenced by the courts. The additional expenditure made very little provision for improvements in prisons or prison sanitation,most of which was still disgraceful. In general, in consideringexpenditure on police and prisons it must be borne in mind that themaintenance of law and order was the basic duty of any Government.In discussion it was suggested that there might be advantage in increasing during the current year expenditure on improvedequipment for police forces, in order to lessen the burden of such expenditure in later years and also to increase the possibility thatpolice establishments might justifiably be reduced towards the endof the period. It would help the industries concerned if orders forcars and wireless equipment could be placed now, while there wasspare capacity, rather than later when demand for these productswas likely to be increasing generally. It was pointed out that difficulty would arise to the extent that half the cost of the equipment was
borne by local authorities, but there was general agreement that this possibility should be pursued.In further discussion it was urged that savings could not beachieved on overseas information, which indeed might well beincreased in the interests both of our trade and of our influenceworld-wide at a time when our defence expenditure overseas wasbeing substantially reduced. It was also urged that although therewas considerable scope for reductions in some fields of expenditureon governmental research and technology, such support for industry should justifiably be increased on purely economic grounds. It wasalso urged that in considering reductions in remaining fields ofexpenditure, consideration should be given to the possibility of reducing expenditure on colour television, local radio and other similar projects; and it was noted that expenditure on the ChannelTunnel would, on present plans, be met from private capital.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion, saidthat there should now be an interdepartmental examination by officials of expenditure classified in C (67) 125 as remainingexpenditure. This examination should include expenditure on colour television, on the establishment of local radio stations and on theextension of the BBC programme of &quot; pop &quot; music. It should also include expenditure on the change to decimal currency. the interdepartmental examination should be on the basis that officials should show by what means it would be possible to achieve netsavings of  50 million in all these fields. It should also take intoaccount the extent to which it might be advantageous to increaseexpenditure in the current year on police equipment in order to make possible savings in police expenditure in subsequent years.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for an interdepartmental examination^ by officials of the field ofremaining expenditure on the lines indicated by thePrime Minister.The Minister of Overseas Development said that, although theChancellor of the Exchequer had proposed that expenditure on aid should rise by between  5 million and  10 million in 1970-71, thisapparent increase was achieved only by adding to the programme the food aid which the Government had agreed as part of thediscussions on cereals in the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations and by adding also the mitigatory aid to be given to Singapore and malaysia as our forces were withdrawn.  Food aid was an item ina commercial bargain which the Government had made not connectedwith the aid programme; and mitigatory aid in the Far East waspart of the price necessary to achieve a much greater saving inoversea military expenditure.   The effect of the proposals of theChancellor of the Exchequer would not be to increase the aid programme, but to maintain for the next three years a reductionimposed upon it as part of the emergency measures which had beenagreed in the previous July; and it would thus be 9 per cent belowthe figure approved for 1966-67. The true position was in fact evenworse, in that the aid programme, unlike nearly all other programmes,
would continue to be based on current prices instead of on constant prices and its real value would in consequence fall even more. Inhis memorandum (C (67) 120) he had shown that the cost of the aid programme to the balance of payments was only about one-third ofthe gross expenditure and that repayments of capital and interest,currently running at about  60 million a year, should also be takeninto account. If the aid programme were held at  205 million, weshould be unable to make our contribution to the replenishment ofthe International Development Association (IDA) at a proper levelwithout damage to our bilateral programmes. The IDA was the most efficient international aid-giving body; for every pound we put into it, Commonwealth countries got  6 out and we obtained 30s. in export orders. The United States had proposed a replenishment rising to four times the present level, but had also proposed that the aid should be tied. We could not afford an increase of this order, but ifwe could contribute to replenishment at twice the present level wecould reasonably expect to obtain international agreement thataid given by the IDA should not be tied and there would be considerable consequential advantages to our balance of payments.In considering the level of our aid programme, we must have regardto our moral obligations and to the leadership which we had hithertoprovided in this field.In discussion it was urged that particular importance attachedto the increase in our contribution to the IDA, both on general grounds and because of the particular benefit to our balance ofpayments which it was estimated would ensue. It was also urgedthat, since much of our bilateral aid was tied to United kingdom exports or was to provide technical assistance, the cost of which rosewith any general increase of prices, it was unreasonable that the totallevel of the aid programme should continue to be based on currentrather than constant prices. On the other hand, it was argued thataid, unlike other governmental programmes, was given and accepted in cash terms and that it would be contrary to the Governmentsinterest to accept that it would automatically rise with rising prices.Even on the restricted level proposed by the Chancellor of theExchequer, the extent of our aid would still compare reasonablywith aid provided by other Western nations. Furthermore, it mustbe borne in mind that in this field it was necessary to allow for substantial unexpected expenditure to meet new developments, suchas the aid which had had to be provided for Zambia in consequenceof the illegal declaration of independence by Rhodesia or theadditional aid which it might be necessary to provide in the middle east in consequence of the recent hostilities there.The Cabinet (2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a subsequent meeting,at which they would first consider expenditure on social security.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,12th July, 1967.
