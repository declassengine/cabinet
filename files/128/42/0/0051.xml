Rhodesia(previous reference:CC (67) 38thConclusions,Minute 1)CC 51 (67)secret the Cabinet met to consider what action the Governmentshould take as a result of oral reports made to the Prime Ministerand the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Affairs byLord Alport, formerly British High Commissioner to the Federationof Rhodesia and Nyasaland, after his recent visit to Rhodesia.The Commonwealth Secretary said that Lord Alport had been invited to visit Rhodesia on behalf of the Government for thepurpose of assessing the climate of opinion there in relation to apossible settlement, because of his knowledge of the country and because he was a known opponent of the illegal regime. At the outset of his visit Lord Alport had been cold shouldered but laterlarge numbers of Rhodesians of all races and shades of opinionhad come to see him, including representatives of the ZimbabweAfrican National Union and the Zimbabwe African PeoplesUnion, although he had been refused access to those leaders ofthe two latter parties who were in detention. He had foundwidespread eagerness among Europeans for a solution of the rhodesian problem, although they were universally opposed to early majority rule or to any settlement based on the Governmenfscommitment not to grant independence before majority AfricanRule (n.i.b.m.a.r.). Mr. Smith was still in control of the illegal regime but support for him had weakened since the breakdown ofthe talks held in HMS Tiger; then he had had the support of morethan 80 per cent of the European population but it appeared thatthis might now have been reduced to something of the order of60 per cent. His strongest support came from the civil service,police, junior ranks of the armed forces, housewives and artisans,whereas businessmen were in general less strongly behind him,although some had benefited from the need to diversify their activities following the imposition of economic sanctions.Mr. Smith himself appeared troubled about his own position inrelation to his support in Rhodesia, though no more inclined than hitherto to make concessions to our own requirements for asettlement; he might be moving away from the extremists of the rhodesian Front but it was doubtful whether he would be willingor able to break with them or would survive politically if he wereto try. Recent events in the Congo and Nigeria and the attacksmade on us by Zambian leaders were however helping to consolidateEuropean opinion behind Mr. Smith.Economic sanctions would not bring decisive results quicklybut they were hurting the business community and also the Africanpopulation, some of whom were having to return to Malawi andto the tribal areas in Rhodesia because of unemployment. AmongAfrican opinion, politicians and trade unions wished to see economic sanctions ended; they supported a constitutional settlement of the type drawn up on HMS Tiger linked to n.i.b.m.a.r. and they had also expressed a feeling of relief at the general freedom fromterrorism in Rhodesia since the illegal declaration of independence.8205
Lord Alporfs view was that there would be tactical advantagefor us in moving slowly towards negotiations with the illegal regime, while maintaining our position but seeking to create difficulties between Mr. Smith and the extremists in the regimewho were opposed to any talks with us. Lord Alport had put aseries of questions to Mr. Smith on our behalf, although withoutthe authority to press for answers to them or to negotiate. the answers he had received had indicated that Mr. Smith might beable to obtain the authority to negotiate a settlement with us if a firm basis for such a settlement were found before the end of theyear, but that n.i.b.m.a.r. was unacceptable to the regime and thatit was unlikely that Mr. Smith would be able to make the substantial and guaranteed changes in Rhodesia that we should require before it would be open to us to reconsider n.i.b.m.a.r. in consultation withthe other Commonwealth Governments concerned. Mr. Smith had however said that, if certain changes could be made in the Tigerconstitution, he would be willing to seek approval for it in ageneral election in Rhodesia; but we did not know whether the changes he had in mind were minor or important. Lord Alportdid not feel that there could be any certainty of success inreopening negotiations with the illegal regime, but considered thatwe should nevertheless seek to clarify what changes in the Tigerconstitution Mr. Smith would wish to see.The Prime Minister said that Lord Alport had not been ableto establish whether there could be worthwhile discussions withMr. Smith which would offer the hope of a settlement.Nevertheless, Lord Alport had advised that the Government shouldtake an initiative, partly because he feared that the situation woulddeteriorate, leading either to the establishment of a Republic or toeffective dominance by South Africa and partly because he took theview that an initiative at this stage offered the possibility ofincreasing the split in the illegal regime between the extremistsand the moderates. It was to be expected that the former would oppose any kind of discussions and -might be correspondinglyinclined to seek to overthrow Mr. Smith if they were started.In these circumstances, there were three possible courses ofaction open to the Government. We could do nothing, apart fromintensifying sanctions wherever possible and in particularstrengthening the action to be taken against imports of oil forRhodesia through Mozambique. Alternatively, we could make useof the fact that Mr. Smith had said that the Tiger constitution mightbe acceptable to him, subject to certain changes, and we could playfor time by seeking for clarification of what he had in mind. Ifthe changes proved to be minor in character only, this might offer some prospect of a further move. If, on the other hand, it emergedthat Mr. Smith was concerned to re-establish a constitutionalmechanism by which the regime in power could at their discretionimpose a brake on the movement to an African majority in theLegislature, then clearly this would be wholly unacceptable to us.It should be borne in mind that Mr. Malcolm MacDonald, theUnited Kingdom Special Representative in Central and East Africa,
had advised that the Commonwealth countries with which he was concerned could be brought to accept the fact that enquiries werebeing made of Mr. Smith on the basis of clarifying his attitude in this respect. The third course would be to appoint a RoyalCommission to ascertain if the Tiger constitution was acceptable to opinion in Rhodesia as a whole, either as a basis for earlyindependence or as a constitution which would provide for continued constitutional dependence until majority rule. Theappointment of such a Commission would be in accord with theGovernments fifth principle regarding the need for any constitution to be acceptable to the people of Rhodesia as a whole; furthermore,its appointment would offer a better prospect than the second courseof leading to a split in the illegal regime.The Ministers primarily concerned had discussed these possible courses of action and had come to the conclusion that, in presentcircumstances, the best course was the second, that is that weshould ascertain, through the Governor and the Head of ourResidual Mission in Rhodesia, what amendments Mr. Smith would wish to see made in the Tiger constitution. Thereafter, theCommittee had taken the view that it would be appropriate if in early September the Commonwealth Secretary were to visit Africafor some form of discussion, or conference, with Heads of AfricanCommonwealth Governments. The purpose of such discussions would be firstly to seek their agreement on the attitude which shouldbe adopted by members of the Commonwealth at the forthcoming meeting of the General Assembly of the United Nations towardssanctions and in particular on the need to tighten our control of oil passing through Mozambique, while not extending sanctions to south Africa. Secondly, the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s purpose would be to consider with the Commonwealth Heads of Governmentin question the possibility of there being further talks with the illegal regime, including the possibility of appointing a RoyalCommission on the basis he had outlined.     -In these circumstances, the Ministers concerned had taken the view that the statement to be made in Parliament later in theweek should begin by reaffirming that it remained the government&apos;s policy not to grant independence to Rhodesia before majorityAfrican rule. The statement should add that Lord Alport had notreported as a result of his visit that there was any possibility of effective discussions with the illegal regime leading to an acceptablesettlement, but that it appeared that Mr. Smith took the view thata constitution based on that drawn up in HMS Tiger might prove an acceptable basis for discussions, subject to certain amendments.It had not been within the scope of Lord Alports visit to ascertain what those amendments might be and the Government were accordingly seeking clarification of Mr. Smith&apos;s views on this aspect,through the Governor of Rhodesia and the Head of our ResidualMission there.In discussion there was some support for the course of settingup a Royal Commission to investigate the acceptability to the
people of Rhodesia as a whole of a settlement of the Rhodesianproblem on the basis of the Tiger constitution. The general view was however that to attempt to do so at this stage would raise suchserious opposition among the Governmenfs supporters inParliament, in Commonwealth countries and in the United nations that it should be ruled out. On the other hand the view was expressed that we should recognise that Lord Alporf s mission haddemonstrated that there was no likelihood of negotiating with the illegal regime in Rhodesia a solution acceptable to us and that, inthese circumstances, it would be against our interests and policy to make any new move now; even such a limited move wouldhave serious adverse effects among the Governmenfs supporters inParliament, in Commonwealth countries and in the United Nations,since it would be taken as a sign of weakness and of a willingnesson our part to see the Tiger constitutional proposals modified tomeet the wishes of the illegal regime, which would gain strength ifwe were to attempt to reopen negotiations despite its obdurateattitude. The general view of the Cabinet was however that weshould take a positive step as a result of Lord Alporfsrecommendations and that we should be able to defend successfullywith other Commonwealth Governments and in the United Nationsan attempt to elucidate through the Governor of Rhodesia what changes in the Tiger constitution Mr. Simth had in mind if it wereto provide a basis which he could accept for a settlement of the rhodesian problem. This would provide us with essential material for the formulation of our policy towards Rhodesia. In announcingit we should stress that our policy continued to be based on n.i.b.m.a.r. and that economic sanctions against the illegal regimewould be maintained and intensified. To this end an approach was being made that day to Dr. Muller, the South African Ministerfor External Affairs, to seek to persuade the South african government to use their influence with the Portuguese Governmentto induce the latter to give effect to any resolution passed in theUnited Nations to restrict the supply of oil to Rhodesia throughMozambique; there was in any event no reason to suppose that theSouth African Government would make good any resulting shortfall of supplies to the illegal regime. Publicity should also be givento the respects in which the recently published Rhodesian Budget,which purported to show a healthy financial situation in the country,did not represent the true situation. Use might be made of thefact that financial institutions in Rhodesia regarded the Rhodesianpound as being worth no more than 8s. to 11s. sterling.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed on balance that further limited action should betaken as a result of Lord Alporf s mission. They were howeveragreed that a Royal Commission should not at this stage beappointed to investigate the acceptability to opinion in Rhodesiaof a constitution on the lines of that drawn up in HMS Tiger. Thebalance of opinion was in favour of seeking to elucidate throughthe Governor of Rhodesia what Mr. Smith&apos;s attitude was towardsthe Tiger constitution, what changes he had in mind and whether in the light of these it appeared that there was a possible basis for
SECRET- 7.343Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th July, 1967.negotiations. He would make a statement to this effect later that week, stressing also that the Governmenfs policy towards Rhodesiacontinued to be based on n.i.b.m.a.r. and on the maintenance andintensification of economic sanctions against the illegal regime.The Commonwealth Secretary should visit Heads of Government of commonwealth countries in Africa before the meeting of theGeneral Assembly of the United Nations in the middle ofSeptember to canvass their support for our policy of avoiding theuse of force against the illegal regime and the imposition of mandatory sanctions against South Africa. If, by the time thesevisits took place, exchanges with Mr. Smith had shown that the changes that he had in mind in the Tiger constitution were minor and in particular that they did not involve the reintroduction ofarrangements to prevent Africans from obtaining the politicaladvancement for which the Tiger constitution provided, it might then be possible to discuss with those Heads of Government the setting up of a Royal Commission to visit Rhodesia. It would however have to be clearly understood that such a RoyalCommission could only be set up if censorship were lifted in rhodesia and if detainees other than those who had committedcriminal offences were released.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, that the Prime Minister wouldmake a statement in Parliament about action on lord Alporfs report on the lines indicated in his summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to make arrangements to visit Heads of Commonwealth Governments in africa to canvass support for our policy in Rhodesia On thelines indicated by the Prime Minister, in advance of theforthcoming session of the General, Assembly of theUnited Nations.
