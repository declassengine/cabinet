CC 36 (67)secret. The Prime Minister said that, during his visit to Ottawa, had discussions with the Canadian Prime Minister, Mr. Pearson, hadbeen mainly concerned with the situation in the Middle East andthe possibility of action by the maritime nations to assert the freedomof navigation in the Gulf of Aqaba. The position of the canadian government had been somewhat reserved, partly owing to their internal differences. He had also had some discussion of the situationin Vietnam.In Washington his discussions with President Johnson about theMiddle East had shown that, perhaps for the first time in recentyears, the United States Government felt more in need of our supporton an international problem than we felt in need of theirs. Theywere clearly concerned at the possibility that they might beinternationally isolated in terms of the policy which they wished to pursue in the Middle East as they already were to a considerable extent as regards their policy in Vietnam; and they were as anxiousas ourselves that any action to ensure freedom of navigation in theGulf of Aqaba should be multilateral and should not be based solelyor primarily on United Kingdom and United States efforts. Thediscussions on this subject, however, had been largely overtaken bythe hostilities between Israel and the Arab States which had brokenout shortly after his return from Washington.In the discussions on Vietnam he had expressed to the Presidentour grave concern at the possibility that the extent and intensity of the conflict might increase and had made it clear that we mustfeel ourselves free at any time to take further initiatives in pursuit of a settlement if we judged it opportune to do so. It seemed likely that the extent of United States bombing of North Vietnam had beenmoderated to some extent; and there was no question but that theUnited States Administration were anxious to seek a settlement if one could be obtained on any reasonable terms. *In discussing our position in South-East Asia the President had opposed our intention to leave the mainland of Asia (save for HongKong) in the mid-1970s; but, perhaps because of the developments in the Middle East, this view had not been pressed as hard as we had previously expected and the United States Administration realised that we should take our decision in the light of our own interests,after considering the views of our allies. They were anxious that weshould succeed in our application to join the European communities and recognised that in the course of our negotiations it would benecessary for us to present the Anglo-American relationship in a manner which would involve the least incompatibility with ourprofessed desire to become more European in our outlook and policies. In this connection he had reminded President Johnson ofour earlier public statement that it would be desirable at some stage to renegotiate the Nassau Agreement. Indeed, the present visit had shown that the concept of a special relationship between the UnitedStates and ourselves was in any event undergoing a gradual
modification, although close relations in the shape of continuingconsultations on international affairs would no doubt continue.The Commonwealth Secretary said that in the course of his visit on behalf of the Prime Minister to the Expo &apos;67 Exhibition in montreal, he had had further evidence of the division of view in theCanadian Cabinet in respect of the Middle East. Expo &apos;67 wasproving an exceptional attraction, having had 9 million visitors so far;the British pavilion was outstanding.The Cabinet Took note of the statements by the Prime Minister and theCommonwealth Secretary.Middle East(previous reference:CC (67) 35thConclusions,Minute 2)secret. The Foreign Secretary said that, from the information available to us, it seemed that Israel had won a considerable initialvictory against the air forces of the Arab countries. Numbers of egyptian aircraft had been destroyed on the airfields and there hadbeen no reports or claims of Egyptian air action; although Syrianand Jordanian aircraft had been operating, they had been largelyineffective; there was no truth in the report that the oil refineryat Haifa had been bombed; nor had there been any air raids onTel Aviv and the shelling of the city from the sea had been ineffective.It was not however clear that Israel was achieving a comparablesuccess in the land battle in the south where a hard struggle was taking place: the Israelis were being reticent about its progress.Heavy fighting was taking place in Jerusalem where attempts tomaintain a cease fire had twice broken down after an initialacceptance; Israel appeared that day to have taken the offensive against Jordan following shelling by Jordanian troops. We were taking administrative action to delay the shipment of arms to middle east countries while an assessment was made of the attitudes andactions of other countries, including particularly those of France andthe Soviet Union; the United States had stopped the supply of arms to both sides. Our shipping had been warned to delay for 24 hoursany approach to the Suez Canal, which was now reported to be closed. British dependants and other civilians were being evacuated from the most dangerous areas and preparations were being made forfurther evacuations if necessary.He had seen the Ambassadors of the Arab States at their requeston the previous day. Their initial attitude had been one of strong protest and they had proposed recommending collectively to their governments the withdrawal of sterling balances, but he had succeeded in reassuring them about our attitude and no suchrecommendation would now be made. In most of the Arab capitalslocal forces now had the situation under control and earlier attacks on British property had ceased. Meanwhile exchanges were takingplace with the Governments of the United States, the Soviet Union,France and Italy and it might be that in due course it would be
possible to concert action towards a settlement of the crisis betweenthe four Great Powers, though much would depend on the courseof the fighting in the Middle East itself. In the Security Council, aresolution confined to an appeal for a cease fire had.failed to gainthe necessary support and it might be necessary for us to accept aresolution in.less satisfactory terms, as an alternative to a most undesirable failure on the part of the Council to agree on any resolution at all.The Defence Secretary said that the military assessment was thatIsrael had succeeded in eliminating the Egyptian Air Force; thiswould have a major effect on the land battle. There had beenallegations by Egypt and Jordan that Israel had been given air coverby British and United States, carrier-borne aircraft; this was completely untrue and, so far as we were concerned, physicallyimpossible; Iraqi troops had entered Jordan and in view of the israeli attack on the country it was likely that King Hussein would fall. Plans to evacuate British nationals by air from some of thecountries involved would be difficult to implement since the airfieldsthat we would need were closed and there was a risk that, if Algeriantroops moved through Libya on their way to the United arab republic (UAR), they would attack British forces and nationals there.There was no indication of any Soviet troop movements relevant tothe Middle East situation.In discussion doubts were expressed about the proposal that weshould support a resolution in the Security Council which wouldpurport not merely to deprive Israel of all the advantages that she would gain by successful military action but also to alter the situation to her disadvantage as compared with that which obtained before the events immediately leading to the present hostilities. There was general agreement, however, that it was of great importance for usto do what we could to avoiuLaNsituation in which the prestige of theUnited Nations was damaged irreparably by failure to take any action at all in the present crisis and that we would make it plain that,in voting for a resolution some parts of which were both unrealisticand contrary to the view that we held about such matters as the, rightof innocent passage through the Straits of Tiran, we were doing so with reservations in respect of those parts.As regards the supply, of arms to the Middle East, it was generally agreed that it was important to ensure that we did not hold up supplies to Israel if the Soviet Union continued to supply theArab States. It was not clear how the Soviet attitude would develop,particularly if it were to appear that Israel was likely to achieveoverwhelming victory, since this would mean a loss of prestige forher and also an increased possibility that Chinese communist influence would spread in the Middle East. The likelihood wasthat in these circumstances the Soviet Union would become willingto agree to an attempt by the major Powers to stop the fighting; a recent message to the Prime Minister from the Soviet Prime Minister,
Mr. Kosygin, had dealt only with attempts to stop the fighting andhad contained no recriminations or allegations of the kind that wereappearing in the Soviet Press. We should consider what the elements of a lasting settlement might be in the event of an Israeli victoryand also what action we should take if the present indications thatIsrael was succeeding in her military action were reversed and herdefeat became probable.The Cabinet were informed that events in the Middle East hadnot so far seriously affected the position of sterling. So far as possiblewe should not allow external events of the present kind to influenceour internal economic policy.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the action in the United Nations proposed bythe Foreign Secretary. There had been embarrassing Press commentabout the alleged views of individual Ministers at the cabinet&apos;s previous discussion: the origin of these comments should be investigated by the Lord Chancellor. As regards the presentsituation, it would no longer be appropriate to pursue the proposalfor a declaration by the maritime Powers on the right of innocentpassage through the Straits of Tiran; and contingency planning toenforce this right had been suspended. The Foreign Secretary would report further to the Cabinet at their next meeting on developments in the Middle East situation: the Ministers immediately concerned would decide as necessary on any action that was required meanwhileon arms supplies to the Middle East.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister^ summing up of their discussion.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to investigate the origin of recentPress speculation about the views expressed by individual ministers in earlier Cabinet discussions on the middle east.secret. The Commonwealth Secretary said that the main danger in nigeria at present was that irregular forces from the Northern Regionmight attack the Eastern Region in consequence of the declarationof independence by Colonel Ojukwu, the military Governor of thelatter. It did not, however, appear that there were any moves byregular forces of the Federal Government and it was significant that the Head of the Military Federal Government, Major-GeneralGowon, had recently appointed to the Executive Council a numberof civilians, including Mr. Awolowo, the main political leader inthe Western Region. The economic measures being taken by theFederal Government against the Eastern Region appeared to behaving some effect, but could not be expected to be decisive in the longer term. The United States Government had arranged to evacuate all United States women and children in the East. TheOverseaAffairsNigeria(previous reference:CC (67) 35thConclusions,Minute 3)
confidential. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the minister without Portfolio and the Minister of Social Security (C (67) 92) onthe legislation necessary to enable an interim increase in family allowances to be made in the autumn. The Cabinet had also beforethem a memorandum by the Minister of Social Security (C (67) 93)on the case for taking the necessary power.The Minister without Portfolio said that the Cabinet had previously decided that there should be no interim increase of family allowances in advance of a final decision on the form of a &quot; give and take &quot; scheme of family endowment, which must be deferred untilthe completion of the review of public expenditure. It had become apparent that if a decision on the need for an interim increase were so deferred it would not be possible, should the Cabinet eventuallydecide on an increase, to pass the necessary legislation before the summer Recess. This would mean that an interim increase couldnot coincide, as would be desirable for both practical andpresentational reasons, with the increase in national insurance benefits in October and possibly could not be introduced before Christmas.He had considered with the Lord President, the Minister of social security and the Chief Whip how the Government could best put themselves in a position to make an interim increase without prejudicing the decisions on the ultimate scheme; and they had reached the conclusion that the best, if not the only, way of enabling the increase to take effect in October, while reserving decisions onthe amount and scope of the increase until firm decisions on family endowment could be taken in the light of the review of public expenditure, was to include an enabling power in the national insurance Bill which would be introduced later that month. Thepower would be transitory and would provide for any Order madeunder it to cease to have effect in April 1968 when the new schemefor family endowment would come into operation. While the interim increase would be subsumed in the new scheme of family endowment,morale of British subjects in this area was excellent and, although we had arranged for dependants to be evacuated from the most dangerous parts of the East, we had not officially advised civiliansto leave and so far some of those evacuated had only been moved to safer areas of Nigeria. Preparations for evacuation had, however,been taken; two British ships were standing by in Port Harcourtand we should evacuate a number of civilians by air if necessary.No African country had as yet recognised the independence ofthe Eastern Region, nor had we ourselves yet had any request forsuch recognition from Colonel Ojukwu.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement by  the commonwealth secretary.
and would not prejudice decisions on the latter, the Cabinet should recognise that the taking of the power in the National insurance bill would virtually commit the Government to making some interim increase.The Minister of Social Security recalled that the Governmentwere committed to seek out and alleviate poverty affecting children and old people, and had given repeated assurances since November1965 that the problem of child poverty was being urgentlyconsidered. Pressure for improved family endowment would be revived by the publication later in the month of her Departments,survey of family circumstances and, because of the long delay in announcing the Government proposals, it was, in her view, imperative that interim provision should be made for an increase of family allowances to take effect, certainly before Christmas, but preferablyat the same time as the increases in national insurance benefits, since otherwise the dependency benefits for children would have to bereduced when the increased allowances were paid. If nothing were done, the increase in Supplementary Benefit in the autumn would further increase the number of families living below supplementary benefit level and the numbers affected by the &quot; wage stop &quot;. Thenumbers would also be increased by any rise in the level ofunemployment. While the amount and distribution of an interim increase in family allowances should be left for subsequent consideration, it was possible that the extra expenditure could most effectively be concentrated on the larger families, for example, byan increase of 4s. a week in the allowances for third and subsequent children.In discussion there was general agreement that, if an interim increase in family allowances were to be made, power to do so shouldbe taken in the forthcoming National Insurance Bill. It would notbe possible to enact before the Summer Recess a separate bill introduced after decisions had been taken in the light of the reviewof public expenditure, if the House rose as planned about thebeginning of August; nor would it be acceptable to leave over sucha Bill for completion in the autumn at the end of the Session. Tointroduce a Bill at the beginning of the new Session would not enable an interim increase to be made sufficiently in advance of theproposed general improvement in family endowment in April 1968.In further discussion it was suggested that a decision to take power to increase family allowances in the National Insurance bill was inconsistent with the Cabinets earlier view that a decision on an interim increase should await the outcome of the review of public expenditure. It would mean reverting to a piecemeal approach to theproblem of family provision, whereas the relative advantages ofincreasing cash allowances, as compared with increasing benefits in kind, ought to be more fully considered; and extra expenditure on family allowances would necessarily limit the possibilities, forexample, of implementing the recommendations of the PlowdenReport on primary education. An interim increase which would necessarily be small if it were not to prejudice subsequent decisions
on family endowment would have little impact on the problem of family poverty and would offend those who were opposed to anygeneral increase in the allowances, irrespective of needs. Manyfamilies with incomes below supplementary benefit level would obtainno advantage from an increase confined, as had been suggested, tolarger families, while some families with high incomes would benefit.It was suggested that consideration should be given to the adoptionof a more selective interim scheme related to need which would makea greater impact on family poverty and be less open to objection.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Cabinet hadalready reached a decision in principle against the adoption of any means-tested approach to family endowment. An interim increasein family allowances on a modest scale would not prejudicesubsequent decisions on improvements in family endowment, whetherthrough the adoption of a generalised &quot; give and take &quot; scheme, ora generalised improvement in family allowances without an element of &quot; give and take &quot; or a combination of the two. It would be unacceptable to wait until the following April before taking any action to relieve family poverty and the Government would be exposed to strong criticism if, while making provision for increases in the social security benefits of all other sections of the community,they made no extra provision for children.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet were agreed in principle that there should be an interim increase of family allowances to take effect concurrently withthe general increases in national insurance benefits at the end ofOctober; and that the legislative basis could best be provided by including in the National Insurance Bill a power operative until april 1968 to enable family allowances, if necessary for some only ofthe children in a family, to be increased by Order and national insurance dependency benefits for children to be correspondingly reduced. The Cabinet recognised that this would involve a commitment to make some increase, but the amount and distributionof the increase were left open for later decision in the light of the review of public expenditure and the increase would be subsumed inthe subsequent improvement in family endowment. While theCabinet had earlier decided against the adoption of any means-testedapproach to family endowment, the making of an interim increase in family allowances did not affect their subsequent freedom of choice between a &quot; give and take &quot; type of scheme, or a further general increase in family allowances, or a combination of the two.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Social Security to arrange for theinclusion in the forthcoming National Insurance Bill of aprovision to enable family allowances to be increased byOrder in accordance with the Prime Ministers summing upof their discussion.
confidential industrial *5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after discussionSituation previous day with the First Secretary of State, the President ofthe Board of Trade and the Minister of Technology, it had beendecided to carry out a measure of reflation in respect of the motorcar industry. This action was in accord with the economic strategywhich he had considered in February while preparing the Budget,when he had had in mind that such a measure might be desirableby the middle of the year. The mitigation of the existing restrictionson hire-purchase should stimulate the economy by increasingsubstantially the demand for, and the production of, motor carsduring the course of the year. We should not be deterred from taking such a measure, which was necessary for the health of the country&apos;internal economy, by the repercussions of the situation in the middle east on our external position. We should, however, bear in mind that it might prove necessary to reimpose the restrictions in come degree the following spring, though this would depend on the coursetaken by the economy in the intervening period.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,6th June, 1967.* Previously recorded in a Confidential Annex.CONFIDENTIAL
