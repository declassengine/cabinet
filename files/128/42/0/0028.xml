CC 28 (67)secret. The Prime Minister said that he wished to thank all hiscolleagues for the time and patience which they had devoted inrecent weeks to the Cabinefs discussion of the vital implications ofour decision to apply for membership of the European economic community (e.c.). It was the more important that, now that thedecision had been taken, the Cabinet should adhere firmly to theprinciple of collective responsibility in any public discussion of. thecase for entry into the Community and should not provide any grounds for allegations that they were in any way divided inpurpose.In discussion some disquiet was expressed about accountswhich were appearing in the Press purporting to indicate, on thebasis of information supplied from confidential sources, the attitude which individual members of the Cabinet had adopted during therecent discussions on the approach to Europe. These accounts,which were often wholly misleading, were damaging to theGovernment^ position both generally and in relation to thenegotiations with the Community which we should shortly have toundertake. It was essential that all Cabinet Ministers should draw the attention of junior Ministers and Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries to the implications of the Cabinet decision for their ownpositions on the lines which the Prime Minister had indicated attheir previous meeting. The Chief Whip should give furtherconsideration to any action which might be required in this respect.confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons the following week and also of the business to be taken in the first week after the Adjournment for the whitsun Recess.The Lord President recalled that at their meeting on Thursday,27th April, the Cabinet had been informed of the situation whichwould arise in connection with a book about the Suez episodewhich Mr. Anthony Nutting, formerly a junior Minister in theConservative Government in 1956, proposed to publish and toserialise in The Times. Now that the first extracts of the bookhad appeared in The Times, it might be necessary for him to makea statement in the House of Commons about certain of the issues to which it gave rise; but a decision on any action by the Governmentshould not be taken until after the book itself had been published.In discussion there was general agreement with this suggestion.The view was also expressed that it would not necessarily be expedient to acquiesce in any proposal which might be made forthe appointment of a Select Committee, or other form of inquiry,to investigate the Suez episode.
secret. The Foreign Secretary said that the Tripartite Agreementbetween the United States Government, the Federal GermanGovernment and ourselves on offset payments in respect of thecost in foreign exchange of our forces in Germany had now been concluded.The Foreign Secretary said that a British trawler had recentlybeen arrested by the Icelandic Police for allegedly fishing in Icelandicterritorial waters.   The trawler had subsequently escaped, with two policemen on board, but had later been rearrested by anIcelandic naval vessel on the high seas and taken back to Reykjavik. IThe Law Officers had advised that the arrest of the trawler on thehigh seas was contrary to international law, the provisions of whichit was particularly important to our interests to maintain in thisrespect.   Despite the uncertainty about the incidents which had Ipreceded the arrest on the high seas and further incidents which had jlater taken place in Reykjavik, we had accordingly protested to the icelandic Government and had urged that the trawler should be]released.The  Foreign  Secretary   said   that  he  had  given furtherconsideration, in the light of the Cabinefs previous discussion ofthe recent military coup in Greece, to the attitude which theGovernment should adopt towards the new Greek Government.Our Ambassador had been called back to the United Kingdom for!consultations and we were in close touch with the United States!and Federal German Governments, whose views were in accord!with our own.   It appeared that the prime movers in the couplwere disreputable and our actions must not be such as to imply Ithat we approved the outcome of the coup.  We should, however,achieve the most favourable result possible in the circumstancesif we continued to do business with the new Government andencouraged moves  towards  an appointment of a constituent!assembly to consider a new Greek Constitution; and we must express!the hope that there should be a return to Parliamentary democracjiat the earliest possible moment.

In discussion there was.agreement that if arms were currently being exported to Greece, such exports should be stopped for thetime being.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theDefence Secretary and the President of the Board ofTrade, to consider in the light of the discussion stoppingany further export of arms to Greece.The Commonwealth Secretary said that although the situationin Cyprus was still tense in consequence of the military coup in greece, there had been no further outbreaks of violence and calmwas being maintained.The Commonwealth Secretary said that our relations with the zambian Government had deteriorated somewhat in view of therecent anti-British statements made in Zambia by representativesof the Zimbabwe African National Union, one of the RhodesianNationalist parties. It was for consideration whether we should ask the Zambian Government to refuse to harbour representatives ofthe party in such circumstances. Enquiry was also being made about the accuracy of the Press reports of anti-British statements made by the Zambian High Commissioner Designate and it might prove necessary to withdraw the agrement to his appointment.The Cabinet (2) Took  note   of  the   statements   by  the  Foreign  and commonwealth Secretaries.Uprating of social security benefits(previous reference:CC (66) 58thConclusions,Minute 4)secret. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (C (67) 69) and the Minister of Social Security(C (67) 73) on the uprating of Social Security benefits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer recalled that the Cabinet, inthe context of their measures to restrict public expenditure andin the light of the best forecasts then available of the movementof prices and earnings, had earlier taken the view that the nextuprating of Social Security benefits should be 10s. for a single person&apos;s pension, and should take effect at the end of October 1967.In fact, owing to the success of the Governments policy on prices and incomes, prices and earnings had increased less than had beenforecast at that time and he now sought the agreement of theCabinet that the increase in the leading rate of national insurance benefits should be limited to 8s. or 8s. 6d., which would give
benefits the same purchasing power as the Cabinet had by their previous decision intended. The level of public expenditure in1968-69 was likely to present a severe problem and any increaseof Social Security benefits beyond what could be justified in termsof purchasing power would limit the Cabinefs freedom of decision in their subsequent general review of public expenditure.Limitation of the increase in the leading national insurance benefitrate to 8s would save  50 million a year in public expenditure ascompared with a 10s. increase, and over  10 million for theExchequer. Further, a substantial increase in contributions wouldin any event be required to take account of increased unemployment,sickness and retirement.. It was important to limit the furthercost of increased benefits falling not only on the working populationwhose incomes might have fallen, but also on employers, since thisled to an increase in industrial costs and prices generally.An increase in benefits of 8s. or 8s. 6d. would still givepensioners an improved standard of living as compared with March1965 after the last increase of benefits. There would therefore bea margin to meet any further increase in prices and on presentforecasts the increase in benefits he proposed would cover increases of prices for the following 18 months or so. Taking account ofthe large increase of 12s. 6d. given in 1965, the Governmenfsrecord during their first three years of office, would still compare favourably with the increases of 37s. 6d. given by the previous administration over 13 years.The Minister of Social Security said that, in so far as the choicelay between 8s. and 8s. 6d., the additional 6d. would not cause anysevere administrative difficulty. However, there were strong reasons for adhering to the previous decision of the Cabinet infavour of an increase of 10s. The Labour Party&apos;s 1964 election manifesto had promised that national insurance benefits would beraised and thereafter linked to average earnings, so that as earningsrose so too would benefits. An increase of 8s. 6d. in the leadingnational insurance rate would be 2s lid. less than would be requiredby the rise in earnings since 1965. Further, such an increase wouldprovide insufficient margin Is. 7d. to maintain the purchasingpower of benefits until they were next increased. It was likely that on the basis of an increase of 8s. 6d. the purchasing powerof benefits would, after the middle of 1968, fall below that ofMarch 1965 and the standard of living of pensioners would thenprogressively worsen until benefits were next increased, which was unlikely to be before 1970. This would be the first decline in thevalue of pensions which had been allowed to occur for over10 years. Pensioners were the poorest section of the community and if, under the policy on incomes, preference were to be givento the lowest paid wage earner, the pensioner should not be allowedto fall too far behind. The record of the Government would notcompare favourably with that of the previous Administration interms of proportionate increases in benefit rates, since thatAdministration had given increases of 125 per cent over 13 yearscompared with the 30 per cent by which the present Government
would, on the basis of an increase of 8s. 6d., have raised benefitsbetween 1964 and 1970. While an increase in contribution of between 4s. 4d. and 5s. would be needed for an increase of 10s. in benefits, an increase of 8s. 6d. in benefits would reduce thisextra contribution by only 6d. She still had under considerationhow the contribution should be divided between employer and employee.In discussion it was suggested that an increase of 8s. 6d. inthe leading rate of national insurance benefits might be generally acceptable if associated with improved provision to relieve childpoverty; but, because of the time required for legislation andadministrative preparations, a decision on the amount of thenational insurance increase to take effect at the end of October mustbe reached in advance of the Cabinefs forthcoming review ofpublic expenditure. It was suggested that in order to avoid prejudicing decisions on social service expenditure generally, andon family endowment in particular, it was important to limit theincrease of national insurance benefits to the amount required tomaintain their real value. Too large an increase of benefits at thisstage would risk premature stimulation of consumer expenditure.If prices rose more quickly than expected, it might be possible tobring forward the next increase in benefits to 1968 or 1969.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Cabinefs earlier decision in favour of an increase of 10s. had itself been a compromise. Since the economic outlook was now morefavourable than it had been when that decision was taken, therewas no reason to depart from it now. An increase as low as 8s. 6d.would intensify the criticism that the Government were givinginadequate help to the poorest members of the community and itcould not be assumed that it would, in fact, be possible to bring forward the next increase of benefits if prices rose so as to reducethe purchasing power of benefits below the 1965 standard. Anincrease of 10s. given now would provide greater flexibility in the timing of the next increase.In further discussion there was general agreement that it was essential as a minimum to maintain the purchasing power of social security benefits, and it was suggested that 9s. was the smallestincrease which could ensure this over a reasonable period.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that the increase in the weekly rate ofnational insurance benefit for a single person to be given at theend of October should be 9s. The other rates should be increased on a proportionate basis. It was desirable as a matter of presentation that the improvements for pensioners should bepublished a little in advance of any general improvement in family endowment, and accordingly, on the assumption that anannouncement on family endowment would be possible in July,the national insurance increases should be announced soon after themiddle of June, when legislation would in any event be required.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the standard rate of national insurance benefit for a single person should be increased by 9s. a week atthe end of October 1967.(2) Invited the Minister of Social Security, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, to settle the increases to be given in the rates of war pension and subsidiarynational insurance benefit rates, which should beproportionate to the increases in the standard rate, andthe appropriate increases in the rates of contribution.(3) Invited the Minister of Social Security, in consultation withthe Lord President of the Council, to arrange for thepublication of the proposed increases in benefits and in contributions in accordance with the summing up oftheir discussion by the Prime Minister.EconomicSituation .Bank Rate(previous reference:CC (67) 13thConclusions,Minute 5)secret. The Chancellor of the Exchequer informed the Cabinet thatBank Rate would be reduced that day from 6 per cent to 5\ per cent.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer.SECRETConcessionary        6.  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the MinisterFares .without Portfolio (C (67) 74) on concessionary fares.The Minister without Portfolio said that the Home AffairsCommittee had been unable to agree at a recent meeting to aproposal that the Minister of Transport should make an early statement indicating the Governments intention to introduce legislation enabling local authorities outside London to extend to non-municipal bus undertakings the arrangements which they wereempowered to make for concessionary fares for local journeys ontheir own buses and to lay a statutory obligation on both the municipal and non-municipal operators to give concessions to children up to school-leaving age. The legislation was proposed as a means of removing fresh anomalies resulting from the TravelConcessions Act, 1964, which empowered local authorities to giveconcessions on their own buses but gave rise to difficulty where those buses were organised in conjunction with non-municipaloperators or served areas also served by such operators. TheMinister of Transport had informed the House of Commons on 4th May, 1966, that the Government intended to review the anomalies to see what amending legislation, if any, was necessary and   there   was   considerable   pressure   for   a   statement.
8151bMr. Bob Brown, m p, had introduced a Private Member&apos;s Bill with similar purposes but in an unsatisfactory form. This had receiveda Second Reading but the Minister of Transport hoped to be ableto persuade Mr. Brown to withdraw the Bill before the committee stage if she could make a statement of the Government&apos;s intentionto legislate themselves. It was estimated that the proposals would raise the cost of the concessions from about  2^ million a year atpresent to a maximum of  9 million, of which  5 million would fall on the Exchequer; and if the concessions were extended toLondon, which would be considered after the re-organisation ofLondon Transport, the potential cost, assuming that all authoritiesexercised the new powers, would be  14 million.In the Home Affairs Committee there had been some criticism of the principle of helping the elderly and disabled, by the extensionof concessions in kind and of a proposal which would lay additionalburdens on both the Exchequer and the rates. Apart from the merits, on which no decision had been taken, however, theCommittee thought that it would be premature to commit theGovernment to this further expenditure in advance of considerationof the public expenditure review and of a number of other formsof social security payment which would fall to be considered at thesame time. They though that the normal procedure should befollowed of declining to provide a Financial Resolution for a bill which would involve increased public . expenditure and that theMinister should, if necessary, say that the question of extending the travel concessions would be considered in the context of the reviewof public expenditure.The Minister of Transport said that she had asked for thematter to come to the Cabinet because of the political difficultiesof the situation. The Travel Concessions Act, 1964, had been a highly popular measure and the continuing existence of anomalieswas correspondingly irritating to the public. The Prime minister had suggested before the election of 1966 that some statement should be made that the Government would review the Act and she had so informed the House of Commons on 4th May, 1966.She had been under continuing pressure to announce the outcome of the review but the immediate cause of her embarrassment wasthe fact that the Private Member&apos;s Bill had been allowed to receive a Second Reading, the Legislation Committee taking the view thatit would be illogical to oppose a Bill with the purposes of which theGovernment were in sympathy. It would be unusual to refuse a financial Resolution where a Second Reading had not been opposed and if she could not state the Government^ intention to legislate, even without a commitment as to the date, she was not clear how Mr. Bob Brown could be persuaded to withdraw hisBill or how he could justify its withdrawal to his constituents.The Prime Minister said that in the normal course the HomeAffairs Committee&apos;s decision not to authorise an early statement would have been final but he had agreed to the matter coming
before the Cabinet because the situation described by the Ministerof Transport raised political considerations which he thoughtneeded further examination. The question of concessionary fareshad been prominent during the election of 1964 and the remaininganomalies undoubtedly caused resentment.In discussion it was pointed out that the Home AffairsCommittee had taken no decision on the merits of the proposals but only on the suggestion that the Government should commit themselves to legislation in advance of the public expenditurereview. They ought not to allow the existence of the private member&apos;s Bill to deflect them from the orderly process of considering claims on public expenditure and it would in any event be unwise to depart from the normal practice of refusing a financial Resolution to a Bill imposing expenditure on theExchequer. The problem of travel concessions was a complicatedmatter which would need careful consideration if the creation offurther anomalies were to be avoided. It was suggested that there might be a case for a more limited scheme than that proposed bythe Minister of Transport, designed to remove the anomalies which arose, for example, where elderly people had been moved to somedistance from the city, in which they still wished to visit friends andrelatives and in areas where the local authority refused to giveconcessionary fares to people living more than half a mile fromthe municipal bus route. There was not necessarily a case for extending the power to give concessions for members of localauthorities or students or creating a statutory obligation to give a concession to children under school leaving age, but local authorities might be empowered to give concessionary fares to the elderly andthe disabled on municipal buses without regard to the existence of aprivate franchise and to make arrangements with private operatorsfor similar concessions in areas where there were housing estatesowned by the local authorities but not served by their buses. if local authorities chose to use those permissive powers, it would be reasonable for the cost to be borne entirely on the rates. It was argued, on the other hand, that such a limited scheme would createfurther problems and that since the Government had recently been compelled to reduce rate support to the detriment of other sociallyvaluable local services it was desirable that the problem should beconsidered in the light not only of expenditure by the Exchequer 1but also of the additional burden likely to fall on the rates, Iparticularly in areas such as Liverpool and Newcastle where seriousanomalies were known to exist.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were unwilling to agree that the Government should be committed to a substantial amount of public expenditure inadvance of the review of public expenditure. In examining further the details of the proposals put forward by the Minister ofTransport, however, the Home Affairs Committee should considerwhether a more limited scheme on the lines suggested in discussion,which would remove the major anomalies in. respect of old age pensioners and the disabled without putting any further burden on the
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th May, 1967.Exchequer, would be practicable. In the meantime no financial resolution should be provided to enable the Private Member&apos;s Billto make progress.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister without Portfolio to arrange for theHome Affairs Committee, in giving further considerationto the proposals put forward by the Minister ofTransport, to consider the practicability and cost of alimited scheme on the lines proposed in discussion.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport in the meantime to refrain from commitment to specific action on the partof the Government.
