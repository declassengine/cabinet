ParliamentFamilyEndowment(previous reference:CC(67) 12thConclusions,Minute 1)CC22(67)confidential. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Minister without Portfolio said that he had discussed withthe Minister of Social Security what approach they should adoptwhen speaking in the debate on family poverty that afternoon inthe House of Commons. They were agreed that the right course inpresent circumstances was to outline the alternative approaches tofamily endowment with which the Cabinet were familiar, explaining the advantages and disadvantages of each, but without committing the Government to any particular type of scheme. They would saythat the Government were urgently considering all aspects of theproblem, that no decision had yet been taken, but that theGovernment policy would be announced in the course of the summer.In discussion there was general agreement that the debate on family poverty should be conducted on the lines proposed by theMinister without Portfolio and the Minister of Social Security. Itwas important, however, that attention should be directed at the record of the Opposition in this matter. It was also important thatthe House and the public should be made fully aware of the issues involved in the various alternatives and, in particular, in any schemeinvolving a means test; and arrangements should be made forGovernment supporters to challenge Opposition policy in this respect.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the minister without Portfolio and invited him, in consultation with theMinister of Social Security and the Chief Whip, to arrangefor the debate on family poverty to be conducted inaccordance with the points made in their discussion.Approach to europe(previous reference:CC (67) 21stConclusions,Minute 3)secret.   (i) procedure Prime Minister said that he had now received the views ofa number of Ministers on the proposal he had made for a discussionof the approach to Europe to take place over the week-end29th-30th April. It appeared that the most acceptable arrangement would be to have a meeting at No. 10 Downing Street on the morning only of Saturday, 29th April, and for discussions to be resumed the following day, Sunday, 30th April, at Chequers, withmeetings in the morning and afternoon and if necessary in the evening. The Cabinet had agreed at their meeting on Thursday,13th April, that it might be convenient if Ministers whosedepartmental responsibilities were particularly involved in the approach to Europe could be accompanied for the first part of theweek-end discussions by an adviser who could be consulted by his minister as necessary.   He now proposed that this arrangement
should apply to the first of the week-end meetings, on Saturday morning at No. 10 Downing Street, and that the Foreign Secretary,the First Secretary of State, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theLord Chancellor, the Commonwealth Secretary, the President of theBoard of Trade, the Minister of Labour and the Minister ofAgriculture might each bring an adviser; the Economic Advisers ofthe Cabinet Office, the Department of Economic Affairs and theTreasury should also attend. , It was not the intention that theCabinet should reach a decision during their week-end meetings,whose purpose would be to complete the Cabinefs explanatory discussions and to make progress with the definitive consideration oftheir decision, which should be taken at a regular meeting of theCabinet at No. 10 Downing Street. With that in mind it wouldbe right for the Cabinet to have available in time for their nextdiscussion on the approach to Europe on Thursday, 27th April, allthe memoranda which they would wish to have studied before reaching a decision; these comprised, in accordance with theprocedural arrangements agreed at earlier meetings of the Cabinet,a paper or papers by the Commonwealth Secretary on the value ofthe Commonwealth and on essential Commonwealth interests; areport on the impact of entry into the European economic community (e.c.) on our balance of payments; the memorandum which he and the Foreign Secretary had undertaken to submit onthe alternative methods by which the approach to Europe might be pursued; and a further report on the implications for entry on the mobility of labour and immigration policy. It would also be appropriate for any papers by individual Ministers to be availablein time for consideration at the meeting of the Cabinet on 27th April,so that the documentation would be complete for that meeting andfor the meetings over the week-end 29th-30th April.In discussion it was suggested that it might not be advisable to hold special discussions over the week-end of 29th-30th April,in view of recent information that the conclusion of the definitivestage of the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations might not nowbe reached until later in May than had previously been thought,since week-end discussions were likely to arouse strong publicinterest and so create pressure for a decision at an earlier date thanthe Cabinet would think suitable. On the other hand it was urgedthat even if the completion of the definitive stage of the kennedy round were so delayed and if the Cabinet were to decide that itwould be desirable to await its completion before reaching a decisionon the approach to Europe, no embarrassment need arise out ofthe discussions over the week-end of 29th-30th April, since an explanatory statement could be made to the effect that it was right for the Cabinet to examine such a historic decision in great depthand to make clear that the Government felt it important not to prejudice the completion of the critical Kennedy Round negotiations.In the discussions the previous day the Canadian Ministers had shown no concern on this question; and the Foreign secretary would shortly be reporting his talks with the United states administration on the same point. Whilst there was some substance in the argument that the presence of the entire Cabinet at the
week-end discussions might give rise to suggestions that decisions were being reached, the convention that meetings at Chequers were for purpose of discussion and that decisions were taken at regular meetings of the Cabinet at No. 10 Downing Street was generallyunderstood and accepted by the Press. But the most important point was that if the week-end discussions were postponed it wouldnot be practicable for the Cabinet to reach a decision before theParliamentary Recess, with undesirable consequences which theCabinet had discussed at previous meetings.In further discussion it was suggested that there were a numberof points on which the Cabinet might need further informationbeyond that contained in the memoranda already discussed or in preparation. In particular, if the general view were to favour afurther development of the approach to Europe, the questions of methods and tactics by which this course might most advantageouslybe pursued would be particularly important; and a consideredstatement would be necessary of the alternative methods of doing so open to us. It was pointed out that the paper which the PrimeMinister and the Foreign Secretary had undertaken to submit, andwhich would be available in time for consideration by the Cabineton 27th April, would cover this ground fully. It was also suggestedthat the Cabinet should have available to them the latest advice from our Embassies in the more important member countries ofthe Community as to the likely reactions of those countries to anearly decision to proceed at once with a further development of the approach to Europe. The best course might be to arrange for the circulation to Cabinet of the most recent reports from our posts in the capitals of the e.c. and of EFTA and from the moreimportant Commonwealth capitals, together with the records ofthe discussions earlier in the week with the Canadian Ministers andwith the Foreign Minister of the Federal German Republic.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thegeneral view was that the programme of the Cabinet for furtherconsideration of the approach to Europe should comprise the regularmeeting of the Cabinet on 27th April and that all the documentation(including any further Ministerial papers) necessary for a definitivediscussion of the approach to Europe, as indicated in discussion,should be available in time for that meeting. He would consult the Foreign Secretary on the way in which all relevant information from our oversea Posts on the attitude of the countries primarily concerned could best be made available to members of the Cabinet.The Commonwealth Secretary should consider how similar relevant information in respect of the other members of the Commonwealthwho were most directly concerned, including the West Indies, shouldbe made available. The Cabinet should continue their discussions,with advisers present, as indicated in his opening statement, on the morning of Saturday, 29th April, at No. 10 Downing Street. these discussions should.then be continued at meetings of the Cabinetduring the morning, afternoon and, if necessary, the evening of sunday, 30th April, at Chequers; thereafter the Cabinet should aim
to reach a decision,&quot; in the light of their discussions and of anyother relevant factors such as the progress of the Kennedy Roundnegotiations, at a regular meeting of the Cabinet to be held in timefor the decision to be announced to Parliament and a Debate heldon it before the Recess.The Cabinet-(1) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministers summing up of their discussion.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would consult theForeign  Secretary  regarding  the  circulation to theCabinet of information from oversea Posts on theattitude of the foreign countries most concerned.(3) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary to circulate similarinformation in respect of the attitude of theCommonwealth countries primarily concerned.(ii) Material for Parliamentary and Public discussion the Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C (67) 57) to which were attached two memoranda prepared bythe Ministry of Agriculture for submission to the Select Committeeon Agriculture, dealing respectively with the effect of accepting thecommon agricultural policy (c.a.p.) on the volume of UnitedKingdom cereals production, and with possible effects of UnitedKingdom accession on the financing of the c.a.p. of the european economic Community (e.c.).The Minister of Agriculture said that a factual memorandumon the c.a.p. of the e.c. and the implications of accepting that policy as it now stood had been prepared by his Department inconsultation with the other Departments concerned and submittedto the Select Committee. It was now available in the records ofthe Committee&apos;s proceedings, though it could not be made availablefor publication save with the consent of the Committee. Theinformation it contained was however no more than he had himselfmade available in public speeches on this subject. The Committee&apos;sexamination of his officials on the first memorandum had led toa request from the Committee for further factual information andthe two memoranda before the Cabinet had been preparedaccordingly and agreed by the Departments concerned for submission on a confidential basis, subject to the views of theCabinet, to the Select Committee.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet might consider thetwo memoranda as suitable for submission to the Select Committeeprovided that a proper saving clause was added, pointing out that theestimates in the memoranda, which were necessarily somewhatuncertain, set out the full impact of the c.a.p. on the United Kingdomafter any transitional period which might be negotiated, but on thebasis that no other changes had been negotiated or had taken placein the Community&apos;s arrangements; and that the Government had
repeatedly made clear that if a decision were made to seek to enter the e.c. they would also seek measures to alleviate the difficulties with which the United Kingdom would otherwise be faced. Sucha saving clause would indeed be a necessary part of any furtherdocuments of a similar character which the Cabinet might thinkit right to make available for Parliamentary or public discussion, ifmisunderstanding or misrepresentation of the basis on which the documents had been prepared were to be avoided. For such discussion of the many important issues involved if the UnitedKingdom were to seek membership of the e.c., it would benecessary to make available a number of documents of the typenow before the Cabinet. In particular, if the Cabinefs conclusionwere to seek entry to the e.c. it would be right for Parliament tobe informed of so considerable a decision by means of a full statement, which would need to be accompanied by a White paper of say some five or six pages, setting out the decision and giving asummary account of the reasons for the decision and its implications.This White Paper could then be supplemented by the issue of aseries of documents of a factual character, similar to those now before the Cabinet, dealing with subjects of particular importance which would be affected by the decision. These might be basedon, for example, the memoranda on agriculture submitted to theSelect Committee and the reports considered by the Cabinet onsuch subjects as the legal and constitutional implications of membership of the e.c. and its implications for mobility of labourand immigration policy. It would clearly not be possible to issuesuch documents immediately after the Cabinet decision had beentaken and announced, nor indeed would there be time to do this;but it would be right if officials, under the guidance of the cabinet office, were to put in hand the necessary preparations, to avoidundue delay in the event of the Cabinefs decision requiring theirissue.In discussion it was generally recognised that in thecircumstances envisaged by the Prime Minister it would be properto issue a series of factual and explanatory documents by whichParliamentary and public discussion could be more fully informed;and to make preparations accordingly.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that the two memoranda annexed to C (67) 57, withthe inclusion of a saving clause on the lines indicated in discussion, to be agreed between the Foreign secretary and the Minister of Agriculture, should be presented tothe Select Committee on Agriculture.(5) Took note, with approval, of the Prime Ministefs statement on the measures which would be necessary to inform parliament and the public in the event of a decision bythe Government to seek entry to the e.c..
(iii) Alternatives  to  membership  of  the  European  EconomicCommunityThe Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C (67) 52), to which was attached a report by officials,dealing with possible courses of future policy alternative to UnitedKingdom membership of the European Economic Community (e.c.).The First Secretary of State said that the reports by officialsshowed that of the two possible alternatives to membership of the eec the membership of an Atlantic Free Trade Area (AFTA) wasnot in fact an alternative which was available to us in presentcircumstances. It seemed improbable that conditions would arise inwhich it became so and even if it did, those circumstances wouldbe damaging to general political and economic world stability.The reports also showed that our economy could sustain a reasonablelevel of performance if we were to adopt the other alternative ofabstaining from any other association with a wider group of countries, but that this course would present considerable economic difficulties. It was in any event necessary for us to increase the competitive strength of our economy. This was a difficult task,and if we were to abstain from membership of a wider grouping it seemed likely that the task would be even more difficult. among other difficulties, such abstention would remove the incentive tofurther industrial investment which membership of the e.c. seemed likely to provide. In short, the alternative of abstention was viablebut unattractive.In discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of an AFTA,there was general recognition that such an alternative was not atpresent open to us. It was however urged that if circumstances soaltered that it became a practicable possibility, it would be advantageous to us to seek to join in such a grouping. It wouldprovide us with a wider industrial market for our exports, while not imposing upon us any central controlling body which mightimpair our freedom of economic action: in particular, we shouldnot thereby have to abandon our freedom to impose exchange andother economic controls in accordance with our own judgment ofour best economic interests. On the other hand, it was argued that it was at best dubious if, particularly in the circumstances inwhich alone an AFTA would become a practicable possibility, itwould be open to us to achieve these advantages without paying a substantial economic price, whether through restrictions on our economic freedom of action or otherwise. In particular it was argued that in an AFTA we should be subject to the overwhelmingpolitical and economic power of the United States, with all the disadvantages that would accrue for our own national freedom ofaction in both spheres; and it was unrealistic to assume that theUnited States would agree wholly to disband their tariffs against us.They would certainly not agree to do so if we nevertheless proposedto retain our freedom to impose controls on foreign exchange andtrade. In present circumstances the sole value of the concept ofan AFTA might lie in the possibility that we might use it to influence negotiations in the event of our seeking to join the e.c..
In considering the advantages and disadvantages of ourabstaining from any new association with a wider grouping of countries the comment was made that to describe this policy bythe word &quot; abstention &quot; was open to objection, since that wordbore a purely negative connotation. There was indeed no singleshort description of this policy which was wholly appropriate but its essence would in any event be self-reliance. A policy ofself-reliance was however essential in any event, since we couldnot look to the act of joining any wider grouping, of whatevernature, to solve our economic difficulties for us; economic and social readjustments, which would involve a number of disagreeabledecisions, were necessary whatever policy we adopted. The question for consideration was whether we should be better placed to carryout such measures on our own or as a member of a wider grouping;and also what policy we should follow if we were to seek to join the e.c. but were rebuffed.In considering the political issues arising from abstention ithad been argued that if we were not a member of a wider groupingwe should be better placed to influence other countries inaccordance with our own interests; but membership of the EECwould diminish our political freedom of action, and would inparticular entail the risk that our present close association with theUnited States would be progressively diminished. On the otherhand, it was pointed out that our ability to exert political influencedepended in any event upon our own economic strength; and muchof the political argument turned therefore on the economic aspectsof association. Furthermore, it was strongly argued that it was vital to our political interests to maintain the alliance between western europe and the United States, and that the risk of estrangementbetween them would be considerably greater if we were not tobecome a member of the e.c., since we should then be well placed to influence the political policies of its member countries.In considering the economic advantages and disadvantages ofabstention it was pointed out that these should not be argued onthe basis that we would thus be restricted to a home market ofsome 50 million: our membership of the European Free trade association (EFTA) meant that we had an effective home marketapproaching 100 million. Furthermore, in considering theadvantages of abstention in relation to the advantages of joining the eec, we must also have regard to the damage which the lattermight entail to our markets elsewhere. It was further suggestedthat in any event the advantages of a large home market had been over-emphasised: examples of such countries as Sweden and switzerland suggested that the larger market was not essential to ahigh rate of economic growth and competitiveness. Nor would thefiercer competition to which our industries would be exposed withinthe e.c. necessarily lead to their greater strength; the effect of competition in cotton textiles through free world trade had forexample led to the sharp contraction and depression of the UnitedKingdom cotton textile industry.   It was also suggested that the
economic dynamism of the e.c. had been exaggerated; in anumber of fields, such as EURATOM, there had been a failure todevelop competitive economic strength by comparison with theUnited Kingdom. It was further argued that in any event a decision not to join the e.c. would not damage our trade. Our exports tothe countries of the e.c. had increased since its establishment atleast as fast as those to any other part of the world and we could therefore look forward to a continuation of a growth of our tradewith the e.c. as well as to the maintenance of our position in EFTA,which we could reasonably expect to continue in its present formif we were not to join the e.c.. Admittedly Austria was seeking to join the e.c., but four years of negotiation had not resulted insuccess; the position was unchanged that the Soviet Union would impose a veto on Austria joining the Community on political grounds, having regard to the treaty obligations of Austria tomaintain neutrality. Nor would Denmark be willing to leaveEFTA and join the e.c. if the United Kingdom were not also tojoin, in view of her dependence on the United Kingdom market. Inmore general terms it was argued that our economic prosperitydepended both on the continuation of sound internal economic policies which we should in any event have to pursue and upon thegeneral climate of world trade and continued world economic expansion, to the continuation of which our own contribution in helping to maintain political stability through appropriate defence expenditure in oversea theatres should not be ignored. It was furtherurged that whatever the longer-term effects of joining the e.c. ascompared with abstention might be, it would be the initial impact of joining on our balance of payments, with all the further deterioration which would ensue if that impact were stronglyadverse, which should be decisive.On the other hand, it was urged that there was good reason toaccept that joining the Community as compared with abstentionwould impart a strong stimulus to the United Kingdom economy.Whatever particular instances to the contrary might be urged, itcould hardly be denied that over a broader field competitionwould exercise a salutary effect upon the efficiency of UnitedKingdom industry. The prospect of access to a larger market, withall the encouragement to industrial investment which would result,could reasonably be expected to have a dynamic economic effect and make it much easier to carry out, and gain acceptance for, thesocial and industrial changes which were essential to our economic strength in the future. Where the view of economists on the impact of joining the e.c. differed so widely it was reasonable to payparticular regard to the strongly expressed view of United kingdom industry, in the recent report by the Confederation of BritishIndustry, that joining the Community would be strongly to our economic advantage as compared with the maintenance of ourpresent position; in particular, the prospect of securing increasedinvestment and exports by our industrialists, on which our economic progress depended, would be gravely prejudiced if theirexpectations of a larger market in the e.c. were disappointed. Itwas also urged that it would be imprudent to rely upon our ability
to maintain EFTA in being if we were not to seek to join the e.c.,in view of the pressure on some of its members to join the lattergrouping. Nor was it irrelevant to our own economic judgment ofthe advantages and disadvantages of that course that nearly all our partners in EFTA not only wished us to join but themselves wishedto join or to associate with the e.c.. In considering the advantages of Commonwealth preferences we must also accept that however much we might seek to maintain these preferences they were beingsteadily eroded and the attitude of the old Commonwealth countriesin the Kennedy Round of tariff negotiations showed that they were ready to cancel these preferences whenever they considered it to beto their economic advantage to do so. Furthermore, even if we were deliberately and openly to adopt a long-term policy of not joiningany new wider economic grouping it seemed improbable that theother members of the Commonwealth would either believe that weshould not at some later date wish to join the e.c., or would be willing on either political or economic grounds to maintain thecurrent level of preferences which they gave us. In general it was argued that while the papers before the Cabinet and their discussionshowed that it was open to us to abstain from any new-association,this course was not on balance an attractive one.In further discussion it was pointed out that a policy ofabstention must be considered not only in absolute terms, i.e., as analternative desirable in itself to joining the e.c., but also as thecourse of action which we should be forced to pursue if we made an application to join the Community but were rebuffed and if circumstances continued to be such that AFTA was still not an option open to us. There was widespread support for the view thatin that event we should not seek to pursue the policy suggested inparagraph 13 of C (67) 52, by which we would make no overt ordeclared change of policy but would continue much as we were inthe hope that at a later stage a more favourable opportunity tojoin the Community would occur. If our application to join theCommunity were rebuffed it would be of the utmost importance that we should not give the impression, as had been given by theprevious Administration in such circumstances in 1963, that thisrebuff would be gravely and perhaps even irretrievably damaging to our interests. Such a posture would lead to the worst of allsituations and in the event of our being rebuffed the Governmentshould make it clear that they were no longer interested in seeking to join the Community but would pursue a deliberate policy ofself-reliance and should seek to encourage a national spirit whichwould lead to dynamic economic activity in this country. On theother hand, it was pointed out that while in such circumstances anaggressively self-reliant policy would be appropriate, and indeedessential, the present attitude of industry was such that a rebuffwould seem likely in the event to lead to industrial depression.Indeed, it could well be argued that industrial expectations had now reached the point where even a deliberate decision not to seek tojoin the Community would have an economically depressing effect
because of its influence on industrial expectations and the level of investment.It was further argued that in any event the Governmentscourse of action in the event of our being rebuffed in our application to join could only be judged in the event and accordingto the circumstances and terms in which that rebuff was made.Nor should we ignore in the course of the negotiations, if theseseemed likely to result in a refusal to accept our minimum conditionsof entry, the possibility which had been held out by the Presidentof France, General de Gaulle, during the visit of the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary to Paris, that &quot; something new and different&quot;might be devised as an alternative to the e.c. with british membership.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that while the papers before the Cabinet and some part of thediscussion might have underrated the influence which the UnitedKingdom could maintain if we were not to become a member of a wider grouping, regard must also be had to the important and perhaps decisive role which we might play as a member of the e.c..The tour which he and the Foreign Secretary had made of thecapitals of the Six suggested that in the event of our becoming amember we should be in a very strong position to influence the policies of the Community as a whole. If we were to seek to join the Community but were rebuffed, there was general agreement that the Government should make it clear that we could neverthelessmaintain political influence and a strong economy and should seek to create a national spirit which would enable us to do so with success. We should not therefore in that event adopt the policy of waiting upon events and upon a favourable opportunity to join the e.c. at a later date. Equally, however, we should not turn ourbacks on Europe: developments there, and the probable relativeeconomic strengths of the United States on the one hand and on theother of the e.c. with its present membership, could, after the endof the conflict in Vietnam, be such as to lead the e.c. in thesecircumstances, and provided we were successfully followingself-reliant policies, to invite us to join; and it might then prove tobe in our interests to do so. In the event of our being rebuffed weshould, while not planning to join Europe at some later date,therefore not rule out that possibility, while concentrating upon thedevelopment of our own economy. In considering future action weshould also bear in mind the risk that without our membership the eec might in both political and economic terms become too inwardlooking, with consequent damage both to themselves and the restof the world. We should also bear in mind that a decision on thepart of the Government not to seek membership at present would encourage such inward looking policies. If we were to decide toapply for membership, we should seek to make that applicationsuccessful.It was arguable whether if we were to join the Communitywe should automatically acquire the economic dynamism which hadcharacterised the European economy in recent years: it could
because of its influence on industrial expectations and the level of investment.It was further argued that in any event the Governmenfscourse of action in the event of our being rebuffed in our application to join could only be judged in the event and accordingto the circumstances and terms in which that rebuff was made.Nor should we ignore in the course of the negotiations, if theseseemed likely to result in a refusal to accept our minimum conditionsof entry, the possibility which had been held out by the Presidentof France, General de Gaulle, during the visit of the Prime Ministerand Foreign Secretary to Paris, that &quot; something new and different&quot;might be devised as an alternative to the e.c. with british membership.The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that while the papers before the Cabinet and some part of thediscussion might have underrated the influence which the UnitedKingdom could maintain if we were not to become a member of a wider grouping, regard must also be had to the important and perhaps decisive role which we might play as a member of the e.c..The tour which he and the Foreign Secretary had made of thecapitals of the Six suggested that in the event of our becoming amember we should be in a very strong position to influence the policies of the Community as a whole. If we were to seek to join the Community but were rebuffed, there was general agreement that the Government should make it clear that we could neverthelessmaintain political influence and a strong economy and should seek to create a national spirit which would enable us to do so with success. We should not therefore in that event adopt the policy of waiting upon events and upon a favourable opportunity to join the e.c. at a later date. Equally, however, we should not turn ourbacks on Europe: developments there, and the probable relativeeconomic strengths of the United States on the one hand and on theother of the e.c. with its present membership, could, after the endof the conflict in Vietnam, be such as to lead the e.c. in thesecircumstances, and provided we were successfully followingself-reliant policies, to invite us to join; and it might then prove tobe in our interests to do so. In the event of our being rebuffed weshould, while not planning to join Europe at some later date,therefore not rule out that possibility, while concentrating upon thedevelopment of our own economy. In considering future action weshould also bear in mind the risk that without our membership the eec might in both political and economic terms become too inwardlooking, with consequent damage both to themselves and the restof the world; We should also bear in mind that a decision on thepart of the Government not to seek membership at present would encourage such inward looking policies. If we were to decide toapply for membership, we should seek to make that applicationsuccessful.It was arguable whether if we were to join the Communitywe should automatically acquire the economic dynamism which hadcharacterised the European economy in recent years: it could
indeed be argued that that period of dynamic growth was now coming to a conclusion. But there was good reason to think thatif we were to join this act would of itself create a new economicdynamism, to the mutual benefit of Europe and ourselves, the moreespecially if some of our partners in EFTA were to join the e.c. atthe same time.The Cabinet were agreed that AFTA was not a politicalpossibility in present circumstances. It might become so if, forexample, General de Gaulle were to be held responsible for thefailure of the Kennedy Round, the current negotiations in theInternational Monetary Fund relating to increased world liquidityand, most important of all, for the failure of any application we might make to enter the e.c.. In those circumstances, admittedlyunlikely in combination, there might be a dramatic change in thepolicy of the United States and it might then be possible to obtain some of the economic advantages, particularly in the monetary field,which an AFTA might be argued to present. It was howeverdoubtful if the United States Congress would ever be likely to agreeto the full free trade area envisaged by the concept of AFTA.In considering the political aspects of our joining the e.c. wemust bear in mind that the United States held it to be in our interestsand in world interests that we should join the Community, and therewas reason to believe that the Soviet Union took the same view,even though they were not at present politically in a position to declare it. The Soviet Union in particular feared a revival ofGerman nationalism and after the death of General de Gaullethere was a grave danger that if we were not to join the Community,we should find ourselves confronted with a situation in which aresurgent Germany might dominate Western Europe.In considering the question of our tactics, we should bear inmind that recent events had created the expectation that we would apply to join the Community. The implications of a decision notto apply in such circumstances constituted a factor to be borne inmind in reaching a decision, but neither this nor other considerations should, in the event of a decision to apply, dead us to acceptconditions of entry which we judged to be contrary to our interests.The Cabinet (6) Took note of C (67) 52 and of the points made in discussion.(iv) Implications of entry for United Kingdom Planning policies the Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(C (67) 56) covering a report by the Official Committee on environmental Planning on &quot; The implications of entry for UnitedKingdom Planning Policies &quot;.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said thereport was inconclusive in the sense that the implications of entry for our planning policies depended on what the main economiceffects of entry were assumed to be. The assumptions made in the
report, i.e., that Ministers were satisfied that our regional policieswere compatible with membership of the e.c., that on entry our industry would be fully competitive with that of Europe and that membership would in general be to our economic advantage, werethe major factors. On that basis, the general conclusion of thereport was that while there seemed no reason to expect that entrywould create serious difficulties in the operation of controls overthe distribution of industry or of office development, the increased demand for office accommodation in London and the South Eastresulting from the pull of the Common Market would require us to pursue more vigorous dispersal policies. In his view the reportsomewhat underestimated the likely volume of inward immigrationwhich might result if we were to enter the Common Market; ifthere were in consequence a strong demand for labour and substantial inward immigration this would of course have considerable implications for planning and housing policies.In discussion, it was urged that whereas the objective in asking for the report had been to secure an analysis of the effect of theeconomic pressures which would result from our entry into theCommunity on our physical planning policies, the nature and scope of the assumptions made in the report were such as topre-determine its conclusions and so to frustrate its purpose. Itwas suggested on the other hand that if, for example, theassumption that we should not open negotiations unless we were satisfied that our industry was competitive with that of Europewere taken, as it should be, in its broad sense, the report was reasonably based. Moreover the Cabinet had discussed previouslya number of the economic questions to which the assumptionsrelated, including, as well as the relative competitiveness of our industry with that of Europe, the economic effects of entry on the flow of investment to and from the United Kingdom and its effects on the regional distribution and it would hardly have beenpracticable or appropriate for a report of this nature to seek to review all those issues afresh. In this context it was suggested thatthe essential point was that free movement of capital would undermine our control of the location of industry by the industrialdevelopment certificate (i.d.c.) system. However, it would be wrong to compare our circumstances if we were to enter the Communitywith our present economic condition rather than with our futurecondition if we did not enter; as members of the e.c. we could expect a higher level of investment which would benefit thedevelopment areas. Moreover, if our industry was not competitivewith that of Europe and other parts of the world the outlook forthe development areas would be bleak whether we were in theCommunity or not, since their welfare depended upon the strengthof the economy generally. In these circumstances it was argued that the conclusions of the report were consistent and useful.In further discussion it was urged that our regional policieshad not so far been successful in evening the economic disparitiesbetween different regions and in reducing the attractions of theeconomically stronger regions, which indeed would be increased if
we were to enter the Community, especially if the Channel Tunnelwere built, and if gaps in our policy on the location of industrysuch as those referred to in paragraph 11 were exploited or widened.There would, therefore, be a need for stronger regional policies ifwe were to enter the Community and we ought in any event toconsider the need to shape our regional policies over the next fewyears, and also to develop our transport facilities which greatly influenced regional development, to take account of the economicattraction of the e.c., by such means as building up containertransport ports in Scotland. It was too easily assumed that tradewith the e.c. would need to flow via ports in the South-East ofEngland. It was however also necessary to take account of theconsideration that the Governments regional policies had not yet had sufficient time to make their full effect felt. They had only been in force for up to two years and were still being developed and there were also industries in the development areas whichwould benefit from membership of the e.c..The Prime Minister, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinets discussion had underlined the need tostrengthen our regional policies, especially if it were decided to join the e.c.. There would be a renewed opportunity to discuss thissubject at the further meetings of the Cabinet on the approach to europe.The Cabinet (7) Agreed to resume their discussion on the approach to europe at a subsequent meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,21st April, 1967.
