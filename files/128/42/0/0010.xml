The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.secret. The Minister without Portfolio (Mr. Gordon Walker) saidthat the discussions with the Maltese Prime Minister &quot;and hiscolleagues on the reduction of our forces had so far been amiable intone, but further problems had arisen not only on the interpretation of the consequences of the rundown for the timing of additionalunemployment, but also in relation to the position of an observerfrom the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO). The MalteseDelegation had urged that a NATO observer should be asked to study the defence needs of Malta. He had opposed this in discussion and had taken the line already agreed by Ministers that it would be unacceptable that NATO should in any way be an arbiter betweenMalta and ourselves on the carrying out of the Defence Agreement,though we would agree that they should send an observer to be present at the talks in so far as these related to Maltese defence issues.In consequence of our acceptance of the latter arrangement, NATOhad sent two observers who were taking the embarrassing line thatthe Maltese defence issues could appropriately be studied by NATOin its own right. These complications might well mean that it wouldnot be possible to complete the talks by the end of the current week,but if they lasted longer the continued administrative harassment ofour forces would raise awkward problems of supply.The Cabinet Took note of the statement by the Minister without portfolio.Iron and SteelNationalisationNational SteelCorporationSalaries(previous reference:CC (66) 48thConclusions,Minute 5)confidential. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Power (C (67) 22) on salaries in the National Steel Corporation.The Minister of Power recalled that the Cabinet had consideredthe previous September the salaries to be paid to members of theNational Steel Corporation; they had determined the salary to be offered to the future chairman but had left for later discussion the salaries for the members. Under the Iron and Steel NationalisationBill a minimum of seven members of the Corporation had to beappointed by about Easter, when the Bill would come into force.The nationalised steel industry would constitute the largestmanufacturing complex in the United Kingdom and one of thelargest in the world. It would face serious problems at home andfierce competition abroad. Its problems would be the more seriousin that it had not only to take over and run the industry but alsoradically to reorganise its structure. Failure in this enterprise wouldhave serious consequences, both economic and political. The new structure of the industry required a functional Board with membersdirectly responsible for specific fields of policy, e.g., engineering,7886
marketing and production, rather than a Board of a general and advisory character. Its members would therefore have to possessproven expertise and experience and must be drawn from those already holding senior posts in industry, who earned more than thoseholding the highest paid posts in any of the nationalised industries.The nationalised steel industry would differ from the other nationalised industries in two respects. First, it would not constitute a monopoly, since there would still be some 260 companies in private ownership who would compete with the Corporation for able leaders,as indeed would manufacturing industry. Second, salaries paid inthe steel industry and in manufacturing industry were generallyhigher than those paid in the industries which had previously beennationalised : if for example the salaries offered were below the levelshe was now proposing the top 150 people in the steel industry wouldbe cut off from the possible field of recruitment. The necessity for payment of suitable salaries had been generally recognised by all:sides in the debates in the House during the passage of the Iron andSteel Nationalisation Bill. If the salaries of members of the steel corporation^ Board were too low they would tend to depress salarylevels in the whole industry which would lose its leaders to manufacturing industry, both British and foreign, which was alreadyseeking recruits from those steel companies which were to be nationalised.Following a meeting with the First Secretary of State and theChancellor of the Exchequer he had therefore suggested to theChairman of the Organising Committee (Lord Melchett) thefollowing salary structure for the National Steel Corporation Chairman       ......      18,000Deputy Chairman     ...      15,000Members        ...      ...       9,000-  13,000Lord Melchett had since informed him that he would be unable tocontinue as chairman-designate of the Corporation since he did notconsider that it would be possible to secure a viable Corporation onthis basis. Other members, who would not be personally affected,since their salaries (which were protected by the Bill) were higherthan those which had been suggested, took a similar view. A numberof people who had been approached with a view to taking upappointments on the Corporation had declined on the grounds thatthe remuneration offered was inadequate. In these circumstances and if higher salaries were not offered it would become necessary tofind Board members from outside the industry, with grave consequences for its viability. After consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, hehad therefore discussed with Lord Melchett and two members of theOrganising Committee the minimum salaries necessary to securepersonnel of the right calibre. The following substantive salary structure had emerged:Chairman       ......      a personal salary to be negotiated(not necessarily very high)Deputy ChairmanMembers 20,000- 24,000 15,000- 19,000
The rate of salary within these ranges would be determined on thebasis of the personal qualities of the individual appointed.In considering the relationship of this proposal to theGovernments policy on incomes, it was relevan. that these salarieswere for new posts and were generally at a lower rate than existingsalaries for similar jobs in the same and related industries. with one exception, they would represent a cut in substantive salary forvirtually everyone, including the chairman. They also constituted alarge reduction in the total salary bill as a result of concentrating14 separate companies into probably four groups. The rates weresubstantive but in recognition of the incomes policy they would beabated by 12-J- per cent for a period of two years. Such salariesrepresented the minimum required to secure the services of people ofsufficiently high calibre.In discussion it was pointed out that the Government were facedfor the first time with the problem of determining salaries for a nationalised undertaking on the basis of direct relativities with an industry in the private sector, where salary was generally accepted asa measure of status. In a mixed economy it was impossible to avoidhaving regard to comparability. Furthermore the salaries of the boards of existing nationalised undertakings were also provinginadequate to attract men of the right calibre.Nevertheless, it was urged that the payment of such high salarieswould inevitably have grave consequences for the general acceptanceof the Governments policy on incomes and would have repercussionsunacceptable in the light of that policy on the salaries of the membersof the other nationalised industries. It was suggested that these difficulties might be overcome, at least in part, by paying purelypersonal salaries, on the understanding that these would be revised asa formal salary structure after say two years, during which time weshould seek to bring salaries in the nationalised steel industry into line with those in other nationalised industries. Moreover it shouldnot be assumed that the only men of the necessary ability were thosewho were already at the top; there must be others in the middle orhigher ranks of steel management who would be suitable for appointment to the Corporation and who would be content withsalaries below those now proposed.On the other hand, there was wide support for the view that itwould be essential to pay competitive salaries. The need for suchsalaries had for example recently been demonstrated by theCo-operative Wholesale Society. On wider grounds moreover itwas mistaken policy to pay to those in the service of the State salarieswhich compared unfavourably, having regard to all the circumstances, -with the remuneration which persons of equivalent ability could earnin private industry and private professional practice. Payment ofthe high salaries proposed would admittedly give rise to serious political difficulty but it was essential to secure a better general understanding of the nature of the problem, both in Parliament andin the country.
The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that on balance the Cabinet agreed that salaries for the members of theNational Steel Corporation should be on the basis proposed by theMinister of Power. The Minister of Power should consult with theLord President on their public presentation, which was of the utmost importance. That presentation should inter alia make it clear thatthe salaries, high as they were, would still be less than those paid inother industrial fields, and that the persons receiving them would inmany instances receive a lower salary than those which they currentlyearned. The presentation should also not only emphasise the dilemma which faced the Government of the need to pay such highsalaries in order to obtain people of the calibre requisite to ensurethe success of iron and steel nationalisation, but should also seek tosecure a better understanding of the problems arising in a mixedeconomy in determining the salaries of persons in the service of theState. The discussion also showed that at a later stage the salaries of the Boards of other nationalised industries would need to be reviewed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the salaries to be paid to the senior members ofthe National Steel Corporation should be as follows:Chairman......      Personal SalaryDeputy Chairman ...      Substantive range  20,000- 24,000Reduced for two years by12i per cent t0  17,500- 21,000Functional Members      Substantive range  15,000- 19,000Reduced for two years by12-1 per cent to  13,125- 16,625(2) Invited the Minister of Power, in consultation with the lord president of the Council, to consider in the light of thediscussion the timing and presentation of the announce-ment of these salaries.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,2nd March, 1967.
