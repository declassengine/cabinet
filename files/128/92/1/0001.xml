CC(88) 6th Conclusions

ECONOMIC

STRATEGY

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer

(C(88) 3) on economic strategy.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that Britain was now in a strong

economic position.    There had been continuous growth of 2i per cent or

more a year in the five years from 1983 to 1987,  the first time this had

happened since the war.    The public sector was no longer a net borrower.

Britain&apos;s performance compared well with all the other major industrial

nations save Japan.    But there were also reasons for caution. There

were major uncertainties abroad, especially in the United States, and

earnings in Britain were rising too fast.    He therefore thought it right

to frame a prudent Budget, and to reduce taxation no further than was

consistent with a modest Budget surplus.    It would be helpful if the

message from the Cabinet as a whole were that the Budget would be the

occasion for reviewing taxation and borrowing, not public expenditure.

In discussion the following main points were made -

a. The Opposition were trying to create expectations that the

Budget would contain public expenditure measures, especially to

increase spending in the National Health Service (NHS), and

there was a danger that when it did not the public reception of the

Budget would be affected.    Action should be taken immediately to

prevent the growth of these expectations.

b. The case for aiming for a surplus was very strong.    It would

help to deal with the pressures in the economy, especially on pay.

Indeed, a surplus could be presented positively as showing both the

Government&apos;s determination to maintain a prudent policy, with room

for manoeuvre if world economic conditions deteriorated,  and the

substantial improvement which they had secured in the public

finances.

c. More generally,  the concern about inflationary pressures and

the level of consumer demand showed the importance of maintaining

tight financial discipline.    A Budget surplus would contribute to

this.    It was also necessary to be prepared to raise interest rates

if financial conditions required it.    It was vital too to maintain

the exchange rate discipline, so that industry did not feel that it

would be protected by devaluation from the consequences of failing

to keep costs under control.

d. The recent movement abroad to reduce the top rates of tax left

Britain&apos;s looking rather high.    There was a strong case, on grounds

of improving incentives,  for reducing the top rates and also

possibly for simplifying the top rate structure.    That would be a

good year for making such changes.    It was important to attract

mobile foreign investment.

e. Table 2 of Annex 3 to C(88) 3 showed that those on half

average earnings paid a higher proportion of their gross earnings

in tax and National Insurance Contributions than when the

Government came into office.    The unemployment and poverty traps

which affected people at lower levels of earnings had a serious

effect on incentives and it was important to reduce the tax burden

at those levels.    A substantial increase in personal allowances

would be a way of achieving that.

f. Tax reform was never easy, since powerful groups could be

disadvantaged.    But it was important to the efficient    running of

the economy.    It was the right year to consider a bold package of

reform which could be justified as laying the foundations for

future economic success.    There was a strong case for

simplification,  for example of Capital Gains Tax, and the

introduction of greater fairness in the taxation of husband and

wife.    The possibilities for extension of the Value Added Tax base

were limited by pledges which had been given, but if any such

extension was likely to become necessary for European Community

reasons it would be better for the Government to make a virtue of

necessity themselves.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet

congratulated the Chancellor of the Exchequer on his successful

management of the economy.    They endorsed the need in framing the Budget

to follow a prudent policy as described in C(88) 3,  and to continue to

encourage incentive and effort.    They also believed that it was a good

year for considering structural changes in the tax system. Finally,

they were agreed that it was essential to make it clear at that time

that the Budget would not be the occasion for substantial expenditure

proposals,  for example on the NHS.    She would arrange for the press to

be told that the Cabinet had had its usual pre-Budget discussion; and

that they had stressed that increases in public expenditure for the

coming year had already been considered and announced,  and that the

Budget would be the occasion for reviewing tax and borrowing, not

expenditure.

The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;s

summing up of their discussion.

2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take

account of the discussion in preparing his Budget.
