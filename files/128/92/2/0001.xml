MOST CONFIDENTIAL RECORD

TO

CC(88) 35th Conclusions

THE QUEEN&apos;S

SPEECH ON

THE OPENING

OF PARLIAMENT

THE PRIME MINISTER said that before the Cabinet considered the

memorandum on The Queen&apos;s Speech by the Lord President of the Council

(C(88) 15) she wished to inform them that it was proposed to announce in

The Queen&apos;s Speech a Bill to place the Security Service on a statutory

footing.    The background to this Bill was that although the Security

Service had hitherto operated successfullly without specific statutory

cover,  the issue had attracted increasing attention,  and the small group

of colleagues that had been considering the matter for more than a year

had now concluded that the time had come to put the Service on a

statutory basis.    The Security Service themselves were fully behind the

proposal and this legislation,  at a time of the Government&apos;s own

choosing, would also help in dealing with some forthcoming cases under

the European Convention on Human Rights.    The proposals had been under

consideration for some time and were certainly not being brought forward

as a response to the book &quot;Spycatcher&quot; or to the litigation about it.

The preservation of secrecy lay at the heart of the Security Service&apos;s

work,  and there were obvious problems  in devising a statutory scheme of

oversight.    The idea had gained ground in some quarters that the

Security Service might be placed under some Parliamentary machinery,

such as a committee of Privy Councillors, but that was quite

unrealistic.    The forthcoming Bill would therefore declare that the

Security Service operated under the authority of the Secretary of State,

and would not  in any way change her own and the Home Secretary&apos;s

responsibilities in these matters.    The way in which a degree of public

accountability could be established for a secret agency had been

demonstrated by the Interception of Communications Act which provided a

model for the system of authorising warrants and the complaints

machinery that would be embodied in the forthcoming Bill.    It would also

be necessary for the Parliamentary handling of the Bill to be as swift

and successful as that of the Interception of Communications Act, with

no significant changes being made during its passage.    The Queen&apos;s

Speech would therefore include the short reference:  &quot;A Bill will be

introduced to put the Security Service on a statutory basis under the

authority of the Secretary of State&quot;,  and the Bill would be published on

the day after the Speech.    She would make a short reference to the Bill

in her speech on the first day of the Debate on the Address, and the

Home Secretary would make a fuller announcement when it was introduced.

Thereafter,  the Bill should be taken forward with all deliberate speed.

The Committee Stage would have to be taken on the Floor of the House.

It was absolutely essential that there should be no publicity about this

Bill before the opening of the new Session though,  in accordance with

the usual practice,  it would be necessary to make the full text of

The Queen&apos;s Speech available to the Opposition in confidence on the

afternoon of the day before its delivery.    Junior members of the

Government would be told when The Queen&apos;s Speech was read at the Eve of

Session dinner.


THE HOME SECRETARY said that legislation to provide a statutory

foundation for the Security Service had been under review for some time.

The proposals to legislate in the forthcoming Session had been largely

prompted by the Security Service themselves, who greatly welcomed the

proposals.    The legislation would be difficult in Parliamentary terms,

and the difficulties would be greatly compounded by any speculations and

assertions in the media in advance of The Queen&apos;s Speech.

THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that some care would be needed

about the Parliamentary management of the Security Service Bill,

together with the Official Secrets Bill and the Prevention of Terrorism

(Temporary Provisions) Bill.    Since the Security Service Bill would be

coming as a surprise to Parliament, it would be all the more necessary

to observe the usual Parliamentary procedures,  such as the passage of

two weekends between the introduction of the Bill and its Second

Reading.    It might be helpful if the Official Secrets Bill were to be

published before the Security Service Bill was taken to Second Reading.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the Cabinet had

agreed that a Bill to put the Security Service on a statutory basis

under the authority of the Secretary of State should be added to the

legislative programme for the forthcoming Session, and that a reference

to that effect should be included in The Queen&apos;s Speech.    It was most

important that there should be no publicity on the matter before the

Opening of Parliament.

The Cabinet -

Endorsed the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of

the discussion.
