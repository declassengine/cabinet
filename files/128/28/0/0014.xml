Parliament. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.government offices.New ColonialOffice Building.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 13thConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the scheme for building a new Colonial Office on the site of the old WestminsterHospital.Discussion turned mainly on the question whether the Govern-ment should adopt a long-term aim of creating a greater parliament square, extending from the Central Hall to the Houses of parliament and from Great George Street to Westminster Abbey. Against this,it was argued that the cost might amount to  5 millions; that theGovernment had acquired the old Westminster Hospital site for thepurpose of erecting an office building on it and could not, without legislation, hold it as an open space; that legislation might also be needed to prevent owners of other buildings in the area fromrebuilding out of conformity with the long-term plan; and that,until the plan was finally realised, the environs of the Houses ofParliament and Westminster Abbey would be made less,, rather thanmore, attractive by exposing to view the backs of the existing build-ings fronting on Great George Street. On the other side it was argued that this was an imaginative project for giving a worthy settingto the centre of the Commonwealth at Westminster; that for suchan area as this it was sound planning to lay down a long-term aim to which the owners of all property in the neighbourhood couldconform; and that the cost of carrying out the project would bespread over very many years.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although he couldnot agree that any Exchequer expenditure should be incurred onsuch a scheme at the present time, it might be right to keep this possibility open for the future if a suitable alternative site could befound for a new Colonial Office building. If no such site could befound, he would be in favour of completing the building on the oldWestminster Hospital site.From further discussion it appeared that Richmond Terracewould be the best alternative site for a new Colonial Office building.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Works to consider, and report tothe Cabinet as soon as possible, whether a practicablescheme could be devised for erecting a new Colonial office building in Richmond Terrace and leaving the old West-minster Hospital site vacant as a first instalment towards thecreation of a greater Parliament Square.Commercial 3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumPolicy. by the President of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 40) on the positionReview of the reached in the review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and TradeG.A.T.T. (G.A.T.T.).(Previous The Cabinet first discussed the need to secure adequate flexibilityReference:      in tne revised G.A.T.T. to meet the special needs of the Colonies.C.C. (53) 13th The Colonial Secretary said that the combination of the no-new-Conclusions, preference rule of the G.A.T.T. and the obligation under the OttawaMinute 5.) Agreements to allow free entry for Commonwealth goods preventedany extension of Imperial Preference. Although this was no longerdesired by the independent countries of the Commonwealth, it was still of great concern to the Colonies, and there was a general expecta-tion among the Governments supporters in this country that, as aresult of the current review, the United Kingdom would obtaingreater freedom to help Colonial industries. The United kingdom delegation at Geneva had originally suggested a Colonial clause
which would give us freedom from the no-new-preference rule so faras concerned the Colonies, but this would involve unanimous agree-ment to amend Article 1 of the G.A.T.T., and it was now clear thatit could not be carried at Geneva. The alternative of a Colonialwaiver, which was now proposed, was not free from objection. it seemed that, under it, the United Kingdom would be unable to givematerial help to the Colonies otherwise than by subsidies; and, once this principle was established, there would be a risk that theExchequer would be pressed to provide substantial and continuingsupport for Colonial products. It was important, particularly inview of the extent to which the United States would secure its aimsunder the revised G.A.T.T., that the Government should be able toshow that they had done everything possible to obtain adequateprovisions to meet the needs of the Colonies. In these circumstances,it might be preferable to press the original proposal to a vote.In discussion, it was pointed out that the waiver, although asecond-best solution, had definite advantages for the Colonies.Under it, the United Kingdom would obtain power to treat a Colonialindustry for certain purposes as if it were a metropolitan one, forexample, by the imposition of countervailing duties, or the use of export subsidies. Also, we should be able to exercise for the benefitof the Colonies the right which we, with other European countries,hoped to obtain to continue existing protective quotas. The waiverwould also facilitate the negotiation of some flexibility on tariffs forthe benefit of the Colonies.The following arguments were put forward against pressing theoriginal proposal to a vote. First, the proposal was bound to be defeated. Secondly, it would be opposed by the other members ofthe Commonwealth, with whom we had previously agreed that weshould not press for fundamental amendment of the no-new-preference rule. Thirdly, if it were pressed and defeated, this might increase the domestic political pressure for the United Kingdom toleave G.A.T.T. Finally, the Colonial advisers themselves preferred to seek the waiver, which would come into operation immediately,rather than pursue the original proposal.In further discussion the following points were made: - (a) The fact that our original proposal would be defeated wouldnot be conclusive if we had a good case for seeking a modificationof the no-new-preference rule in the interests of the Colonies. Butthe fact was that at present only three Colonial industries (tobacco,citrus fruit and bananas) were in real difficulties, and tariff action would be an appropriate remedy only for bananas.(b) The United States was able to treat Puerto Rico as if it werepart of the metropolitan territory because of their Customs Union.It was suggested that the United States was about to give preferential treatment also to the Philippines, under an agreement just concluded.(c) It did not seem possible to bring enough pressure to bearon the United States to support our original proposal, since theUnited States was able to obtain all her aims in the review without our support.(d) It was not clear to what extent a waiver in the form suggested would facilitate tariff action to help the Colonies. If, for example,a preferential tariff were needed to help the Colonial banana industry,it would be necessary to re-negotiate the tariff, which was bound, onBrazilian bananas; this re-negotiation would then have to obtainthe approval of a two-thirds majority of the G.A.T.T., underArticle XXV. It was desirable to ensure that tariff action of this sortcould be taken under the waiver without first obtaining the prior approval of the members of the G.A.T.T.(e) Whether we should press our original proposal to a vote, inin which we should be defeated, depended on whether that would prejudice the chance of securing a satisfactory waiver to meet Colonialdifficulties. The United Kingdom delegation in Geneva had advised that we should be more likely to get a waiver in satisfactory terms2 &quot; B 2
The Cabinet then considered the need to obtain equal rights withother European countries to continue existing quota restrictions incertain circumstances after balance of payments difficulties had ended.The President of the Board of Trade said that, at present, wecould use quotas to meet balance of payments difficulties, withdiscrimination in favour of other sterling Commonwealth countries.After convertibility, although we should still have power to imposequotas on balance of payments grounds, they would have to beapplied on a non-discriminatory basis. The right which we are now seeking was to allow the use of quotas, after balance of payments difficulties had ended, for protective purposes. We should only beable to use existing quotas for that purpose and no question of their use would arise until balance of payments difficulties had ended. Thequestion for decision was whether we should seek a power to discriminate in the use of these protective quotas. It was now clearthat, on balance, most of the other members of the commonwealth would oppose such a power; and he recommended that, unless other european countries pressed for it, the United Kingdom shouldnot do so.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in favour of seeking the power to discriminate in the use of these protectivequotas. Other European Governments-would wish to be able to discriminate, although their delegations in Geneva had not so farpressed for this. In any event we needed the power for domesticpolitical reasons; and, even though other members of the Common-wealth had not wished us to maintain the power to discriminate intheir favour, there would be criticism if we/ appeared to havegiven it up.In discussion it was pointed out that, with the possible exceptionof New Zealand, the other members of the Commonwealth thoughtthat their true economic interests would be better served by non-discrimination, since they feared that, if European countries had theright to discriminate, Commonwealth exports to European marketsmight be adversely affected. Germany, for example, might makebilateral trade agreements which would favour Latin America at theirexpense.It was pointed out that, if other European countries did not seek the power to discriminate, it would be difficult for the UnitedKingdom to take the initiative in doing so, It was undesirable thatif we did not press the original proposal. This was a question of tactics, on which the United Kingdom delegation were in the best position to advise.(/) If we could secure a waiver in satisfactory terms, it wouldnot be necessary to press the original proposal to a vote for the solepurpose of showing that the United Kingdom had done everything possible in the interests of the Colonies. The waiver could be presented as being, in effect, as good as the original proposal.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that the United Kingdom delegation at Geneva should do their utmost to obtain a waiver in the best possible terms to meetthe needs of the Colonies, Without such a waiver, it seemed most unlikely that the Government would be able to accept the revisedG.A.T.T., and this should be clearly stated by the United kingdom delegation. In any event the Government would have to considerthe revised G.A.T.T. as a whole when the negotiations had been concluded; and, if it then appeared that the revised Agreement was unacceptable and that freedom from the no-new^preference rule wasnecessary, the Government would be obliged to seek an amendmentof that rule which would be in general terms and not limited to theColonies.
5CC. 14 (55)we should lead the European countries in opposition to the Common-wealth on this question. It would be a different matter if we could obtain the support of other Commonwealth countries. But atpresent, apart from New Zealand, only Australia was prepared tosupport us in seeking this power.It was also argued that the power to discriminate could be used by European countries to the detriment of the United Kingdom,since Commonwealth countries might find it necessary to protect their exports by giving preferential treatment to goods from other european countries at the expense of United Kingdom exports.On the other hand, it was pointed out that it was not unreason-able to ask for the continuance of the power to discriminate since it would be available only for a very limited period, between theend of balance of payments difficulties and the beginning of 1960,when the right to maintain protective quotas would lapse. Thecontinued right to discriminate would be a useful argument withwhich to meet criticisms, not only from industry, but also from thosewho still supported the principle of Imperial Preference. It wouldbe helpful politically if the Government could demonstrate that itwas the other members of the Commonwealth and not the UnitedKingdom that had rejected Imperial Preference.Further discussion showed that it was the general view of theCabinet that, while it would be inadvisable to incite other european countries to seek the power to continue to discriminate in the use ofprotective quotas, the United Kingdom Government should be ableto show that they had sought such a degree of flexibility in the useof protective quotas as would be to the mutual advantage of theUnited Kingdom and of the other countries, dependent and independent, of the Commonwealth.The Cabinet next considered the other requirements necessaryfor a satisfactory conclusion to the review. These were to obtainthe agreement of the United States that the general arrangementsrelating to their waiver permitting agricultural quotas should besubject to review in 1960 or earlier; and to secure the inclusion inthe record of the G.A.T.T. review of a statement enabling UnitedKingdom Ministers to say that in the last resort general discrimina-tion against a scarce currency could be authorised under the waiverprocedure.It was the view of the Cabinet that the United kingdom delegation should be instructed to seek satisfaction on these two points.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to give thefollowing instructions to the United Kingdom delegationsin the concluding stages of the review of the G.A.T.T.:  (i) To press for a waiver in the most favourable termspossible to meet the needs of the Colonies, andto make it clear that a satisfactory waiver was essential if the United Kingdom Government wereto be able to recommend the revised G.A.T.T.to Parliament.(ii) To obtain equal rights with other European countries to continue existing protective quotas for a period after balance of payments difficulties had endeduntil 1960, and to seek such flexibility in the useof such quotas as might be mutually advantageous to the United Kingdom and to the other countries of the Commonwealth, including the Colonies.(iii) To secure the agreement of the United States that thegeneral arrangements relating to their waiverpermitting agricultural quotas should be subjectto review in 1960 or earlier.
(iv) To obtain the inclusion in the record of the G.A.T.T.review of a statement enabling Ministers to saythat in the last resort general discrimination againsta scarce currency could be authorised under the waiver procedure.(2) Agreed that, when the current review had been concluded,the Government should consider their attitude to the revised G.A.T.T. as a whole.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,16th February, 1955,\
