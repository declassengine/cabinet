Prince ofHanover.Claim to british nationality.(Previous    &apos; :&apos;Reference:C.C. (55) 10thConclusions,Minute 3.) , .I. The Cabinet again considered the possible legal consequences of a declaration by the courts that the Prince of Hanover wasa British subject by virtue of an Act of 1705.The Prime Minister said that he had had the help of the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General in preparing a submission toThe Queen to accompany the record of the Cabinefs discussion onthis matter at their last meeting. The proposed submission was read to the Cabinet.In discussion the following points were raised:  &apos; (a) Some doubt was expressed about the possible heed for legislation, which was mentioned at the end of the proposedsubmission.The Cabinet were informed that it was not certain whether averdict favourable to the Prince of Hanover in his action in theChancery Division would, in practice, have the effect of drawingpublic attention to the point about the Royal Marriages Act, 1772.If, however, this should happen, it could be argued that this situationarose as the result of wrong advice tendered to the Sovereign at thetime, and the Government might feel obliged to introduce thelegislation which would be necessary to regularise the position. Thesituation could probably be met by a one-clause Bill declaring that persons deemed to be British subjects by the operation of the act of 1705 should not on that account, be deemed not to belong to&quot;foreign families &quot; for the purposes of tlie Royal Marriages Act,1772// i; - 1    - -(/;) The Attorney-General said that, in accordance with the cabinet&apos;s wishes, he had already taken such steps as were open tohim to reduce the chances of undesirable publicity about the Prince&apos;transaction and, in particular, the bearing which its outcome might haveupon the position under the Royal Marriages Act, 1772. .The Cabinet-Took note of the proposed terms of the Prime Minister^submission to The Queen on this matter.
