Europeans 1.   The Cabinet considered a draft message to the United StatesUefemceand Secretary of State, which the Foreign Secretary had prepared in theFour-Power light of their discussion on the previous day, commenting on theMeeting. American plan for holding in Paris early in May a series of(Previous        international meetings designed to demonstrate the progress made reference:       towards European unity.  This set out some of the main difficultiesCC. (55) 23rd   which the Cabinet had seen in the specific plan outlined by conclusions.)    Mr. Dulles, and suggested that these might be avoided if thePresident were to announce, before the French debates on the ratification of the Paris Agreements, his willingness to visit Europesome time later in the summer, perhaps in June.  It also suggestedthat the announcement of such a visit need not be linked specificallywith the ratification of the Paris Agreements: it could refer more generally to the easing of international relations in Europe and thepossibility of a top level Four-Power Meeting with the Russians.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the terms of the draft telegram. The Prime Minister said thathe attached particular importance to the reference to a top levelmeeting with the Russians. This should ensure that the UnitedStates Government would make it plain whether they envisaged ameeting of Heads of Governments of the Four Powers or furthermeetings of Foreign Ministers in continuation of the BerlinConference.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to send a message to theUnited States Secretary of State in the terms of the draftsubmitted to the Cabinet (subsequently despatched as foreign Office telegram to Washington No. 1057).Iraq.defence arrangements.(previous reference:CC. (54) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theForeign Secretary (C. (55) 70) recommending that the UnitedKingdom should accede to the Turco-Iraqi Pact and should concludethereunder a new defence agreement with Iraq.The Foreign Secretary said that the recently concluded Pactbetween Turkey and Iraq, which was reproduced in Annex I of his paper, appeared to offer us the best chance of securing a satisfactorydefence agreement with Iraq to replace the existing Anglo-IraqiTreaty, which would expire in 1957. He recommended that weshould accede to the Pact under Article 5, and thereafter concludewith the Iraqi Government under Article 1 a defence agreement onthe lines of the draft in Annex II of his paper. This agreement would go some way towards meeting Iraqi susceptibilities for example,by allowing the Iraqi flag to fly over the airfields at Habbaniya andShaiba. On the other hand, the facilities which we should obtain,which were summarised in paragraph 6 of his paper, werecomprehensive in scope and would meet our essential strategic requirements. The United States Government approved our proposed accession to the Turco-Iraqi Pact and might themselvesconsider acceding to it at an appropriate time. Jordan and Persiamight join later. The Pact was in no sense directed against the Israelies, who might also find it possible to accede to it if their relationswith the Arab States could be improved. Complete agreement had recently been reached with the United States authorities upon a plan for promoting a settlement of the present differences between israel and her neighbours, and this plan would be put into operation assoon as conditions were favourable. The Iraqi Government were anxious that a Cabinet Minister should, if possible, visit Bagdad forthe signature of the proposed Anglo-Iraqi Agreement, and he would consider what could be done to meet this desire.
Cabinet Office, S.W.1,15th March, 1955.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was sorry that itwas necessary to contemplate the free supply of arms to Iraq at atime when profitable exports were of growing importance to our economic position. If arms had to be supplied to Iraq without charge, this should be so arranged that it would not provoke demands for free supply to other countries such as Pakistan. The proposedlinking of the supply of arms with the taking over by Iraq of the installations at Habbaniya and Shaiba might safeguard this position;but it should be borne in mind that the higher the value we put uponthe installations, the greater the quantity of free arms which wouldhave to be supplied. He also desired that other oustanding claimsshould, if possible, be settled during the course of the treaty negotiations.The Cabinet were informed that the United States Governmentwere ready to offer free supplies of equipment to the Iraqis and thatwe should have to make some free supply if we were to ensure thatthe Iraqi forces continued to use British equipment. If, however, thiswas assured, Iraq would have continuing need of spare parts andreplacements for which payment would be demanded. Moreover,the amount of the compensation payable for the installations, whichwas to be used as a fund for the supply of arms, would be much lessthan the total sum which the Iraqis would need to spend on there-equipment of their forces. Finally, it was hoped that some ofIraq&apos;s requirements might be met by &quot; off-shore &quot; purchase of british equipment by the United States Government.The Commonwealth Secretary said that the arrangements proposed in C. (55) 70 would be welcomed by most other commonwealth Governments. He would wish to inform them ofthe stage reached in the negotiations. This information might,however, be withheld from the Government of India, to whom theAgreement was unlikely to be wholly welcome.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the proposals in C. (55) 70.(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would arrange for continuing consultation with the Treasury on the detailed arrangements for the transfer of the fixed installations inIraq and the supply of arms and also on the settlementof outstanding claims.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments of the stage now reached inthe negotiations for a new Anglo-Iraqi Agreement.
