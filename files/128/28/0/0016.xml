Formosa.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)aircraft production.Swift fighter aircraft.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 12thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memo-randum by the Secretary of State for Air and the Minister ofSupply (C. (55) 37) on the supply of Swift fighters to the R.A.F.The Minister of Supply said that, since the Cabinefs last discussion, the further tests of the latest improvements made in this aircraft had been completed, and the problem had again been reviewed by the Ministers directly concerned. It had already beenestablished that the first three Marks of the Swift were not suitablefor squadron service with the R.A.F. It was now clear that the mark 4, although considerably improved, could not be relied on ataltitudes above 40,000 feet and would not therefore be efficient inthe interception role for which it had been intended. Final decisions about Marks 5 and 7 could not yet be taken but there was a fairprospect that they would prove acceptable for fighter reconnaissance and for carrying air-to-air guided missiles, respectively. Mark 6 was unacceptable for the photographic reconnaissance role for which itwas required. In these circumstances, he sought the cabinet&apos;s approval for the following recommendations : (i) that acceptances ofMark 4 should be limited to the forty aircraft which were virtuallycompleted and that, for the rest, this Mark of Swift should be replaced by Hunters; (ii) that orders should be maintained for fifty Mark 5 and thirty Mark 7 Swifts on the understanding that, if these Marks should eventually prove satisfactory, orders for them might possibly beincreased; and (iii) that, as an insurance, the possibilities should nowbe explored of using Hunter aircraft both for fighter reconnaissancepurposes and for carrying our first air-to-air guided weapon, BlueSky. Orders on this scale should be sufficient to enable VickersSupermarine to retain enough skilled staff to be able to proceed indue course to the production of the new naval fighter, N. 113. As a corollary to these proposals, he also sought authority to place firmorders forthwith for initial deliveries of 250 Blue Sky projectiles. Itwas important that these orders should be placed without further delay, and there was now a reasonable prospect that, when the firstBlue Sky projectiles were delivered, either Mark 7 Swift aircraft ormodified Hunter aircraft would be available to carry them.In discussion there was general support for the recommendationsput forward by the Minister of Supply.1. The Cabinet were informed of the terms of president eisenhower&apos;s reply to the personal message which the Prime minister had sent to him following the Cabinefs discussion on 15th February.The Cabinet were impressed by the firmness with which thePresident had stated the considerations underlying the policy of theUnited States Administration in respect of the islands off the Chinacoast. His message suggested that the Administration would not easily be persuaded to the view that the Chinese Nationalists shouldbe withdrawn from all the coastal islands. It was evidently their considered judgment that the Chinese Nationalist forces had animportant part to play in containing Communist encroachment inthe Far East and South-East Asia as a whole, and that their withdrawal from Quemoy and the Matsus would seriously impairtheir effectiveness for this purpose. It was also clear that theyassessed more highly than we the power of the Chinese Communiststo threaten in the long run the security, not only of Formosa, but of japan.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.
i - : -4.The following points were made in further discussion:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could agreegenerally with these recommendations. He would, however, wish todiscuss further with the Minister of Supply the proposed ordering of250 Blue Sky projectiles, the cost of which he understood to be about 3 million.(b) There was no reason to doubt that production of Hunteraircraft would prove adequate to the increased demand arising notonly from partial replacement of the Swift but also from off-shoreorders placed by the United States Government.ic) It was assumed that the Blue Sky weapon would eventuallygive place to the Blue Jay, which would be carried by the all-weather. Javelin fighter. It was, however, right that Blue Sky should first bebrought into use, as there could be no certainty either that thedevelopment of Blue Jay, which was based on different principles,would proceed without interruption, or that the Blue Jay projectileand the Javelin aircraft to carry it would, in fact, become availabletogether on the date now planned.(d) Care would be needed in presenting to the public theGovernments decisions on future production of Swift aircraft. Onthe one hand, it was important to avoid any impression that theprogramme of Swift production had been a total failure. On theother hand, the future of these aircraft was still far from certain, andthe Government would be well advised to say nothing which theymight later have to retract.The Minister of Defence said that, in reply to Questions whichhe was to be asked in the House of Commons on the following day,he proposed to recall that, as had already been announced, Marks 1,2 and 3 of the Swift could not be brought up to an acceptableoperational standard. He would then go on to say that, after furthertests on the Mark 4, it had been decided that the production of this aircraft should be restricted to a limited number and that we shouldrely mainly on the Hunter, which had been developed as a parallelproject and had proved fully suitable for use as an interceptor fighter and for future development. He would add that development work would continue on other Marks of the Swift intended for certainspecialist roles.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Supply to act on the recommend a-tions summarised under (i) to (iii) above.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss further with the Minister of Supply the proposal that orders for 250 Blue Sky weapons should be placedforthwith.(3) Approved the lines on which the Minister of Defenceproposed to announce in the House of Commons theGovernments decisions about the future of Swift aircraft.Monopolies andRestrictivePractices.(previous reference:C.C. (52) 89thConclusions,Minute 8.)3. The President of the Board of Trade said that the House ofCommons was to debate on 24th February an Opposition motiondeploring the slow progress made in dealing with the harmful effects of monopolies and price rings in industry and trade, and calling onthe Government to take all possible measures by legislation andother means to protect the public interest against the misuse of monopoly powers. The President suggested that the Governmentshould move an amendment which would make it clear that it wasthe Governments policy fully to investigate alleged monopolies and restrictive practices before deciding what action could be taken inrespect of them. The President said that he would be speaking in the
5CC. 16 (55)debate and would take that opportunity of announcing theGovernment&apos;s acceptance of the recent report of the monopolies commission on the calico printing industry.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to table aGovernment amendment, in the terms proposed, to theOpposition motion on monopolies and restrictive practices.4. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, with growingprosperity, some inflationary pressure had developed in the internal economy which was having an adverse effect on the balance ofpayments. The latest trade returns showed that the substantial increase in imports was not matched by the increase in exports. Theterms of trade had taken a further turn against us. The yield frominvisible exports was not as high as had been hoped, largely becauseof the effect of the oil settlements with countries of the Middle East.Overseas expenditure was also increasing. In addition, there was acertain amount of trafficking in transferable sterling, throughcommodity operations, which affected the strength of sterling.He was satisfied that prompt action would have to be taken to correct this situation. He would submit definite proposals to theCabinet at an early date.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 42) on the difficulties andanxieties of the cotton industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that the main concern of the cotton industry was at the increase in imports of grey cotton cloth, especially from India. It would be difficult to keep out such imports: tariff action would involve the re-negotiation of the trade agreement with India, and would be likely to lead to modification ofthe Ottawa Agreements with other Commonwealth countries: quotaaction would have to be on a non-discriminatory basis, underArticle XIX of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade(G.A.T.T.) and, unless the industry were threatened with serious injury, to impose quotas^ would expose our exports to retaliatory action. He would, however, consult with the other ministers concerned in order to be ready, if necessary, to take action to restrict imports of Indian grey cloth.The real difficulties of the cotton industry were due, not tocompetitive imports, but to the loss of export trade, especially incheap cotton cloth, owing to Japanese and Indian competition, mainly in the Colonies. Colonial Governments had eased their restrictionson imports of Japanese textiles when Japan had an adverse balance oftrade with the sterling area. Japan was now accumulating sterling balances, and it would be of great assistance to Lancashire ifColonial Governments could be persuaded to reduce their importsof Japanese textiles. He suggested that Colonial Governments shouldbe warned to consider this now, not as a long-term policy, but on theground that it was justified in view of the balance of trade betweenthe sterling area and Japan.The future of the cotton industry lay in concentrating on theproduction of higher quality cloth. But it was the high-qualitysection of the industry that bore the burden of purchase tax.  The
removal of purchase tax would be the most important measure that could be taken to assist the industry, but he realised the difficulties involved in making this concession.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The complaints about the increased imports of cotton greycloth were aggravated by the high tariff maintained by India on united Kingdom textiles. We might try to persuade the indian government voluntarily to reduce this tariff, but we should have tobe careful to avoid giving any assurance in exchange that we wouldnot impose a quota on Indian textiles.(b) It was suggested that, in the light of the governments general external economic policy, it was difficult to ask colonial governments to restrict imports from Japan, unless there weregeneral balance of payments difficulties; and that, before doing so,we should in any event invite the Japanese, in view of theiraccumulation of sterling earnings, to increase their purchases fromthe sterling area. On the other hand, if action were needed to restrict imports of Japanese textiles into the Colonies, it should be takensoon to be effective. It would therefore be best to draw the attentionof Colonial Governments to the need to consider this possibility, inthe light of information we should seek about the level of purchaseswhich Japan intended to make from the sterling area.(c) It would help to show Government concern at the difficultiesof the cotton industry if an early announcement were made of theGovernments decision not to accept G.A.T.T. obligations towardsJapan at the present time.(d) The maintenance of purchase tax was particularly valuable inpresent circumstances as a means of restricting the spending powerof consumers. There was even greater pressure from other industries to remove purchase tax than there was from the textile industry.(e) The Prime Minister said that he had been asked to receive adeputation from Lancashire to discuss these problems. He was inclined to accede to this request, even though there did not seemmuch that could be done to help the cotton industry in presentcircumstances. It was suggested that, if such a deputation wasreceived, it should represent all sections of the industry, includingfinishers and exporters as well as manufacturers; and that theindustry might usefully be asked what specific measures they thought to be needed.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement in C. (55) 42 of the current problems of the cotton industry.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the colonial secretary and the President of the Board of Trade tosettle the terms of a communication to be made toColonial Governments inviting them to consider thepossibility of restricting their imports of Japanese textiles,in the light of information to be sought about the level of japanese purchases from the sterling area.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,22nd February, 1955.
