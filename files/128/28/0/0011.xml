3CC. 11 (55)Remuneration 1   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in pursuance ofof Ministers.     the Cabinefs decision of 20th October, 1954, he had discussed with(Previous        the Foreign Secretary and the Lord Privy Seal the proposals outlinedReference:      in his memorandum C. (54) 313 on the remuneration of Ministers.CC. (54) 68th   He was satisfied that there was a very strong case on the merits for conclusions,    increasing the salaries of Junior Ministers, but he would be guidedMinute 3.)       by the views of his colleagues on the question whether legislation for this purpose should be introduced in the lifetime of this parliament.  If it were decided to proceed with this in the present session, he would prefer that the legislation should deal only withthe   remuneration   of   Ministers   of   State   and   parliamentary secretaries: he did not think that the time was opportune for makingthe proposed increase in the remuneration of Cabinet Ministers.In discussion it was agreed that the salaries of Junior Ministersought to be increased. Discussion turned wholly on the questionwhether legislation for this purpose should be passed in the present session, with effect from the beginning of the new Parliament, orwhether it should be deferred until a new Parliament had beenelected. The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was againstintroducing this legislation in the present Parliament.The Cabinet Agreed that legislation dealing with the remuneration ofMinisters should not be introduced in the present Parliament.Parliament. 2.   The Lord President said that the Cabinefs decision to deferExpenses of the improvement of Junior Ministers&apos; salaries strengthened the casePeers. for early introduction of the projected scheme for granting allowances(Previous        to Peers for attendance on their Parliamentary duties.   A PeerReference:      appointed to be a Junior Minister had only the salary of that post,CC. (55) 6th&apos;    while Junior Ministers in the Commons Continued to draw part of conclusions,    their Parliamentary salary and could claim income tax relief in respectMinute 6.)       of expenses. The case for introducing some system of allowances forPeers was very strong; and he had already stated in the House ofLords, with the Cabinefs authority, that the problem was one whichmust be faced at the earliest practicable date.   He hoped that hiscolleagues would not close their minds to the possibility of introducing the projected scheme before the end of the present Parliament, andhe suggested that the Cabinet should consider the matter again beforethe debate on House of Lords reform which Lord Samuel was due to open on 7th March.In discussion it was argued that the considerations which had led the Cabinet to defer the introduction of legislation on ministerial salaries pointed to the conclusion that the introduction ofParliamentary allowances for Peers should be similarly postponed.47691-3The Cabinet Agreed to consider again in a fortnight&apos;s time whether ascheme of allowances to Peers for attendance on their parliamentary duties in the House of Lords should beintroduced before the end of the present Parliament.p. 2
Policy.       3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Defence (C. (55) 29) submitting for the approval of the Cabinet:      the draft of the annual Statement on Defence, which he proposed to75th   present to Parliament as a White Paper on 17th February. They alsoons,    had before them a report by the Home Defence Committee.)       (C.^(5^5) 30) on the cost of defence preparations by Civil Departmentsiper. The Minister of Defence said that the draft White Paper hadbeen considered by the Defence Committee and incorporated anumber of amendments which they had suggested. He had in preparation a separate White Paper dealing in greater detail with the; difficulties which had been met in developing the supply of Serviceaircraft j and a draft of this would be submitted for the Cabinefsconsideration later in the week.In discussion of the draft White Paper the following points weremade:- &quot; -(a) The Cabinet confirmed their decision of 4th February thatthe modification of the atomic weapons programme should be announced in the Defence White Paper and approved, subject to adrafting amendment, the terms in which this decision was stated inparagraph 3 of the draft annexed to C. (55) 29.(b) By the terms of paragraphs 70-72 of the draft White paper the Government would be committed to maintaining the currentperiod of two years&apos; whole-time National Service. When the draft was under consideration by the Defence Committee, it had beensuggested that some reduction of the period might be justified on military grounds. It was however argued that, even if this were so,it would be inexpedient to hold out any hope at the present time that it might become possible to reduce the period. If any suchindication were given now, the period of National Service wouldbecome a matter for political manoeuvring between the Parties.The Cabinet approved the terms of paragraphs 70-72 of thedraft White Paper.(c) The new scheme for developing a Mobile Defence Corpsmanned by members of the Armed Forces had made it necessaryto readjust the earlier scheme for training Class H reservists of theRoyal Air Force in Civil Defence duties. Means of making thisadjustment had now been worked out, and the terms of paragraph118 of the draft would be revised to take account of them.The Secretary of State for Air suggested that in redrafting thisparagraph it should be borne in mind that the reorganisation of theTerritorial Army might provide a fresh source of reservists, inaddition to the Class H reservists of the R.A.F., for training in civil defence duties.(d) The references to the risk of major war^, in paragraph 55 ofthe draft, should be reconsidered in the light of recent developments in the international situation.(e) The point should be made in paragraph 10 that theagreements resulting from the London and Paris conferences would,among other advantages, make independent recourse to warimpossible for any of the countries which were parties to them.(f) The reference in paragraph 100 to co-operation with other commonwealth countries on defence matters should be expanded inthe light of the consultations which had taken place during therecent Commonwealth Meeting in London.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of Defence to revise the draft white paper to take account of the points noted above andother drafting suggestions approved in the cabinets discussion, and authorised him to publish the white paper, as so revised, on 17th February.(2) Took note of the report of the Home Defence Committee(C. (55) 30) on the cost of defence preparations by civil departments in 1955.
Atomic Energy.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 90thConclusions,Minute 3.)CivilProgramme.4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (C. (55) 31) covering the draft of a White Paper outlining the programme, which had already been approved by the Cabinet,for the development of power from atomic energy for civil purposes.The Lord President drew the Cabinefs attention to the fact thatit was disclosed in the White Paper that the power station at CalderHall was designed to produce fissile material for military purposes,as well as electricity for civil use. According to the advice of her majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington, this disclosure would not be unwelcome to the United States Government.The Cabinet-Authorised the Lord President to present to Parliament on15th February a White Paper on civil uses of atomic energyin the terms of the draft annexed to C. (55) 31.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,10th February, 1955.\
