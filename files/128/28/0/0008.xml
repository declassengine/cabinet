CMna* 1.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 15th December theTreatment of Cabinet had approved the publication of a report on the treatmentBritish of British prisoners of war captured in Korea.   Publication of thisPrisoners in. document had, however, been delayed while the Secretary-GeneralKorean War. of the United Nations was conducting his mission to Peking with the(Previous aim of securing the release of certain United States airmen whoReference: were still held in Chinese custody. The Secretary-General had nowC.C. (54) 87th said that he did not wish this publication to be further delayed on conclusions,     this account.Minute 7.) jn fjiscussion it was argued that the Government might be opento some criticism if they brought this document out at a moment when they were trying to persuade the Chinese Communist Govern-ment to participate in discussions in the Security Council designed toreduce the existing tension in the Far East.The Cabinet Agreed to defer for two weeks their decision regarding thedate of publication of the report on the treatment of british prisoners of war captured in Korea.Formosa. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Soviet Government had(Previous        now asked for an immediate meeting of the Security Council to reference:      consider &quot; acts of aggression by the United States against the People&apos;sC.C. (55) 7th    Republic of China in the area of Taiwan and other islands of China.&quot;Conclusions,    It need not be assumed that their motives were necessarily hostile:Minute 4.)       it was conceivable that their resolution had been framed with a viewto making it possible for the Chinese Communist Government tosend representatives to the discussions in the Security Council.   Asa result of consultations between the representatives in New Yorkof the United Kingdom, United States, New Zealand and France,it was now proposed that this request by the Soviet Governmentshould  be  placed   on   the   agenda   of   the   Security   Councilsimultaneously with that previously put forward by the New zealand government on the understanding that the New Zealand itemwould be discussed first and that any communication inviting theChinese Communist Government to be represented at the ensuingdiscussions should be related to that request.The Foreign Secretary said that, while the discussions in theSecurity Council were likely to last for several days, it was not too early to consider what line we should take if they produced no result.To assist the Cabinet in considering this he had put together somesuggestions, in the form of a draft telegram to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington. Copies of this draft were handed round. If Ministers were in broad agreement with the general linethere suggested, it might be adopted as a basis for discussion at theforthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers. It wasfortunate that we should have that opportunity for ascertaining theviews of other Commonwealth Governments on this question.In discussion of this draft the following points were made :  (a) Further consideration should be given to the terms ofparagraph 11 of the draft. First, there might be some inconsistencybetween this and what was said in paragraph 7. Secondly, reference might be made to the human, as well as the juridical, arguments against accepting the Communists&apos; claim to Formosa. In many countries public opinion would be impressed by the argument thatthe followers of Chiang Kai-shek now in Formosa should not be abandoned to the Communists. Thirdly, the analogy with cyprus and Gibraltar might be put in more general terms.(b) The Prime Minister said that he had made some suggestions to, the Foreign Secretary about the advice which we might offer tothe  United  States  Government.    It  was  important  that  the
Administration should not get into a position from which theycould not extricate themselves without the appearance of a diplomaticdefeat. On the other hand, if they took a firm stand on a reasonableposition, it seemed unlikely that the Chinese Communists wouldpress their claims to a point at which they ran the risk of provokinggeneral hostilities with the United States.(c) It would be helpful if the Foreign Secretary would circulate,for the information of the Cabinet, a note on the juridical position inrelation to Formosa.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary, in the light of thepoints raised in the Cabinefs discussion and of the suggestions communicated to him by the Prime Minister,would re-cast the draft telegram to Her Majesty&apos;ambassador at Washington which he had circulated asa basis for the Cabinefs discussion.(2) Took note that, during the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers, the opportunity wouldbe taken to ascertain the views of other commonwealth governments on the present situation in the Far East.(3) Agreed to consider at a further meeting what advice mightbe given to the United States Government on this subjectif no practical results emerged from the current discussions in the Security Council.South-East 3.   in connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingAsia Treaty     Minute The Foreign Secretary said that he had increasing misgivingsOrganisation,   about  the wisdom  of his  leaving  the  United  Kingdom  on(Previous        18th February as he would have to do if he were to carry out his planReference:      of attending the meeting in Bangkok of the Manila Treaty Powers.e.G. (54) 59th   He was anxious not to disappoint the United States Secretary of conclusions,    State, and other Commonwealth Governments had also attachedMinute 2.)       importance to his attending the proposed meeting.  It might be that,in present international circumstances, Mr. Dulles himself would be reluctant to leave the United States at that time, and he proposed toask Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington to sound Mr. Dulleson this point.   He would also take an opportunity of seeking theviews of the Prime Ministers of Australia and New Zealand.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Atomic Energy.       The Minister of Defence recalled that on 26th July the CabinetWeapons        had decided that the current programme for the manufacture of programme.     atomic weapons in this country should be so adjusted as to allow for(Previous        the production of thermo-nuclear bombs. The Defence Committee,References:     when they had considered on 27th January the draft of the DefenceCC. (54) 53rd   White Paper, had come to the conclusion that the time had nowConclusions,    arrived when a public announcement of this decision should be madeMinute 3.)        either in the Defence White Paper or before its presentation toParliament. They were proposing to recommend to the Cabinet thatthe announcement should be incorporated in the Defence white paper.   Meanwhile, an exposition of our defence policy would haveto be given at the forthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters.   He was to make a statement on this at a meeting ofrepresentatives of the old Commonwealth countries on 1st February;and the Prime Minister would be giving a similar exposition on thefollowing day at a plenary session including representatives of all the
external trade and payments.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 6thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 26) on the prospects for the overseas trade of the United Kingdom.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, although exports had reached record levels in 1954 in both value and volume, overseas expenditure was rising faster than overseas earnings. The increasein imports was substantially due to increased industrial production.It was important to keep the economy as free from inflation aspossible, and the recent increase in the Bank rate had already had a beneficial effect. The level of the gold and dollar reserves had beensustained during the current month. The terms of trade had turnedslightly against us. We should have to watch our balance ofpayments carefully and be ready to take any measures necessary toimprove it.One of the most important factors was the unsatisfactory coalposition. Production was insufficient, and it was wastefully used: asa result coal exports had had to be reduced and imports had had tobe increased.The Cabinet-Took note of C. (55) 26.tariff policy.Japan and theG.A.T.T.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 6thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 27) outlining the course whichthe United Kingdom Government might follow in connection withthe accession of Japan to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (G.A.T.T.).The President of the Board of Trade said that the foreign secretary and other Ministers principally concerned had agreed thatthis course should be put to the Cabinet as a basis for discussion.Although, by invoking Article XXXV of the G.A.T.T., it did not satisfy the aims of our foreign policy, it went as far as seemed possible, in present political circumstances, in expressing an intentionto work towards a position in which we could accept G.A.T.T.obligations towards Japan. This would not involve us in any commitment to accept such obligations, or to admit Japanese goodsmore freely, at any specific date. However, an offer to negotiate acommercial treaty with Japan, under which we should undertake to commonwealth countries. Our defence policy could not be adequately explained without disclosing our intention to proceed withthe production of thermo-nuclear weapons. He therefore suggestedthat the Cabinet should authorise the disclosure of this information toother Commonwealth Prime Ministers at the meetings on 1st and2nd February.The Prime Minister said that in the circumstances described bythe Minister of Defence it seemed clear that our intention to proceedwith the production of thermo-nuclear weapons in this country should be disclosed to other Commonwealth Prime Ministers, at their meetings, in advance of the public announcement which would bemade, if the Cabinet agreed, when the Defence White Paper was published on 17th February.The Cabinet Agreed that other Commonwealth Prime Ministers shouldbe informed in confidence, during the forthcoming Meeting,of the decision to proceed with the production of thermo-nuclear weapons in this country.
continue to give her most-favoured-nation treatment on tariffs, wouldbe regarded by industry as an important concession to the Japanese.To defend this concession the Government would have to be able tosay that they intended to take powers to impose countervailing dutiesagainst dumped goods if necessary, and that they were prepared tointroduce legislation for this purpose during the current year.The Cabinet were informed that Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in tokyo had been made aware of the course contemplated. He had asked that, if it were adopted, it should not be announced until afterthe General Election in Japan (27th February), and that he shouldbe authorised to inform the Japanese Foreign Minister in advanceof any announcement of the decision. He had also suggested thatthe description of the offer to negotiate a commercial treaty shouldbe amended.In discussion, it was agreed that it would not be necessary to announce any decision before 27th February, and that the JapaneseForeign Minister ought to be informed of the decision before anannouncement was made. Some announcement would have to bemade at the end of the current negotiations for the review of theG.A.T.T., and it would be best for officials to examine the timing of any statement of policy.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the course to be followed in connection with the accession of Japan to the G.A.T.T. should be as described in the Annex to C. (55) 27, subject to amendment in thelight of Conclusion (3) below.(2) Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to discussthe United Kingdom intentions informally with the PrimeMinisters of Australia and New Zealand and to ascertain what course their Governments intended to follow in thismatter.(3) Agreed that the timing of any announcement of government policy on this question should be examined further by officials of the Departments concerned, but that thedecision should not be announced in any event until after27th February, and that the Japanese Foreign minister should be informed of it before an announcement wasmade.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the President of the Boardof Trade to settle, as part of the course decided upon,the description of the offer to negotiate a commercial treaty with Japan.Railways. 7.   The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that(Previous        the Chairman of the British Transport Commission would that after-Reference:      noon invite the co-operation of the Railway Unions in  theCC. (55) 6th    appointment of a joint consultative council for the promotion of conclusions,    efficiency and the increase of productivity in British Railways.   he Minute 5.) &apos;    suggested that, if the Unions promised their co-operation, theGovernment should immediately make it clear that they welcomedsuch a development.  He therefore sought the Cabinefs approval ofthe terms of a draft Parliamentary statement, copies of which were handed round at the meeting.The Cabinet approved the course proposed and the terms of thedraft statement.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) As it was now clear that the debate in the House of commons on 3rd February would be wide-ranging, it was proposed that theMinister of Transport should reply to the debate, which was to be opened by the Parliamentary Secretary, Minister of Labour, and that
the Chancellor of the Exchequer should intervene at an appropriatestage to deal briefly with the financial aspects of the problems underdiscussion.(b) It was,desirable to retain the reference in the draft statement to the British Productivity Council, which was a body representativeof both sides of industry.The Cabinet Authorised the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour,to make a statement in the House of Commons, in the termsof the draft which he had circulated, welcoming theappointment of a joint consultative council for the promotion of efficiency in British Railways.8. The Cabinet Were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the week beginning 7th February.9. The Cabinet were informed that Government supporters had shown substantial opposition to the project of Mr. C. Osborne, M.P.,to seek leave to introduce under the ten-minute rule a Bill restrictingcoloured immigration into this country. Mr. Osborne did not nowintend to proceed with this project. This had some immediateadvantage for the Government, as the forthcoming visit of PrincessMargaret to the West Indies and the recent election in Jamaica of agovernment whose future policy was unpredictable made the presentan inopportune moment to initiate action in this matter. On theother hand, the need for early action was in no way diminished andthe introduction of a Private Member&apos;s Bill would at least have provided an opportunity for the expression of public and parliamentary opinion on the subject. The Cabinet were informedthat the question might be raised in the House of Commons that afternoon during the Second Reading debate on the Bill for transferring responsibility for the administration of the Cocos Islandsto the Australian Government. Certain Opposition Members were aware of the inability of the Australian Government to promiseunrestricted entry to Australia for Cocos Islanders after the proposed transfer arid intended to raise this aspect of the matter in the courseof debate on the Bill.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.10. The Minister of Housing said that there were three courses open to the Government in relation to the Private Member&apos;s Bill,sponsored by Mr. Nabarro, M.P., and based on the recommendationsof the Beaver Committee, which was down for Second Reading on 4th February. First, they could allow the Bill to proceed in theknowledge that it would be passed but would prove unworkable andwould have to be repealed later. This would plainly be unsatis-factory. Secondly, they could co-operate with Mr. Nabarro in improving the Bill. He did not recommend this course. There were strong constitutional objections to incorporating important financial provisions in a Private Member&apos;s Bill. Moreover, it was unlikely that sufficient time would be available to complete the radical recastingof the Bill which would be needed. Thirdly, he could announce inthe House of Commons that the Government had in hand thepreparation of legislation of their own, but that this could not beintroduced until the necessary discussions with local authorities and
with industry had been completed. He would be careful to avoid any commitment to introduce Government legislation within a statedperiod but, if it could be clearly shown that the Government intendedto deal with this problem, there were grounds for believing thatMr. Nabarro would agree to withraw his Bill.The Minister said that he recommended the third course, whichwould be the logical sequel to his announcement on 25th January thatthe Government had decided in principle to adopt the policy recommended by the Beaver Committee.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Housing to state, in the SecondReading debate on Mr. Nabarro&apos;s Clean Air Bill, that theGovernment had in hand the preparation of legislation to implement the recommendations of the Beaver Committee,on the understanding that the Government would notbe committed to carrying a Government Bill on this subjectthrough all its stages in both Houses in the present session.Privileges and 11.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreignimmunities. Secretary (C. (55) 24) on the privileges and immunities to be(Previous accorded to the international staff of the proposed WesternReference:      European Union (W.E.U.).C.C. (54) 2nd It was stated in the memorandum that the first step would be to conclusions, negotiate an agreement with the other members of W.E.U. with minute 9.) a view to the subsequent submission to Parliament of the necessaryWestern Order-in-Council under the International Organisations (ImmunitiesEuropean and Privileges) Act, 1950. The new agreement would be modelled, inUnion. so far as the W.E.U. Assembly was concerned, on the correspondingsection of the Agreement on Privileges and Immunities for theCouncil of Europe and, for the rest, on the 1951 North atlantic treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.) Agreement on the status of N.A.T.O.national representatives and international staff. The privileges and immunities which would be enjoyed by W.E.U. staff on this basiswere summarised in the Annex to the paper.The Lord Privy Seal said that, despite the wide measure of support for Western European Union, it must not be assumed thatthere would not be opposition in Parliament to the proposed agreement on privileges and immunities.\The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the negotiation of an agreement on the lines proposed inC. (55) 24 and for the subsequent submission of thenecessary Order-in-Council to Parliament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,31st January, 1955.
