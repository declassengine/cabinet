v Prince ol -Hanover.Claim to British&quot;^Nationality.:-. &apos;(previous reference.:&apos;&quot; C.C.(55) 7th :. Conclusions,Minute 8.) . . -,; 3. The Home Secretary reported to the Cabinet the results ofhis further consultations with the Lord Chancellor and the Attorney-General about:the possible legal consequences of a declaration bythe courts that the Prince of Hanover was a British subject by virtueof the Act of 1705 entitled &quot;An Act for the Naturalisation of theMost Excellent Princess Sophia Electress and Duchess Dowager ofHanover and the Issue of her Body.&quot;. &apos; .    &apos;The Home Secretary said that he was advised that if, as seemedvery likely, the Prince of. Hanover should succeed in his action inthe Chancery Division, in which he was claiming a declaration that49602-1&apos;b 2
*-he was a British subject by virtue of the Act of 1705, all linealdescendants. of Princess Sophia born before. 1949 would, by thisdecision of the courts, likewise be deemed to be, or to have been,British subjects. One such lineal descendent was Louis IV of Hesse,who had married Princess Alice, daughter of Queen Victoria.As the Cabinet would be aware, the Royal Marriages Act, 1772,laid it down that any descendant of King George II,- whether maleor female, but excluding the issue of princesses who married intoforeign families, must, before marrying, obtain the&apos;previous consentof the Sovereign, signified under the&apos;Great Seal and declared inCouncil, and that any such marriage contracted without such consentshould be deemed null and void. Queen Victoria&apos;s consent&apos;had been duly obtained for the marriage of Princess Alice to Louis IV of Hessebut, as the latter had been assumed at the time to be a foreigner,consent had not been obtained for the marriage of their daughter,the Princess Victoria.; One consequence, therefore of a successful outcome to the present action in the Chancery Division would be torender that marriage null and void. Similar results would no doubtfollow in other comparable cases.&apos;The Foreign Secretary said that a further consequence of a successful outcome to the Prince of Hanoveris current action wouldbe to entitle him to the immediate issue of a British passport and toput him into a position to pursue his claims against the Austrian and united States authorities for the restitution of his estates in Austria,despite the fact that he had served in the German forces during theSecond World War. .&apos; Discussion showed that there were two possible courses open tothe Government. If the Prince&apos;s action in the Chancery Court wentforward, it would probably succeed. In that event the Governmentcould take whatever steps were open to them.to ensure that the outcome of the action received as little publicity as possible and, inparticular, that no public mention was made of the bearing of theCourfs decision upon the position under the Royal Marriages Act.It must be recognised, however, that, if the action were to come intocourt and be decided in favour of the Prince, it would arouse keeninterest among constitutional lawyers, who might well draw public attention to the resulting situation under the Royal.Marriages Act..Moreover, even if publicity were avoided at that stage, it was likely.to occur when the Prince subsequently became involved in actions forthe restitution of his estates in Austria.The alternative course would be for the Home Secretary to grant the Prince forthwith a certificate of British citizenship underSection 25 of the British Nationality Act, 1948, which empowered theHome&apos;Secretary to grant such a certificate in an individual case inwhich a doubt existed. If such a certificate were now issued to the prince, he would have no need to pursue his action in the ChanceryDivision. The Cabinet recognised that, in the short term, theadoption of this course would be likely to reduce the chances of publicity. It had, however, serious drawbacks. Thus, the formerHome Secretary had at an earlier stage declined to grant such acertificate to the Prince, and if one were now granted it would bedifficult to refuse similar certificates to - other descendants of the princess Sophia who might apply for them. Furthermore, this courseseemed unlikely to prevent publicity for any length of time seeing that the Prince would probably apply for, and would have to begranted, a British passport, and would thereafter pursue his claims for the restoration of his Austrian properties. Publicity in such circumstances seemed likely to be even more embarrassing as it would. be revealed that British nationality had been accorded to the Prince,not by a decision of the courts, but by the exercise of an administra-.tive discretion by the Home Secretary.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the balance ofadvantage lay in favour of leaving the Prince to pursue his action inthe Chancery Division but of taking all practicable steps to reduce
the chances of undesirable publicity, particularly about the bearingof the action on the position under the Royal Marriages Act. TheCabinet recognised that adoption of this course might mean that in&apos; the last, resort the. Government would be faced with the&apos;need to remedy the situation by legislation.     *     - -,v,&apos;r\) &quot;- \- &quot;.:The Cabinet  - &apos; . - -. Agreed that the Prince of Hanover&apos;s current action in theChancery Division for a declaration that he was a British&apos; subject should be left to take its course, but invited-theHome Secretary and the Attorney-General to take whatever- , action was  open to  them to reduce ,the chances of;    undesirable publicity for this action and, in particular, aboutthe bearing which its outcome might have upon the position&apos;-&apos; under,the Royal Marriages Act, 1112...:   &apos; ..   , . . -
