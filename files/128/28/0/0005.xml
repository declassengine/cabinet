Kenya.SurrenderOffer.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 4thConclusions.)1. The Cabinet were informed that the offer of new surrenderterms to Mau Mau terrorists had been well received by public opinion in this country and, to a lesser extent in Kenya. There had been some criticism from European residents in Kenya, and there was a wide measure of scepticism about the practical results which the offer was likely to produce. It was, however, too early as yet to form anyjudgment on this.The Cabinet Took note of this statement.Colonial 2.   The Cabinet again considered what action the Governmentimmigrants.     should take to deal with the problems resulting from the increasing(Previous       flow of coloured immigrants into this country.  They were informedReference:      that a deputation from Barbados was about to arrive in this country .C. (55) 3rd    with the object of pressing for an organised scheme of migration fromConclusions,    Barbados to the United Kingdom; that the Birmingham City CouncilMinute 6.)       had drawn attention to the serious housing problems resulting fromthe concentration of large numbers of coloured immigrants in slumhouses in that city; and that one of the Government^ own supporters in the House of Commons, Mr. Osborne, M.P., was intending to seekleave to introduce a Bill on the subject under the ten-minute rule.It was suggested that, if there were no real prospect of passing aGovernment Bill on the subject during the present session, theGovernment might with advantage appoint a Committee of Inquiry toreport on the social consequences of this flow of immigrants. Thereport of such a committee would reinforce the case for government action. On the other hand, the view was expressed that it was alreadyclear that there was urgent need of legislation to restrict the admission of coloured immigrants to this country, and that theGovernment would be amply justified in introducing a Bill for thispurpose.The Cabinet were informed that draft legislation was being prepared on the basis outlined in the Home Secretary&apos;s memorandum c. (55) 5.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at a later meeting.Soviet Union.Deserters.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 84thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that he had now received theadvice of the Law Officers on the case of a Soviet soldier, Kuptsov,who had sought asylum in the British Zone of Germany after killingone of his non-commissioned officers. The Law Officers had advised that there were np purely legal considerations which required the refusal or the granting of the Soviet application for the return ofKuptsov. The considerations which they had advanced, however,by analogy with extradition law, would support a refusal to hand backKuptsov. The Foreign Secretary therefore proposed to inform theSoviet authorities that in our view Kuptsov&apos;s offence had been committed in self-defence and that we had decided to grant himasylum as a political refugee. He proposed to take this course, eventhough this might make the Soviet authorities less ready than theyhad been of late to return to us British subjects who had come into their custody in the Soviet Zone of Germany.The Cabinet Approved the course which the Foreign Secretary proposedto take.
North atlantic council.MilitaryPlanning.(previous reference:CC. (54) 86thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that, in pursuance of the cabinet&apos;s request at their meeting on 14th December, he had considered what steps could be taken to ensure that potentialenemies were fully aware of the power of thermo-nuclear weapons.He had reached the conclusion that the Cabinet should review thisquestion again after the forthcoming Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers. It was proposed at that Meeting to give Common-wealth Prime Ministers some up-to-date information on this subject,and the Cabinet would be better able to judge, after that Meeting,whether it would be expedient to ask the Prime Minister of India to convey to the Chinese Government his sense of the gravity of the risks which they might be running. Before such a suggestion was made toMr. Nehru, he would verify that the United States Government hadno objection.The Cabinet Agreed to review this question after the end of theforthcoming Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers.Western 5.   The Foreign Secretary said that there was no support amongEuropean the other members of the Western European Union for the FrenchUnion. proposals for an armaments pool. These proposals contained supra-Arms Pool. national features which were unwelcome to other countries:moreover, they were almost certainly unworkable. All the other member countries were disposed to accept a practical scheme forstandardisation of arms; and he sought the Cabinefs agreement to hisputting forward practical proposals of our own for a scheme of standardisation at the appropriate stage in the discussions now proceeding in Paris.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to put forward proposalsfor standardisation of arms between members of theWestern European Union.Formosa. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-previous        ment had sought our views on the action which they proposed to takeReference:      in respect of the islands off the China coast which were at presentCC. (54) 84th   held by the Chinese Nationalists.   The United States GovernmentConclusions,    proposed to assist with sea and air forces the evacuation of ChineseMinute l.)       Nationalist forces from the Taachen Islands on the ground that these were too vulnerable and insufficiently important from the strategicpoint of view to justify an American commitment to defend them.At the same time, to offset the loss of morale which the evacuation of these islands would cause to the Chinese Nationalists and otheranti-Communist elements in the Far East, the United  StatesGovernment were ready to state that they would assist the ChineseNationalists   to   defend   Quemoy though   they   envisaged   this commitment as provisional and subject to any action which theUnited Nations might take to stabilise the situation in the area.Mr. Dulles also considered that the time had now come to proceedwith the earlier plan for raising the problem of Quemoy in theSecurity Council.The draft of a telegram to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,Washington, conveying the Foreign Secretary&apos;s views on these developments was read to the Cabinet. In this telegram thearguments against any United States commitment in respect of
Estimates 7.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommittee. Financial Secretary, Treasury (C. (55) 11), seeking the Cabinet&apos;?Report on guidance on the form of the reply to be made to the Seventh ReportForeign Service, from the Select Committee on Estimates.(Previous The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that, if the government reference: desired to make an early reply to the Select Committee&apos;s criticisms ofC.C. (54) 9lst the Foreign Service, this would best be done by means of a WhiteConclusions, Paper. On the other hand, to reply to the Committee by a WhiteMinute 2.) Paper might set an undesirable precedent and would be more likelyto stimulate pressure for a debate.The Foreign Secretary said that he was most anxious that a replyto the Select Committee^ criticisms should, if possible, be published by the end of January.There was general agreement that, in the circumstances, the replyto the Select Committee&apos;s criticisms on the Foreign Service shouldtake the form of a White Paper.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Financial Secretary, Treasury, to arrange for his committee to submit at the earliest possible date thedraft pf a White Paper replying to the criticisms on theForeign Service in the Seventh Report from the SelectCommittee on Estimates.The Financial Secretary, Treasury, said that it was also necessaryfor the Cabinet to consider how to deal with the wider question raised by Recommendation (4) of the Select Committee, namely, that&quot; urgent consideration should be given by the House to the way inwhich proper supervision could be exercised by its Cornmittees overthe everrihcreasing expenditure authorised by Parliament to be incurred in foreign territories.&quot;In discussion it was recalled that the Estimates Committee,during the course of the investigations which preceded the submission of their Seventh Report, had suggested that they should be permitted to conduct certain Investigations overseas, and it was &quot;likely that theCommittee had had this possibility in mind in making this particularSupervision ofOverseasExpenditure.Quemoy were forcibly stated. Thus, it was recalled that the UnitedStates Government had for long recognised that Quemoy wasstrategically unimportant and indefensible except by the use of nuclear weapons and it was nearer to the Chinese mainland thanthe Taachen Islands. What then was the justification for undertaking a commitment in respect of Quemoy which was consideredunwarranted in the case of the Taachen Islands? The point was also made that in international affairs provisional undertakings tended tobecome permanent. The telegram went on to state that, if the UnitedStates Government should decide against giving the proposedundertaking in respect of Quemoy, the United Kingdom Govern-ment would be ready? despite the risks? to consider proceeding withthe plan for raising the problem of Quemoy in the Security Council.In discussion there was general agreement with the foreign secretary&apos;s views on this question and on the terms of the telegram which he proposed to send to Washington.The Cabinet-Approved the term? of the communication which theForeign Secretary proposed to make to the United StatesGovernment.
recommendation. Discussion showed that there was general agree-ment in the Cabinet that it was neither necessary nor desirable thatCommittees of the House of Commons should conduct investigationsabroad.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that the Government^ views on this wider question should not be included in the White Paper replying to theEstimates Committee&apos;s criticisms of the Foreign Service;and invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to prepare,in consultation with the Lord Privy Seal and other ministers concerned, a draft of a Government statement on that question.Railways. 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous        Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (55) 13) suggesting that reference:      the Government^ attitude to the plan which had been submitted byC.C. (55) 3rd    the British Transport Commission (B.T.C.) on the modernisation of conclusions,    the railways should be announced in an early debate in Parliament,Minute 4.)       and that the opportunity of such a debate should be taken to dealwith the Reports of the Court of Inquiry into the recent railway wages dispute and the related question of man-power efficiency on therailways.  The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (55) 12) on the financial implications of the modernisation plan.Modernisation The Commission^ plan for mode mis citioii involved a totalPlan. investment of about  1,200 millions over a period of fifteen years.The Transport Commission had submitted it to the Minister ofTransport in pursuance of their statutory obligation to secure his approval for the general lines of any programme of reorganisationor development which involved substantial capital investment.In discussion the view was expressed that the Government should proceed with caution in giving even general approval to this plan.The long-term future of the railways was doubtful: in the years tocome roads, and perhaps aircraft, would take over much of the trafficnow carried by railways in this country. On the other hand, it waspointed out that the railways had been starved of capital investment for many years, and that the modernisation plan was based on estimates of the types and volume of traffic which were expected tobe available in the future. The plan was an imaginative one, andshould improve the economic position of the railways by  30 millionsnet annually by the end of fifteen years: this would more than offset the present annual deficit, which was assumed to be  25 millions.It was also pointed out that, over the next fifteen years,  600millions would be needed to maintain the railway system in its present state. And, if a comparison was to be made with investment on roads, only that part of the capital expenditure attributable to trackand signalling ( 210 millions) should be compared with the investment programme for the roads, which was about  400 millions over thenext ten years.The following points were also made in discussion:  (a) The capital investment would not have to be provided bythe Exchequer. The Transport Commission would find  400 millionsout of their current receipts, and the remaining  800 millions wouldbe raised on Government guarantee from the market.(b) Even if the Government were to say that they were in favourof modernising the railways, there were many aspects of the plan onwhich further information was necessary. The Government wouldbe in the position of underwriters, so far as the  800 millions of newmoney was concerned, and ought to be satisfied that the plan waseconomically sound.
East/west trade.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 87thConclusions.Minute 4.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 8) on the outstandingproblems of strategic controls over trade with countries in the soviet bloc.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had not beenable to persuade the Americans to accept a general settlement of the outstanding issues on the lines approved by the Cabinet on15th December, 1954. Ministers must therefore consider separatelyeach of the outstanding items, namely, shipping, copper wire and rolling-mills, to which had now been added communicationsequipment and electric generators.(c) The plan would mean a heavy call on the engineering industry, and care must be taken to ensure that this did not adversely affect exports. The Minister of Supply said that it was within the capacity of the engineering industry to meet the calls which this plan would make on it, but it would be useful if a Standing committee could be appointed, representative of the Transport Commission andthe engineering industry, to spread and apportion the orders.(d) It was important that the railway workers should be persuaded to support the execution of this plan. The annual lossof men, by death, retirement and resignation, was very high in this industry, and this should help to mitigate the difficulties of redundancy which the modernisation plan might involve.(e) It had been suggested that there should be an independent enquiry into the use of man-power on the railways. The Chairmanof the Transport Commission was not anxious to have such an enquiry, but was prepared to appoint one if the Government so desired. It was by no means certain that such an enquiry would help to enlist the support of railway workers for the modernisationplan. In any case, the question of efficiency in the short-term wasthe concern of the Transport Commission and should perhaps beconsidered separately from the man-power implications of the modernisation plan. This question could not be finally decided untilthe Final Pveport of the Court of Inquiry was available.Parliamentary The Cabinet were informed that the Final Report of the CourtArrangements,  of Inquiry might be presented to the Minister of Labour on thefollowing day.It was the general view that, before the two parties to the disputewere asked for their views on the Report, it should be considered bythe Cabinet, at a meeting on 24th January. At that meeting furtherconsideration could be given to the line to be taken by the Govern-ment in a general debate in the House of Commons covering, notonly the wage settlement and the question of man-power efficiency,but also the modernisation plan.It would in any case be desirable to postpone the british transport Commission (Borrowing Powers) Bill, which was at present to be taken in the House of Commons on 25th January. In reply to questions which would be asked in Parliament as soon as the Housereassembled it could be stated that the Government would arrangefor an early debate to deal with all these matters.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to inform the british transport Commission that they might publish theirmodernisation plan in the week beginning 24th January.(2) Agreed to consider the Final Report of the Committeeof Inquiry at a further meeting on 24th January.
As regards shipping, it was proposed that, since we could notdefend the terms for controls proposed by the Co-co-ordinating committee of the Paris Group (COCOM), which would make aspecial exception in favour of Denmark in respect of fast ships andwould give the United Kingdom only an equal share of a limitedquota for other ships, there was no alternative to continuing theexisting system. Under this each country was free to authorise sales of new or secondhand ships with speeds of up to 12 knots, but had to consult on sales of ships with a speed of over 12 knots. It was also proposed that we should abandon our present practice of imposing a unilateral embargo on sales of ships with a speed of over 16 knots;this voluntary embargo served no strategic purpose while othercountries were free to sell fast ships. These arrangements would givethe United Kingdom the same freedom as other countries, but there might be advantage in trying to modify the present controls by seeking agreement on embargo characteristics other than speed andon prior consultation only for sales of ships with a speed of over15^ knots.,The Foreign Secretary said that, although the Americans had made no concessions to us, he was reluctant to agree that we shouldreject entirely the new shipping controls proposed by COCOM. Ifwe could make some concession by accepting increased controls oversales of ships, the United States might still be ready to modify theirattitude on some of the other items. He regarded the question ofshipping as the most important of the items at issue, and he hadserious misgivings about the proposal to maintain the present arrangements and to abandon our unilateral embargo on fast ships.As regards copper wire, there was general agreement with theproposal that we should not agree to the restoration of a control which had only been removed last summer, and that we should makeit clear in COCOM that the normal List 3 procedure was adequate.It was, however, pointed out that there was an outstanding Russianorder with Crompton Parkinson for 18,000 tons of bare copper wire,and it was suggested that the company should not be given permission to fulfil this order until the United States had been informed of our decision.On rolling-mills, the Cabinet were in general agreement with theproposals of the President of the Board of Trade. This problem should be examined once more by defence experts of the UnitedKingdom and the United States, but it should be made clear that wereserved the right to table proposals in COCOM and possibly alsoto apply for a special exception in favour of the tin-plate mill.The Americans had wished to embargo a wide range of cablesand communications equipment. The Chiefs of Staff had recom-mended an embargo on co-axial cable and multipair cable; and theyhad also recommended an embargo on frequency repeater equipment,which had not been suggested by the Americans. As a concession to the Americans, it was proposed that there should be an embargo on co-axial cable and carrier frequency repeater equipment, but thata decision on multipair cable should await the results of the examina-tion which was being undertaken by experts of the United Kingdomand United States.   This proposal was approved.As regards electric generators, the Cabinet agreed that the compromise proposed by the Americans should be accepted. Thiswould mean that generators above 60,000 kW. would be embargoed,but that generators of between 5,000 and 60,000 kW. would be subjectto quantitative controls. It was also agreed that there was no case for the introduction of controls over prime movers.The Foreign Secretary said that there would be advantage in informing the United States of our decision to accept controls overcommunications equipment and electric generators, and of our willingness to examine the question of rolling-mills, before announ-influencing publicly, or in COCOM, our decisions about shipping andcopper wire.   There was general agreement with this suggestion.
The Cabinet Approved the proposals in C. (55) 8, but agreed that the americans should be informed of the decisions on com-munications equipment, electric generators and rolling-millsbefore any announcement was made of the decisions on shipping and copper wire.Civil Service. 10.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in pursuance of equal Pay. the statements which he had made in his Budget Speech, he had been discussing with the National Whitiey Council, a scheme for applying the principle of equal pay for men and women to the non-industrialgrades of the Civil Service. He had now secured agreement on ascheme by which this principle would be progressively applied tothese grades over a period of seven years. The cost in the first year would be  If millions. He had been under strong pressure to extend the principle to industrial civil servants, but had declined to do so.He hoped to be able to announce the conclusion of a firm agreement on this question soon after Parliament reassembled.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.Price of sugar.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 90thConclusions,Minute 7.)11. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (55) 9) proposing that the increasein the price of sugar to the refiners, which had been approved inprinciple by the Cabinet on 21st December, should come into effect at the end of January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this increase of price would save the Exchequer about  13 millions over the next fifteen months, with a negligible effect on the cost-of-living index. this increase in the price to refiners would mean that the retail price of sugar would be increased by \d. a lb. during the first week or ten days of February. The increased rates of National Assistance would come into operation on 7th February.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in C. (55) 9 for increasing the priceof sugar to refiners at the end of January 1955.Irisn   m 12.   The Common wealth Secretary said that the Irish RepublicanRepublic. Army had recently adopted more aggressive tactics in furtherance oftheir campaign to end Partition and had resorted to open acts of violence on the border with Northern Ireland. In November he hadbeen assured that the Government of the Republic were prepared totake drastic action to check these activities and to break up theorganisation of the Irish Republican Army. No such action had,however, been taken, and he feared that the Dublin Government had now abandoned that intention. They were evidently apprehensive that there would not be a sufficient body of public support in theRepublic for drastic action to suppress the Irish Republican Army.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the commonwealth secretary.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,20th January, 1955.
