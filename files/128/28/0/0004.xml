Kenya. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals madeSurrender by the Governor of Kenya for a new offer of surrender terms toOffer. Mau Mau terrorists.

Secretary&apos;s view that this further offer of clemency to terrorists wouldbe resented in Kenya unless it were accompanied by a suspension of, investigations into past irregularities by loyalists. The cabinet considered, however, that suspension of these investigations shouldbe presented as a consequence of the Governors decision to offernew surrender terms; and it was agreed that, in the draft announcement set out in Kenya telegram No. 41, the passagereferring to the surrender offer should precede the statement thatno further proceedings would be taken for past offences by membersof the security forces.Discussion then turned on the question whether it was expedient that those criminal proceedings against loyalists which had alreadybeen started should be completed, as the Governor proposed. some ministers felt that it would be easier to justify a complete suspension of all the action which was now in train with a view to punishingloyalists for past irregularities.

The Cabinet were informed that this had originally been the view of the Commander-in-Chief in Kenya.

Kenya.SurrenderOffer.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 3rdConclusions,Minute 1.)The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals madeby the Governor of Kenya for a new offer of surrender terms toMau Mau terrorists. They had before them two further telegrams(Kenya telegrams Nos. 35 and 41) outlining the terms of the public statements which the Governor of Kenya intended to make if his proposals were approved.After some further discussion the Cabinet accepted the colonial secretary&apos;s view that this further offer of clemency to terrorists wouldbe resented in Kenya unless it were accompanied by a suspension of investigations into past irregularities by loyalists. The cabinet considered, however, that suspension of these investigations shouldbe presented as a consequence of the Governors decision to offernew surrender terms; and it was agreed that, in the draft announcement set out in Kenya telegram No. 41, the passagereferring to the surrender offer should precede the statement thatno further proceedings would be taken for past offences by membersof the security forces.Discussion then turned on the question whether it was expedient that those criminal proceedings against loyalists which had alreadybeen started should be completed, as the Governor proposed. some ministers felt that it would be easier to justify a complete suspension of all the action which was now in train with a view to punishingloyalists for past ii regularities. This would appear to balance thenew offer of clemency which was to be made to all terrorists whosurrendered voluntarily. The Cabinet were informed that this had originally been the view of the Commander-in-Chief in Kenya. Onthe other hand, it was open to very serious question, bn constitutionalgrounds, whether a Government should for political reasonsintervene to stop judicial proceedings once a criminal charge hadbeen formally brought before a court. Indeed, it was doubtfulwhether the current proceedings could be stopped unless the attorney-General of Kenya were willing to enter a plea of nolleprosequi; and it was evident, from the telegrams which had been exchanged, that the Attorney-General was unwilling to do this.Moreover, on grounds of expediency, the Government of Kenyawould be ill-advised to lay themselves open to the criticism thatthey had taken this step in order to prevent the disclosure ofirregularities by Government servants in some of these cases.It was the general view of the Cabinet that in all thecircumstances they should not overrule the Governor^ view that thecourts should be allowed to complete those criminal proceedingswhich had already been started against loyalists in respect of pastmisdemeanours.The Cabinet were informed that the Governor^ legal adviserswere already considering what special emergency powers would berequired in order to provide a sound legal basis for the action whichhe was proposing to take.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward by the Governor of kenya for the offer of new surrender terms to Mau Mauterrorists and for the suspension of investigationsdesigned to uncover misdemeanours committed in thepast by loyalists in the course of their activities againstthe terrorists.(2) Invited the Colonial Secretary to advise the Governor that,in his public announcements, the suspension of investigations into the activities of loyalists should be presented as consequential upon the offer of newsurrender terms to the terrorists.(3) Took note that the legal authorities in Kenya were considering what emergency powers were needed toprovide a sound legal basis for this policy.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th January, 1955.
