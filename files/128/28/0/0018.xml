Situation;&apos;(previous reference:eC. (55) 17th.Conclusions.)Bank Rate.Hire-Purchase.Coal Prices.1. The Cabinet again reviewed, in the light of their discussion on the previous day, the measures which the Chancellor of theExchequer Was proposing to take to check the drain on the reserves of gold and dollars;They were informed that the Bank rate would be raised that morning from 3% per cent, to A\ per cent. This,, together with other measures already taken to restrict credit, should have a steadyingeffect. It should also ease the pressure on the reserves, by attractingfunds to London, There Were obvious advantages in taking this action before, rather than after, the monthly announcement on thestate of the reserves, which would be made on 2nd March.The power to control hire-purchase facilities had been resumed,by an Order in Council made that morning; and an Order imposingthe control would be made that afternoon by the President of theBoard of Trade. The Cabinet considered whether, in view of the congestion of the legislative programme, the Chancellor of theExchequer should include in his announcement that afternoon a state-ment of the Governments intention to seek permanent powers tocontrol hire-purchase facilities, or whether he should reserve this foruse in reply to supplementary questions. They agreed that, as it wasthe Governments general policy to rely as little as possible on emergency powers, the Chancellor should make it clear in his announcement that the Government intended, when opportunityoffered, to seek permanent powers to control hire-purchase facilities.The Cabinet Were informed that, as a result of consultationsbetween the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Minister of Fuel and power and the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, it was now proposed that the Chancellor&apos;s announcement should include a brief reference to coal prices in the following terms:  &quot; Coal, besides being a mainstay of our economy, has givengreat support to our balance of payments. This contribution hasrecently decreased substantially. We asked the newly-eonstituted National Coal Board, as one of their first acts, toconsider the whole matter of the industry&apos;s position in thenational economy, and they will be making a statement shortly.&quot;The Coal Board would then issue, later in the day, a separatestatement foreshadowing early increases in coal prices, indicating thatthey were about to discuss the details with the consumers&apos; councils and adding that over a wide range of household coals there wouldbe no increase in price.In discussion serious misgivings were expressed about theproposal that the Chancellor should make this reference to coal prices in his statement on the economic situation. A vague reference inthese terms would be out of harmony with the Governments decisiveaction under other heads. It would do nothing to remove uncertainty.It would riot establish a clear relation between coal prices and thebalance of payments. At the same time, it would suggest that theincreased coal prices were due to an initiative by the Government,and Ministers would thus assume an unnecessarily large share of theresponsibility for the rise in the cost of living which increased coal prices must eventually entail. For all these reasons it was the general view of the Cabinet that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should not include any reference to coal prices in his statement that afternoonon the economic situation, and that care should be taken to ensurethat any statement by the Coal Board foreshadowing increases in coal prices should not be linked with the measures which theGovernment were taking to check the drain on the gold and dollar reserves.
The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, even though the coalposition was not to be mentioned in the Chancellor^ statement, it was important that the Coal Board should lose no time in announcingtheir intention to increase coal prices. Ministers were concerned to avoid any increase in the price of the lower grades of householdcoal, and it was only by the prospect of early revenue from otherprice increases that the Coal Board had been persuaded to modify their original proposals so as to avoid increasing the price of thosegrades of household coal. Delay in introducing the new prices nowproposed would involve the Board in a loss of revenue amountingto  2^ millions a week. Therefore, the longer the decision was delayed, the greater the increases would have to be. For these reasons he would prefer that the Board&apos;s announcement should bemade that evening or, failing that, on the following day.The general opinion in the Cabinet was that, while the proposed increases in coal prices could not be avoided, they should be presented, not as part of a plan for redressing our balance ofpayments, but as a consequence of the general financial position and prospects of the coal industry. The announcement of increased coal prices should not therefore be made at a time when it might be related&quot;to the Chancellor^ statement on the economic situation. It might,however, be made in the course of the following week.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the action taken to increase the Bank rate and tore-impose control over hire-purchase facilities.(2) Agreed that, in announcing these measures in the House ofCommons that afternoon, the Chancellor of theExchequer should make no reference to prospectiveincreases in coal prices.(3) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to ensure that theNational Coal Board would not issue in the course ofthe current week any statement foreshadowing increases in coal prices.(4) Agreed to resume, at a meeting in the following week,their discussion of the Coal Board&apos;s proposals for increases in coal prices.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.It had been intended that the Second Reading of the PublicWorks Loans Bill should be taken on 28th February. If theOpposition asked for facilities to debate the statement by theChancellor of the Exchequer on the economic situation (see Minute 1above), it might be possible to arrange for this debate to be held on28th February and for the Public Works Loans Bill to obtain its second Reading thereafter without further discussion.The debate on the Defence White Paper would be held, on aGovernment motion, on 1st and 2nd March.Valuation for rating.(previous reference:CC. (55) 15thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Minister of Housing and Local Government,the Minister of Defence and the Attorney-General (C. (55) 52, 53, 56and 57) on the question whether the Government should proceed inthe present session with the Rating and Valuation Bill.The Minister of Housing said that, if there were neither legis-lation in the present session nor a further Order to postpone the newvaluation, the new lists of assessments would be published in Octoberor November whereas the countervailing reductions in poundagewould not become known until new rate demands were issued in the
r&quot;&quot;iI     1     JParliament. 4.   The Lord President said that he would have preferred thatExpenses of financial assistance for Peers attending on their Parliamentary dutiesPeers. in the House of Lords should have taken the form of a fiat-rate(Previous        attendance allowance of, say,  3 a day for each day&apos;s attendance.Reference:      He now understood, however, that the Inland Revenue would beC.C. (55) llth   unable to exempt such an allowance from taxation and that, to secureConclusions,     such exemption, the allowance must be one for expenses actuallyMinute 2.) &apos;     incurred, up to a given maximum for each sitting day, for whichPeers would be required to vouch.   He now sought authority toinform, in the strictest confidence, a small number of representativePeers, including the Leader of the Labour Opposition in the Houseof Lords, that he hoped to be able to obtain the Governmentsapproval for a system of expenses allowances on these lines, and toobtain their views upon it.   He recognised that this was not apropitious time to contemplate announcing the adoption of such ascheme and that, in the debate on Lord SamueFs Motion on 9th March, he could not go beyond saying that the government recognised the need for some action in this matter.The Cabinet-Authorised the Lord President to take informal steps to sound opinion in the House of Lords about a system of expenses allowances on the lines contemplated.Ministry of 5.   The Cabinet considered what name should be given to the agriculture new Department to be created by the amalgamation of the ministry and Fisheries Gf Agriculture and Fisheries and the Ministry of Food.   It wasand Ministry of agreed that the name of the new Department must include the wordsFood. &quot; Agriculture,&quot; &quot; Fisheries &quot; and &quot; Food &quot; and that, as the Ministryfollowing April. This situation, which was bound to give rise towidespread apprehension and the lodging of appeals on a large scale,could be avoided by passing the Rating and Valuation Bill whichwould provide, among other things, for simultaneous publication ofassessments and poundages in April, 1956. Even so, there would be some risk that the prospective increases in assessments would begin to become known in January or February when the assessment listswould have to be distributed to local authorities. On the other hand,there were strong arguments against further postponement of the newvaluation by Order, although the fact that legislation had been introduced would not preclude the Government from resorting to this expedient if developments should make this desirable at a later stage.He therefore recommended that the Rating and Valuation Bill shouldbe introduced, and carried through all its stages if possible.The Prime Minister said that in his view it would be preferable to defer this legislation and make a further Order postponing thenew valuation.Discussion showed that the balance of opinion in the Cabinet wasin favour of proceeding with the Bill in the present session. The lord privy Seal said that it should be introduced at the earliest possible date if it was to have a reasonable prospect of passing into law beforethe summer recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Government should proceed with the Ratingand Valuation Bill in the present session.(2) Invited the Minister of Housing to submit the draft Bill tothe Legislation Committee with a view to its introductionat the earliest possible date.
of Food was a later creation, the word &quot; Food &quot; should properly comelast in the title.The Cabinet Agreed that the new Department to be created by the amalgamation of the Ministry of Agriculture and fisheries and the Ministry of Food should be known as the Ministryof Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.government offices.New ColonialOffice Building.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 14thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Works (C. (55) 51) on the possibilities of erecting a newColonial Office building in Richmond Terrace and leaving the oldWestminster Hospital site vacant as a first instalment towards thecreation of a greater Parliament Square.The Cabinet recognised that, before they could take final decisions on the questions raised in this memorandum, it would bedesirable that a smaller group of Ministers should study more closely the practicability of accommodating the Colonial Office in thebuilding to be erected in Richmond Terrace and the legal and political implications of any plan for creating a greater Parliament Square.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee composed of Lord Privy Seal (Chairman),Colonial Secretary,Minister of Works,Attorney-General,to report to the Cabinet, in the light of the memorandum bythe Minister of Works (C. (55) 51), on the practicability of accommodating the Colonial Office in the proposed new building in Richmond Terrace and on the implications of thescheme for a greater Parliament Square.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,24th February, 1955.
