CoBomiafiEmpire.IndianCommunities.The Cabinet 1Took note of C. (55) 10 and agreed to resumeconsideration of this problem later in the year.47692-3 b 2their1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the colonial secretary on the problem presented by the growth of Indiancommunities in British Colonial territories.The Colonial Secretary said that, although he sought no immediate decisions on this problem, he had thought it right to bring it to the notice of the Cabinet since it was one which Ministers shouldhave constantly in their minds. There were substantial Indiancommunities in many of the Colonies, both in Africa and elsewhere,and their rate of natural increase was alarming. In some Coloniesthis was already giving rise to racial tension.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The attitude of the Indian Government towards thesecommunities should be closely watched. It was at present theirprofessed policy that Indians settled overseas should regard them-selves as members of the community in which they lived. It was,however, stated in paragraph 10 of C. (55) 10 that, while professingthis policy, the Indian Government lost no opportunity to foster links between India and these overseas communities.(b) Close attention should be given to the activities of IndianCommissioners in Colonial territories. The Indian Government had recognised that these representatives should not intervene in the domestic politics of the countries where they were stationed; and itwas open to us to press, as we had done successfully in the past, forthe recall of any Indian Commissioner whose activities transgressedthis principle.The title &quot; Commissioner &quot; gave these representatives a higherlocal status than that of the Trade Commissioners of other Common-wealth countries. It was for consideration whether those countries should not be asked to change the title of their representatives, so asto deprive the Indian Commissioners of the superior status whichthey now enjoyed.(c) Colonial Governments could take steps to restrict furtherimmigration of Indians. The Indian Government had not disputedthe right of other Commonwealth countries to restrict Indianimmigration into their territories.id) In paragraph 16 (e) of C. (55) 10 it was proposed that publicaction should be taken in the United Nations and elsewhere to counter tendentious speeches and actions by Indian representatives.It was suggested that on most occasions it would be preferable, andmore effective, to proceed by way of private representations to theIndian Government.The Prime Minister said that, while he recognised the gravity ofthis problem, he did not think the time was opportune for any drastic action in respect of it which might given offence to the indian government. India was in a position to exercise a moderatinginfluence in Asia; and it was specially important at the present time that she should maintain the closest possible association with us inthe handling of the major international problems of the day. It neednot be assumed that in all Colonies Indian communities would provean embarrassment to us: in some they might even be a balancingfactor. Thus, although the problem should be carefully watched,precipitate action should be avoided.The Lord President doubted whether action could be longdelayed. He was specially impressed by the considerationssummarised in paragraph 10 of C. (55) 10. He believed that in thismatter the policy of the Indian Government was likely to be influenced by their desire to champion coloured peoples and toencourage opposition to Colonial rule.
legislative programme.Sugar Bill.(previous references:C.C. (54) 36thConclusions,Minute 6 andC.C. (54) 76thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Lord Privy Seal(C. (55) 45) and the Minister of Food (C. (55) 46) inviting them todecide whether the Sugar Bill should be introduced in the present session of Parliament.The Cabinet recognised that, on the merits, there was a strong case for proceeding with this Bill. It had been promised in the queen&apos;s Speech and it was necessary for the purpose of ending state trading in sugar and re-opening the London terminal market in sugar.The commercial interests concerned would be disappointed if theBill did not go forward. Although it would be a hybrid measure,petitions for its rejection from private interests were not expected.On the other hand, there were strong Parliamentary reasons for not introducing the Bill at this stage of the session. If it were onceintroduced, the Government could not afford to let it drop. TheGovernment still aimed at completing the legislative business of the session before Parliament adjourned for the summer recess, and it seemed unlikely that so substantial and complex a measure as this could be passed in the time available without the use of a compulsorytime-table. It was undesirable that the Government should have recourse to this in what might prove to be the last session of thepresent Parliament, particularly in respect of a Bill which would notbe welcome to many of their own supporters. The better course might therefore be to complete the drafting of the Bill and hold itready for introduction at the opening of a future session.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Sugar Bill should not be introduced in thepresent session of Parliament.Valuation for rating.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 14thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had a preliminary discussion of the questionwhether the Government should proceed in the present session withthe Rating and Valuation Bill.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss thisquestion further with the Foreign Secretary, Lord privy seal, Minister of Defence and Minister of Housing, and tosubmit a memorandum on it for consideration by theCabinet at their meeting on 22nd February.Colonial 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the immigrants. Commonwealth Secretary and the Colonial Secretary (C. (55) 34)(Previous covering a draft White Paper summarising the restrictions applicableReference: to the admission, to other Commonwealth countries, of BritishC.C. (55) 8th    subjects not originating from those countries.Conclusions, This draft had been prepared in pursuance of the CabinetsMinute 9.) decision of 13th February. The Cabinet were informed that, before a statement of this kind could be presented to Parliament, theGovernments of the independent Commonwealth countries andsome Colonial Governments would need to be given an opportunityto consider whether it correctly summarised the existing law and practice in their countries.In discussion reference was made to paragraphs in the draft which indicated that, in some Commonwealth countries, steps were taken to exclude British subjects who were not of European originby administrative methods which lacked the support of any statutory authority. The other Commonwealth Governments concerned mightnot welcome disclosure of the fact that they took administrative measures to discriminate against British subjects who were not ofEuropean origin.   On the other hand, the purpose of the White
5 CC. 15 (55)Paper could not be fully achieved if it concealed the fact that thisdiscrimination was already practised in many of the other countries of the Commonwealth.The Cabinet Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and the colonial secretary to verify, by reference to the other Common-wealth Governments concerned, whether the draft white paper annexed to C. (55) 34 was an accurate summary ofthe restrictions at present applicable to the admission, toother Commonwealth countries, of British subjects notoriginating from those countries.Roalamd 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by them TffanaspdMnt Minister of Transport (C. (55) 44) seeking guidance on the attitudeSpecial Travel   which the Government should adopt towards the Public ServiceFacilities.        Vehicles (Contract Carriages and Special Travel Facilities) Bill, aPrivate Member&apos;s Bill introduced by Captain Short, M.P., which wasto come forward for Second Reading on the following day.The Cabinet were informed that, by the decision of the Court ofAppeal in the recent case of Prescott v. Birmingham Corporation, ithad been made clear that under the existing law local authorities(i) were no longer entitled, unless specifically authorised to do so by private Act, to grant free travel on their municipal transport under-takings to old age pensioners, children or cripples; and (ii) were not entitled to grant concessionary fares for philanthropic purposes.Captain Shorfs Bill was designed to authorise all local authoritiesoperating municipal transport undertakings to grant free travel orconcessionary fares alike to old age pensioners, children or cripples,and to subsidise such facilities from the rates.The Cabinet recognised that this proposal was open to serious objections of principle. On the other hand, the Government couldnot afford to appear to be obstructing the retention by old age pensioners in fourteen municipalities (including Birmingham and liverpool) of privileges which they had enjoyed for some time past.Several of the local authorities affected were already taking steps topromote private legislation to authorise them to continue theirexisting practice.In discussion it was explained that the Government could notensure that the Bill would be talked out. In these circumstances itwas suggested that the Governments right course would be to allow the Bill to receive a Second Reading, subject to its being made clearthat it was their intention, on the Committee stage, to proposeamendments having the effect that this part of the Bill would do no more than legalise existing facilities for free travel and concessionaryfares. It would then be necessary for any local authority wishing tointroduce these facilities for the first time to seek authority to do soby means of private legislation, and all other interested parties wouldthen have the opportunity to state their objections.The Cabinet approved this suggestion.The following further points were made in discussion:  (a) There were objections to the suggestion in paragraph 9 ofC. (55) 44 that the Bill might be amended to make it obligatory upon local authorities who granted free or concessionary travel facilities on their municipal transport undertakings to &quot; buy &quot; similar facilitiesfor the same categories of persons on competing private servicesoperating within their areas. Such a provision might lead to pressure for the provision of free travel or concessionary fares by localauthorities which did not operate municipal transport undertakings.
(b) It would be necessary to consider, before the committee stage of the Bill, whether the Government should seek to eliminateor amend sub-section (5) of Clause 3, which authorised the financing of free travel and concessionary fares out of the general rate fund.(c) If the Bill were to receive a Second Reading, it would benecessary for the Government in the Committee stage to secure the elimination of Clauses 1 and 2 of the Bill, which would authorisemunicipal undertakings and the British Transport Commission to operate &quot;contract carriages.&quot;The Cabinet^Agreed that no special steps should be taken to prevent thePublic Services Vehicles (Contract Carriages and SpecialTravel Facilities) Bill from obtaining a Second Reading,subject to its being made clear by the Government spokes-man in the Second Reading debate that, if the Bill shouldreceive a Second Reading, the Government would in theCommittee stage propose amendments designed to ensurethat, so far as concerned free travel facilities andconcessionary fares for old age pensioners, children orcripples, the Bill would do no more than legalise the practicealready in operation in certain areas.6. The Foreign Secretary said that it was generally recognisedthat it was unsatisfactory for the United Nations Assembly to meet in the United States in an election year. The Secretary-General wastherefore considering what arrangements could be made for theAssembly to meet in 1956 elsewhere than in New York, and he wouldbe disposed to suggest that this meeting should be held in London ifsuitable accommodation could be provided. It would not in fact be easy to find a suitable meeting-place in London; and, if the Assemblywere to meet here, temporary accommodation might have to be constructed specially for the purpose. Substantial expenditure might therefore be involved, although we might expect that much of thiswould be offset, in terms of our balance of payments, by the moneyspent here by those attending the Assembly. The question thereforeturned, to his mind, largely on considerations of prestige. Would itbe to our advantage, nationally, to put ourselves to some trouble and inconvenience for the sake of enabling the General Assembly to meet in London in 1956? On this he would welcome the views of hiscolleagues.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be advantageous if the General Assembly of the United Nations were held in 1956 in London.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, fo arrange for a group ofMinisters to consider what practical steps would need to betaken, in providing the necessary meeting-place and other accommodation, to enable the General Assembly of theUnited Nations to be held in London in 1956.7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-General (C. (55) 50) about the hours during which television broadcasting should be allowed on Sundays.The Postmaster-General said that it had been proposed that theindependent television companies should be allowed to broadcast on sundays from 2 p.m. to 11 p.m. with a breaik between 6 p.m. and7 p.m. The B.B.C. were also anxious that the hour at which theirSunday television programmes began should be advanced from 4 p.m.to 3 p.m.   Objections would certainly be raised to the introduction
of television broadcasting between the hours of 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.,which was the normal Sunday school period. On the other hand,the independent television companies were most anxious to beallowed to broadcast during what would be one of the most popularperiods for viewing, and they were ready to give an undertaking toprovide during this period programmes which would not beattractive to children. In these circumstances the Postmaster-Generalrecommended that permission should be given for the broadcastingof television programmes between 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sundays,subject to the condition that such programmes were specially designed for adult viewers.In discussion there was general support for the Postmaster-General&apos;s recommendation. It was, however, recognised that thequestion might have to be reconsidered if serious opposition was raised to the proposed introduction of television broadcasting on sunday afternoons.The Cabinet Authorised the Postmaster-General to give permission forthe introduction of television broadcasting for adult viewersbetween 3 p.m. and 4 p.m. on Sundays.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,17th February, 1955.
