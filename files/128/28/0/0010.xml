3CC. 10 (55)Parliament.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Capital 2.   The Cabinet considered what attitude the GovernmentPunishment. should adopt towards the amendment, tabled by Mr. Silverman, M.P.,Report of the anfj other Members from both sides of the House, to the Govern-Royal menfs motion inviting the House to take note of the Report of theCommission. Royal Commission on Capital Punishment. The amendment called(Previous on the Government to introduce forthwith legislation to substituteReferences: iife imprisonment for the death penalty for an experimental period ofCC. (54) 56th   fiVe years.Conclusions, The Cabinet were informed that the Speaker was likely to callMinute 3, and   this amendment, although he might first allow some time for debateCC (55) 7th    on the Royal Commission&apos;s recommendations.   The amendmentConclusions,     would probably be supported, not only by a large body of minute 1.)       Opposition  Members, but also  by a number of government supporters.    In  these  circumstances  it seemed  likely  that,  if government supporters were allowed a free vote, the amendment would be carried.   Nor was it certain that it -could be defeated if government supporters were required, by the Whip, to vote against it. The use of the Government Whip on such an issue would not be welcomed   by   Government   supporters   generally   and   wouldparticularly embarrass those, including some Ministers, who on previous occasions had voted in favour of an experimental suspension of the death penalty.The Lord Chancellor said that he was fully convinced that the death penalty acted as a powerful deterrent and that its removalwould prejudice the maintenance of the Queen&apos;s peace and tend to undermine the morale of the police.The Home Secretary said that, whatever views might be heldabout the justification for retaining the death penalty, there was a clear case for opposing its suspension for a limited period and for holding that the only practicable alternatives were to retain it orabolish it altogether.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that, on an issue ofthis importance, the Government had a duty to give a clear lead toParliament, and that the line suggested by the Home Secretaryoffered the best prospect of enabling the Government to rally their supporters against the amendment. All Government supportersshould be urged to attend the debate, in which the Home secretary would state forcibly the case against suspending the death penalty,and informal steps should be taken to ensure that as manyGovernment supporters as possible voted against the amendment.No formal Government whip should, however, be issued.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary, the Lord Privy Seal and theChief Whip to arrange for the forthcoming debate in theHouse of Commons on the Report of the Royal Corn-mission on Capital Punishment to be handled on the lines agreed in the Cabinefs discussion.

Formosa.(previous references:C.C. (55) 9thConclusions.Minute I.)4. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinefs meetingon 4th February, the situation in the Far East had been further discussed by Commonwealth Prime Ministers. In these discussionsgreat anxiety had been expressed about the intentions of the UnitedStates Administration. There had been general agreement that theAdministration would not be able to command the support of world opinion if they supported the position of the Chinese Nationalists inQuemoy or the Matsu Islands to the point of engaging in openhostilities with the Chinese Communists. All commonwealth governments took the view that the position of Formosa and thePescadores should be differentiated from that of the coastal islands,and several of them were likely to put before the United StatesGovernment, in separate and private representations, the advantages of adopting a policy founded on that differentiation. Representa-tions in this sense were already being made to them on behalf of theUnited Kingdom and Canadian Governments.Meanwhile, the Soviet Government had proposed, to us and tothe Indians, that a special conference should be summoned toconsider this situation. In the form in which they had originally put it forward, their proposal was not likely to be acceptable; but theUnited Kingdom and Indian Governments were keeping theseovertures open by suggesting alterations in the form of the originalSoviet proposal.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Soviet Uaion. 5.   The Cabinet took note of the appointment of MarshalBulganin to succeed M. Malenkov as Chairman of the Council ofMinisters of the Soviet Union.The Foreign Secretary said that it was interesting to recall that,at the Geneva Conference held in 1954, he had been struck byM. Molotov&apos;s cool reception of any references made to M. Malenkovduring the course of the discussions.
PoliticalBroadcasting.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 6thConclusions,Minute 8.)6. The Lord Privy Seal said that the leaders of the labour opposition, whom he had now consulted, shared the Government^objections to the proposal by the National Broadcasting council for Wales to institute Party political broadcasts on Welsh affairs.He therefore suggested that he, in association with the opposition leaders, should now communicate this decision to the Welsh Council.It was unlikely that the Council would willingly accept the decision.The Postmaster General said that, in a matter of this kind, theB.B.C. had no power, even if they should be. willing, to override theCouncil, and in the last resort it would fall to,him to issue a directionon the matter under Section 15(4) of the Corporation^ Licence.There were grounds for believing that, if such a direction were issued, all the members of the Welsh Council would resign.,?The Cabinet recognised that the resignation of the WelshCouncil in such circumstances would give an unfortunate stimulus to the Welsh Nationalist movement. They agreed, however, that this risk must be accepted in view of the importance of the principlethat political broadcasting should be handled on a national, ratherthan a regional, basis. While every effort should be made to avoid the need for a formal direction to the B.B.C. on this matter, theGovernment should not shrink from this course if it became clear thatthe Welsh Council could not be prevented by other means fromproceeding with their proposal.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Postmaster General toarrange for the National Broadcasting Council for wales to be prevented, if HCCCSS ary by the issue of a formaldirection to the B.B.C., from proceeding with their proposalto institute political broadcasting on a regional basis in wales.industrial disputes.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4.)BritishEuropeanAirways.7. The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, informed the Cabinet of recent developments in certain current industrial disputes.The dispute between British European Airways (B.E.A.) and members of the Amalgamated Engineering Union (A.E.C.) over thelatter&apos;s demand for the reinstatement of a shop steward, Mr. Peters,dismissed from London Airport might well cause a strike of engineering and maintenance staffs at London&apos; Airport in thefollowing week. The trade union side of the National Joint.council for Civil Air Transport had put before the Chairman of B.E.A. a request for the reinstatement of Mr. Peters, and Lord Douglas had asked whether it was possible for the Ministry of Labour to help him in any way in the further handling of this matter. Lord Douglas hadbeen informed that the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour,would be willing to appoint a body of three independent persons to review the matter and make recommendations if Lord Douglasshould decide that such a course would be desirable.The Cabinet were informed that the change was hot thought to imply that the Red Army had increased their influence in politicalcircles in Moscow. It seemed more likely to be due to an increasein the influence of M. Khrushchev, the Secretary of the central committee of the Communist Party.
In discussion support was expressed for the view that theGovernment would not be justified in bringing any pressure to bear upon the Chairman of B.E.A. to make concessions in the case ofMr. Peters for the purpose of avoiding a strike of engineering andmaintenance staffs at London Airport.London In the wage dispute between the London Transport ExecutiveTransport. and the Railway Unions, the National Union ^of Railwaymen had now agreed that the outstanding issues should be referred to theLondon Transport Railway Wages Board for arbitration.Docks. No success had yet attended the efforts which had been made(Previous over a long period to promote a settlement of the dispute on the reference: working of overtime, which had given rise to the dock strike before. C.C. (54) 72nd Christmas,  but further informal  discussions  were  now  beingConclusions, undertaken with this object.Minute 1.)The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Labour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th February, 1955.
