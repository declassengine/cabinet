Formosa.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to two messages fromthe Foreign Secretary (Delhi telegrams Nos. 241 and 242) suggesting that further representations should be made to the PekingGovernment urging the importance of finding a peaceful solutionof the differences which had arisen over Formosa and the coastalislands.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers proposal that theterms of the draft communication to the Peking Government set outin Delhi telegram No. 242 should be discussed by the Cabinetimmediately after the Foreign Secretary&apos;s return to London. Ameeting for this purpose would be held on 7th March.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition hadselected as a subject for debate in the House of Commons on 9th March, which was a Supply Day, the current difficulties of thecotton industry. In discussion it was pointed out that, by debatingthis question at the present time, the House of Commons might dothe cotton industry more harm than good. For, in explaining why they had not taken action to help the industry, the Governmentwould be obliged to disclose the difficulties in the way of each particular course of action which might be taken, and this disclosurewould have the result of enhancing those difficulties. Moreover,the Prime Minister was proposing to receive a deputation from thecotton industry, and it would be preferable that any final statement on behalf of the Government should be reserved until after thatdeputation had been received.It was the view of the Cabinet that these considerations werenot likely to deter the Opposition, who had the right to choose thesubject for discussion on a Supply Day, from pressing their request for an early debate on this subject. The Government&apos;s best coursewould be to allow the debate to go forward, as proposed, and todo their best to avoid disclosures which might be contrary to thebest interests of the industry.3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Defence and the Secretary of State for War (C. (55) 62)Guided Missiles, about the purchase from the United States of a ground-to-groundguided missile for the Army.&quot; 1 The Minister of Defence said that it was generally agreed thatthe Army needed a ground-to-ground guided missile to carry a tactical atomic warhead to ranges up to 75 miles. It was acceptedpolicy that for a purpose of this kind we should adopt a type of american weapon, both to promote closer collaboration with the americans on defence research and development and to avoidoverloading our own programme of defence research. It was also considered that, in this case, the right course was to acquire the equipment itself from the United States. Authority was thereforesought to arrange forthwith for the United States Army to place, aspart Of a bulk order to meet its own needs, orders for 8 sets of ground equipment and 113 missiles at a cost of  9^ millions over three years.To secure acceptance of this order we should have to undertake tomake payment in dollars if it should be found ineligible for freesupply or if the necessary United States funds could not be madeavailable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while it might be.right to depend on United States research and development, it didnot follow that the end-product should be obtained from UnitedStates production at a direct cost in dollars rather than manufacturedHDefemcePffOgirfflBBBillSo
in this country under licence. He had thought it right that theCabinet should be made aware of the dollar cost of this weapon,whose purchase would impose an appreciable burden /upon our balance of payments.In further discussion the Cabinet were informed that purchase ofthis weapon was the only method of providing our troops withatomic artillery support before 1965. It would be hard to justifyhaving withheld this weapon from our forces in Germany when it became available to the American forces there and might even besupplied by them to future German units. The Government had a duty to ensure that the British forces which they had committed tothe continent of Europe were provided with up-to-date equipment.Every effort should be made to obtain as much of this equipment aspossible under the Mutual Defence Assistance Programme but wemust be prepared in the last resort to meet the whole cost in dollars.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the purchase from the United Statesof 8 sets of CORPORAL ground equipment and113 missiles.(2) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would discuss further with the Minister of Defence the detailedfinancial implications of this proposed purchase.Government 4.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the ChancellorRecords. of the Exchequer (C. (55) 16) and the Secretary of the Cabinet(C. (54) 265) about the report of the Committee on DepartmentalRecords (Cmd. 9163).This Committee had recommended that departmental recordsshould be reviewed 5 years after they had passed out of active use and again after 25 years; and that, on the occasion of each suchreview, unwanted papers should be destroyed; that departmentalrecords should normally be transferred to the Public Record Officeafter 25 years; and that, as a general rule, all records, includingCabinet records, should be open to public inspection after 50 years.The Committee had further recommended that responsibility for thePublic Record Office should be transferred from the Master of the rolls to a Minister of the Crown, and the Prime Minister had decidedthat the Lord Chancellor should undertake this duty.In discussion doubts were expressed about the expediency of opening Cabinet records to public inspection after 50 years. It wassuggested that account should be taken, not only of the reluctance ofMinisters and former Ministers to contemplate official disclosureduring their lifetime of Cabinet proceedings in which they had taken part, but also of the possible effects of such disclosure on current problems which might still be influenced by memories of events50 years ago. What, for example, would be the effect on our presentrelations with South Africa of publishing now records of Cabinetproceedings at the time of the South African war, if such recordswere, in fact, in existence? When all such considerations were takeninto account, it might be found that a longer interval than 50 years would be more suitable.On the other hand, it was pointed out that, if a longer delay wereprescribed for Cabinet than for departmental records, there would bea risk of partial disclosure of Cabinet proceedings through the earliertransfer to the Public Record Office of departmental records which included drafts of Cabinet papers, extracts from Cabinet minutes orcorrespondence between Ministers on Cabinet matters. It was theintention that, if the recommendations in Cmd. 9163 were adopted,discretion should be retained to exempt limited categories of
5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (C. (55) 49) on a proposal that police cadets should not becalled up for National Service so long as they were serving in a police force.The Minister of Defence said that he and the Service Ministerssaw no objection to this proposal so long as the numbers involved were limited to about 2,000 a year. The Minister of Labour had,however, been unwilling to accept this breach in the principle ofuniversality of National Service, and the matter was thereforereferred to the Cabinet for decision.The Home Secretary said that the arrangement proposed would help to improve recruiting for police forces, which were seriouslyunder strength, especially in London and the larger towns. It was important that the effectiveness of the police should be increased, notonly for peace-time purposes, but also because of the onerous duties which would fall on them in a future war.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that therewas already strong pressure for similar concessions in favour of farmworkers, apprentices in firms engaged on defence contracts, scientists and teachers. It would be more difficult to resist those demands ifthis proposal in respect of police cadets were accepted.In discussion there was general support for the view that service with the police was much more comparable with service in the armed Forces than employment in any of the industrial and professional occupations mentioned by the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour. The public would appreciate that service witha disciplined and uniformed force could in this matter be differ-entiated from industrial employment. It should not, therefore, bedifficult to resist the argument that, because this arrangement hadbeen made in respect of police cadets, it should be extended to farmworkers, engineering apprentices or scientists.The Cabinet Agreed that, subject to an upper limit of 2,000 a year,satisfactory police cadets should not be called up for national Service so long as they continued to serve with a regular police force.NationalService.(previous reference:CC. (53) 66thConclusions.)Police Cadets.documents, for example, documents of special secrecy, from anygeneral rule; and the exercise of such a discretion should provide a means of avoiding embarrassing consequences of the kind to which attention had been drawn. There was the further consideration that,even when they were made open to inspection, Cabinet records would still be protected by copyright from reproduction in extenso. It Wassuggested that the degree of copyright protection which they wouldenjoy should be further investigated.In reply to a question it was explained that, if the LordChancellor were made responsible for it, the Public Record office would continue to enjoy, like the Office of the Public Trustee and theLand Registry, a full measure of administrative autonomy.The Prime Minister said that the papers before the Cabinetraised issues of considerable interest and importance, to which further thought and study might well be given in the light of the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion.The Cabinet Agreed to resume consideration of this question at a later meeting.
China.Treatment ofBritish prisoners in Korean War.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. T he Attorney-General informed the Cabinet of certain furtherParliamentary consequences of the publication of the report on thetreatment of British prisoners of war captured in Korea.First, a number of Questions had been addressed to him asking whether the Government would now arrange for proceedings to betaken against persons guilty of the activities described in Chapter vi of the report. He understood that, while the Labour Governmentwas in office, the possibility of instituting proceedings againstMrs. Monica Felton had been considered but rejected. He proposedto say, in reply to these Questions, that according to the information in his possession neither Mr. Alan Winnington nor Mr. MichaelShapiro was now resident within the jurisdiction and no criminal proceedings could be taken against either of them at present; but that,if either returned to this country, he would carefully consider thequestion whether such proceedings should be instituted. He would go on to say that the facts disclosed in the report did not inhis opinion suffice to justify proceedings against Mr. Jack Gaster orMrs. Monica Felton.Secondly ^ certain Government supporters were intending to seekleave to introduce under the ten-minute rule a Bill of Attainderagainst the persons concerned. The consequences of such action were likely to be unfortunate. It was, however, possible that theauthors of this plan would be deterred from pursuing it if they were told that it was not regarded with favour by the Government. Therewas general agreement in the Cabinet that it was undesirable that thepower of attainder should be revived.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Attorney-General to reply on the lines proposed to Questions about the Governments intentionstowards persons guilty of the activities described in chapter VI of this report.(2) Invited the Attorney-General to indicate informally to theGovernment supporters concerned that the government did not favour the promotion of a Bill of Attainder underthe ten-minute rule.Honse of Lords.Reform.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 19thConclusions,Minute 10.)7. The Lord President said that he had now discussed with theCabinet Committee on House of Lords Reform the terms of thestatement which he was proposing to make in the forthcoming debate on 9th March. There were two particular points on which he sought the guidance of the Cabinet.First, he sought authority to take the line that the composition of the House of Lords should be reformed before any alteration wasmade in its powers. He wished to say that, while the Governmentwould not wish to commit themselves to the view that no House ofLords should have more powers than those now enjoyed by theUpper Chamber, they thought it more immediately important to reform the composition of the House than to amend its powers andthat any measure which they had at present under contemplationwould be limited to the question of composition.Secondly, he was anxious to end the legal uncertainty about thepower of the House of Lords to limit the attendance of Peers by theuse of its own Standing Orders. When a proposal of this kind hadbeen put forward by Lord Exeter, doubts had been raised about theconstitutional propriety of a plan by which the House of Lords would carry out its own reform by procedural means. Whatever the merits of this plan, it seemed desirable that these legal and constitutional issues should be resolved.  He therefore sought authority to propose

(55) 9thConclusions,Minute 5.)ImteirmaiioBalLabourOrganisation.(previous reference:GC. (53) 45th(Conclusions,Minute 11.)that a Select Committee of the House of Lords should be appointed toconsider those issues.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the general lines of the statement which the lord president was proposing to make, in the forthcoming debate on 9th March, on the powers of the House ofLords, and agreed that he should then refer to thepossibility of an enquiry into the constitutional proprietyof reforming its composition by procedural means.The Lord President informed the Cabinet of the terms in whichhe proposed to refer, in this debate, to the possibility of introducing a system of expenses allowances for Peers. On this he proposed tosay that the Government recognised that some plan of this kind would be necessary if the second Chamber were to continue to function effectively under modern conditions.The Cabinet (2) Took note with approval of the statement which the lord president proposed to make, in the forthcoming debate,on the possibility of introducing a scheme of expensesallowances for Peers.8. The Cabinet were informed of the stage reached in theannual review of farm prices. The farmers&apos; representatives were proposing prices which would increase the income of farmers byabout  33 millions: the prices proposed by the AgricultureDepartments would yield an increase of about  9 millions. It mightnot be possible to secure an agreed settlement without increasingsome prices beyond the level which could be justified as economicallysound. In that event the Government might have to face thenecessity for imposing a settlement on the farmers.The Cabinet Took note of these statements and invited the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer to arrange for the Economic PolicyCommittee to consider the details of the proposed settlement.9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theParliamentary Secretary, Minister of Labour (C. (55) 48) outlining thesubstance of the statement to be made to Parliament defining theGovernments attitude towards certain recommendations andconventions adopted by International Labour Conferences in 1948and 1953.The Cabinet Approved the proposals outlined in C. (55) 48, and authorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliamentary White Paper on the lines indicated in the Annex to that memorandum.
