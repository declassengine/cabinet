Innatos&amp;riaBDisputes..Railways.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 1stConclusions.)The Minister of Labour said that, since the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 4th January, he had held separate discussions with representatives ofthe National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) and of the british transport Commission and had strongly urged each of the parties tothe dispute to resume negotiations on the basis of the interim reportof the Court of Inquiry. The N.U.R. had so far been reluctant towithdraw their strike notices without an assurance that, if negotiations were resumed, the substance of their claim would beadmitted. The Transport Commission were in fact prepared to make some concessions but they could not be expected to say, beforenegotiations began, precisely how far they were prepared to go. TheMinister informed the Cabinet of the arguments which he had put tothe N.U.R. representatives at his latest meeting with them that morning. His conversations would be resumed in the afternoon,when both parties to the dispute would come together under his chairmanship. At that meeting he hoped that both parties couldbe brought to agree that negotiations should be resumed.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Transport Commission should not resume negotiationsunder threat of a strike. The N.U.R. should be left in no doubt onthis point. It should be made clear to them that, if the strikenotices had not been withdrawn by the following day, the Govern-ment would be obliged to proceed with their preparations for maintaining essential services and for that purpose would arrange fora Proclamation of Emergency to be made under the emergency powers Act, 1920. Under the strike notices already issued the menwere due to cease work at midnight on Sunday, 9th January, and negotiations could not be reopened unless those notices were withdrawn.(b) On the other hand, the N.U.R. were unlikely to call off thestrike unless they had good reason to believe that they could nowsecure a substantial part of their claim by negotiation. It would therefore be necessary for the Transport Commission to satisfy theN.U.R. that, if negotiations were resumed, they would make asubstantial improvement on the offers which they had so far been willing to put forward. The Cabinet were informed that this hadalready been made clear to the Chairman of the transport commission, and that the Minister of Labour would do his utmost, when he met the two parties later in the day, to ensurethat no misunderstanding arose on this point.(c) If railway wages were to be increased, some satisfactoryassurance should be obtained that the men would co-operate in measures to secure a more efficient employment of the labour force on the railways. This important point seemed to have beenoverlooked in the interim report of the Court of Inquiry.The Minister of Labour said that the Court might be expectedto deal with this in their final report. And, if the strike notices were withdrawn, the final report was likely to be available in time for itto be taken into account before the wage negotiations were completed.(d) It, was very doubtful whether the Government should acceptthe argument, outlined in paragraph 10 of the interim report of theCourt of Inquiry, that employees of a national service were entitledto a fair and adequate wage, regardless of the financial position ofthe undertaking. This was a wholly new doctrine, which had never been approved by Parliament, and its consequences could be serious and far-reaching.The Minister of Labour said that, in his statements to theN.U.R., he had been careful to confine his approval of the report toan endorsement of the recommendations which the Court had made
for action at this stage of the present dispute. He had said nothing to imply that the Government approved all the arguments used inthe body of the report.It was agreed that, if the strike notices were withdrawn and negotiations were resumed, there would be no occasion for theGovernment to make any immediate pronouncement on this point.When, however, the time came for the Government to make some statement, it should be made clear that in the Governments view theTransport Commission had not been relieved of the financial obligations imposed on them by Section 3 (4) of the Transport Act,1947. The real issue was, not whether those obligations existed, buthow narrowly they should be interpreted.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour and ofthe points raised in the discussion.(2) Agreed that, unless the N.U.R. had meanwhile informed theMinister of Labour that they were willing to withdraw the strike notices and resume the wage negotiations, theywould meet again later in the afternoon to review theposition and the steps which would be required tomaintain essential services in a railway strike.Cabinet Office, S.W. I,6th January, 1955.\
