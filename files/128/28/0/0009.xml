Formosa. 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Chinese Communist(Previous        Government had now announced that they were not prepared to reference:      participate in discussions in the Security Council On the present.C. (55) 8th    situation off the mainland of China, unless China&apos;s seat in the council I- Conclusions^    were transferred to them and the discussions were based on the SovietMinute2.)       resolution referring to &quot;United States aggression.&quot;   It was plainlyimpossible to accept these conditions. The New Zealand represehta-tive on the Security Council was, nevertheless, in favour of tablinga resolution in the Council, and his attitude might be supported byopinion in the United States.The Foreign Secretary said that the position had been discussed with other Commonwealth Prime Ministers earlier that day. All ofthem, including the Prime Minister of New Zealand, had shared his view that to table a resolution in present circumstances mightaggravate a difficult situation still further, and that the wiser coursewould be to defer further action until the position could be fullyreviewed in the light of developments. He had instructed the UnitedKingdom representative on the Security Council in this sense.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statementendorsed the action which he had taken.and pakistan. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister of(Previous Pakistan had now put before the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeReference: Ministers a definite programme of constitutional change by which.C. (54) 70th Pakistan would become a republic in the course of 1955.  He hadrv..,;-;li.*.i;viit.        dssiireH the rithpr Cnmmnnwpalrh Primi^ lVTinictere that it was the minute 1.) unalterable will of the Pakistan people to adopt a republican formof Constitution, but that it was equally their desire that Pakistanshould remain a full member of the Commonwealth. He had made it clear that it was the policy of the Pakistan Government tomaintain the closest association with the other members of theCommonwealth and to align themselves firmly with the western powers.In the discussion at the Commonwealth Meeting the PrimeMinisters of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand had expressed their profound regret at Pakistani decision to renounceher allegiance to the Crown. In the course of this discussion thesuggestion had been made that the wishes of the Pakistan peoplemight have been met by an arrangement by which the Governor-General would in future be elected instead of being appointed by theCrown; but it seemed clear that their nationalist aspirations wouldnot be satisfied with anything less than the declaration of a republic.This being so, the other Commonwealth Prime Ministers had unanimously agreed to accept Pakistani proposal that she shouldcontinue to be a full member of the Commonwealth after becoming a republic.The Prime Minister said that, with very great regret, he had made the necessary submission to Her Majesty on behalf Of all theCommonwealth Prime Ministers. The decision would be announced- - that evening, in the form of a declaration approved by all therepresentatives of Commonwealth Governments attending theCommonwealth Meeting.In discussion there was general agreement with the PrimeMinister^ view that Pakistani decision to adopt a republican formof Constitution was greatly to be regretted.It was suggested that in recent years there had been too great a tendency to describe the advancement of dependent peoples interms of &quot; independence &quot; instead of &quot; self-government,&quot; and that
3 CC. 9 (55)these references to &quot; independence &quot; had tended to encourage theview that full sovereignty was incompatible with continued allegiance to the Crown. The Colonial Secretary undertook to consider thispoint.The Cabinet Took note that the representatives of all the commonwealth governments attending the Commonwealth Meeting had agreed that Pakistan should continue to be a full memberof the Commonwealth even though she adopted a republicanform of Constitution.Libya.(previous reference:CC. (53) 45thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet should be aware of the background to the criticism which was now being directed at the United Kingdom Government by certain political elements in France on the subject of Libya. Having failed themselves to persuade the Libyan Government to meet their requirements in theFezzan, the French Government had tried to induce us to use our influence with the Libyan Government to achieve their aims. Hehad not been willing to jeopardise on this account our close andcordial relations with the Libyan Government; but he had nowsucceeded in securing Libyan agreement to the holding of staff talks between ourselves and the French about the arrangements whichwould be brought into operation in the Fezzan in the event of war.Under the arrangements now contemplated the role of the french in Libya in war would be entirely subordinate to our own.The Cabinet-Took  note with approval  of the  Foreign  Secretary&apos;sstatement.Atomic Energy.WeaponsProgramme.(previous reference:CC. (55) 8thConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Prime Minister said that other Commonwealth PrimeMinisters had now been informed of the Government^ decision toproceed with the development and production of thermo-nuclear weapons. The Government would be embarrassed if there were any premature disclosure of this decision, and he had thought it right that the Cabinet should have an opportunity of considering whether an official announcement should be made in advance of the publica-tion of the Defence White Paper. He himself was satisfied that publicreception of this decision would be less favourable if it were announced in isolation; and he would much prefer that it shouldbe made public in the White Paper in the context of the Govern-menfs defence policy as a whole.The Cabinet were reminded that a White Paper was also to be presented on the civil uses of atomic energy. It had been assumedhitherto that this would be published a few days before the defence white Paper. There would be advantage in publishing the Govern-menfs programme for civil development of atomic energy beforeannouncing their decision to produce thermo-nuclear weapons. Thiswas an additional reason for announcing the latter decision in theDefence White Paper.The Cabinet Agreed that the Governments decision to proceed with thedevelopment and production of thermo-nuclear weaponsshould be announced in the Defence White Paper, whichwas due to be presented to Parliament on 17th FebOx u-cii y.
Farm Price 5.   The Cabinet were informed that the Economic policy review. Committee had considered the objectives which the agriculture ministers should have in mind in their forthcoming negotiations withthe farmers&apos; representatives on prices for farm products in the coming year. They had agreed that the Agriculture Ministers should aim at reaching an agreed settlement with the farmers&apos; representatives on prices which would have the effect of reducing the exchequer subsidy by something between  8 millions and  13 millions. Thisrelief should be secured mainly by reductions in the prices for pigs,eggs and wheat, offset by increases in the prices for beef and mutton.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the report by theCommittee on Civil Expenditure, which the Cabinet had considered on 20th July, it had been assumed that this review of farm pricesmight result in a saving to the Exchequer of  30 millions. In view,however, of the bad summer and the upward trend in production costs, he was now satisfied that it would be unrealistic to expect the farmers to accept any greater reduction in the level of government subsidy than that envisaged by the Economic Policy Committee.The Cabinet-Took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th February, 1955.\
