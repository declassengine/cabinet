European 1.   The Foreign Secretary said that, now that the FrenchDefence and     Parliament had ratified the. Paris Agreements, the Western PowersFour-Power     must lose no time in putting themselves in a position to invite theMeeting.        Soviet Government to confer v/ith them on the outstanding political(Previous        problems of Europe.   Before such a conference could be held the reference:      Western Powers must first reach agreement among themselves on theC.C. (55) 25th   future of Germany, and proposals for a preliminary meeting for that conclusions,    purpose were now being canvassed between the Governments of the minute 1.)       United Kingdom, the United States and France.   If, as was hoped,the Dutch Parliament had ratified the Paris Agreements by thebeginning of May, a special meeting of the North Atlantic council could then be held for the purpose of admitting the German federal republic to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation; and that meeting would afford an opportunity for the Foreign Ministers of the western powers to confer together, after preliminary preparation by officials,with a view to the possibility that a meeting with the SovietGovernment might subsequently be arranged.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign SeCretary&apos;s statementIraq. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, in pursuance of theDefence authority given by the Cabinet on 15th March, a new defence agree-Arrangements. ment between the United Kingdom and Iraq had now been initialled.(Previous This met all our important strategic requirements in this area. in reference: particular, it would enable us to maintain in Iraq stocks of theC.C.

Habbaniya and Shaiba, it secured the facilities needed by the RAP.for the use of those and other air bases in Iraq in peace or war. it also gave us the exclusive right to train the Iraq Air Force, and thiswould give us a valuable market for British aircraft and equipment.It was important that the new agreement should be formallyconcluded without delay. It was therefore proposed that the Houseof Commons should be invited on 4th April to pass a motionapproving its terms. The agreement could then be signed inBagdad and the United Kingdom Government could deposit on thefollowing day their instrument of accession to the Turco-Iraqi Pact.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the financial provisions of the new agreement were satisfactory. The opportunityhad also been taken to clear up old outstanding claims between thiscountry and Iraq.The Cabinet-Took note, with approval, of the proposal to accede to theTurco-Iraqi Pact and to conclude thereunder a new defence agreement with Iraq.Parliament. 3.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Parliament would be adjourned for the Easter recess on 7th April.Non-industrial employment..Safety and welfare.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 32ndConclusions,Minute 5.)47913-4. The Cabinet discussed what attitude the Government should adopt towards the Non-Industrial Employment Bill introduced byMr. H. Davies, M.P., and set down for Second Reading on 1st April.The Home Secretary explained that the Bill was based on therecommendations of the Gowers Committee (Cmd. 7664) on health,welfare and safety in non-industrial employment. Its provisions would affect large numbers of employers and work-people, and thesubject was inappropriate for a Private Member&apos;s Bill.   The Bill was-2 b 2
also open to other objections: it would, for example, comer excessivepowers on Ministers. The Opposition Would, however, exploit anyimplication that the Government were not in sympathy with thegeneral objects of the Bill. It was therefore undesirable that theGovernment should appear to be opposing it. In any event ministers had already gone a long way, in public statements made over the past three years, towards committing the Government in principle to introducing some legislation on this subject when time permitted.The Minister of Agriculture said that the high accident rate inagriculture, resulting from increased mechanisation, provided specialjustification for early legislation on safety in agriculture. The tradeunions were pressing strongly for this, and the Opposition were already turning the situation to their advantage in rural areas. TheHome Affairs Committee had recently authorised the preparation of draft legislation on this part of the subject, but they had wished toconsider the matter further in the light of the terms of the Bill andof the nature of the regulations which would ultimately be required.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the Governmentcould rightly claim that these matters were not suitable for enactmentby a Private Member&apos;s Bill. They should express their sympathy with the purposes of the Bill and their readiness to secure the passageof legislation on this subject at the earliest practicable date. this statement of their intentions should, however, be framed in thebroadest possible terms and should not commit them to detailedlegislation covering all the recommendations of the Gower&apos;s committee.In discussion of the tactics for handling Mr. Davies&apos;s Bill, it wasagreed that it would be inexpedient for the Government to table a reasoned amendment for its rejection. Steps should be taken toensure that the debate on the Bill lasted throughout the day&apos;s sitting;and a motion for the closure could properly be opposed if it was clearthat it could be defeated. It would be best if the promoters of theBill were to withdraw it after debate, but it seemed unlikely that theywould be willing to do so. The possibility must therefore be facedthat the Bill might obtain a Second Reading. In that event theGovernment would have to accept the risk of misrepresentation byreason of their having opposed particular provisions of the Bill in theCommittee Stage. It was, however, unlikely that there would betime for the Bill to pass through ail its stages before the end of thesessionThe Lord Privy Seal said that the statements made on behalfof the Government in the proceedings on this Bill were likely to commit the Government to introducing extensive legislation on these subjects in the next session of Parliament. In these circumstances the drafting of the necessary Government legislation should now beput in hand. Three separate Bills would probably be necessary todeal with agriculture and forestry, railways and other non-industrial employment.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Home Secretary to explain the governments attitude to Mr. Davies&apos;s Bill during the Second reading debate on 1st April on the general lines approved in the cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Agreed that, if the Opposition should seek to obtain the closure at the conclusion of the debate, this might be opposed on behalf of the Government if a majority forits rejection was assured.
Armed Forces. 5. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a motion by LordOfficers&apos; Jeffreys, which was to be debated in the House of Lords on 6th April,Retired Pay. calling on the Government to take immediate steps to improve the(Previous pensions of retired officers of the Armed Forces. This motion would reference: command much sympathy in the House of Lords and it was unlikelyCC. (54) 11th that it could be defeated. It was therefore suggested that the Govern-Conclusions, ment should propose an amendment recalling the specific stepsMinute 5.)       already taken by the Government to improve officers&apos; pensions in1952 and 1954 and stating that the position would cqntinue to bekept under review.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not contem-plate at present any further improvement in the basic rates of officers&apos;pensions. The claims of retired officers could not be considered in isolation: they must be reviewed in conjunction with those of otherretired members of the public services. At some stage the Govern-ment would have to consider the introduction of a Pensions IncreaseBill to improve the pensions of retired members of the public services generally. He was in general agreement with the lines of the proposed amendment to Lord Jeffreys&apos; motion, but would like to have a further opportunity of considering its wording.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister without Portfolio to settle, in consulta-tion with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the terms ofthe amendment to be tabled by the Government in theforthcoming debate in the House of Lords on pensions of retired officers of the Armed Forces.National 6.   The Minister of Defence said that he had to answer that service. day a Parliamentary Question by Mr. F. J. Bellenger, M.P., suggesting(Previous that a Select Committee of the House of Commons should be reference: appointed to enquire into the working of the National Service Acts.CC.

Alternatively, he couldMinute 3.) recall the arguments outlined in paragraphs 67-69 of the defence white Paper in support of the Governments policy of maintaining the current period of two years&apos; whole-time National Service.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be preferable for the Minister of Defence to base his reply on theGovernments decision to maintain the current period of NationalService.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Defence to answer Mr. BellengefsQuestion about National Service by reference to the policy announced in paragraphs 67-69 of the Defence White Paper.British 7.   The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum byEuropean the Secretary of State for Scotland, the Minister of Supply and theAirways. Minister of Transport and Civil Aviation (C. (55) 85) on the proposalRenfrew of British European Airways (B.E.A.) to close their maintenance baseMaintenance at Renfrew and transfer the remaining work to London Airport.Base.

Industrial 8.   The Minister of Labour reported that deadlock had nowDisputes. been reached between the Newspaper Proprietors&apos; AssociationNewspapers. (N.P.A.) and the unions with which they were at present in dispute the Amalgamated Engineering Union and the Electrical TradesUnion. The N.P.A. were not at present prepared to negotiateseparately with these unions but had agreed to accept an award given at arbitration. The unions refused to accept arbitration and insisted on separate negotiations with the N.P.A. &quot; On the previous day theN.P.A. had decided to give notice of termination of employment, totake effect from 15th April, to printing operatives employed in news-paper offices affected by the strike, and at his invitation representativesof the printing unions were to discuss the situation with officers ofhis Department that afternoon. There was little else that he could do for the present. The appointment of a Court of Inquiry wouldnot be appropriate: nor was it desired by the N.P.A., who werenot prepared to make any concession. He would continue to seek a means of promoting a settlement, but at present there seemed tobe no prospect of breaking the deadlock.Docks. The Minister of Labour said that a strike involving 15,000dockers on Merseyside had arisen in connection with the half-yearlyissue of new attendance-money books. Since 1940 the LiverpoolDock Labour Board had issued new books on production of member-ship cards of the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union (T. and . W.U.), and that Union had recently obtained legal advice on whichthey had based a claim that the Dock Labour Board was not at liberty to issue new books to dockers belonging to another union. TheMinister had informed the Secretary of the Union that he could notdefend this attempt to enforce a closed shop in the Merseyside docks,and arrangements had been made for new attendance-money booksto be issued by the Liverpool Dock Labour Board regardless of union membership for the time being. On the strength of thisarrangement the headquarters of the Amalgamated Stevedores&apos; andDockers&apos; Union had issued instructions to their representatives onMerseyside that the strikers should resume work.Later in the meeting the Minister of Labour reported that the strikers would return to work on the following day.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Labour.in this way, a choice of alternative employment was likely to be madeavailable to all B.E.A.&apos;s employees who would be displaced by theproposed move.The Cabinet were informed that B.E.A.&apos;s employees at Renfrewhad that day staged the first of what was intended to be a series ofone-day strikes in protest against the uncertainty of their futureemployment at Renfrew. It was the general view of the Cabinet thatthis action on the part of the men concerned should not deter theGovernment from carrying out the plan which had now been devised for enabling B.E.A. to transfer their work from Renfrew without serious effects upon the staff whom they employed there. The view was, however, expressed that, in considering any similar problem in the future, the Government should pay greater regard to the undesirability on defence grounds of concentrating further industrial activity in the London area.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Transport and Civil Aviationto inform British European Airways that they could now proceed with the transfer of their maintenance work fromRenfrew to London, and to announce in Parliament thearrangements made for providing alternative employment for those employees of British European Airways who wouldbe displaced by this transfer.
7 C.C. 27 (55)Government The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordOffices. Privy Seal (C. (55) 87) submitting the report of the committee whichNew Colonial   they had appointed on 24th February to consider the practicabilityOffice Building of accommodating the Colonial Office in a new building in Richmond(Previous        Terrace and the implications of a scheme for a greater ParliamentReference:      Square.   The committee had concluded that, while it would beC.C. (55) 18th   practicable to build a new Colonial Office in Richmond Terrace, this conclusions,     would involve an additional delay of two years. They foresaw greatMinute 6.)       difficulties in proceeding with a scheme for a greater parliament square, partly because the Government would have to promotelegislation giving them authority to exercise compulsory purchasepowers at an indefinite future date, and partly because a very largeexpenditure   would   ultimately   be   involved.    They   thereforecommended the earlier plan for building the new Colonial Office onthe Westminster Hospital site.The Cabinefs discussion turned oh the question whether theGovernment should preclude all possibility of a greater parliament square in the future by proceeding now with the project for buildingthe new Colonial Office on the Westminster Hospital site. It was generally recognised that the Government could not immediatelyproceed with a scheme for a greater Parliament Square, if only onaccount of its heavy cost. There was, however, strong support forthe view that such a scheme might become practicable in the future and that this possibility should be left open if it were found that therewere no insuperable objections to it. This suggested that it wouldbe preferable to build the new Colonial Office on the RichmondTerrace site. The Cabinet were, however, reminded that newaccommodation was needed for the Foreign Office, and that they hadnot yet finally approved the proposal to adapt Carl ton House Terracefor that purpose. If it were decided not to proceed with that proposal, the Foreign Office would wish to put forward a claim toany new building erected in Richmond Terrace. It was the general view of the Cabinet that work would have to be undertaken in due course on the adaptation of Carlton House Terrace for modern office accommodation; and it was agreed that, on this understanding, theColonial Office should have first claim on a new building inRichmond Terrace.As regards the suggestion that early legislation would be needed to enable the Minister of Works to hold the Westminster Hospitalsite for purposes other than the erection of Government offices, it waspointed out that this necessity would not arise until the government announced a decision to proceed with a scheme for a greater\ Parliament Square. It would therefore be preferable that it shouldnot be made publicly known that the new building in RichmondTerrace was earmarked for use by the Colonial Office. Indeed, if itwere subsequently decided not to proceed with the scheme for agreater Parliament Square, the Colonial Office might wish to revivetheir claim to a building on the Westminster Hospital site.The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the difficulty which would arise connection with the building in Great George Street occupiedby the Chartered Surveyors, if it were decided to leave open thepossibility of working towards a greater Parliament Square. TheSurveyors intended to rebuild their present premises, and would needplanning permission to do so. It therefore seemed that it would be advisable to hold consultations in confidence with the Surveyors, andalso with the London County Council and perhaps other interested parties, with a view to reaching some amicable arrangement, whereby the Surveyors would be content to postpone their plans for rebuilding.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that the houses in Carlton House Terraceshould in due course be adapted as modern office accommodation for the Foreign Office.
commercial policy.Review ofthe G.A.T.T.(previous reference:,C.C.(55)26thConclusions,Minute 3.)10. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (55) 64 and 86) on the results of the recentreview of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.The President of the Board of Trade said that he had undertaken to present to Parliament before the Easter recess a further white paper giving the text of the revised Agreement, together with ageneral statement of the Governments attitude towards the resultsof the recent review. The statement which he proposed to make was set out in the Annex to C. (55) 86. It indicated that, in the Govern-ment s view, the revisions adopted in the review strengthened thevalue of the Agreement as an instrument for facilitating theexpansion of international trade. It also drew attention to thewaivers obtained in the course of the review, particularly thatrelating to the special problems of the Colonies, and announced theGovernments intention to seek legislative powers to impose counter-vailing and anti-dumping duties. The proposed statement should beof value in disposing the United States Congress to accept the revisedAgreement.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to include,in the White Paper containing the revised text of theGeneral Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a statement ofthe Governments attitude towards the revised agreement in the terms of the draft contained in the Annex toC. (55) 86.Cotton.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 26thConclusions,Minute 5.)11. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Presidentof the Board of Trade (C. (55) 88 and 89) about the difficulties of thecotton industry.The President of the Board of Trade said that, at their meeting with the Prime Minister, the Cotton Board had made it clear thatthey wished the Government to impose a quota on retained imports of grey cloth and cotton yarn from commonwealth countries, as a holding measure to lead to a tariff on such imports,and to relieve textiles of all liability to purchase tax. He did notthink that any action, by quota or tariff, was necessary in the case ofcotton yarn. He had, however, described in C. (55) 88 the quotaarrangements which would be necessary if it were decided to restrict imports of grey cloth from the Commonwealth. He did not recommend this action, which was open to grave objections. Thus,if such restrictions were imposed, it would be necessary to applythem to imports from Hong Kong: to exclude Hong Kong fromthe quota would mean increased discrimination against India and pakistan, with the risk of greater retaliation from India, and thedanger that imports from Hong Kong would increase still further.But to apply a quota to Hong Kong would be contrary to theGovernments Colonial policy. Moreover, quota action could notbe justified under the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade and(2) Agreed that, a new Government office should be built inRichmond Terrace, and that the Colonial Office shouldhave first claim to that building^(3) Invited the Minister of Housing and Local Government ana.the Minister of Works to formulate, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, and to submit to the.Cabinet proposals for conducting the necessary negotia-tions with the Chartered Surveyors, the London CountyCouncil and other interested parties with a view to leavingopen the possibility of proceeding at some future date with a project for a greater Parliament Square.
9CC. 27 (55)would be contrary to the policy of free entry for Commonwealthgoods. It would lead to pressure for similar action from many otherindustries which had as good a case for protection as the cottonindustry. It would also lead to the need for tariff legislation, andwould involve the re-negotiation of the Indian Trade Agreement,with the risk of the loss of preferences and of retaliation from theCommonwealth.He would therefore prefer to help the cotton industry by removing purchase tax from textiles, in order to help its export trade.This might, however, form part of a comprehensive plan for dealingwith the difficulties of the cotton industry on the lines set out inC. (55) 89.In a preliminary discussion the Cabinet first considered thedifficulties of imposing a quota on Hong Kong. It was pointed outthat, if such restrictions were imposed, it would be difficult to avoidextending them to other goods, such as gloves. It was argued thatthe&quot; application of such a quota to Hong Kong would beunprecedented and would be inconsistent with the Governmentssuccessful efforts to obtain a Colonial waiver from the provisions ofthe General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Moreover, the textile industry had been developed in Hong Kong because of the loss ofher entrepot trade with China which had followed from our application of strategic controls.Some Ministers considered that, nevertheless, some level ofquota against Hong Kong could be justified as a holding operation.It might be possible to treat Hong Kong more favourably than India;the annual rate of imports of grey cloth from Hong Kong had increased to such an extent in the current year that to impose a quotaat the 1954 level would be a serious blow. It seemed clear, however,that, if a quota were imposed on India, some restriction would haveto be applied to Hong Kong, since otherwise imports of grey clothfrom the latter would be bound to increase considerably.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the proposals inC. (55) 89 raised many problems which needed further study by theMinisters mainly concerned before agreed recommendations couldbe formulated for a comprehensive plan for assisting the cottonindustry.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to confer with theChancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Minister ofDefence, the Commonwealth Secretary, the colonial secretary, the President of the Board of Trade and theMinister of State for Foreign Affairs (Lord Reading), witha view to formulating, for consideration by the Cabinet ata meeting in the following week, detailed recommendations for assisting the cotton industry.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.30th March, 1955.
