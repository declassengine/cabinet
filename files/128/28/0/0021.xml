3 C.C. 21 (55)Foreign Affairs. 1. The Foreign Secretary gave the Cabinet a report on therecent Conference of the Manila Treaty Powers at Bangkok, and onthe impressions which he had formed in the visits which he had paidto other capitals on his way to and from that Conference.In Cairo he had found that the Prime Minister was not personallyhostile to the idea of a rapprochement with Israel. It had, however,been evident that the Egyptians would have strong views on the timing of such a move; and, in view of the recent incident at Gaza,it was unlikely that any progress could be made with this at present.In Bagdad he had discussed the revision of the Anglo-Iraq treaty and the possibility of our being associated in some way with the recentdefence treaty between Turkey and Iraq. It should be possible to devise means by which the United Kingdom could be effectivelyassociated with this defence pact.In Malaya he had been impressed by the efficiency and deter-mination of the British troops. He had, however, some doubts aboutthe existing organisation for co-ordination, not only between the civil and the military elements within Malaya, but also between the &quot;ariousGovernments under the general supervision of the Commissioner-General for South-East Asia. He would take up these points withthe Colonial Secretary.In Delhi he had received a warm welcome, and at a banquet at government House Mr. Nehru had made a notable speech on thequality of the relations between India and the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Formosa.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 20thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that the Conference at Bangkokhad given him a valuable opportunity to ascertain, through informal discussions with the United States Secretary of State and his military advisers, the views and intentions of the United States Governmentin respect of Formosa and the coastal islands. It was evident thatthere were differences of opinion within military circles in washington. While Mr. Dulles was being advised, in Bangkok, that formosa was vulnerable to attack by the Chinese Communists andthat Nationalist possession of Quemoy and the Matsus was essentialto its defence, Admiral Radford was reported to have made astatement in Washington scouting the possibility of a Communistinvasion of Formosa and belittling the role which the coastal islandscould play in its defence. Nevertheless, there were disturbingindications that some of the Presidents military advisers wereinfluenced by the consideration that, if a clash with China was inevitable, there was much to be said for taking military action nowrather than later and for doing so by way of air attack against the mainland.The Foreign Secretary said that he would be expected to make astatement in the House of Commons on the results of his mission to south-East Asia and he had been considering what he should say, inthat statement, about his discussions with Mr. Dulles on the current situation in-the Far East. He doubted whether he could any longerpostpone giving some indication of the views of the United KingdomGovernment on this question, and he had prepared a draft statement which concluded by indicating the lines along which a solution mightbe sought.   Copies of this statement were circulated to the Cabinet.Discussion showed that it was the view of the Cabinet that theForeign Secretary should at this stage give some indication of theattitude of the United Kingdom Government towards this problem,and there was general agreement with the broad lines of the draft which he had prepared. This sugaested that the main elements in a47778-1 B 2
Coal Prices. 3.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal to(Previous        increase coal prices.Reference: They had before them a further memorandum by the MinisterC.C. (55) 19th of Fuel and Power (C. (55) 61) which had been prepared in the lightConclusions. of a further examination of his original proposals by the EconomicMinute li.) Policy Committee. This put forward, for decision by the Cabinet,the proposal that prices of coal for industrial use should be increasedeither by 12-J- per cent, or by 10 per cent. No change was suggestedin the increases previously proposed for the top three grades of household coal.possible solution would be these. First, that the United States shouldcontinue their efforts to relax tension and to restrain the Nationalistsfrom offering provocation. Secondly, that the Chinese Communistsshould make it plain that they would not prosecute by forceful meanstheir claims to Formosa and the Pescadores. Thirdly, that theChinese Nationalists should withdraw from all the coastal islands andshould let it be known that they would not prosecute their claims byforceful means and would abstain from all offensive military action.Fourthly, that an understanding should be reached that at the end ofa fixed period the inhabitants of Formosa and the Pescadores shouldbe enabled to choose whether they wished to rejoin mainland Chinaor to maintain an independent existence. Fifthly, that consideration should be given at an appropriate stage to the problem of Chineserepresentation in the United Nations.In discussion it was argued that the suggestion of a plebiscite inFormosa might be specially unwelcome to the United States Govern-ment. It might also arouse misgivings in some commonwealth countries. And it might be seized upon by those who were concerned to argue that the people of Cyprus should be allowed to choosewhether they should remain under British rule or be united with greece. It was also pointed out that the ultimate status of Formosaand the representation of China in the United Nations were bothproblems which could not be resolved in the near future and could appropriately be differentiated from the first three suggestions madein the draft statement, which were elements in a solution of theimmediate difficulties. It was therefore agreed that, after outlininghis three proposals for dealing with the immediate situation, theForeign Secretary should refer to the long-term problems in more general terms, on the following lines :  &quot; If these three objectives can be realised, consideration could then be given at an appropriate stage to the problem of Chineserepresentation in the United Nations and to the future status of formosa.&quot;Other minor amendments of the draft statement were suggestedin the course of the discussion.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would revise, in thelight of the Cabinefs discussion, the draft of the statement which he was proposing to make in the House ofCommons on the following day.(2) Took note that the Lord President would make a corres-ponding statement in the House of Lords.(3) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to inform other commonwealth Governments, through their high commissioners in London, of the terms of the statement which the Foreign Secretary was proposing to make.
Coal Prices. 3.  The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal to(Previous increase coal prices.Reference: They had before them a further memorandum by the MinisterC.C.(55)l9th of Fuel and Power (C. (55) 61) which had been prepared in the lightConclusions. of a further examination of his original proposals by the EconomicMinute 11.) Policy Committee.  This put forward, for decision by the Cabinet,the proposal that prices of coal for industrial use should be increased1 either by 12  per cent, or by 10 per cent.   No change was suggested\         -&apos; fn the increases previously proposed for the top three grades of\ household coal.
.5 .&apos;;-&apos;&apos;;&apos;V &apos;;.  CC. 21 (55)The Cabinet again reviewed the arguments for and againstincreasing the price of coal. In the course of their discussion theywere informed tiiat the British Transport Commission had nowintimated that they would shortly seek approval for increases in passenger fares and freight charges; and that the effect of any increasein the price of coal would be taken into account in determining thelevel of the increased charges to be proposed by the Commission. Inthis connection, critical comment might be made on the fact that thecost of coal to the railways would be raised by more than the amountby which the prices of identical coal would be raised to domestic consumers..The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.Cotton.(previous reference:CC. (55) 16thConclusions.Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet were informed of the ternjs of a proposedGovernment amendment to an Opposition Motion criticising theGovernments policy for the cotton industry.Discussion turned on the terms in which the amendment should express the Governments intention to take action to restrict importsof cotton textiles. A promise of &quot; safeguarding action on imports &quot;might be understood to connote safeguarding duties of the typeimposed before the war. It might be preferable to use more generallanguage.The Cabinet Agreed that a Government amendment should be tabled onthe general lines suggested and invited the Minister of State,Board of Trade, to settle its detailed terms in consultationwith the Chancellor of the Exchequer.Australia. 5.   The Commonwealth Secretary said that, after the CabinefsFloods in New discussion on 2nd March, he and the Chancellor of the ExchequerSouth Wales. had decided that the United Kingdom Government should make a(Previous gift of  250,000 to the Australian Government for the relief of distressReference: caused by the, recent floods in New South Wales.   This decision hadCC. (55) 19th at once keen conveyed to the Australian Government, and had been conclusions. made public on 2nd March.   He had now received a message ofMinute5.) &apos; thanks from the Prime Minister of Australia, who had asked that hisappreciation of this generous gift should be conveyed to the Cabinet.Cabinet Office.
