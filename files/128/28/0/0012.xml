IAircraftProduction.Swift fighter aircraft.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Air and the Minister of Supply (C. (55) 37) onthe difficulties encountered in the supply of Swift single-seat fightersto the R.A.F.The Minister of Supply said that it had now been definitely established that the first three marks of the Swift were not acceptablefor Service use. Quite recently further improvements had been developed in the Mark 4 Swift, but flying tests had started only aweek ago and tests of the new type of engine incorporated in it had only just begun. It remained doubtful whether these latest modifica-tions would suffice to make the aircraft suitable for operational use,but this could not be definitely determined until the current testswere completed. The Government would be open to criticism if theydid not await the outcome of these tests before announcing their finaldecision. It was still just possible (hat later marks of the Swift would prove suitable for a limited range of service uses, but few machinesof this type would be required for those purposes.

aircraft production.White Paper.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 7thConclusions.Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister ofDefence and the Minister of Supply (C. (55) 35) covering a draft,prepared in pursuance of the Cabinets decision of 27th January, ofa White Paper on the supply of military aircraft.In a detailed discussion of this draft the following points weremade:  (a) Paragraph 6. Was it sufficiently clear that the decisionmentioned in this paragraph was taken, not by the aircraft industry,but by the Government? The Cabinet thought there was little room for misunderstanding on this point, since the paper as a whole was written in terms of official decisions.(b) Paragraph 10. The second sentence of this paragraph was open to the criticism that it did not take account of the substantial volume of research work carried out for the Government bycontractors. It was agreed that this sentence should be omitted.(c) Paragraph 20. Production of the Swift fighter had in fact been ordered before the detailed specifications had been completed.This paragraph should be revised so as to bring out more clearly the exceptional haste with which the Swift had been put into production.id) Paragraph 22. The point should also be made here that theunusual haste in ordering the Swift had the further consequence thata disproportionate load of work was placed on particular firms in theaircraft industry.the Cabinet would agree to await the assessment of the latestimprovements in the Swift before announcing a final decision aboutthe future of this aircraft.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The first four Marks of the Swift had been designed to meetthe requirement for an interceptor fighter which could climbrapidly to 45,000 feet and maintain that height with an endurance ofabout H hours. These characteristics were essential to counter the threat of nuclear attack by air. The first four Marks of the Swiftwhich had been developed could not meet these requirements and itwas very doubtful whether the latest improvements would remedy the deficiencies. The Mark 7 Swift, designed to carry guided missiles,was also unable to meet the approved requirements. It was important, therefore, to avoid optimistic statements about the futureof the Swift in the White Paper on the Supply of Military Aircraft.(b) The aircraft production programme was planned on thebasis that the later Marks of the Swift would be followed by a newnaval fighter, the N. 11.3. The orders for the Swift should, therefore,be cut back in such a way as to avoid the dispersal of the manufacturer^ labour force in the interval before the new navalfighter had been developed to the production stage. It was also important that the goodwill of the firm should be retained. this could not be assured if a decision were taken before full tests hadbeen made of their latest efforts to improve this aircraft.(c) The outcome of the current tests of the Swift would be known in time to allow the Governments final decision to be announcedseveral days before the defence debates.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Governments decision on the adjustment ofthe orders placed for the delivery of Swift fighters shouldbe deferred until the current tests of the latest improve-ments in this aircraft were concluded.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of C. (55) 37 when the outcome of these tests was known.
(e) Paragraphs 31-32.-*-This passage would be adjusted to take account of the decision, recorded in Minute 2 above, on existing contracts for Swift fighters.(/) Paragraph 36. The Wyvern, though designed as a carrier-borne aircraft, could not in fact be operated from a carrier and wasbeing used solely as a shore-based aircraft. These facts were widely known, and the White Paper should not attempt to conceal them.The paragraph should be re-drafted so as to make it clear that this aircraft was unsuitable for use in carriers, but could be useful in a subsidiary role.(g) Paragraph 37. It should be brought out that an important factor in the long delay in bringing the Gannet into service was that,during its development, radical changes had been made in therequirements which it was designed to meet.(//) Paragraph 39.- Some helicopters were already in service withthe Navy, and the drafting of this passage should be adjusted to take account of this.(/) Paragraph 42. It was suggested that this paragraph should include a reference to the fact that budgetary difficulties must impose a limit on the amount of expenditure that could be incurred on thedevelopment and production of military aircraft. The cabinet agreed that this point could best be met by adjusting the wording ofthe second sentence of paragraph 1 of the draft. This shouldconclude by referring to the sums of money &quot; provided &quot; for, ratherthan the sums &quot; involved &quot; in, the production of military aircraft.(/&apos;) Paragraphs 43-66.-the purpose of these paragraphs was,not so much to draw conclusions from the past, as to indicate some general considerations which should be kept in mind in the future.The Cabinet agreed that the main Paper should end with the summing up in paragraph 42 of the present draft, and that theremaining paragraphs should be printed as an appendix.(k) Paragraph 60. -This passage should be revised so as to draw a less sharp distinction between &quot; essential&quot; modifications and&quot; desirable &quot; modifications.(/) Paragraph 65. This paragraph should be omitted.(in) Paragraph 66. Sub-paragraph (//) and the second sentence of sub-paragraph (d) should be omitted.In the course of their discussion the Cabinet also approved anumber of suggestions for minor amendment of the draft.The Cabinet then proceeded to consider the time-table for publication of this White Paper.The Minister of Defence said that the production of military aircraft was part of the wider question of research, development and production of defence equipment, which was discussed in genera!terms in Sections V and VI of the Defence White Paper. For thisreason he had hitherto assumed that the more detailed statementcontained in the White Paper on the supply of military aircraft wouldbe made public simultaneously with the general statement on defence policy contained in the Defence White Paper. He had hoped topresent both these documents to Parliament on 17th February.The Prime Minister said that these documents were of greatimportance and that each ought to receive full publicity. It would therefore be a mistake, in his view, to publish both on the same day.It would be much better that they should issue consecutively, so that each could receive due publicity and comment in the press.After discussion it was agreed that the aim should be to arrangefor the White Papers on Civil Uses of Atomic Energy, Supply ofMilitary Aircraft and Defence to be presented to Parliament,respectively, on 15th, .16th and 17th February. If, however, it provedimpracticable to adhere to this time-table, the second and third ofthese White Papers might be presented on 17th and 18th February.
The final decision on the adjustment of existing contracts for theproduction of Swift aircraft would be announced in Parliament assoon as possible thereafter and in any event before the opening of the debate on the Defence White Paper.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence and the Minister of supply to revise, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, the draft white Paper on the Supply of Military Aircraft which was annexed to C. (55) 35; and authorised them to arrange forthis White Paper, as so revised, to be presented toParliament.(2) Agreed that the White Paper on the Supply of Military. Aircraft should be presented one day before the defence white Paper, and invited the Minister of Defence to aim at presenting these two White Papers on 16th and17th February respectively.China.Treatment ofBritishPrisoners inKorean War.(previous reference:CC. (55) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 31st January theCabinet had agreed to defer for two weeks their decision regardingthe date of publication of the report on the treatment of british prisoners of war captured in Korea. He considered that a point had now been reached when this report could be published without riskof prejudicing the attempts which were being made to ease theexisting tension in the Far East.The Cabinet Agreed that the report on the treatment of British prisonersof war captured in Korea might be published as aStationery Office publication not earlier than the week beginning 21st February.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,11th February, 1955.
