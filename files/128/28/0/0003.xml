Kenya. 1.   The Cabinet had before them telegrams which the Colonial(Previous Secretary had exchanged with the Governor of Kenya on a proposalReferences: that a new offer should now be made that Mau Mau terrorists whoC.C.

(he terrorists, and this was a favourable moment for an offer of newsurrender terms. It was, however, the view of the War Council inNairobi that such an offer should not be made unless it could be stated at the same time that no further proceedings would be taken against members of the Kikuyu Guard and other loyal supporters of the Government for misdemeanours committed in the course oftheir activities against- the terrorists. The Colonial Secretary saidthat he shared this view: it would be impossible to satisfy publicopinion in Kenya that it .was right to offer clemency to terroristsand at the same time to continue investigations designed to uncoverirregularities committed by those, whether European or African,who had sought to help the Government to restore order.In a preliminary discussion questions were raised about the legalbasis of the proposals put forward by the Governor of Kenya.Doubt was also expressed about the wisdom of linking a newsurrender offer with a suspension of further investigations intomisdemeanours by members of the Kikuyu Guard and otherloyalists. This latter proposal, though it might be welcomed in kenya, might give rise to misgivings in this country.The Cabinet . - Agreed to resume their discussion of these proposals at afurther meeting later in the day.Appointment The Prime Minister said that he had been surprised at theof new manner of the announcement of General Erskine&apos;s  impendingCommander- transfer from his appointment as Commander-in-Chief in Kenya.in-Chief. It seemed strange that this change of command should be announced at a moment when military operations in Kenya were beingintensified. The change was certainly one on which he shouldhave been consulted.The Secretary of Stale for War said that General Erskine hadbeen appointed to this post for a period of two years, which was due to expire in May; that his transfer, and the choice of his successor, had been settled in consultation with the Colonial Secre-tary; and. that, as had been made clear in the announcement, his departure from Kenya would be delayed beyond May if the stateof military operations then made this desirable. He greatly regretted that, by an oversight, the announcement had been made without prior consultation with the Prime Minister.The Prime Minister asked that further steps should be takento ensure that he was consulted in future on all military appointmentswhich might affect other Departments or arouse public interest, sothat he might have an opportunity of bringing them to the noticeof the Cabinet.Afro-Asian 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, at the initiative of theConference. Indonesian Government, the Prime Ministers of the Colombo powers had invited the Governments of a number of countries in Africa andAsia to send representatives to an Afro-Asian Conference to be heldat Bandoeng towards the end of April. This was an unfortunateinitiative and seemed likely to result in -resolutions deprecatingColonialism and urging the prohibition of all further development47494---3 - V B 2
of thermo-nuclear weapons. It was now clear, however, that theConference could not be prevented, and he had been considering what guidance could be given to those of the Governments invitedto it who were likely to accept advice from us. It would, he thought,be unwise to encourage such Governments to send representatives to the Conference if they were reluctant to do so. He proposed thatwe should content ourselves with offering information, help and advice to those Governments who were proposing to be represented at the Conference.In discussion there was general agreement that this Asianintervention in African affairs was not to be welcomed. It wouldbe preferable on this account that Governments of British territories in Africa should not be represented at&apos;the Conference. The cabinet were informed that the Prime Minister of the Gold Coast had show no special wish to send a representative and was likely to accept such adyice as the Governor might give him on this point. TheGovernment of the Central African Federation, who had also been invited, were showing no enthusiasm for the Conference.The Cabinet 11) Endorsed the Foreign Secretary^ proposal that, as regardsforeign Governments which might accept guidance from us, we should do nothing to encourage attendance at the afro-Asian Conference but should be ready to give information, help and adyice to Governments wishing tobe represented at the Conference.(2) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and Colonial Secretaryto take discreet steps to discourage the Governments ofthe Central African Federation and the Gold Coast from sending representatives to this Conference.

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign the Oman. Secretary (C. (55) 6) seeking approval of measures to support theAssistance to Sultan of Muscat and Oman against Saudi Arabian pretensions tothe Sultan. territory on the borders of his Sultanate.The Foreign Secretary explained that British and american companies were prospecting for oil in Central Oman and in theprovince of Dofar. The prospecting areas were in territory whichthe Sultan of Muscat had always claimed to be part of his Sultanatebut to which Saudi Arabia had put forward counter-claims. Therewere grounds for believing that the Saudi Arabians might resort to forceful means of interfering with the prospecting operations. Hehad therefore authorised the Political Resident in the Persian Gulfto inform the Sultan that we should be ready to make available tohim arms and equipment for a further 400 troops of his at a cost ofabout  150,000, and he now sought the Cabinet&apos;s endorsement ofthis action. It was reasonable to suppose that a substantial propor-tion of the necessary expenditure could be recovered from the iraq petroleum Company. He further recommended that we should take any other reasonable measures which might prove to be necessaryto support the Sultan in resisting Saudi Arabian incursion orpressure.There was general support in the Cabinet for the foreign secretary&apos;s proposals.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The need for a Supplementary Estimate to cover theproposed expenditure should, if possible, be avoided as its submission to Parliament would provide the opportunity for a debate and itwas preferable that publicity for our action should be avoided.
(b) The ground and air forces at present available in AdenColony and Protectorate were limited and it might be foundnecessary to despatch modest reinforcements to the area if we wereto ensure that the Sultan received all the support which he might require.The Cabinet (1) Approved the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals for givingsupport to the Sultan of Muscat and Oman against saudi arabian pretensions.(2) Invited the Minister of Defence to consider urgently, inconsultation with the Foreign Secretary, the colonial secretary, the Secretaries of State for War and Air, andthe Financial Secretary, Treasury, what forces were required to ensure adequate support for the Sultan andwhether any reinforcements need be sent to the area forthis purpose.industrial disputes.Railways.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 2ndConclusions.)4. The Cabinet reviewed the situation resulting from thesettlement of the railway wages dispute.The following points were made in the discussion:  id) The discussions which the Minister of Labour had held on 6th January with the two parties to the dispute had been difficult and protracted. It was only at the last moment that a strike hadbeen averted.  Now, however, all strike notices had been withdrawn.(b) Now that wage increases had been granted, it must be theGovernment&apos;s main aim to secure a more efficient employment of thelabour force on the railways. The large annual turnover of labour should simplify the problem of reducing redundancy. The labour force had in fact been reduced by about 25,000 in 1954. The Ministerof Transport proposed that a formal enquiry should be held into theuse of man-power on the railways.ic) Further capital investment in the railways should be linked with the more efficient use of labour. The plans of the british transport Commission for modernising the railways would besubmitted for consideration by the Economic Policy Committee inthe following week. At this stage it might not be necessary for theGovernment to go further than indicate approval of the general linesof the Commission^ policy for future capital investment. It was important that, before they were finally committed to large capitalexpenditure on the railways, the Government should have anopportunity to relate this to future expenditure on road development.id) There was also room for improvement in the structure of management under the Transport Commission. The Cabinet were informed that this was already under consideration.ie) The Government would be under pressure to make an early statement on these matters when Parliament reassembled.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of these questions at their meeting on 20th January.House otCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous reference:C.C.

(54) 91stConclusions,Minute I.)&apos; -5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Attorney-General (C. (55) I) covering the draft of a White Paper which he had prepared for the purpose of bringing to the attention of parliament the constitutional considerations which he had presented to theCourt of Appeal in asking that the injunction granted by Mr. JusticeRoxburgh should be discharged.   ;.In discussion it was suggested that the presentation of these considerations in the form of a White Paper might have the effectof provoking further debate in the House of Commons.  The Lord.
Privy Seal had already expressed, in his statement on 21st December,the Governments view that this was not a justiciable issue, and hehad said that the Attorney-General would consider how the reportof the proceedings before the Court of Appeal should be madeavailable to Members.   It was not necessary for that purpose to. present a White Paper: it would suffice if copies of the proceedings were placed in the Library of the House of Commons.   For that* purpose the print annexed to C. (55) 1 would serve if the introductoryparagraphs -were omitted.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Privy Seal and the Attorney-General toarrange for copies of pages 3-67 of the print annexed toC. (55) 1 to be placed in the Library of the&apos; House ofCommons before Parliament reassembled.colonial immigrants.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 82ndConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (C. (55) 5) indicating the general lines of the legislation which he was preparing for the purpose of restricting the admissionof British subjects from overseas to the United Kingdom.In a preliminary discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was general support for the view that the social consequences of the increasing flow of West Indian immigrants intothis country were sufficiently serious to compel the Government totake such action as was open to them, or at least to make theirattitude on the matter clear to the public.(b) On the other hand, it was represented that the Governmentwere most unlikely to be able to carry through the House ofCommons a Bill on the lines suggested in C. (55) 5. The opposition parties would not publicly support it, and some of the government&apos;s supporters would not favour it. The Trade Union Congress wouldalso be unlikely to give it public support. The introduction of such&quot;a&quot;Bill would seriously dislocate the Parliamentary programme forthe current session.- (c) As regards the form of the proposed legislation, TheCommonwealth Secretary urged that its provisions should be keptas general as possible in order that means might be found in practice to allow the movement of British subjects between the UnitedKingdom and independent Commonwealth countries to continue without hindrance.(d) Public opinion might be influenced in favour of-the intro-duction of legislation on the lines proposed if more publicity weregiven to the restrictions already applicable to the entry of Britishsubjects into all the other independent Commonwealth countries and into most Colonial territories.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Commonwealth Secretary and Colonial Secretaryto prepare and submit to the Cabinet the draft of a white paper describing the existing restrictions on the entry ofBritish subjects into other Commonwealth countries.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion at a later meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,13th January, 1955.
