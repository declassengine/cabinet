1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 3rd February there would be a debate on the railway wagesdispute. It was hoped that this could be held on the motion for the adjournment. It was agreed that the Government spokesmen shouldbe the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Parliamentary Secretary,Ministry of Labour. The Chancellor would reply to the debate, andwould take the opportunity of stating the Governments views onthe question of wages in nationalised industries.The Opposition had asked for a separate debate, in the week beginning 7th February, on the Transport Commission^ plan formodernising the railways.The Cabinet were informed that facilities would have to beprovided before long for the House of Commons to debate the Reportof the Royal Commission on Capital Punishment. It must beassumed that, when this was debated, means would be found offorcing a division on the question whether capital punishment shouldbe abolished in this country. On this issue the Government might find it necessary to allow a free vote.aircraft production.2. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the increasing pressure,in the House of Commons, for a Government statement on the delay in producing up-to-date fighter aircraft for the Royal Air Force. Ithad been assumed that this would be among the topics to be discussed in the debate on the Defence White Paper, which would containsections dealing with research, development and production of weapons. On this particular subject, however, feeling was now so strong that it might be inadvisable to delay a Government statementuntil then. There was much to be said for the publication of aseparate White Paper dealing only with the delays in. the productionof up-to-date fighter aircraft. These could be better explained ina White Paper than in an oral statement. The Government neednot thereby be committed to finding time for a separate debate onthis subject.The Prime Minister said that he would arrange for the DefenceCommittee to keep this possibility in mind, when they consideredthe draft of the Defence White Paper at their next meeting. Hewould thereafter discuss with the Lord Privy Seal how best thequestion could be handled in the House of Commons.Bank Rate. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that the Bank rate had that morning been raised by \ per cent. This would demonstrate theGovernments determination to use a flexible Bank rate as an instrument of financial policy. It should also help to hold in checkany tendency towards inflation.Formosa. 4,   jy7e foreign Secretary said that arrangements were now in(Previous train for promoting a discussion in the Security Council on the reference: current situation in Quemoy and neighbouring islands off the ChinaC.C. (55) 6th coast. He had, however, been disturbed by the attitude of the united conclusions, States Government as evidenced by the last-minute changes which minute 2.) they had wished to make in those arrangements and by theproceedings in the Foreign Relations Committee of the Senate, where47686-3 B 2
they had been unwilling to accept a formula designed to show that military action by United States forces would be limited to the defenceof Formosa and the Pescadores. The Administration seemed to be running great risks of exposing themselves to the criticism that theirpolicy was designed, not so much to avoid an extension of hostilities in the Far East, as to enlist support for military action which theywere determined to take.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Estimates 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommittee. Financial Secretary, Treasury (C. (55) 25) covering a draft WhiteReport on Paper commenting on the views expressed in a Report on theForeign Foreign Service by the Select Committee&quot; on Estimates.  The draftService. White Paper had been prepared by a Committee of Junior Ministers(Previous        from the Treasury, Foreign Office and Ministry of Works, and reference:      represented the agreed views of these three Departments.C.C. (55) 5th The Cabinet expressed general approval of the terms of the draft conclusions, White Paper. They recognised, however, that it did not answer the minute 7.) wider question raised by Recommendation (4) of the SelectCommittee, namely, that &quot; urgent consideration should be given bythe House to the way in which proper supervision could be exercised by its Committees over the ever-increasing expenditure authorised by Parliament to be incurred in foreign territories,&quot; and that this wasa matter on which the Government were likely to find it necessary tostate their views at an early date.The Cabinet Approved the draft White Paper attached to C. (55) 25,and invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for it to be presented to Parliament by 31st January.National Coal 6.   The Cabinet were informed that Minister of Fuel and PowerBoard. had now received the report of the independent Committee underthe chairmanship of Dr. Alexander Fleck which had investigated theorganisation of the National Coal Board. The Committee had madea number of valuable suggestions. Most of these were addressedto the Board, which had appointed it. But the Committee had recommended that, as a pre-condition of the carrying out of its other recommendations, the Board itself should be so reconstituted thatin future each of its members would bear direct responsibility for aparticular branch of the Board&apos;s affairs. The Minister was thereforeanxious to proceed at once with the reconstitution of the Board sothat this could be completed before the report was published.The Cabinet expressed general approval of the lines on whichthe Minister proposed to reconstitute the Board. They recognised,however, that some difficulties might be encountered in carrying thisthrough and that it might on this account prove impracticable tocomplete the process before the report was published.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to proceed with hisplans for reconstituting the National Coal Board, inconsultation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.
5CC. 7 (55)Horror Comics. 7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home(Previous Secretary (C. (55) 23) covering the draft of a Bill to prevent the reference: publication and sale of publications commonly known as &quot; horrorCC. (54) 82nd   comics.&quot;Conclusions, The Cabinet expressed general support for the introduction of minute 3.)       legislation on the lines of the draft Bill before them.The Attorney-General made the following comments on particular provisions of the Bill:  (a) It was not certain that a single issue of the kind, of publicationat which the Bill was directed, considered by itself, could reasonably be held to &quot; tend to corrupt &quot;; it was rather the cumulative effect ofthese publications which was evil. He would like to consider further,in consultation with the Lord Chancellor, whether the terms of clause 1 could be modified to meet this point.(b) It seemed to him doubtful whether a court would feel justified in convicting on the ground that such publications tended&quot; to incite or encourage to the commission of crimes or acts of violence or cruelty.&quot; It was true that this passage in Clause 1 was followed by the more general words &quot; or otherwise to corrupt,&quot; butthe potential effectiveness of the clause might be increased if it werereinforced by some definition of &quot; corrupt.&quot;(c) One effect of the penalties at present provided under clause 2 would be that, where a defendant elected to go to trial,he would automatically be revealing that he had previously been convicted under the Act.The Cabinet-(1) Approved in principle the introduction of legislation on thelines of the draft Bill attached to C. (55) 23.(2) Agreed that detailed points on the draft Bill, including those&quot;raised by the Attorney-General in discussion, should beconsidered by the Legislation Committee.
