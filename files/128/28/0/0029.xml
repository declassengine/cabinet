Prince 6f 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeHanover. Secretary (C. (55) 15) about a claim to British nationality by PrinceClaim to British Ernst August of Hanover.Nationality. The memorandum explained that the Prince claimed british nationality by reason of his descent from Princess Sophia, Electressof Hanover, and by virtue of an Act of 1705 which provided thatPrincess Sophia and all persons lineally descending from her (exceptRoman Catholics) should be deemed to be natural-born Britishsubjects. In J952 the Prince had applied for a certificate of Britishcitizenship under Section 25 of the British Nationality Act, 1948,which empowered the Home Secretary to grant such a certificate inan individual case in which a doubt existed. The former HomeSecretary had then taken the view that the Prince&apos;s claim depend-ing, as it did, on the interpretation of an old statute affecting the- national status of large numbers of people would more appropriately be settled by a decision of a court of law than by an administrative discretion and he had declined to issue a certificate.The Prince had subsequently brought an action in the ChanceryDivision in which he claimed a declaration that he was a British. subject by virtue of the Act of 1705.It was explained to the Cabinet that, although the Attorney-General would be the nominal defendant to the action, he would.    -     regard it as his function, not to contest the claim, but to bring all relevant considerations to the notice of the court in order that it mightbe enabled to give a ruling.In discussion attention was drawn to certain possible legalconsequences of a declaration by the court that the Prince of Hanoverwas a British subject by virtue of the Act of 1705.  It was agreedthat these should be urgently examined before the action came before-the High Court on 14th February. ..,The Cabinet- - ..Invited the Home Secretary, in consultation with the Lord- Chancellor and the Attorney-General, to consider further,as a matter of urgency, the possible legal consequences ofa declaration by the Court that the Prince of Hanover was;.a British subject by virtue of the Act of 1705, and to reportto the Cabinet. &apos;.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,. 27th. January, J955.
