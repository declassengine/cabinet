The Minister, of Agriculture said that in the summer of 1954Review. there had been reason to hope that the level of Exchequer assistance(Previous to agriculture could be reduced in 1955. This had justified the reference: Cabinet Committee on Civil Expenditure in recommending that itCC. (55) 20th should be the Governments aim, in the next annual review of farmConclusions, prices, to reduce the level of Exchequer support to agriculture by minute 8.)        30 millions.   Since then the position had changed in three respects.First, farmers&apos; costs, which were then dropping, were now increasing;and this change represented an increase of  40 millions in the47778-2 b 2
estimated costs of the industry over the coming year. Secondly,there had been a sharp rise in imports of animal feeding-stuffs, andthe cost of these imports was likely to rise by another  28 millions in the coming year. Thirdly, the weather had been unfavourable.There had been a bad harvest and unfavourable conditions for wintersowing; and the frost was now seriously delaying the spring sowing.This might result in a loss of income amounting to  40 millions,through lower production. These factors had together had the resultthat, when the time came to review prices for the coming year, the farmers&apos; representatives had put forward claims calculated to increasethe producers&apos; incomes by  33 millions. The Economic PolicyCommittee, after considering the representations put forward onbehalf of the farmers in the course of the review, had decided that, inthe hope that an agreed settlement might be reached, the Governmentshould offer price guarantees and production grants which wouldhave the effect of increasing producers&apos; incomes by about  20 millions.At this stage in the discussions, however, the Councils of the national farmers&apos; Unions (N.F.Us.) had instructed their negotiators to demanda minimum increase of  28 millions. A small group of Ministers had met to consider the situation on the previous evening and had agreedthat, by minor adjustments of prices, particularly for milk and eggs,the figure of  20 millions previously approved by the economic policy Committee could be increased to  21-9 millions. TheGovernment were thus faced with the choice of imposing on the farmers a settlement involving an increase in producers&apos; incomes of 21-9 millions, or accepting an agreed settlement involving anincrease of  28 millions. The first course could be justified oneconomic grounds. But it would be bitterly opposed by theN.F.Us., who would certainly conduct an active campaign against theGovernment in the rural constituencies. In this they would probably have the support of the Labour Party, who would argue that theGovernment had failed to support agriculture in a particularly badseason. It had been suggested that, if such a settlement were imposed, it might be accompanied by an assurance that the positionwould be reviewed in the summer when it could be estimated moreexactly how far next year&apos;s production would suffer from severe weather conditions in the spring. The Minister feared, however, that,if such a review were held, he would be strongly pressed to restore thewhole of last year&apos;s cut of  15 millions in Government assistance towards cereals production, and that the eventual cost to theExchequer would be greater than that of accepting now an agreed settlement at the higher figure. The alternative was to clinch mattersnow by arriving at an agreed settlement involving an increaseof  28 millions in producers&apos; incomes. This would be a generoussettlement, which could not be justified on economic grounds alone.But it would command the support of the N.F.Us. and would avoid a difficult political situation.The Minister said that up to a late stage he had been inclined to favour the first course. But, on reflection, he was increasinglyconcerned about the dangers of coupling this with a promise tore-consider the position later in the summer. He was also influenced by the fact that, in their latest offer, the N.F.Us. had abandoned their demand for an increase of Id. a gallon in the price of milk and had indicated their readiness to accept an increase of only \d. on balance, therefore, he now considered that the better course would beto seek an agreed settlement on the basis of an increase of 28 millions.The Chancellor of the Exchequer-said that this situation con-fronted the Government with a very difficult choice. It was notpossible to justify, on economic grounds, a settlement at the higher figure. It would be particularly unsound to make the proposed increases in the price of milk and of eggs. Increased production of milk and eggs was not needed; and higher prices would tend to worsen
the balance of payments by increasing the demand for imported feeding-stuffs. While he agreed that some increase of producers&apos;incomes was needed in order to maintain the required level ofproduction, the lower figure of  21-9 millions would be ample forthat purpose. On more general grounds, an easy settlement with the farmers would be contrary to the main trend of economic policy atthe present time, which ought to be aimed at checking inflationarytendencies. From that point of view there might be advantage inchoosing this moment to impose a settlement on the farmers. On theother hand, he recognised that an imposed settlement at the lower figure would be hotly opposed by the farmers and that they might be moved by it to stir up ill-will against the Government in rural areas.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) There was no prospect of reaching an agreed settlement ona basis of some figure intermediate between  21-9 millions and 28 millions.(b) There was no doubt that farmers&apos; incomes in 1955 would be seriously affected by the unfavourable weather conditions of theautumn and spring; and this was a sound reason, which the public would understand, for granting a higher level of Exchequer assistancein the coming year than would otherwise have been justified. Indeed,it could be said that the farmers were facing two consecutive badseasons, since they had already had a bad harvest in 1954, and that a generous settlement was justified on that account.On the other hand, it was mainly this consideration which had led the Economic Policy Committee to raise the total figure from the 9 millions proposed by the Agricultural Departments to  20 millions.The lower of the two figures now suggested (viz.,  21-9 millions)would contain ample compensation for loss of income due to weather conditions.(c) Special objection was raised to the proposed increase in theprice of milk. The view was widely held that no further incentiveshould be given to increased production of milk. There was a real risk that, if milk prices continued to be fixed at a high level, therewould be surplus production and waste. Some Ministers felt that theproposed increases in the prices of milk and eggs would be moredifficult to justify than the total of the proposed Exchequer assistanceto the industry.As against this it was argued that the increased cost of milk production represented \\d. a gallon, and a price increase of %d. a gallon would not therefore increase the incentive to milk production.Moreover, the regular income from milk was of special value to small farmers; and it was they who would be in greatest need of financial help in overcoming the difficulties arising from two consecutive badseasons. This consideration might outweigh the economic objectionsto an increase in the price of milk.(d) There was general agreement that it would be dangerous tooffer to review the position again in the summer. A further review was likely to involve the Exchequer in much larger expenditure.But, now that this possibility had been mentioned to the farmers&apos;representatives, it would be difficult to impose a settlement without some promise of a further review.(e) The practice of seeking an agreed settlement with the farmers&apos;representatives was costly to the Exchequer. This method of conducting the negotiations at the annual reviews had the result thatthe farmers were able to extract from the Government more than theywere justified in obtaining on economic grounds alone. This situation would continue until the Government showed that they wereprepared, on a suitable occasion, to impose a settlement. There was,however, general agreement that this was not a suitable occasion onwhich to take such a stand. This could be better done earlier in the lifetime of a Parliament.
Further discussion showed that the balance of opinion in theCabinet was in favour of seeking an agreed settlement with the farmers&apos; representatives, even though this involved an increase of 28 millions in producers&apos; incomes. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that, if this course were taken, he would be obligedto look for other means of checking the inflationary tendencies whichwere at work in the national economy.The Cabinet -(1) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to seek an agreed settlement with the farmers&apos; representatives, in the annual review of farm prices, on the basis of a schedule of price guarantees and production grants which would have theeffect of increasing producers&apos; incomes by  28 millions.(2) Authorised the Minister of Agriculture to announce thesettlement, if it had been reached by then, in a statement in the House of Commons on 10th March, and to present to Parliament later that day a White Paper on the annual review of the Agricultural Industry and Determination of guarantees.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture to settle the terms of his proposed statement in consultation with the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer.coal production.The St. Leger.(previous reference:C.C. (53) 35thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (55) 63) covering a copy of a letter addressed to the PrimeMinister by the Senior Steward of the Jockey Club regarding thedate of the St. Leger.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he was ready to fall in with the proposal of the Stewards of the Jockey Club that in 1955and 1956 the St. Leger should be run on the traditional day,Wednesday. If it were proved that this resulted in a loss of coal production, the Jockey Club would then agree that the race should thereafter be run on a Saturday.In discussion no objection was raised to this proposal.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to accept theproposal of the Stewards of the Jockey Club that the st. Leger should be run on a Wednesday in 1955 and 1956.Coa! Prices. 5.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposal to(Previous increase coal prices, on the basis of the further memorandum by the reference:      Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (55) 61).C.C. (55) 2.1st The Cabinet reviewed the economic arguments for and againstConclusions, increases in coal prices, having regard to the effect on the cost of minute 3.) living, and consequently on wage demands, and also on the balanceof payments. In the latter connection it was pointed out that,although the question of maintaining a high level of coal exports would have to be decided in the light of the long-term prospects forsatisfying overseas markets without having to import considerable quantities of dearer coal, it was not possible to reduce further the levelof coal exports for which commitments had already been made in thecurrent year.There was general agreement that the coal industry was failing to play its proper part in the national economy. Higher coal prices were not an acceptable substitute for increased production and greater
7CC. 22 (55)efficiency. In this connection, the Cabinet were informed that thenew National Coal Board had now accepted almost all the recommen-dations of the independent advisory committee which had recentlyreviewed the organisation of the industry. Although the reformswhich would be adopted would not lead to significant results for sometime, this was an indication that the present Board was likely to bemore effective.It was, however, suggested that the new Board had put forward the proposals for price increases without having taken time to give full consideration to all the problems involved. The Government shouldnot discourage the Board by refusing to allow price increases whichwere necessary on commercial grounds. But the Board could resonably be asked to give further thought to the total amount of therevenue to be obtained from price increases and to the incidence ofthe increases.The Board could be informed that it was the view of theGovernment that the total effect of any price increases should not be such as to result in a conspicuous surplus which might sharpen thedemand for wage increases. As regards the incidence of the increases, the Board might be left to make such proposals as they thought best even though this might mean that they would proposesome increase in the price of the lower grades of house coal.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to ask the national coal Board to reconsider, on the lines indicated in thediscussion, their proposals for increasing coal prices.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th March, 1955.
