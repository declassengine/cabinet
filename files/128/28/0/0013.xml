naval construction programme.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)17692-2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the FirstLord of the Admiralty (C. (55) 32) on the naval construction programme.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that, in accordance withlong-established custom, he was submitting the naval construction programme for the Cabinet&apos;s approval. The programme formed partof the general defence programme, which had been thoroughlyexamined by the Minister of Defence and by Committees of Ministersbefore being approved by the Cabinet and formed the basis for determing the allocation of defence expenditure in the next financialyear. His paper had three main purposes. First, it sought approval for the programme of new construction in 1955 of vessels of existingdesign armed with conventional weapons, set out in paragraph 2.This programme was the minimum which would make adequate provision for modern ships to replace older vessels and maintain areasonable level of employment in the yards alfected. In order toprovide enough work for the smaller shipyards, he was proposing to-1 b 2Formosa. I.   The Foreign Secretary said that he was increasingly disturbed(Previous        by the risk that the United States Administraion would commitReference:      themselves to support the continued occupation of Quemoy and theC.C. (55) 10th   Matsu Islands by Chinese Nationalist Forces.   The AdministrationConclusions,     were being led to believe, by reports from their representatives in-Minute 4.) .    Moscow and elsewhere, that the Russians were ready to support the peking Government in an offensive policy; and this made themreluctant to make any move which might be interpreted as a gesture ofappeasement. It was also known to be the view of some of the senior..   military advisers in Washington that the recent Government changesin Moscow had reduced the likelihood that the Soviet Governmentwould risk a major war, and that the United States could thereforeafford to take a very firm line in the Far East.   Against this generalbackground it was disturbing to learn, from Washington telegramNo. 414, that the Administration were thinking of making a public declaration of their policy which would imply that, in present circum-stances at any rate, some of the coastal islands were regarded bythem as necessary for the defence of Formosa.In discussion there was general agreement ,with the foreign secretary&apos;s view that the United States Government would not be ableto command the support of large sections of world opinion if at thisstage they publicly committed themselves to a policy which might involve them in giving active support to the Chinese Nationalists inQuemoy and the Matsus. The Prime Minister said that it suited the communists&apos; purpose to divide Western opinion on this question, andthe United States Government would be falling into an obvious trapif they made a public declaration which had the effect of dividingthat opinion still further. Peking&apos;s threats to seize Formosa by force were idle words: in fact it would be quite impossible for the chinese communists to mount an effective attack against Formosa in the face of United States opposition. It was, therefore, both unnecessary andunwise for the United States Government to make any public declaration implying that they paid serious attention to these threats.The Foreign Secretary read to the Cabinet a draft of a message on this question which he was proposing to send to the United states secretary of State. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of thesubstance of a personal message which he was proposing to send to president Eisenhower.The Cabinet Took note of these statements and approved the terms of the messages which the Prime Minister and the foreign secretary were proposing to send to Washington on thisquestion,
order ten of the twenty-four coastal minesweepers which the cabinet had authorised him to construct over a period of four years.Secondly, his paper sought covering approval for what remained ofthe new construction programmes of 1952, 1953 and 1954 after the constant adjustments which had been made necessary by successivereviews of defence policy.   This was set out in Appendix 1.   Thirdly,he sought authority to proceed with the preparation of detaileddesigns for the guided-weapons ships which in due course would replace the cruisers.   At first these ships would have a dual armamentcomprising a ship-to-air guided weapon system and a modern gunarmament.   They would be so designed, however, that the gunarmament could be replaced by the ship-to-ship guided weaponsystem when this became available.The following were the main points made in discussion:  (a) it was of special importance that early authority should begiven to proceed with the designing of the proposed guided-weaponsships. II this designing work were not pursued energetically, these vessels might not be ready for service when the first guided weaponsbecame available. By giving authority for designing to proceed,however, the Cabinet were not authorising the placing of orders forsuch vessels, which would require further specific authority.ib) There was a case for considering whether the-separatesubmission of the naval construction programme for the cabinet&apos;s approval, apart from the programmes of the other two Services,continued to serve any useful purpose or might be discontinued infuture years.The Cabinet Approved the proposals for naval construction contained inC. (55) 32.

Offices.New ColonialOfficeBuilding.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 90thConclusions,Minute 6.)\L\0Commercial 5.   -phe Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePolicy. President of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 40) on the position reached(Previous in the Review of the General Agreement on Tariffs and TradeReference: (G.A.T.T.) in Geneva.C.C. (54) 29th The memorandum set out four requirements necessary for a conclusions, satisfactory conclusion to the negotiations.  These were:  Minute 4.) ^ .^ provision designed to give some flexibility to meet the review of the   needs of the Colonies.G.A.T.T. (ii) Equal rights with other European countries to continueexisting quota restrictions to protect particularly difficult items for aperiod after balance of payments difficulties had ended; and the rightto maintain existing discrimination in these quotas.4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofWorks (C. (55) 2) and by the Minister of Housing (C. (55) 33) on thescheme for building a new Colonial Office on the site of the oldWestminster Hospital.The Colonial Secretary said that, in view of the urgent need tore-house his Department in adequate premises, he hoped that theCabinet would reaffirm their decision of 28th July, 1954, to proceedwith this building on the Westminster site.In discussion, it was generally agreed that new accommodation for the Colonial Office was necessary, but it was suggested that this need not be on the scale envisaged, and that it would suffice to providea smaller building, of dignified design and construction, even if this meant that some parts of the Colonial Office would be accommodatedelsewhere. A new building on these lines could be erected on someother site, such as Richmond Terrace, if it were desired to leave the westminster site vacant.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the WestminsterHospital site and the accommodation already constructed there belowground represented an investment of nearly  H millions. Moreover,steps had already been taken to proceed with the building inpursuance of the decision of 28th July, 1954. Thus, tenders hadalready been invited for the steel work.The view was also expressed that there would be no advantage in leaving the Westminster Hospital site vacant except as part of a plan for creating a much wider open space extending from the Central Hallto the Houses of Parliament and from Great George Street to West-minster Abbey. This would be a much more expensive project andmight cost  4^-5 millions. A particular difficulty was that the chartered Surveyors were planning to rebuild on the site oftheir present building in Parliament Square, and were expectedshortly to seek the advice of the Minister of Works about a suitablearchitect: if their project was to be prevented or delayed, it wouldbe necessary for the Government to disclose their intention to create a greater Parliament Square.It was further suggested that, even if it were decided to build onthe Westminster site, it would be wrong to erect a larger building than was absolutely necessary. It would be best to confine the new building to an area little more than that occupied by the oldStationery Office. Objection could also be taken to the proposed new building on account of its height. On the other hand, it waspointed out that the Royal Fine Art Commission had not raised this objection, and that the height as planned was very much less thanthat of the dome of the Central Hall.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.
(iii) Agreement by the United States that the general arrange-ments relating to their waiver permitting agricultural quotas shouldbe subject to review in 1960 or earlier.(iv) Inclusion in the record of the G.A.T.T. Review of astatement enabling United Kingdom Ministers to say that, in thelast resort, general discrimination against a scarce currency could beauthorised under the waiver procedure.The President of the Board of Trade said that it was desirablethat we should obtain satisfaction on these points in order to ease the political difficulties of presenting the revised G.A.T.T. toParliament. The leader of the United Kingdom delegation had returned to London for consultation; and, if these requirements wereto be obtained, he should be given instructions on them as soon aspossible. The chances of obtaining the requirements would be much improved if our delegation could say that the United KingdomGovernment would be prepared to recommend the revised agreement to Parliament if our needs on these four points were met.The Colonial Secretary said that it was specially important thatthe Government should be able to show that they had done everything possible to secure that the revised G.A/T.T. contained adequate provision to meet the special needs of the Colonies. Although it now seemed that the general provision which We had orginallyproposed for this purpose would not be accepted by other countries,and that we should have to rely on a waiver to meet particularColonial difficulties, it might be best to continue to press the original proposal and be beaten on it in order to show that we had done our best for the Colonies.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th February, 1955.
