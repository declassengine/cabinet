Industrial The Minister of Labour said that he had now received the disputes.        interim report of the Court of Inquiry which he had appointed toRailways.       inquire into the railway wages dispute.   In this report the Court(Previous        made critical comments on the conduct of both parties to the dispute.Reference:      They criticised the National Union of Railwaymen (N.U.R.) force.C. (54) 92nd   rejecting a wages agreement which they had ratified and for issuingConclusions,    strike notices before they had exhausted the normal processes of minute 3.)       wage negotiation and arbitration.   They criticised the transport commission both for delays in the earlier stages of the negotiation and for relying on the argument that their statutory obligation tomake the railways pay could prevent them from conceding wage claims which they recognised as valid and desirable.   The Courtconcluded that this argument was undesirable in this nationalised industry and unsound in the light of the figures provided by theTransport Commission, and they recommended that the commission should not continue, to rely on it.  They considered that there wasa case for re-examining all wage rates for conciliation grades coveredby the wages agreement of October 1954 and recommended that negotiations should at once be resumed between the parties, at thelevel at which they had been broken off, and pressed forward with a sense of urgency. They added, however, that negotiations could notbe so resumed unless the threat of strike action was first withdrawn.The Minister said that publication of this report would givethe N.U.R. an opportunity to resume negotiations, if they were inthe mood to do so. It therefore offered a hope that the threatenedstrike might be averted. In any event it would help to restoreconn dence in the normal processes of wage negotiation.The Minister said that the report was being printed and wouldbe published in the course of the following day. He would sendcopies to the N.U.R. and the Transport Commission early in the morning and would invite them both to meet him later in the day.He would then urge them to accept the report as a basis for resumingnegotiations.Copies of a summary of the Courfs conclusions were handed round at the Cabinet.The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the obligation ofthe Transport Commission to make the railways pay &quot; taking oneyear with another&quot; and the bearing of that obligation on theCommission^ capacity to meet a particular wages claim. From thepoint of view of averting the immediate threat of a strike, it washelpful that the Court of Inquiry should have concluded that theCommission had been mistaken in their view that this obligationmight preclude them from conceding wages claims which they considered to be justified on their merits. On the other hand, it was undesirable that the impression should be created that themanagement of a nationalised industry had a duty to pay what they considered to be fair and reasonable wages without regard to thefinancial capacity of the undertaking to meet the resulting charge.Much turned on the interpretation of the phrase &quot; taking one year with another.&quot; While it had never been the Governments viewthat this phrase should be interpreted narrowly, the transport commission would not be justified in continuing to operate with alarge and increasing deficit unless they had reasonable grounds for believing that, on a long view, the railways could be put in a positionin which they would pay their way and yield profits to wipe out the accumulated deficit.On this point The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while he would be strongly opposed to the grant of a Government subsidy to the railways, he believed that the Transport Commission would bejustified at the present time in incurring an increased deficit on their current operations. Their plans for modernising the railways, the promise of greater flexibility in freight charges and the economiesto be secured by a redeployment of railway manpower, taken together, offered them prospects of making the railways profitable
in the long term which would justify them in accepting an increaseddeficit for a further period. On the other hand, he was doubtfulwhether the Government should take the initiative in pressing thisview on the Transport Commission; and he was still more doubtfulwhether it would be wise for the Government to make any public statement to this effect at the present stage. It would be preferable that the Commission should first deal with the current wages claim on its merits and, having made whatever settlement they thoughtproper, should then ask whether the Government concurred in their view that their long-term prospects would justify them in accepting the increased deficit on current operations which the wages settlement would involve. At the present stage it should be the Government^first objective to uphold the recognised procedures of wagenegotiation. Concessions should not be made under threat of astrike. But, if the strike notices were withdrawn and negotiationsresumed, there would be a case for some general increase in railway wages.In further discussion there was support for the view that theGovernment would be well advised to avoid volunteering at thisstage any public statement on the question whether the long-termprospects of the railways were such as to justify acceptance of anincreased deficit on their current operations. It would also be preferable that the Government should avoid being drawn into public controversy on the question whether the Transport Commission^obligation to make the railways pay &quot; taking one year with another &quot;would prevent them from conceding any particular wages claim.At this stage it should be enough for the Government to say thatthey accepted the report of the Court of Inquiry and that, in their view, it contained nothing which was inconsistent with the provisionsof the Transport Act, 1947.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) At an earlier meeting the Cabinet had been informed thatit was doubtful whether the N.U.R. could substantiate a claim thatrailwaymen in the lower grades were substantially less well paidthan persons in comparable occupations in other industries. TheCourt of Inquiry had, however, concluded that there was substance in the railwaymen&apos;s claim. Moreover, within the last few days publicopinion had clearly shifted in the railwaymen&apos;s favour, and therewas now a widespread feeling that railwaymen in the lower gradeswere not adequately paid. This change in public opinion was probably due to the skill with which the railwaymen&apos;s case had beenput forward on the first day of the public hearings before the Courtof Inquiry. Though the Court had said that the pay of the higher grades was particularly in need of review, there was now substantialpublic sympathy for railwaymen in the lower grades.(b) If all-round increases were to be made in railway wages,it was important that some satisfactory assurance should be obtainedthat the men would co-operate in measures for the more efficientemployment of labour on the railways. Progress in that directionwas urgently needed in order to balance, not only an increase in wages, but also the prospective capital investment in the plan forre-organising the railways. It might be desirable that, some form ofpublic inquiry should be held into the use of manpower on therailways.(c) The Cabinet were informed of the steps which would haveto be taken to maintain essential services if the efforts to avert a railway stoppage proved unsuccessful. Emergency powers wouldbe needed from the outset, and a Proclamation of Emergency shouldbe made under the Emergency Powers Act, 1920, as soon as itwas clear that there was no hope of averting the strike. If such a proclamation were made, Parliament would have to be re-convenedwithin five days. If the strike notices were not withdrawn, it was contemplated that the Proclamation would be made on 7th january and that Parliament would re-assemble on 12th January.
3 1Cabinet Office, S.W.1,4th January, 1955.The Cabinet-(1) Took note that the Minister of Labour would arrange forthe interim report of the Court of Inquiry to be published on the following day, and would invite the parties to thedispute to discuss its conclusions with him during thecourse of that day.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to inform therepresentatives of the National Union of railwaymen and of the British Transport Commission, when he sawthem on the following day, that the Government acceptedthe report of the Court of Inquiry and that, in their view,it contained nothing which was inconsistent with theprovisions of the Transport Act, 1947.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to arrange that a statement in the terms of Conclusion (2) above would be includedin the communique issued to the Press at the conclusionof his meeting with representatives of the National Unionof Railwaymen and of the British Transport Commission.
