The cabinet agreed that, if those efforts were successful, the basis of democratic government in this country would be gravely threatened and the resulting situation would call for drastic action.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Minister of Labour.Austria. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that an Austrian delegation was(Previous        about to visit Moscow for discussions with the Soviet government reference:       on matters of direct concern to Austria.

This declaration, the text of which was contained in ForeignOffice telegram No. 89 to Vienna, would be communicated to theAustrian Government that day and published on 6th April.The Cabinet Took note with approval of this statement.China- 3.

It was understood that Mr. Winnington was(Previous        about to travel from China to Indonesia to attend the forthcomingReference:       Afro-Asian Conference as a representative of the Daily Worker.CC.

There was, however, no power to arrest him in minute 6.)       either of those territories with a view to criminal proceedings.  the statements about his conduct which had been published in the reporton the treatment of British prisoners captured in Korea had been based on information provided by prisoners themselves, but it was doubtful whether they would be ready to provide further evidence on which criminal proceedings might be based.   In order to demonstrate, however, that the Government had taken all measuresopen to them, he would like to arrange for the police to institutefurther enquiries into the activities of both Mr. Winnington andMr. Shapiro in Korea, even though these further enquiries mighthave the result of casting doubts upon the reliability of some of the statements made in the report.The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Winnington&apos;s passport hadbeen impounded in 1954, and that it was open to the authorities in hong Kong and in Singapore to refuse him leave to enter theterritory. It was the general view of the Cabinet that steps shouldbe taken to ensure that such leave would be refused.
Some doubt was expressed whether, in the circumstances described, it would be advantageous to institute further enquiries witha view to criminal proceedings against these two men. It was,however, the general view of the Cabinet that the enquiries proposedby the Attorney-General should be made.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Colonial Secretary to instruct the Governors of hong Kong and Singapore that Mr. Alan Winningtonshould be refused permission to pass through eitherterritory in transit to Indonesia.(2) Authorised the Attorney-General to arrange for further enquiries to be made with the object of ascertaining wether evidence could be obtained on which to basecriminal proceedings against Mr. Winnington andMr. Shapiro.4. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a Question, to be askedon the following day by Mr. S. T. Swingler, M.P., enquiring whetherthe Government would propose the appointment of a SelectCommittee on the Naval Discipline Act.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that the procedure of preliminary review by a Select Committee had facilitated the passageof legislation amending the disciplinary codes of the Army and theRoyal Air Force. In the light of this experience he was willing thatthe same procedure should be adopted for the review of the naval discipline Act and, subject to the Cabinefs concurrence, he proposedto answer Mr. Swinglefs Question in the affirmative.The Cabinet Authorised the First Lord of the Admiralty to invite theHouse of Commons to appoint a Select Committee on theNaval Discipline Act and to reply in this sense to theQuestion which was to be put to him by Mr. S. T. Swingler8M.P., on 6th April.5. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the week after the Easter recess.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budget on19th April, and it was expected that the debate on the Budgetresolutions would be completed by 25th April.6. The Prime Minister said that he intended to submit his resignation to Her Majesty at an audience that afternoon. his resignation would carry with it the resignation of the wholeAdministration. Other Ministers need not tender their resignationsto The Queen, but they should regard their offices as at the disposalof his successor. Meanwhile they should carry on the necessaryadministration of their Departments until a new Government was formed. Ministers of Cabinet rank who were not members of theCabinet would be so informed at a meeting which he was holdinglater in the day. Junior Ministers would be similarly informed byletter.The Prime Minister said that it remained for him to wish hiscolleagues all good fortune in the difficult, but hopeful, situationwhich they had to face. He trusted that they would be enabled tofurther the progress already made in rebuilding the domestic stability and economic strength of the United Kingdom and in weaving stillmore closely the threads which bound together the countries of theCommonwealth or, as he still preferred to call it, the Empire.
The Foreign Secretary said that his Cabinet colleagues had asked him to speak on this occasion on behalf of them all. It therefore fell to him to express their sense of abiding affection and esteem for thePrime Minister and their pride in the privilege of having served ashis colleagues. He himself had enjoyed this privilege for sixteenyears, others for varying shorter periods; but all, whatever the lengthof their service, had the same strong feelings of affection for him. if in a succeeding Government they met with success, this would be largely due to the example which he had shown them: if they didless well, it would be because they had failed to learn from his experience and skill as a statesman. They wo^id remember himalways for his magnanimity, for his courage at all times and for hisunfailing humour, founded in his unrivalled mastery of the english language. They would always be grateful for his leadership, and forhis friendship, over the years that had passed; and they would hope to enjoy in future his continuing interest and support in theirendeavours.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,5th April, 1955.
