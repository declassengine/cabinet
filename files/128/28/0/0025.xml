european defence and^Four-power meeting.(previous reference:CC. (55) 24thConclusions,Minute 1.)1. The Cabinet took note of a telegram from Her Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington (Washington telegram No 568)reporting the preliminary views of the United States Secretary ofState on the message which the Foreign Secretary had sent to him in pursuance of the Cabinets decision of the previous day.Mr. Dulles was to discuss the matter further with president eisenhower. It seemed unlikely, however,. that either of them wascontemplating an early Four-Power Meeting with the RussiansParliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.They took note that in the Statement on Business on 17th Marchit would be announced that Parliament would be adjourned for the easter recess from 7th to 19th April, and that the Chancellor of theI Exchequer would open his Budget on 19th April.(DuBoHmailImmigrants.(previous reference:CC. (55) 15thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet were informed that at the meeting of theCentral Council of Conservative Associations on the following dayattention would be drawn to the problems arising from the increasingimmigration into the United Kingdom of coloured workers from colonial territories. The resolution which was to be movedsuggested that powers might be taken to permit the deportation fromthis country of undesirable persons belonging to other Common-wealth countries but did not propose legislation to control immigration. On this latter point opinion in the Conservative party was divided.The Cabinet agreed that this resolution would provide a usefulopportunity for ventilating the conflicting views which were held onthis subject. There would be no need for the Government to give any indication of their attitude on this occasion. It should suffice to say that the Government were giving urgent and anxiousconsideration to these problems. It could be left to the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, who would be attending the meeting as chairman of the Party, to decide at the time whether he should makea brief intervention or whether a statement should be made by ajunior Minister from the Home Office.Raw Materials.Newsprint.(previous reference:CC. (54) 24thConclusions,Minute 4.)497024. The President of the Board of Trade said that currentcriticism in certain newspapers of the Governments handling of theproblem of newsprint supply was unwarranted. Last year theGovernment had sanctioned an increase of 50,000 tons a year in imports of newsprint, and since the autumn negotiations had been proceeding between the newspapers, the home newsprint mills andother parties concerned about a voluntary scheme which wouldenable the Government to discontinue the statutory control over thedistribution of newsprint and the size of newspapers. As part ofsuch a scheme the Government had indicated their willingness toagree that, up to the end of 1958, annual imports of newsprint shouldbe at the rate of 500,000 tons, which was 50,000 tons more than thepresent rate. They had also expressed their readiness to consider sympathetically any request from the newspapers for an annual increase in the rate of imports from 1956 onwards of from 50,000 to100,000 tons. Independently of these negotiations the newspapershad asked the Government to allow an increase of half a page in the size of newspapers, and it was this request which he had refused,B 2
LocalGovernmentReform.(previous reference:C.C. (54) 28thConclusions,Minute 9.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Housing and Local Government (C. (55) 71) seeking approval of a statement which he proposed to make in the House ofCommons on the reform of local government organisation.The Minister of Housing and Local Government said that inview of the statement which his predecessor had made on this subject in the House of Commons in the Second Reading debate on theLuton Corporation Bill on 18th March, 1954, he had been obligedto explore the possibilities of making some progress in the matter before further Private Bills to secure County Borough status cameforward in the present session. . He had been greatly encouraged byhis initial discussions with representatives of the Local authority associations and, at their request, had presided over a series offurther meetings between them. These discussions had resulted inagreement on proposals covering a number of the main issues uponwhich local authorities had previously been divided. He had,however, fully reserved the Governments position in respect of theagreement thus reached and, so far as concerned the redistribution of functions, the Local Authority Associations had still to reach agreement between themselves. There was, however, a fair prospect that, if he were now to make a statement on the lines of the draft in annex B to his paper, the Corporations of Ilford, Luton and Poolewould agree to withdraw their Private Bills seeking County Boroughstatus, which were due to come forward for Second Reading in theHouse of Commons at an early date. The Minister said that, since he had circulated his paper, the draft statement had been considered further by the Local Government Reform Committee and amended in certain respects. He now sought authority to make the proposed statement in the form which the Committee had finally approved.Copies of this revised statement were handed round.The Lord Privy Seal confirmed that the Local GovernmentReform Committee were satisfied that, in the circumstances whichhad arisen, the right course was for the Minister to make a statement in Parliament on the lines which the Committee had approved.partly to avoid jeopardising the prospects of agreement oh a voluntary scheme of control, and partly because the extra half pagewould be likely to prevent stocks of newsprint being raised to thefigure of 100,000 tons which was considered to be the minimum necessary if such a scheme was to be introduced successfully. Hewould, however, be ready to agree to some increase in the size of newspapers if a change in the attitude of the newspaper interestsshould appear to make this desirable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the attitude of someof the newspapers towards this question was highly irresponsible.The Government had treated the newspapers generously, havingregard to the state of our balance of payments.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that theGovernments action in this matter should be directed towardspromoting early agreement on the proposed voluntary scheme whichwould enable the Government to discontinue the statutory control.The Cabinet Authorised the President of the Board of Trade to agree toan increase of half a page in the size of newspapers if andwhen it appeared to him likely that such a concession would assist in promoting the proposed voluntary scheme for controlling the distribution and consumption of newsprint.
CA^S  JES\In discussion there was support for the view that theGovernment should try to consolidate the unexpected measure ofagreement which the Minister had succeeded in promoting, and thatthe proposed statement should achieve this object. On the otherhand, certain features of the agreement reached between the LocalAuthority Associations for example, the suggested provision for thewithdrawal of County Borough and Chartered Borough status incertain cases, and the proposals for redistribution of functions were likely to arouse strong local feeling or to involve difficulties for ministers responsible for the various services administered by localauthorities. It was therefore desirable that any statement which theMinister might make at this stage should be framed in the broadestpossible terms.In discussion of the draft statement it was suggested that paragraph 9 might well be shortened, and might omit any specific reference to the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Secretary ofState for Scotland. It was further agreed that the proposed statement was more suitable for circulation in reply to a writtenQuestion than for oral delivery.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Governmentto circulate at an early date, in reply to a writtenParliamentary Question, a statement in the terms of thedraft before the Cabinet, subject to modification ofparagraph 9 on the lines suggested in discussion.United Nations.general assembly of1956.(previous reference:GC. (55) 15thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet considered a Note by the Minister of State forForeign Affairs (C. (55) 68) submitting the report of a Committee ofMinisters which had considered what practical steps would need tobe taken to provide the necessary meeting placeaccommodation to enable the General Assembly of the united nations to be held in London in 1956.There was general agreement in the Cabinet that theGovernment would be ill-advised to pursue further the possibility of inviting the United Nations to hold its General Assembly in london in 1956. It would be difficult to justify expenditure of  3-3^ millions on the erection of temporary conference buildings, and it was alsoplain that sufficient suitable hotel accommodation could not be madeavailable without serious disruption of tourist traffic. There was,however, support for the view that further thought should be givento the possibility of arranging for the erection of a permanentconference centre either on the South Bank site or on some other sitein central London. This would ensure that, on a future occasion, theGovernment of the day would be able to invite the United nations with confidence to hold a meeting of their General Assembly inLondon. It was recognised that the full value of a permanentconference centre would not be secured if London continued to be short of first-class hotel accommodation. In present conditionsprivate concerns were showing a marked reluctance to invest new capital in the hotel business.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the suggestion that facilities might be offered for the holding in London of the General Assembly ofthe United Nations in 1956 should not be furtherpursued.(2) Invited the Minister of Works to arrange for a study to bemade of the possibilities of erecting a permanentconference centre in central London, and to report theresults of this study to the Cabinet in due course.
/    )Civil Aviation.Comet Aircraft.(previous reference:CC. (54) 2ndConclusions,Minute 8.)7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed with the Secretary of State for Air, the Minister of Supply and the,Minister of Civil Aviation the future of the second and third Marksof Comet aircraft. He now recommended, with their concurrence,that in order to make good the delay in production caused by theaccidents to Comet I aircraft, the De Havilland aircraft company should proceed at once to the production of the Comet III and that,to facilitate this, the Government should buy nineteen of theComet IIs. It was proposed that these, after modification, should beused mainly by R.A.F. Transport Command for carrying troops and freight and by the Ministry of Supply for test purposes, and that oneof them should be sold to B.O.A.C. for training. The rest of theComet IIs, of which about forty-four were in various stages of construction, would be scrapped. These proposals would enableDe Havilland&apos;s to concentrate on the rapid construction of theComet III which could then be available in 1958 and should be ableto compete successfully with the new American aircraft which wouldthen be in production.In discussion it was pointed out that the use of Comet IIs for thetransport of Servicemen and their families might arouse some criticism, on the ground that the aircraft were not consideredsatisfactory for commercial use. But they would not be used forthese purposes unless a certificate of air-worthiness was given inrespect of them.It was the view of the Cabinet that the decision not to produceComet Us&apos;for commercial purposes should be presented as necessaryin order to speed up the production of Comet Ills. If it were sopresented and if the Comet IIs obtained a certificate of air-worthiness, the decision to use Comet IIs for the transport of servicemen could be justified. If the Comet IIs obtained a certificate of air-worthiness, the cost of buying the number required for transport Command and other purposes would be borne on Votes.But if they failed to secure a certificate of air-worthiness, other meanswould have to be devised of giving financial assistance to theDe Havilland aircraft company.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals, outlined by the Chancellor of theExchequer, for the Governments purchase of nineteenComet IIs, in order to enable the De Havilland aircraftcompany to proceed at once to the production of Comet Ills.Railways. \ 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the(Previous Minister of Transport (C. (55) 66) covering the draft of a railwayReference: merchandise charges scheme, with an explanatory memorandum,CC. (55) 8th which the British Transport Commission proposed to submit to theConclusions,     Transport Tribunal.Minute 7.) Minister of Transport said that this draft scheme wasMerchandise designed to give effect to the provisions contained in the transport charges Act, 1953, which allowed the Commission greater freedom inScheme. charging for the carriage of merchandise on the railways.  When thedraft scheme was submitted to them, the Tribunal would publish itand would hold a public inquiry at which any objections would be heard before the draft scheme was confirmed or modified. Thiswould take several months, and no variation in railway merchandisecharges would be made as a result of this scheme until it had beenapproved by the Tribunal.Under the Railways Act, 1921, the Minister of Transport was entitled to be represented and heard at the proceedings of theTribunal. In view, however, of his power under the Transport Act,1947, to give directions to the Commission in matters which appearedto affect the national interest, the Minister proposed that he shouldnot be formally represented at the TribunaFs hearings on this
transport charges.(previous references:C.C. (54) 8thConclusions,Minute 7 andC.C.(54)24thConclusions,Minute 1.)occasion. This would leave him free to use his powers of direction,if necessary, when the Tribunal had come to a decision.The Cabinet (1) Took note of C. (55) 66; and agreed that the Minister ofTransport should not be formally represented at the inquiry by the Transport Tribunal into the draft railwaymerchandise charges scheme.The Cabinet also had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Transport (C. (55) 67) reporting certain interim increases in transport charges which were proposed by the British transport commission.The Minister of Transport said that the financial position of therailways was becoming increasingly difficult. Railway costs,including maintenance and central charges, had increased by 52f millions since the beginning of 1954. The Commissionestimated that they would be adding to their deficit at the rate ofabout  1 million a week if no increases were made in fares and freight charges. They hoped to save  15 millions a year in the future by certain further economies. They proposed to increase railway freight rates and dock and canal charges so as to yield additional revenue of 17/7 millions a year, to increase passenger fares to obtain a further 6-8 millions a year and to make increased charges for road transport of goods and passengers to produce a further  2-5 millions.The total increased annual revenue to be obtained from theseproposals was  27 millions. Even with these increases, and with the saving from new economies, the Commission would still be runninginto deficit at the rate of  9 millions a year, without taking intoaccount any further rise in coal prices.The Minister said that the Commission had to obtain his authority, under the Transport Act, 1947, for the increases proposedin railway freight and dock and canal charges, and that before he made the necessary Regulations he would have to consult thepermanent members of the Transport Tribunal acting as a consultative Committee. He had no control over the increases in passenger fares other than his power to give a direction, underSection 4 of the Transport Act, 1947, in relation to matters affectingthe national interest. The Commission already had power toincrease ordinary passenger fares on main line railways by 1\ percent., but would have to make application to the Transport tribunal for the rest of the increases they now proposed in passenger fares.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) It was suggested that further details of the financial positionof the Commission should be made available to the Cabinet. these should show, in particular, what proportion of the estimated totaldeficit was attributable to depreciation. It was also not clear to what extent the increase in maintenance, estimated at  14 millions, was dueto a change in accounting practice.(b) It was, however, plain that, unless some increase in charges were made, the Commission^ deficit would be bound to increase, andthis would lead to a demand for a subsidy.(c) As regards the timing of any increases in charges, it waspointed out that the increases in passenger fares, for which theapproval of the Transport Tribunal was necessary, would be dealtwith under the special procedure of Section 23 of the Transport Act,1953. If these proposals were approved, it was likely that the increases in passenger fares would come into effect at the end ofApril.(d) It was suggested that the increases proposed in railway freight and dock and canal charges would not have any great effecton the general public. These increases would have tq be referred tothe permanent members of the Transport Tribunal; and it might be preferable to avoid any announcement about increases in passenger fares (the major burden of which seemed to fall on the London area)
until the increases in freight, dock and canal charges could also be announced.The Cabinet (2) Invited the Minister of Transport to circulate further detailsof the financial position of the British transport commission.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question in thefollowing week.United States 9.   The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the PresidentAid to of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 72), and by the Minister of TransportPakistan. (C. (55) 73) on a scheme of United States aid for Pakistan.The Cabinet were informed that part of the aid which the UnitedStates were proposing to give to Pakistan was to take the form of a transaction under which Pakistan would import cotton textiles from third countries free of cost to her, payment for the textiles being madeby free supply of surplus American cotton. The United kingdom manufacturers had tendered for the supply of these textiles and hoped to obtain business variously estimated to be worth between$2 millions and $5 millions. It was, however, a condition of theproposed transaction, under United States cargo preferencelegislation, that 50 per cent, of the imports of raw cotton must becarried in United States ships. The Economic Policy Committee had considered this requirement in relation to United States aidtransactions generally, and had decided lhat the requirement shouldbe accepted where the transaction resulted in direct aid to the UnitedKingdom or to a Colony; and that, where the aid transactionbenefited a third country, each case would have to be decided on its merits. i%. The President of the Board of Trade said that this transactionwould enable Lancashire manufacturers to obtain orders they would otherwise not receive and that, unless the United Kingdomparticipated in the scheme, there might be a temporary stoppage ofall textile exports from this country to Pakistan. The transactionwas, moreover, one which gave direct aid to a relatively poorCommonwealth country. In any case, about half the cotton cargoesfrom the United States to this country were in fact carried in UnitedStates ships. He therefore considered that, on its merits, the^proposed transaction was one in which it would be justifiable for the&apos;^Government to accept the shipping condition.The Minister of Transport said that this condition was strongly* opposed by British shipping companies and the country&apos;s long-term interests would be prejudiced by accepting it. All other maritimecountries, including Scandinavia, Holland and France, had alwaysresisted this condition; and so far it had only been accepted once, by turkey. For the United Kingdom to accept the principle of flagdiscrimination in such circumstances would weaken internationalresistance to the imposition of such discrimination. The shipping industry earned  220 millions a year, and would be as much concerned if the Government were to accept the requirement in this case, as the textile industry would be at the loss of the opportunityto participate in the proposed aid transaction.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to decide, inconsultation with the President of the Board of Trade andthe Minister of Transport, whether the 50 per cent, shippingcondition should be accepted as part of this proposedtransaction for the supply of textiles to Pakistan.
