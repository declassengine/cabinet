3CC. 6 (55)Colonial 1.   The   Cabinet   were   informed   that  on   26th   JanuaryimmnigB-amte.     Mr. C. Osborne, M.P., would seek leave to introduce under the(Previous        ten-minute rule a Bill designed to regulate the admission into the reference:      United Kingdom of persons not belonging to the British Isles.CC. (55) 5th In discussion it was agreed that the attitude of Members on that conclusions, occasion might provide a useful indication of the prospects of securingMinute 2.) Parliamentary approval for a measure of this kind. If Mr. Osborneobtained leave to bring in the Bill, this would not preclude theintroduction of Government legislation at a later stage. If, on theother hand, leave were refused, it would be more difficult for theGovernment to introduce legislation of its own during the present session. In these circumstances it would be appropriate, if the matterwent to a division, that Ministers of Cabinet rank should abstain from voting and that other members of the Government should eitherabstain or vote in favour of the proposal.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if a division were taken on the application ofMr. C. Osborne, M.P., for leave to introduce a Bill on thissubject under the ten-minute rule, Ministers of Cabinetrank should abstain from voting in the division and othermembers of the Government should refrain from votingagainst the proposal.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to give guidance to members of theGovernment in accordance with Conclusion (1) above.Formosa, 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that, as a result of representations(Previous        made to them since the Cabinefs discussion on 20th January, the reference:      United States Government had now gone a long way to meet ourCC. (55) 5th    views on the action which they had originally proposed to take in conclusions,    respect of the islands off the China coast now held by the ChineseMinute 6.)       Nationalists.   In particular, they had abandoned their proposal togive a provisional guarantee to defend Quemoy.   They had donethis on the understanding that we would go forward at once with theplan for initiating discussions of this problem in the Security Councilof the United Nations.  It was now proposed that the New zealand government should raise this matter in the Security Council in thecourse of the present week, and that we should meanwhile do our utmost to persuade the Russians and the Chinese Communists tojoin in those discussions.  If, however, the Chinese declined to send representatives to those discussions in New York, we were not committed to do more than consult with the  United  StatesGovernment on the next step to be taken.The Foreign Secretary said that he had discussed the position with the United States and Canadian Ambassadors in London. Bothwere agreed that there was grave danger that, more widespreadhostilities would break out in the Far East unless some such step as this were taken to relieve the existing tension.The Cabinet approved the terms of a draft telegram, which was read to them, explaining to Her Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washingtonthe detailed procedural steps to be taken in arranging for this issue to be brought before the Security Council.In discussion there was general support for the course of action proposed by the Foreign Secretary.The Cabinet were given a summary of the views of the Chiefsof Staff on the strategic issues involved. The main points in thissummary were: (i) that the Taachen Islands and Quemoy were not essential to the defence of Formosa, though they were useful to the americans and the Chinese Nationalists in exercising control overshipping in that area; and (ii) that substantial numbers of troops werein Quemoy and could not easily be evacuated from it in face of opposition by Chinese Communist forces.
The Cabinet-Agreed that it was expedient that the situation in these islands off the China coast should now be discussed by theSecurity Council, and approved the steps which the foreign secretary was taking to this end.3. The Foreign Secretary said that it would be useful if theCabinet could have a report on the future prospects of our overseastrade. It would be specially valuable if this report could be madeavailable before the opening of the forthcoming Meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers, during which various Ministers wouldhave opportunities for informal discussion of this question withrepresentatives of other Commonwealth countries.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presidentof the Board of Trade to submit a report on the future prospects of our external trade, for discussion by theCabinet at their meeting on 31st January.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by thePresident of the Board of Trade (C. (55) 14) discussing the choice of courses before the Government in connection with Japan&apos;application for accession to the General Agreement on Tariffs andTrade (G.A.T.T.). They also had before them a note by the foreign secretary (C. (55) 17) covering a record of the views which had beenformed on this subject by the leaders of the recent parliamentary delegation to Japan.The President of the Board of Trade said that the courses opento the Government had been examined by officials, and had beenconsidered by the Economic Policy Committee on 18th January.If we were to accept G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan, even though we succeeded in obtaining some additional safeguards for our industries by amendment of Article XIX of the G.A.T.T. (course (iii)in paragraph 3 of C. (55) 14), we should have to admit fairly soon a wide range of Japanese goods (such as textiles, pottery, lightengineering products and toys) much more freely to the UnitedKingdom market. This increased Japanese competition would haveto be faced despite the fact that it would not be possible to affordany additional protection to most of the industries concerned bymeans of a higher tariff, since the combination of the &quot; no-new-preference &quot; rule of the G.A.T.T. and the principle of duty-free entry for Commonwealth goods under the Ottawa Agreements preventedsuch tariff changes. There were, therefore, serious political andeconomic objections to this course.A second course would be to refuse to accept G.A.T.T.obligations towards Japan immediately, but to commit ourselves todo so in the future (after, say, an interval of three years) and meanwhile to admit Japanese goods more freely (course (ii) inparagraph 3 of C. (55) 14). If we were to announce a futurecommitment of this sort (and this would be necessary if this coursewere to be of value to our foreign policy) it would be necessary tosay publicly that it was the Governments intention to recast ourtariff policy in order to obtain the necessary freedom to deal with japanese competition. This would also be open to grave political objections. While promising to grant G.A.T.T. rights to Japan after a iimited period, we should have lost the opportunity of securingadditional safeguards which we could hope to obtain by an
amendment of Article XIX if we were prepared to accept G.A.T.T.: obligations towards Japan without delay.  From this point of view,course (iii) was preferable to course (ii).The third course (course (i) in paragraph 3 of C.(55) 14) was torefuse to accept G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan and to undertakeno commitments at present either to do so in the future or to admitJapanese goods more freely. This course was open to objection on grounds of international policy, but was the least objectionable fromthe point of view of domestic politics.In discussion, it was argued that to refuse to accept any commitment towards Japan would be dangerous from the point ofview of our foreign policy, and inconsistent with the Government^external economic policy, while to undertake G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan without having first secured freedom to use the tarifffor our protection would not be defensible politically. It might therefore be wiser to adopt the middle course.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that to refuse to acceptG.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan immediately, but to undertake a commitment to do so after a limited period, would be in line withour general trade policy of moving gradually towards full non-discrimination. An undertaking to accept Japan as a member of theG.A.T.T. in the future would be conditional on her following fairtrade practices, and on the negotiation of a satisfactory commercial treaty. He did not feel convinced that an amendment of Article XIXwas in our true interests, since this would enable other countries totake discriminatory action against our exports.In further discussion it was suggested that it might be possibleto accept G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan if it were possible to suspend these by invoking Article XXXV of the G.A.T.T. if Japanwere to engage in disruptive competition with one or more of our industries. It was pointed out that the Japanese would not feelthat this course satisfied their aims. In any case it did not seempossible to negotiate a solution of this sort in the G.A.T.T.The middle course, under which the Government would be committed to accept G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan after a specified period, was open to the objection that the Governmentwould not be able to point to any certain safeguards for our industrieswhen Japanese competition became effective. It would not bepossible in a commercial treaty to obtain safeguards overridingthe provisions of the G.A.T.T. We should therefore have to rely on obtaining freedom to use the tariff. When this was publiclyexplained, it would be clear that we intended to abandon the principleof free entry for Commonwealth goods. It was true that our general trade policy would in the end necessitate a fundamental alterationof our tariff structure, but this need not otherwise become plain forsome time. It was important that proposals to recast the tariff shouldbe discussed with other Commonwealth Governments before we hadto announce our intentions.The following points were also made in discussion:  -(a) United Kingdom goods at present enjoyed considerablepreferences in Commonwealth markets. These preferences would beat risk when we had to negotiate the abandonment of the system of free entry for Commonwealth goods and it was important that weshould not be forced to recast the tariff under pressure of a time-limit.(b) There were political difficulties in accepting higher quotas for Japanese imports, even in return for reciprocal treatment for united Kingdom exports, since this would not help the industries which would be affected by increased Japanese competition.(c) The proposal for amendment of Article XIX was open to thefurther objection that this safeguard might be considered to be a threat directed particularly against competition from under-developed countries, such as India.
Railways.(previous reference :C.C. (55) 5thConclusions,Minute 8.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary(C. (55) 18) covering the Final Report of the Court of Inquiry intothe railway wages dispute, and a memorandum by the parliamentary secretary, Ministry of Labour (C. (55) 19), about the Report.The Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour, said that thereport was due to be published on the following day, and he proposedto* invite representatives of the British Transport Commission and ofthe Railway Unions to give him their views on it at meetings onThursday, 27th January. Possibly the most valuable feature of thereport was the suggestion in paragraph 76 that there should be amore searching and detailed inquiry into questions of efficiency and economy on the railways, and at his meetings with both sides of the(d) Whatever course we followed, it was by no means certainthat Australia, New Zealand and South Africa would all invoke article XXXV against Japan. Australia and New Zealand were particularly susceptible to pressure from the United States on defencegrounds, and might accept obligations towards Japan which, theywould claim, made it essential for them to increase their tariff protection of secondary industries, despite the fact that this would adversely affect United Kingdom exports.(e) It would be helpful to know what course these Common-wealth countries would follow since, if they were to invoke ArticleXXXV, it would then be much more difficult politically for the UnitedKingdom to justify having accepted G.A.T.T. obligations towardsJapan.It was also pointed out that there were variations on the broadcourses described in C. (55) 14. Acceptance of G.A.T.T. obligations towards Japan could be made conditional, not only on our being able to obtain some safeguards by an amendment of Article XIX,but also on our securing a commercial treaty containing satisfactory assurances on shipping, and on copying and other unfair trade practices. A decision to accept Japan as a member of the G.A.T.T.would be welcome to the United States, and we could try to secure some economic concessions from the Americans in return. At theother extreme, a refusal to accept any obligations immediately couldbe accompanied by an intimation that it might be possible to acceptJapan at a later date. The middle course, or some variation of it, wasalso favoured by several Ministers.The Prime Minister said that it would be advisable for theForeign Secretary, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chancellorof the Duchy of Lancaster, the Commonwealth Secretary, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Minister of Agriculture toexamine the alternative courses further, in the light of the cabinets discussion. Ministers should take the opportunity of the forthcoming meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers to ascertain the views ofother Commonwealth Governments, particularly of Australia, and to explore the difficulties involved in announcing a decision to undertake a commitment which would make it necessary to recast the tariff.The Cabinet should consider the matter further in about ten days&apos;time.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, Chancellor of the Exchequer,Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, commonwealth secretary, President of the Board of Trade and Minister ofAgriculture to examine, in the light of the cabinets discussion, the courses open to the United KingdomGovernment in relation to Japan&apos;s accession to theG.A.T.T., and to report to the Cabinet in about ten days&apos; time.
7CC. 6 (55)industry he would do his utmost to secure satisfactory assurances oftheir full co-operation in pursuing this suggestion.The following points were made in discussion:  (a) It was suggested that the views expressed in the report on thesubject of efficiency and economy were too lukewarm to yield any appreciable results. On the other hand, it was pointed out that thesematters were hardly within the terms of reference of the Court, andthat the suggestion of a further inquiry in paragraph 76 was as definitea recommendation on the subject as could reasonably have been expected.(b) The view was expressed that an inquiry at the present timeinto redundancy of staff and restrictive practices on the railways was unlikely to result in substantial economies, which could best beachieved as a result of the radical reorganisation contemplated in theCommission^ plan of modernisation and re-equipment. On the otherhand, attention was drawn to paragraph 74 of the report where itwas implied that co-operation in measures to improve productivitycould be expected from the Unions once the just claims of railwayemployees had been met. If this view was correct, it would be important to take the earliest possible opportunity of establishingwhether the Unions would now give this co-operation.(c) While is was important that any inquiry should embrace all aspects of the use of manpower including staffing at the higher levels and methods of labour management it was undesirable that itshould extend beyond manpower problems at a time when respon-sibility was being devolved to regional authorities under theTransport Act, 1953. The inquiry should be a private one under the auspices of the Transport Commission, but the body carrying it out should contain an adequate number of suitable persons from outsidethe Commission, one of whom might perhaps be appointed Chairman.(d) The Leader of the House, when he announced the proposedpostponement of the Second Reading of the British transport commission (Borrowing Powers) Bill, would indicate that the house would be given an early opportunity to debate the recent wagesdispute, the Reports of the Court of Inquiry and the plan of theTransport Commission for modernisation and re-equipment of therailways. The timing of this debate must take account of the stateof opinion in the House when it reassembled on the following day,but it seemed desirable that it should be deferred for as long aspossible. Meanwhile Questions to the Ministers concerned aboutparticubr aspects of this general problem should, so far as possible,be answered on the basis that a wide-ranging debate was likely to beheld in the fairly near future.The Cabinet Invited the Parliamentary Secretary, Ministry of Labour,to discuss the final report of the Court of Inquiry withrepresentatives of the Transport Commission and theRailway Unions and to seek their co-operation in theappointment by the Commission of a committee of inquiry(including outside members) to investigate all aspects of theuse of manpower on British Railways.Parliament.Expenses of peers.(previous reference:CC. (54) 68thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Lord President said that in the House of Lords on thefollowing day a debate was to be held, on a motion by Lord Samuel,on the reform of the House of Lords. He thought it would benecessary for him, in replying to the debate, to say something on thesubject of allowances to Peers for expenses necessarily incurred inthe discharge of their Parliamentary duties. He had wished to saythat this was a problem which the Government would have to faceat an early date, but he understood that the Chancellor of theExchequer saw some difficulty about this.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he would prefer that parliamentary allowances for Peers should not be instituted untillegislation could be introduced to increase the salaries of junior ministers. Some of his colleagues had hitherto considered that such legislation should not be introduced in the present Session.In discussion the view was strongly expressed that the grant ofParliamentary allowances to Peers should not be linked withimprovement of the salaries of junior Ministers.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord President to state, in replying to a debate in the House of Lords on the following day, thatthe problem of Parliamentary allowances for Peers was one with which the Government would deal at the earliest practicable moment.7. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Housing and Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (55) 21), theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (55) 20) and the Minister of Fuel and power (C. (55) 22) about the recommendations in the final report ofthe Beaver Committee on Air Pollution (Cmd. 9322).The Minister of Housing said that these recommendations hadreceived a warm welcome from the Press and from interestedMembers on both sides of the House, and in his view the Governmenthad no alternative but to accept them. In view, however, of doubtswhich had been expressed by some Ministers in the Home AffairsCommittee, he was ready to agree that the Governments acceptanceof the report should at this stage be announced in broad terms. Hewas anxious to make an announcement forthwith on account of thePrivate Members Bill, based on the Committee&apos;s recommendations,which was to be brought forward by Mr. Nabarro, M.P., and wasdown for Second Reading on 4th February. There seemed to beevery likelihood that this Bill would command wide support in theHouse but, unless the Government adopted it, it could not providefor the financial measures without which the pursuit of a clean air policy would be largely ineffective.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It could not be assumed that there would be no oppositionto some of the measures recommended by the Beaver Committee.For example, some householders would be reluctant to make thechange from open fires to heating appliances burning smokeless fuel.The Government would therefore be well-advised to be cautious incommitting themselves to carrying out all the Committee&apos;s recom-mendations. The Ministers proposed announcement of theGovernments acceptance of these recommendations should be framed in broad terms.(b) Apart from possible constitutional objections to any proposal that the Government should fortify a Private MemberS Bill with financial provisions, it would be undesirable that the Governmentshould put a Private Member in the position to claim the credit forvaluable financial concessions in the interests of smoke abatementwhich had for long been under consideration but had only now become timely.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Housing to announce in theHouse of Commons in broad terms the Governmentssupport in principle for a clean air policy on the lines recommended by the Beaver Committee.
Political 8.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the broadcasting.   Postmaster-General (C. (55) 3) outlining a proposal by the NationalBroadcasting Council for Wales to institute party political broadcastson Welsh affairs.The Lord Privy Seal said that he was opposed to this proposal,which had not yet been discussed with the National Headquarters ofthe political parties. He suggested that he should, in the firstinstance, ascertain what view was taken of it by leaders of the labour opposition.The Cabinet Invited the Lord Privy Seal to ascertain the views of theleaders of the Labour Opposition on this proposal for party political broadcasts on Welsh affairs.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,24th January, 1955.
