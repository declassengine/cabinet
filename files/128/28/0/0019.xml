3 CC. 19 (55)Formosa. 1.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the terms of the reply(Previous        (Peking telegram No. 226) which the Chinese Foreign Minister had reference:      sent to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s suggestion (Bangkok telegramsCC. (55) .16th   Nos. 173 and 174) that they should meet, in Hong Kong or elsewhereConclusions,    on the borders of China, to discuss means of easing internationalMinute l.)       tension over Formosa and the coastal islands. In view of the negativenature of Mr. Chou En-Lai&apos;s response to his message, the foreign secretary had now informed him (Rangoon telegram No. 90) that&quot;there was clearly no common basis between them on which such discussions could take place.The Cabinet Expressed their approval of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s courseof action.Bisanmamemt. 2.   The Minister of State for Foreign Affairs (Mr. Nutting) saidthat it was clear from discussions in the Disarmament Sub-Committee of the United Nations now meeting in London that theSoviet Government had reverted to their earlier plan for banning allatomic and nuclear weapons and freezing conventional armaments attheir existing level. They were asking that this plan should bediscussed independently of the Anglo-French proposals which theyhad accepted last September as a basis for discussion. those proposals would constitute a phased plan providing for an effectivecontrolling authority to be established before any of the proposedthree stages of disarmament was carried out. But they would ultimately lead to the banning of atomic and nuclear weapons. it seemed important that we should not allow the present discussions to end abruptly and that, before they did so, we should have presented,if possible, the outline of a disarmament treaty as tangible evidenceof the sincerity of our efforts to achieve practical results. He proposedto pursue his consultations with the Americans, the Canadians andthe French to this end. It was the normal practice to issue a white paper at the conclusion of discussions of the kind now in progress,and it should be our aim to ensure that such a document would revealclearly where the responsibility lay for lack of progress.In discussion there was general agreement on the importance ofconvincing public opinion, both in this country and throughout theCommonwealth, that responsibility for failure to bring about any practical measure of disarmament rested squarely with the Russians.The Cabinet Took note, with approval, of the statement by the Ministerof State for Foreign Affairs.Israel.(previous reference:CC. (53) 48thC*o nclu sjo nsMinute 5.)3. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to reports of an engagement on 28th February between Egyptian and Israeli militaryforces near Gaza, in which the Egyptian forces had suffered a numberof casualties. These reports tended to corroborate the view expressedby the United Nations truce supervision organisation that responsibility for the incident rested primarily with Israel.This incident was the most serious of its kind since the signature of the armistice in 1949. The Cabinet took note that the situation was likely to be considered by the United Nations, and agreed that meanwhile both Governments should be urged to avoid any actionwhich might further inflame public feeling in either country.
(previous reference:C.C. (55) 12thConclusions,Minute 4.)Cnina- 4.   The Cabinet were informed that, as a result of the publicationTreatment of of the report on the treatment of British prisoners of war capturedBritish Prisoners in Korea, public attention had again been drawn to the treasonablein Korean War. activities of certain British subjects in Korea. Two Parliamentaryconsequences had followed. First, Mr. P. I. Bell, M.P., had askedwhether the Government would see objection to his seeking leave tointroduce, under the ten-minute rule, a Bill &quot; to provide that personswho give aid and comfort or adhere to the enemies of tlie united nations shall, if the Armed Forces of the Queen are &quot;operating withthe United Nations, be deemed guilty of treason.&quot; Secondly, theHome Secretary was to be asked in the House of Commons that afternoon whether he would consider the introduction of amending legislation to apply the Incitement to Disaffection Act, 1934, tooffences committed outside the United Kingdom.On the first point the Cabinet agreed that Mr. Bell should notbe discouraged from seeking leave to introduce a Bill on the lines proposed.The second point was more difficult. Even if the Act of 1934were amended as proposed, it could hardly be made to applyretrospectively. But it would be embarrassing for the Governmentto admit that there were no practicable means of punishing theconduct to which they had drawn attention in Chapter VI of thereport and that they had no remedy to suggest.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to inform Mr. P. I. Bell, M.P.,that the Government had no objection to his seekingleave to introduce his Private Member&apos;s Bill.(2) Took note that the Home Secretary would examine further the scope for action under the existing law against personsguilty of activities of the kind described in Chapter VI ofthe recent report on the treatment of British prisoners captured in Korea.Australia. 5.   The Cabinet considered a suggestion that the GovernmentFloods in should make a gift to the Australian Government for the relief ofNew South distress caused by the recent serious floods in New South Wales.Wales. They were reminded that the Australian Government had contributed 50,000 towards the relief of distress resulting from the floods in east anglia in 1953, and that the precedents for our making such giftsincluded one of  25,000 to the Canadian Government on the occasion of the recent hurricane in Ontario. There was general agreement that,if a gift was to be made to the Australian Government on this occasion, it should be announced at the earliest possible date. Therewas also support for the view that any gift should, so far as possible,be made in kind rather than in cash.The Cabinet-Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Common-wealth Secretary to decide, in the light of the cabinets discussion, on the amount and form of a gift to theAustralian Government for the relief of distress in NewSouth Wales, and to make an early announcement of their decision.
EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)6. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Court of theBank of England in connection with the recent increase in Bank rate,had drawn special attention to two points. First, they had given theiropinion that A\ per cent, was a comparatively high Bank rate in thecircumstances of to-day and one that ought not to be maintained forlonger than was absolutely necessary. Secondly, they had emphasisedtheir view that, while credit policy could contribute towards a balanced economy, the battle against inflationary tendencies must befought mainly in the wider fields of economic policy. He had assured the Bank that the Government had these points in mind.The Chancellor added that the measures which the Governmenthad recently taken, although they had not yet had their full effect,had already brought about a noticeable improvement in the strengthof sterling.The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer.House ofCommons.redistribution of Seats.(previous references:C.C. (54) 82ndConclusions,Minute 4 andC.C. (55) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Cabinet were reminded that in the course of the debates on the recent reports of the Boundary Commissions the Governmenthad indicated their willingness to consider the possibility of amending the existing law so as to secure that these reviews of Parliamentaryconstituencies would in future be carried out at longer intervals andthat the Commissions would be relieved of their obligation torecommend changes merely for the sake of producing numericalequality between constituencies. The Labour Opposition in theHouse of Commons were suggesting that informal talks on thepossibility of amending legislation might now be held between representatives of the political Parties.In discussion there was general agreement that this was not asuitable moment for initiating such talks. The controversy arousedby the Orders resulting from the latest review had not yet beenforgotten. It would be some years before the Commissions had toundertake a further review. It seemed unnecessary and undesirable that amending legislation should be considered in the present parliament.The Cabinet Agreed that discussions between the political Parties on thepossibility of amending the House of Commons (redistribution-tion of Seats) Act, 1949, should not be undertaken in the lifetime of the present Parliament.Parliament. 8.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.In the House of Lords the Defence White Paper would be debated on 16th and 17th March.Prince ofHanover.Claim to british nationality.(previous reference:.C.C. (55) 12thConclusions,Minute 1.)9. The Cabinet took note of the judgment delivered in theChancery Division of the High Court on 1st March in the actionbrought by Prince Ernst of Hanover with a view to establishing a claim to British nationality. This rejected Prince Ernsfs claim tobe a British subject by virtue of an Act of 1705 (4 and 5 AnneChapter IV).The Attorney-General reminded the Cabinet that it was stillopen to Prince Ernst to take the matter to the Court of Appeal.
House of Lords.Reform.(previous reference:CC (53) 63rdConclusions,Minute 5.)Expenses of peers.(previous reference:CC. (55) 18thConclusions,Minute 4.)10. The Lord President said that he was discussing with theCabinet Committee on House of Lords Reform the terms of thestatement which he was proposing to make in the debate on thissubject which was to be held in the House of Lords on 9th March ona motion by Lord Samuel. He would, however, wish to consult theCabinet about the statements which he would have to make on(i) powers of the House of Lords; and (ii) payment of expenses incurred by Peers in the discharge of their Parliamentary duties. he proposed to circulate to the Cabinet, for their consideration early inthe following week, the text of the statements which he was proposing to make on these two points. It was now clear, however, that no progress could be made with this question in the present Parliament.The Leader of the Labour Opposition in the House of Lords had informed him that the Labour Party were quite unwilling to supportat the present time any proposals for the reform of the House ofLords.The Lord President recalled that on 24th February the cabinet had authorised him to take informal steps to sound opinion in theHouse of Lords on his proposal for a system of expenses allowances for Peers. He had, however, taken no action in pursuance of this authority; for it was clear, from the statement made to him by the leader of the Labour Opposition in the Lords, that the unwillingnessof the Labour Party to associate themselves with measures for the reform of the House of Lords would extend to any scheme of expenses allowances for Peers. In these circumstances he had concluded, with regret, that it would not be practicable to proceedwith this scheme in the present Parliament.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Lord President.Coal Prices. 11.   The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposed(Previous        increases in coal prices.   They now had before them a further reference:      memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power (C. (55) 60).  ThisCC (55) 18th   proposed that the Coal Board should be allowed to assume fullConclusions,     responsibility, as they were prepared to do, for increasing coal pricesMinute 1.)       to the extent previously discussed by the Cabinet and that theyshould announce the increases, after consulting the Consumers&apos;Councils, about the middle of March. The memorandum contained adraft of the announcement which the Board would make.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Pensions said that the increases proposed would raise costs in industry by about  64 millions a year. He doubted whether the financial position and prospects of the Coal Board wouldalone warrant increases of this order. He found it difficult to accept some of the figures which the Minister of Fuel and Power had put to the Economic Policy Committee in justification of the proposedprice increases. Thus, it was stated that in 1956 the Board wouldspend an additional  17 millions on safety measures. It was also stated that another  12 millions would be spent on increaseddepreciation and interest: this represented about  300 millions of capital expenditure. There was also a figure of  11^ millions forother increased costs; and this did not include increases in wages,which were estimated to cost another  24 millions. These figuressuggested to him that the proposed increases were put forward, noton Commercial considerations alone, but for the wider economicpurpose of encouraging economy in the consumption of coal and supporting the Chancellors efforts to strengthen confidence in sterling. He feared that increased prices on the scale proposed would have the result that the Coal Board would show a largesurplus on their next years operations, and that this would encourage the miners to press for a further increase in wages.
(b) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that his proposals, while they would serve to support the financial measures which theChancellor had recently taken, could be justified on commercialgrounds. The Coal Board would shortly have to incur muchadditional expenditure on safety precautions. Apart from the costlyprogramme of installing non-inflammable conveyor belts throughoutthe industry, the Board would begin to incur in 1956 the cost of thenew measures prescribed by the Mines and Quarries Act, 1954.Capital investment in the industry was also increasing. In addition,a large programme of research and development was to be under-taken ; and additional money must be spent on measures to improvemanagement throughout the industry. It was true that, if prices were increased as proposed, the Board were expected to earn a surplus of 8 millions in 1955 and  1^ millions in 1956. But, even then, their accumulated deficit would not have been reduced below  10 millions.(c) The proposals under discussion would have the effect ofincreasing the cost of smokeless fuels. To this extent they wouldmake it more difficult to carry through the Governments policy forsmoke abatement.(d) Even though the prices of the lower grades of household coalwere not increased, the proposals would still have an indirect effecton the cost-of-living index figure through the consequential increases which would follow, e.g., in prices of gas, electricity, transport charges, &amp;c. Therefore, in any announcement, care should be takento avoid the impression that these proposals would not involve any increase in the cost of living.(e) The Economic Policy Committee should consider whether itwas still to our advantage to sell coal overseas at prices lower thanthat which we had to pay for coal imported to meet our internalneeds.(f) These proposals, while producing a surplus in the accounts ofthe Coal Board, would increase by  5 millions the estimated deficit ofthe British Transport Commission.(g) The effect of the proposals in increasing the costs of manufacturing industries should not be overlooked. Would it not be wise to consult some of the main coal-using industries, e.g., the steelindustry, before the increases were made?(h) These proposals would certainly increase the difficulties ofmaintaining, against foreign competitors, our exports of manu-facturing goods. On the other hand, if they had the result of makingmore coal available for export, they would directly benefit our overseas trade.Further discussion indicated that there was a broad measure ofagreement in the Cabinet that some increases would have to be madein coal prices and that, if so, there was much to be said for bringingthese into operation at the earliest practicable date. The extent of the increases should, however, be further considered. They should notexceed what was strictly necessary to cover the increased costs whichthe Coal Board would be called upon to bear. And account shouldbe taken of the risk that profits earned by nationalised industries would be dissipated in increased wages.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Economic Policy Committee, in the light of their discussion, to consider further the extent of the proposed increases in coal prices.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of this question at ameeting on 7th March,
