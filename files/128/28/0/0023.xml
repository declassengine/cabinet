European The Cabinet had before them a telegram from Her Majesty&apos;defence and     Ambassador at Washington (Washington telegram No. 539) outliningFour-Power     a plan, evolved by President Eisenhower and his Secretary of State,Meeting.        for holding in Paris early in May a series of international meetings(Previous        designed to demonstrate the progress towards European unity, whichReferences:      had been made in the ten years since the defeat of Hitler&apos;s Germany.C.C. (54) 53rd   This plan was based on the assumption that all the countriesConclusions and concerned with the restoration of sovereignty to Western GermanyC.C(54)63rd   and its admission to Western European Union and the NorthConclusions.)    Atlantic Alliance would have completed their ratification of thoseTreaties by the tenth anniversary of VE-Day.  It was proposed that president Eisenhower should come to Paris in order to exchange the instruments of ratification with the Heads of Governments of theUnited Kingdom, France and Germany.   This, it was suggested,would also give an opportunity to make plans for a Meeting with theSoviet Government, in pursuance of the policy of the western powers to ease international tension and to reduce the risk of war.Therefore,  in  advance   of  the  ceremony for  exchanging  the instruments of ratification, the four Foreign Ministers might meetto prepare, for the consideration of Heads  of Governments,proposals on the unification of Germany, the Austrian State treaty and the general security of Europe as a whole, on the basis of whichthe Soviet Government might be invited to attend a Meeting for thediscussion of those problems.   In the course of these proceedings,an extraordinary meeting of the North Atlantic Council might alsobe held.   Mr. Dulles had invited the views of the United KingdomGovernment on this plan.The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Dulles had previouslysuggested that, if the French delayed unduly their ratification of the paris Agreements, other means would have to be found ofemphasising the independence of Western Germany. It seemed likely, therefore, that the primary purpose of this new plan was toensure French ratification of the Paris Agreements. It should notbe assumed that it was certain to have this effect on the French; andit might be doubtful whether the Germans would appreciate the choice of the tenth anniversary of VE-Day as the most suitable date for a ceremonial exchange of ratifications of the Paris Agreements.A more important consideration, however, was the effect which theannouncement of this plan might have on the Soviet Government.If it were announced before the French Senate debated theAgreements, the Russians were likely to counter it by a public declaration that, if the French ratified the Agreements, they would decline the proposed invitation to a Four-Power Meeting. a russian declaration on those lines would probably cause someFrench Senators to revert to the earlier idea that a Four-power meeting should be held before the Agreements were ratified.The Foreign Secretary said that, if it were the primary purposeof this plan to prepare the way for a Four-Power Meeting, he would wish to give it his support. But, if that were its object, it would bemore likely to produce results if both the announcement and the invitation were withheld for some time after the ratification of the paris Agreements. He would like also to know what kind of four-Power Meeting was envisaged by the Americans. There was nothing in this telegram to suggest that they had in mind a Meetingof Heads of Governments. Indeed, the subjects suggested forpreliminary discussion by the four Foreign Ministers implied that what the Americans had in mind was a continuation of the BerlinConference though, for the resumption of those discussions nofurther preparation by the Western Powers was necessary. The main question for the Cabinet to consider was whether an early announcement of the plan outlined by Mr. Dulles was likely tofurther our primary purpose of securing a fruitful Four-power meeting with the Russians. He himself doubted whether it would improve the prospects of securing such a Meeting.
3CC. 23 (55)The Prime Minister said that he attached primary importanceto the Presidents willingness to come to Europe for the purpose ofmaking plans for a Four-Power Meeting with the Russians. Thiswas a new and significant initiative, and we should welcome it. Weshould certainly say nothing to discourage it. Many people, both inthis country and elsewhere in Western Europe, would have highhopes that such a visit would make a significant contribution towardsthe preservation of world peace. Even though it might be true thatthe primary purpose of the plan was to ensure French ratification of the Paris Agreements, it would give us an opportunity to discuss with the President means of securing a fruitful Meeting with theRussians. We should therefore be ill-advised to brush it aside ordeny ourselves the chance of turning it to good account.The following were the main points made in the cabinets discussion:  (a)-It was open to some doubt whether the plan outlined byMr. Dulles would have the desired effect of ensuring Frenchratification of the Paris Agreements. Earlier American attempts to influence the outcome of Parliamentary proceedings, in France andin Italy, had not been successful. This move might even have theeffect of stiffening some sections of French opinion against ratifica-tion especially if it provoked a sharp reaction from the SovietGovernment. This was, however, a point which might be left to the judgment of the French Government.(b) Similarly, it was for the German Government to raise objection, if they wished, to the emphasis which the plan would layon the tenth anniversary of VE-Day. To many Germans that wasthe anniversary, not of Germany&apos;s defeat, but of Hitlets downfall.(c) Whatever its effect on the French or the Germans, the plan would do nothing to make it more likely that the Russians would accept an invitation to a Four-Power Meeting. They had consistentlyopposed the Paris Agreements; and, although they would probablyaccept them in the end as facts of the international situation, theycould hardly be expected to accept an invitation to a Four-power meeting which was issued soon after, and linked with, the ratifications. The plan outlined by Mr. Dulles did not seem to takesufficient account of the problems of timing: neither the timingproposed for the original announcement, nor the timing of theproposed invitation to the Four-Power Meeting, seemed likely to appeal to the Soviet Government.(d) There was nothing in the telegram to suggest that president eisenhower would himself be willing to take part in the Conferencesproposed, either at the original meetings in Paris or at a subsequentFour-Power Meeting with the Russians. The plan contemplated that the preparatory work in Paris would be undertaken by foreign ministers and that the President would attend only for the formalceremony of exchanging instruments of ratification. It could not therefore be assumed that the President would be willing to attend a four-Power Meeting of Heads of Governments.The conclusion which emerged from the Cabinets discussion was that precipitate action on the lines proposed by Mr. Dulles,though it might help to ensure French ratification of the ParisAgreements, was not likely to improve the prospects for a Four-Power Meeting with the Russians which might produce fruitfulresults. Indeed, it was more likely than not that the Russians would decline an invitation issued in the circumstances envisaged in this plan. On the other hand, much good might come from a visit to europe by President Eisenhower; and we should certainly do nothing to discourage the initiative which he had shown in suggesting it.Many of the difficulties which had been mentioned in the cabinets discussion could be avoided if any immediate announcement of hisplans could be confined to a statement that he was willing to cometo Europe later in the summer perhaps in June.   Though this
announcement could be made before the French debate on the ParisAgreements, it need not be linked specifically with the ratification ofof those Agreements and could refer more generally to the easing ofinternational relations in Europe and the possibility of a Four-power meeting with the Russians. The issue of a specific invitation to theSoviet Government to attend such a Meeting could then be deferred until the President was in Europe. The promise of a visit by thePresident later in the year, together with the prospect that a Four-Power Meeting might be held later, would be more valuable in reducing international strain than an earlier visit by the president on the basis proposed in Mr. Dulles&apos; plan coupled, as seemedinevitable, by an immediate Soviet rejection of the accompanyingproposal for a Four-Power Meeting.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in the light of their discussion,to prepare a draft reply to the proposal outlined in washington telegram No. 539, and agreed to resume their discussion when this draft was available.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,14th March, 1955.
