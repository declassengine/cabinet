ECONOMIC STRATEGY

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C(85) 4) on economic strategy.

THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the development of the United Kingdom economy during the past year had been dominated by the miners&apos; strike and the appreciation of the United States dollar against all other major currencies.   More recently the weakness and uncertainty of oil prices had had a substantial impact.    In most respects the United Kingdom economy had been fairly resilient; despite the miners&apos; strike, the current account balance had remained in surplus, and the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) had increased by about 2i per cent, as against the earlier forecast of 3 per cent.    Inflation had been held to about 4^4 per cent despite the depreciation of sterling, as against the earlier forecast of k\ per cent.    Not all of the overshoot of the 1984-85 Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) could be attributed to the miners&apos; strike; this factor had however probably influenced sentiment in financial markets, and the resulting increase in interest rates had further exacerbated the PSBR problem.

For 1985 the prospect was for 3 per cent growth in GDP, with inflation remaining at about 5 per cent, although it might go somewhat higher during the first half of the year, particularly as a result of the impact of higher mortgage interest rates.   There were considerable uncertainties, both external and domestic.    The very large United States budget deficit and the high level of dollar interest rates, with the dollar remaining extremely strong against all other currencies, represented a threat to the world economy; the United States were in effect importing other countries&apos; savings and exporting their own inflation, while the debtor countries were facing an increasing real burden of debt service.    On the domestic front one main worry was that earnings were rising substantially faster than prices, with productivity stagnant; the result was rising United Kingdom unit labour costs, while those of other major countries were static or falling. This factor was preventing the economic recovery from giving rise to an increase in numbers of people employed.    The other main worry was the continuing upward pressure on public expenditure.    A larger overshoot of the 1984-85 planning total as in the recent Public Expenditure White Paper was now expected than could be attributed to the continuation of the miners&apos; strike beyond the end of 1984.    Higher interest rates would mean higher debt service payments, and local authority overspending now seemed likely to exceed earlier forecasts.    These pressures were expected to continue in 1985-86 and thereafter.    Because of these difficulties he thought it prudent to increase the size of the Contingency Reserve for 1985-86 and the two subsequent years, which would necessitate parallel increases in the planning totals.    Great efforts would still be needed to keep public expenditure within these somewhat higher totals.    The financial markets sensed these difficulties, and

this made it all the more important that the Government should stick to their economic strategy.    Against this background there seemed likely to be much less room for a fiscal adjustment in the Budget than had been foreshadowed the previous autumn; whatever scope there was should be devoted to measures which would help the growth of employment.

In discussion, the following main points were made -

a. There was general agreement on the need for caution in setting the 1985-86 PSBR:    restraining borrowing to the level consistent with the Medium Term Financial Strategy (MTFS) was a minimum requirement.    An adverse reaction from financial markets would add to the difficulty of managing economic policy. It would be important to avoid creating expectations that the Budget would have a substantial impact on unemployment.

b. The outlook for public expenditure was extremely serious, and the fact that major difficulties would remain after the miners&apos; strike was over would be extremely disappointing both to the financial markets and to the Government&apos;s supporters.

The Government risked getting the worst of both worlds: unpopular expenditure cuts were being made over a wide range of services, while at the same time the Government were unable to keep total expenditure within the prescribed limits.    The problem could be resolved only if changes were made in the structure of demand-led programmes, although even here the scope was limited by previous pledges to maintain the real value of certain benefits.    It was nevertheless essential to find ways of reducing social security expenditure and expenditure by local authorities.

c. There was a widespread feeling that this was not the year in which to embark on radical changes in the tax structure which would attract the hostility of powerful interest groups or increase the general price level.

d. Much of the responsibility for the upward movement in unit labour costs was attributable to ineffective managements. Recent improvements in profits, and the greater profitability of exports resulting from the depreciation of sterling, seemed to have made companies more reluctant to resist excessive wage claims and risk interruptions in production.    The effects then spilled over into the public sector, by creating pressure for &quot;catching up&quot; pay settlements.    Although the climate of opinion was changing, there were still far too many examples of workforces pressing for pay increases very damaging to the international competitive position of the companies employing them.

e. Rather than look for further tax concessions to business, the Government should now be seeking a greater contribution from business towards reducing unemployment and providing better training facilities for young people.    Employers should recognise that the United Kingdom Government provided far more financial assistance to training than the Governments of the United States, Germany and Japan.

f.     Despite the high level of unemployment, it remained difficult to fill vacancies for lower-paid workers.    This in part reflected the fact that the differential for men with families between income from social security benefits and income from work was very small.    If the problem were to be overcome, it would be necessary to consider reductions in entitlement to benefit as well as increases in tax thresholds for the lowest paid.    However, not all the burden of restraining public expenditure could be placed on the poorest sections of the population; while for the lowest paid the proportion of income taken in tax had increased, the higher income groups had seen their tax burden reduced under the present Government.

THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that the Cabinet recognised that the Chancellor of the Exchequer had little room for manoeuvre in his forthcoming Budget.    There was general agreement on the need for a new effort to secure better control over public expenditure, and on the need to secure further reductions in the rate of inflation; 5 per cent a year inflation was still far too high. The objective of restoring the PSBR to the path set out in the MTFS was generally endorsed, and within this constraint the Cabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should concentrate on measures which would contribute to the growth of employment.    The need to give full and clear explanations of the Government&apos;s policies, both to the Government&apos;s supporters in Parliament and to the wider public, was generally recognised.    Inquirers from the media about the Cabinet&apos;s discussion would be told that the Cabinet had considered the economic situation and the approach to the Budget, and reaffirmed their commitment to the central objectives of the Government&apos;s economic strategy:    lower inflation, firm control of public spending and a continuing reduction in public sector borrowing.

The Cabinet -

1. Took note, with approval,    of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.

2. Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to take account of their discussion in preparing his forthcoming Budget.
