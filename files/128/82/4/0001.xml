THE PRIME MINISTER said that,  since the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion, the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland had obtained further improvements in the package which had been negotiated with the Irish Government.

The Irish side had been brought to agree to a firmer statement about continuing and enhanced co-operation in combating terrorism.    The Irish Government had agreed to announce that it would accede as soon as possible to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism; the Irish Attorney General had advised that there would be a risk of constitutional challenge if the Irish Government signed the Convention before the required legislation was passed in the Dail, with a view to ratifying it afterwards.    The United Kingdom Government had said that the Secretariat of the Intergovernmental Conference could not be housed in Stormont; but a reasonably secure building not far from there had been identified, which might be purchased and converted for the Secretariat.    The United Kingdom Government had made clear to the Irish Government that,  if the reaction in Northern Ireland to the Agreement was worse than expected,  these matters would have to be discussed again. With regard to the risk of legal challenge to the proposed Agreement, which the Cabinet had discussed on 7 November 1985,  the Attorney General had advised that an application for judicial review could be launched but that the Government would have a good defence and it should not succeed.

The Prime Minister said that the Agreement maintained two important features previously noted by the Cabinet:  that the Intergovernmental Conference would have no executive powers and that there would be no derogation from United Kingdom sovereignty.

Although a very difficult situation had now arisen, because of revelations in the Irish media of much of the contents of the Agreement, she and the two Secretaries of State were in no doubt that it was right to go ahead with the proposed Agreement.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said that there had been a long series of major press leaks from the Irish side.    The resulting reports in the media had been slanted,  in that they had concentrated on elements in the package which were welcome to the Republic of Ireland. The actual package was more favourable to United Kingdom interests than the press stories had suggested.    For instance,  the Irish willingness to accede to the European Convention on the Suppression of Terrorism had not featured in the media.    Once the Agreement had been published, the Government should emphasise that the Irish Republic was recognising for the first time that the status of Northern Ireland would not change unless a majority there so wished and that the present wish of a

majority was for no change;  that there was no derogation from sovereignty and that the Agreement could encourage devolution in Northern Ireland in due course, a development which the unionists wanted.

In discussion the following points were made -

a. If the expert advice on security risks made it necessary the arrangements for the Anglo-Irish Summit would be changed.

b. The Prime Minister had invited the Leader of the Opposition, the leaders of the Liberal Party and the Social Democratic Party, and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party to call on her before the Anglo-Irish Summit for a strictly confidential briefing on Privy Council terms about the general contents of the proposed Agreement.    The Leader of the Opposition would be accompanied by Mr Roy Hattersley MP.

c. Briefing about the Agreement would be sent to all Cabinet Ministers that evening,  strictly for their personal use only.

d. After the Anglo-Irish Summit,  the Agreement,  the Summit Communique&apos; and the press release summarising the Agreement would be sent to Members of Parliament on both sides of the House who had shown particular interest in Northern Ireland affairs. Similar material would be sent to members of the Northern Ireland Assembly and to a number of influential persons in Northern Ireland.

e. The texts of the Agreement and the Communique would be made available to Members of Parliament at Westminster at the time when the Prime Minister was beginning her press conference with the Taoiseach at the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Summit.    This would ensure, among other things,  that Members of Parliament had access to the texts no later than members of the Northern Ireland Assembly.

f. Given all the leaks in the media,  there was a risk that in the House of Commons on that day or the following day Unionist Members would mount some kind of demonstration; or that insistent moves would be made to call for a statement by the Government on the proposed Anglo-Irish Agreement or to table a Private Notice Question.    A move to table a Private Notice Question was already being resisted.

g. A form of words should be agreed for the use of the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland at Question Time that day.    If asked when or where the Agreement would be signed, Ministers would say that they were unable to comment.

If asked whether the Cabinet had taken decisions on the proposed Agreement, Ministers should reply that a statement would be made in due course.    If there was pressure on the Government to give an assurance that no Agreement would be signed before a full debate had taken place in the House of Commons, Ministers could reply

that,  if there was to be an Agreement,  it would/center into force before a full debate or without the approval of Parliament.

h. If pressed in the House of Commons on the following day, the Lord Privy Seal,  and other Ministers as necessary, could say that the Prime Minister would make a statement to the House on Monday 18 November and that the text of the Agreement and of the Communique&apos; on the Anglo-Irish Summit would be available in the Vote Office from the moment of publication.

i. The debate on the Agreement in the House of Commons was likely to take place in the week beginning 25 November.    The debate in the House of Lords would follow later in the same week or on Monday

2 December. It was probable that few members of the House of Lords would oppose the Agreement.

The Cabinet -

1. Confirmed its decision that the proposed Anglo-Irish Agreement should be signed by the Prime Minister.

2. Invited the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland to propose a form of words for his use and that of the Prime Minister in case there were questions in the House of Commons that afternoon,  about the proposed Agreement.

3. Invited the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrange for copies of the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the Summit Communique&quot; to be made available in the Vote Office of the House of Commons at the time when the Prime Minister was starting her press conference at the conclusion of the Anglo-Irish Summit.
