SIR ROBERT ARMSTRONG

As you will see these draft minutes contain no explicit record of Mr Heseltine&apos;s dissent. Although he made his dissent very clear at the end of the discussion he did not,  in our hearing, actually ask for it to be recorded.    He may, however, have made a request to you or to the Prime Minister. The practice, as you know,  is to avoid, wherever possible, the recording of dissent from Cabinet Conclusions except when a Minister resigns. May we leave it to you to do what you judge necessary in the circumstances?

TYPE 22 FRIGATES

The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry about the Ministry of Defence orders for two further Type 22 frigates (C(85) 3).    They also had before them minutes to the Prime Minister by the Secretary of State for Defence of 18 December 1984, by the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry of 21 December 1984 and by the Secretary of State for the Environment of 18 January 1985, together with a minute of 23 December 1984 from the Prime Minister&apos;s Private Secretary to the Private Secretary to the Secretary of State for Defence.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE recalled the circumstances which had resulted in the Cabinet&apos;s decision at their previous discussion in July 1984 to call for a third round of tendering for the two Type 22 frigate orders.    Simply on the basis of the third round tenders,  those orders would go to the Swan Hunter (SH) yard.    In his view, however,  it would be wrong to accept this course of action, essentially because the third round of tendering had been carried out on a basis other than that which had been agreed by Cabinet.    Plans already in course of implementation by British Shipbuilders  (BS) at the time of the Cabinet&apos;s previous discussion had deprived Cammell Laird (CL) of the capacity to build both ships, but if all their overhead costs had to be loaded on to the price of one of the ships, they could never compete against the other yard. In these circumstances the Government could be represented as having deceived the management of CL,  and the moderate members of the workforce who had been striving with some success to overcome militancy and to bring about improved industrial relations and better productivity in the yard, by allowing them to believe that there was a possibility of their winning the contract for the two frigates when the possibility did not in fact exist.    On the two previous occasions CL had been the lowest tenderer, without any interference from Departments or from BS central management.    The least the Government should do now should be to give CL one of the orders despite the extra costs.    There was an unenviable choice between preserving a given number of jobs on Merseyside or in the North East; but whereas giving both orders to SH would definitely result in the closure of CL (which was extremely important to the economy of Merseyside),  splitting the orders would not mean the closure of SH. For these reasons he proposed that one order should go to CL and one to SH.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE AND INDUSTRY said that he did not accept that the third round of tendering had been carried out on a false basis.    BS had permitted CL to make favourable assumptions about other work over which they could spread their overheads,  even though there seemed to be little prospect of these assumptions being realised. Permitting CL to undertake both orders would have resulted in CL taking on fresh labour while SH had to impose a comparable number of additional

redundancies.    Splitting the order between the two yards,  as proposed by the Secretary of State for Defence, would mean in effect spending  47 million -  7 million directly by the Ministry of Defence,  and a further  40 million through BS - to divert jobs from the North East to Merseyside.    If the orders were split, it would be clear that substantial additional costs were being incurred essentially for political reasons, and this would add to the bitterness which would be felt in the North East if SH&apos;s better record of productivity and industrial relations was seen to be ignored.    The closure of the Austin and Pickersgill yard would give rise to 700 shipbuilding redundancies in the North East in the near future, and would make the further 1,200 redundancies resulting at SH if CL received one of the Type 22 orders all the harder to bear.    In industrial terms the correct course was undoubtedly to place both orders with SH.    If nevertheless the Cabinet decided that one of the orders should go to CL,  they should at the same time decide how the additional costs this would impose on BS should be financed; his Department had no funds available to meet these costs.    He recognised that there was a very strong moral and political case for some Government action to support the workforce at CL.    Some such action would have been possible if CL had received the order for the conversion of the Balder London, and it would also have been possible to have had the submarine HMS Otter refitted there. Some measures on these lines which enabled the yard to continue in operation and demonstrate its improved productivity and industrial relations record could be implemented at relatively modest cost, and so help CL to justify its own survival following privatisation.

The following were among the main points made in discussion:

a. Giving both orders to SH would be seen as a means of improving the prospects for privatisation;  it could be politically damaging if the Government were thought to be giving higher priority to privatisation than to the social and industrial fabric of Merseyside.

b. The Government had been ready to spend very large amounts of money to resist militancy elsewhere in the economy; the miners&apos; strike and the DHSS computer strike at Newcastle (which had cost  150 million) were both examples of this.    The CL workforce&apos;s achievement in overcoming militancy was second in importance only to the struggle in the coalmines.

c. Postponing economic change, and maintaining excess capacity, as would result from splitting the orders between the two yards, simply increased the costs of measures which would at some point be inevitable.

d. The Government had arguably held out to the CL workforce the prospect of competing for a prize which was beyond their grasp. This added to the strength of the argument for some action to assist CL if SH received both orders.

THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion,  said that the balance of view in the Cabinet was in favour of both orders going to SH.    At the same time there was a strong feeling that the Government should take action to recognise the value and importance of the stand taken by the moderate workforce at CL.    There should therefore be a further examination of the scope for other action to help CL; the Departments concerned should consider this urgently,  and a further paper should be prepared for discussion at an early date.

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that he would be ready to co-operate in the further examination proposed, but wished to put on record that,  if it was not possible to find work for CL which would be broadly equivalent to an order for a Type 22 frigate, he would not be able to accept a decision by the Cabinet to put both the Type 22 frigate orders to SH.

The Cabinet -

Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for the preparation of a paper assessing the scope for action to assist Cammell Laird to continue in operation,  in the event of a Cabinet decision to place both Type 22 frigate orders with Swan Hunter.
