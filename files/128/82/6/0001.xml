CC(85) 36th Conclusions Thursday 12 December 1985

WESTLANDS PLC

THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE reported on developments since the meeting of the Ministerial Sub-Committee on Economic Affairs (E(A)(85) 24th Meeting) on 9 December had considered certain proposals relating to the future of Westlands.    He suggested that those developments were such as to make necessary a further meeting of Ministers,  to which he could circulate a memorandum.

The meeting on 9 December had agreed that time should be given until 13 December for a consortium of British and continental European firms to make firm and fully worked out proposals for participation in Westlands,  so that these could be properly considered along with the proposals by United Technologies and Fiat.    The European firms&apos; proposals would need to be presented to Westlands by 3.00 pm on Friday 13 December 1985.    Significant progress had been made. British Aerospace (BAe) and Mr Alan Bristow had expressed willingness to join the European consortium.    One of BAe1s reasons was that,  if a United States corporation gained control of a British firm like Westlands, this would prejudice the interest of BAe and other British companies in European programmes such as the European Fighter Aircraft and Airbus. As well as the industrialists concerned with a possible European offer and the National Armaments Directors of the countries involved, the Ministers of Defence of those countries were also in touch with each other.    If the European consortium was to make a firm offer,  it would have to be based on the goodwill of the Defence Ministers and the knowledge that it was in line with their future procurement policies. It followed that his own views must be presented to Lloyds Merchant Bank, which was leading the European consortium, and also to United Technologies.    Before doing this, he needed the agreement of other Ministers to the views he would be putting forward.

In discussion,  it was pointed out that the minutes of the Sub-Committee&apos;s meeting on 9 December 1985 recorded the decision that, if a viable European package which the Westlands board could recommend were not available by 4.00 pm on Friday 13 December,  the United Kingdom Government would not thereafter be bound by the recommendation of the National Armaments Directors of the United Kingdom, West Germany, France and Italy,  to the effect that the Governments of all four countries should in future meet their helicopter requirements in three specified classes by equipment designed and built in Europe.    The discussion in the Sub-Committee on 9 December,  for part of which Sir John Cuckney, the Chairman of Westlands had been present, had been the third meeting of Ministers on this subiect.    No further decisions were needed at the present time.    The Westlands Board had legal duties towards shareholders and employees and must take the ultimate decision between the proposals of Sikorsky and a possible European option.    There was a real danger that, if the Government intervened, it would incur a degree of

responsibility for the company which could prove to be extremely expens ive.

The following points were also made in discussion -

a. Neither the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, who was the Minister responsible for Westlands, nor the Prime Minister had been warned that the question of Westlands would be raised at the present meeting of the Cabinet.

b. Sikorsky, with their present British partner, Short Bros Ltd, had tried a year previously to sell their Blackhawk helicopter to the Ministry of Defence.    This offer had been rejected,  since the Ministry had neither a requirement nor the funds for such a helicopter.    Sikorsky had now made clear to the Ministry of Defence that they would expect to sell the Blackhawk if it was manufactured by Westlands.    Without orders in the United Kingdom, Westlands was unlikely to be able to sell the Blackhawk overseas in markets which were not the property of Sikorsky.

c. If the Ministry of Defence were to buy the Blackhawk helicopter from Westlands,  it would be thought that the Government, having resisted pressure from Short Bros despite the economic problems of Northern Ireland, had succumbed to pressure for the west of England.    On the other hand,  the Minister of State, Northern Ireland Office had been present at the meeting on

9 December, and had not reserved his Secretary of State&apos;s position on the decision taken.

d. The decision reached by the Sub-Committee on 9 December had been based on the expectation that a serious European offer to Westlands could be put forward.    No such offer could be made without a full discussion of Ministers.    Such a discussion had apparently been envisaged by the Cabinet Office, which at 10.00 am on 10 December had telephoned Ministers&apos; offices about the possibility of such a meeting but had later rung to say that no meeting was being called.    Against these points,  it was pointed out that the Cabinet Office often made exploratory enquiries about Ministers&apos; availability in case a meeting should be required.

The Prime Minister,  summing up a short discussion, said that E(A) had taken a decision at its meeting on 9 December.    The matter had been raised at Cabinet without notice.    Cabinet could not properly consider the matter or take decisions without papers and without time for preparation.    There was nothing in the developments since 9 December or in the discussion in Cabinet to invalidate or give grounds for reconsideration of the decision reached on 9 December.
