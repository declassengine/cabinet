THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that the increase in the Retail Price Index (RPI) for April, which would be announced the following day, would be 6.9 per cent.    It had been expected that the figure would be higher than that for March (6.1 per cent) for several reasons:    the second instalment of the increase in mortgage rates; increases in rents and rates; and the effect of taxation changes in the Budget.    In the event the magnitude of the increase had been higher than predicted, probably because companies had found it possible to reflect taxation increases in retail prices more quickly than the previous year.    The May figure was also likely to be high and this would have an unwelcome effect on the social security upratings and on public expenditure.    Later that year the monthly increase would fall, reflecting the strengthening of the sterling exchange rate and the reduction in mortgage interest rates which ought to occur before long.    The line to take in public would be that the Government still adhered broadly to the view of inflation prospects taken by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in his Budget speech which forecast a rise in the RPI to over 6 per cent but a fall to 5 per cent by the end of that year.
