PARLIAMENTARY!. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.RoadTrafficCasualtie sBillPreviousReference:CM(76) 30thC   ^elusions,Minute 2THE HOME SECRETARY said that the Cabinet had decided in July that public expenditure savings, of  20 million in 1977-78 and  40 million in a full year, should be made by legislation to recover frominsurance companies the full costs to the National Health Service(NHS) of treating road accident cases.    As he had recalled in the minute which he had circulated to members of the Cabinet the previous day, the Cabinet had turned down on 4 November a proposal by theSecretary of State for Social Services that these savings should insteadbe found by an increase in vehicle excise duty (VED).    Since then two things had happened which seemed to the Home and Social AffairsCommittee, which had discussed the matter the previous day, torequire further discussion in Cabinet.    He regretted the very short notice, but the matter was urgent because, unless the Bill was introduced and given a Second Reading very soon, there would be little chance of securing the full  20 million savings in 1977-78.    The two new factors were, first, the total opposition of the insurance companies to the original proposal, which was to recover the money from them and leave them to adjust premiums on whatever basis theyliked;  it had been expected that they would load the increases againstunsafe drivers.    Instead, the Secretary of State for Social Services had had to propose a flat rate charge of  3 to  4 per vehicle, which theinsurance companies would simply collect for the Government as an addition to the premium, and this scheme would be open to much morecriticism.    The insurance companies were prepared to co-operate inthis method of collection, though they reserved the right to attack theBill in Parliament;  and it might be difficult to carry it unscathedthrough Standing Committee.    Second, the Eill had been ruled to be ataxing measure which must be founded upon a Ways and MeansResolution, and this almost put it into the same category as anincrease in VED, but without the same simplicity and certainty of collection.In discussion of the arguments between flat rate or loaded increases ininsurance premiums, it was suggested that a basic point of equity was involved.    It would be difficult to argue that one section of thecommunity, motorists, should be singled out to pay flat rate contributions to the costs of the NHS regardless of needs or means.A flat rate would inevitably be seen as a tax, just like an increase inVED, and motorists - who tended not to be rational in such matters -might even refuse to pay.    Premiums loaded against unsafe drivers,however, would be much fairer and could more easily be presented asa charge and not a tax, levied on those who caused these costs to the nhs.    An alternative to the loading of premiums or a flat rate would be
a percentage increase in premiums, the familiar form of mostincreases, or perhaps a percentage increase in premiums for third party cover, since many of those likely to have accidents, such as theyoung and those running older vehicles, had third party insurance only.Another possiDility would be to collect the actual cost of eachaccident from the insurance company concerned, leaving it to thecompanies to make whatever adjustments to individual premiums theychose to cover this additional liability.    But it was already possible under the present law to recover costs where liability could be provedagainst the motorist concerned;   and experience suggested that thiswould be a very costly and ineffective way of seeking to recover suchcosts.Against the idea of loaded premiums, it was argued that this newimpost would be unpopular whatever form it took;  but a flat rate wouldbe only slightly more unpopular than loaded premiums, whereas itwould be very much simpler and easier to collect.    It would beinvidious that insurance companies should not only collect whatamounted to a new tax but also to decide the precise rate of the tax asbetween their clients;  and this might indeed cause more resentmentamong motorists than a flat rate charge.     The co-operation of thecompanies was important, and the reopening of negotiations with them would prejudice this and would delay the Bill.    On the other hand itwas suggested that a row with insurance companies would be preferable to a row with the motoring population at large.    Insurance companies were both well qualified and accustomed to assessing risks anddiscriminating between their customers.    It was their habit to protest against new developments of this kind, but they would operate a schemeinvolving loaded premiums if required by Parliament to do so.In further discussion considerable support was expressed for the viewthat if, notwithstanding the arguments in favour of loaded premiums,the view was taken that a flat rate system was unavoidable onpractical grounds, there would be every advantage in increasing VEDby the requisite amount and so avoiding the need for a highlycontentious Bill in Parliament and for requiring insurance companies to take on the job of collecting agents.    Alternatively, a very small increase might be made in petrol tax;  petrol prices were going up allthe time and the increase would be little noticed.    Moreover, therewas some correlation between the rate of petrol consumption and the incidence of road accidents, though express hypothecation of theadditional revenue would have to be avoided.    Against this, it was strongly argued that the choice was not between a Bill or an increasein taxation, but between a Bill or other cuts in Department of health and Social Security (DHSS) programmes.    The saving to be achieved by the Bill was being scored as a public expenditure saving, and theInternational Monetary Fund had been informed accordingly.    the proceeds of the Bill would be offset against NHS expenditure and
would reduce the DHSS vote.    But an increase in VED or in petrol tax would not count as a public expenditure saving and would not reducethe DKSS vote; it was not possible to hypothecate tax revenue.    Theincrease would reduce the public sector borrowing requirement,although not public expenditure, and if no other DHSS savings weremade in compensation, the contingency reserve for 1977-78 would bereduced by  20 million, and that amount less would be available tomeet claims from all Departments.    Control of public expenditure would become impossible if spending Ministers could proposeincreases in taxes vaguely relating to their area of responsibility inorder to avoid real savings in public expenditure programmes.In discussion of Parliamentary and political aspects, it was suggestedthat the Bill as drafted would not cause comparable difficulty to theproblems experienced over the provision in the Social Security bill relating to unemployment benefit for occupational pensioners, whichhad recently been lost in Committee.    Government supporters would recognise that the proposals were preferable to the alternative, whichwould be further cuts in the NHS or increased prescription charges.On the other hand it was suggested that all the arguments that had beencanvassed in the Cabinet&apos;s discussion would be raised in parliament and that, while the Bill would no doubt obtain a Second Reading without difficulty, there would be considerable difficulty in maintaining theform of the Governments proposals in Committee.    This was not thekind of issue which it was desirable to have before Parliament at thetime of the Stechford by-election, particularly given the very high proportion of motorist voters in that constituency.    Moreover, theinsurance companies would inevitably stress in their requests for payment of premiums that an addition had been forced upon them bythe Government, and they might well blame the Government for any increase in premiums however caused.    Such notices from insurance companies might be reaching motorists just before the next local elections.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that threedifferent viewpoints had been expressed in the Cabinet:  in favour of a flat rate scheme imposed by Parliament;  in favour of a scheme whichpermitted or even required the loading of premiums by the insurance companies;  and in favour of an increase in VED or perhaps in petroltax.    The general view of the Cabinet tended towards loading ratherthan a flat rate.    The Cabinet were not, however, in a position toreach a firm conclusion as between this or an increase in VED orpetrol tax without further consideration, and it would be important tohave the views of the Secretary of State for Trade, in view of his responsibilities relating to insurance companies.     Accordingly theCabinet should continue their discussion of the matter the following week.    In the meantime, officials should draw up a paper for circulation to the Cabinet setting out the facts and considerationsrelevant to each of the possible options.3
The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion andinstructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangefor a paper by officials to be circulatedaccordingly.The Cabinet discussed the situation arising from the fact that sevenParliamentary Private Secretaries were amongst those Labourbackbenchers who had voted the previous evening for the TribuneGroup&apos;s amendment to a Conservative Motion on the Government&apos;defence cuts.THE PRIME MINISTER said that although Parliamentary PrivateSecretaries were not members of the Government, they were in aspecial relationship to Ministers and, as the Cabinefs discussion hadamply confirmed, it was not tolerable that they should feel free to vote against the Government and remain Parliamentary Private Secretaries.He would arrange for this to be made clear to all ParliamentaryPrivate Secretaries and for the existing guidance to Ministers to bebrought up to date accordingly;  and the individual Ministers whoseParliamentary Private Secretaries had voted against the Governmentshould make a special point of speaking to them to ensure that theyunderstood the position.The Cabinet -2.

2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatMr Richard had completed his first round of consultations in southern africa.    He had explained our ideas for a transitional government inwhich we would be prepared to play a direct role to the four front-linePresidents, the nationalist leaders, Mr Smith and Mr Vorster.    Hehad not made much progress with Mr Smith or Mr Vorster.   Mr Nkomoand Mr Mvigabe had taken a hard line and were generally unhelpful.The talks with President Kaunda and President Nyerere had beenslightly more hopeful.    The overall picture was not however promising,and he had to consider whether to send Mr Richard on a second round of consultations or to bring him back to London to report.    He would shortly be letting his colleagues know his conclusions.    We had beenin close touch with the outgoing United States Administration whosepublic statements had been excellent.The Cabinet -Took note of the statement by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.
HOUGHTONCOMMITTEEON financial aid TOPOLITICALPARTIES3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president of the Council (CP(76) 84) about the handling of the Report ofthe Houghton Committee on Financial Aid to Political Parties.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was not necessary for the Cabinet to reach conclusions at this stage on the detailed issues arising on the Report.    He proposed that there should first be a Commons debate in order to test Parliamentary opinion.    Inthe course of this it could be made clear in general terms that, subjectto the views of the House, the Government were disposed to accept themain principles of the Report.     There had been some preliminary discussion within the Parliamentary Labour Party which revealeddifferences of view and it would be desirable to attempt to secure agreater degree of agreement within the Party before the debate was arranged.    In the light of the debate, legislation (for which there wasnot now time in the present Session) would be necessary to implement the Report.    The various detailed Issues could be considered by ministers before the Bill was prepared.In discussion it was suggested that it might be preferable, havingregard to the divisions of opinion amongst the Government&apos;s supportersand in the House generally, for any debate to take place on a &quot;take note&quot;or other Motion which made it unnecessary for the Government to commit itself to a view.    Such a debate would serve *o educateopinion both as to the Committee&apos;s recommendations and as to theproblems of Party organisations which underlay them, whereas a debate which revealed serious differences of view on this subjectbetween the Government and sections of their supporters would,whatever the formal outcome, merely encourage their political opponents and possibly put at risk a satisfactory later outcome to theissue.    The point was made that there was unlikely to be anopportunity for a debate in the Commons until after Easter although itwas also widely argued that it was important to make progress sooner or later on the recommendations in the Report.    The problems of party organisations would be increased by the cost of elections for theEuropean Parliament, although the difficulties of the Labour Partyrelated, in general, less to the cost of elections than to normal annualrunning expenses.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would wish to return immediately after the Easter Recess tothe question of how the Report should be handled and that the lord president of the Council should bring the matter before them againthen in the light of his appraisal of opinion at that time.    They should,at the same time, consider more fully the merits of the Report&apos;srecommendations.    If the Cabinet were to decide to implement theReport it would be important not to move until they were certain of a parliamentary majority for this policy.
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office13 January 19777
