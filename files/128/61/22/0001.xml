I   FILAMENTARY      1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theA* FAIRS House of Commons during the following week.Nuclear Test Ban       THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been in touch withTreaty President Carter and Mr Brezhnev about the negotiations for a comprehensive test ban treaty, and both agreed that we should participate in them from the outset.    He proposed to announce this in the House of Commons that afternoon:  and the full trypartite discussions would probably begin before the end of July.    We hadalready had bilateral discussions with United States officials andthe latter had had similar bilateral discussions with the Russians.It was difficult to forecast the chances of success in the tripartitenegotiations.    The question of peaceful nuclear explosions was likely to be particularly difficult given the difficulty of distinguishing between them and explosions for defence purposes:  we would haveto listen to what the Russians had to say.    We should do our best tomake the talks a success.The Cabinet -1.      Took note.Finance Bill THE PRIME MINISTER said that following the Government&apos;s defeatsin the Committee Stage of the Finance Bill on 13 June the Chancellorof the Exchequer would be considering the options open to theGovernment before Report Stage in the second week of July.    Itwould then be necessary to table the appropriate amendments and toensure that all the Governments supporters understood thatirresponsible action could not be allowed to determine the shape ofthe Chancellor&apos;s Budget.    The Parliamentary Party would have toconsider the Chancellor&apos;s further proposals in that light:  and he intended to make this clear at a meeting of the Party the following week.In discussion it was suggested that the Chancellor&apos;s proposals shouldbe put to their supporters in the most constructive way possible.This could be achieved if they were seen as necessary to facilitate apackage of further reflationary measures.   The tactics to be usedover the next few weeks were a matter of political judgment, but itwould be a mistake to risk an adverse reaction from theGovernment&apos;s supporters now when there was a good chance that thewhole economic and political climate would improve in the autumn.On the other hand it was argued that the amourt of headroom forsignificant additional tax reliefs or public expenditure increases(other than could be financed from the contingency reserve) was very limited.    The Party should also be made to realise that the twobackbenchers who had voted against the Government had voted withthe Opposition on amendments which tended to benefit taxpayers on higher incomes.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that alater decision would be needed on the amendments to be tabled forthe Report Stage of the Finance Bill.    He himself would explain theposition clearly to the Parliamentary F arty the following week.Meanwhile Ministers should be careful to avoid prejudging theChancellor&apos;s decision in any public speeches or contacts with thePress.The Cabinet -2.      Took note.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that progress on direct elections was essential in order to maintain in being the pactwith the Liberals and thus ensure the survival of the government this Session and next.    The most contentious issue in the framing of the pact with the Liberals had in fact related to direct elections.The Cabinet at its meeting on 26 May had asked for a Bill to beprepared providing for direct elections on a regional list basis but with alternative provision in a schedule for elections on the basisof a simple majority system.    Accordingly a draft Bill had beenprepared.    It provided as a first choice for a regional list systembut, if an appropriate amendment were moved and carried, a simple majority system also set out in the body of the Bill would insteadapply.    It was evident in discussions held the previous evening withrepresentatives of the Liberal Party in the House of Commons thatthey had not fully appreciated that the Bill was weighted in favour ofthe regional list system in the sense that unless an appropriateamendment were approved the legislation would be based on thissystem.    It was desirable to avoid an early vote on a reasonedamendment regretting the absence of a simple majority system and the Bill was designed to avoid this trap and to give the House a clear choice between the two systems.    The draft Bill would beconsidered by Legislation Committee on 21 June and would be presented to the House on 23 June.    It was planned to hold theSecond Reading debate in early July.The main question for decision was whether the Government should clearly recommend a regional list system.    This was what the liberals wanted but this request was an addition to what they had asked before.    The commitment in the pact with the Liberals on direct elections was only to take full account of their views.    If sucha recommendation were not made by the Government this would notbreak faith with the Liberals but the future of the arrangement withthem would undeniably be placed in some jeopardy.    On these groundshe felt that, on balance, the Cabinet would be justified in recommend-ing a regional list system but a decision on this would not be essentialuntil the following week.Direct elections to    e EuropeanAssemblyPreviousReference:CM(77) 21stConclusions,Minute 1
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatit would be very strange if when presenting the Bill the government did not say which electoral system it recommended.    A decision was not however necessary until the following week when Membersof the Cabinet could have studied the draft Bill.    The Home secretary should therefore circulate to the Cabinet, if possible by the weekend, copies of the drafc Bill together ,vith an explanatorycovering note, a recommended course of action and the amendmentwhich would be needed if the regional list system were to be replaced by a simple majority system.    The Cabinet would consider thematter at their meeting on 23 June and this would replaceconsideration of the Bill by the Legislation Committee.The Cabinet -3.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up and invited the HomeSecretary to proceed accordingly.3
I OREIGNAFFAIRSC ommonwaalthHeads ofGove rnmentMeeting2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting had goneremarkably smoothly.    The problem of Uganda had been dealt within a way which would not have been possible three months earlier.Indeed if the Meeting had been held earlier the future of theCommonwealth would have been at grave risk, and if it had endednow without Commonwealth condemnation of President Amin&apos;section, people in this country would have questioned the continuedpurpose of the Commonwealth.    As it was the Meeting had been successful.    It had been possible to reach an agreed statement onSouthern Africa and some useful work had been done on the after-math of the Conference on International Economic Co-operation.There had been an opportunity to establish good relations with thenew Indian leaders and relations with Bangladesh had also been improved.    The Commonwealth leaders had gone out of their way,both in the meeting and in private conversations, to pay tribute tothe prime Ministers skilful and patient chairmanship, and it was right that the Cabinet should know the part which this had played in achieving a successful meeting.THE PRIME MINISTER said that before the Meeting opened several of those who attended had been beginning to question the value ofthe Commonwealth.    Bui by the end all the participants had recognised its value .    This applied particularly to Nigeria, whoserepresentatives arrived in a eomewhat bellicose frame of mind butdeparted with a much happier attitude towards commonwealth membership.    There was also a greater recognition that we didnot seek to run the Commonwealth but had interests which we had as much right to defend as anyone else.    We should face difficultdecisions over both Rhodesia and South Africa in the weeks ahead and it would be necessary to give early collective Ministerialconsideration to the possible scenarios.The Cabinet -Took note.UgandaPreviousReference:CM(77) 21stConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatwhile the condemnation of President Amin&apos;s regime by theCommonwealth Conference was satisfactory we faced a difficult situation in that country.    The Ugandan Government had assertedthat the French were allowing their Embassy to be used for subvers-ive purposes and had told the French Ambassador that the BritishInterests   Section must be moved elsewhere.    The French had beenrobust in defending our interests and it was intolerable to be told to seek help from a different country.    He had therefore decided towithdraw the British Interests Section altogether last night togetherwith their families.    He also proposed to tell the Saudi ArabianAmbassador that the Ugandan Interests Section in London should be
removed.    The question of the Ugandan officials working for thecoffee organisation was being considered in conjunction with the HomeOffice.    They would probably be told to go within the next few days.We now had to consider urgently the future of the support we gave tothe Ugandan Army and Police and of our commercial relations withUganda.    This involved, among other things, the supply of lorriesthrough the Crown Agents and the regular NAAFI supplies for theUgandan forces which were despatched from Stansted Airport.    we also had to take into account the possibility of Ugandan default ontheir debts.    These matters were being looked into by officials andhe expected to make proposals next week.    There was also theproblem of the European Community&apos;s relations with Ugandathrough the Lome Convention, including the provision of  15 millionaid.    His aim would be to suspend the aid so far as it went to theUgandan Government while leaving that which went for humanitarianpurposes unaffected.    He would be discussing this privately withthe Foreign Ministers of the Community the following week.    Therewere still 220 British subjects in Uganda who were at risk.    Weshould need to bear this in mind in any future action we took.These people had, however, lived in Uganda since we broke offrelations knowing that there was little we could do for them.The Cabinet -2.       Took note.United Kingdom/ THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that the purpose ofUnited States Air        the current negotiations was to secure fairer opportunities for services Agreement   British airlines.    Until the beginning of June reasonable progress had been made and it looked as though an agreement would bepossible.    The United States airlines and Civil Aviation board had then embarked on a campaign of lobbying in Washington whichhad resulted in the United States negotiator being forced to withdrawconcessions previously made.    By the beginning of this week, wewere no bettar off than we had been at the start of the negotiations,and possibly worse.    There had been a slightly more favourablemovement in the last two days, but the existing agreement was dueto expire next week.    If we could not reach agreement we facedthe possible suspension of scheduled air services between theUnited Kingdom and the United States.    He hoped this could be avoided, but the situation was a serious one.    If a breakdownoccurred, the practical effect would be that people from the UnitedKingdom would have to travel via Canada and British Airways hadalready made dispositions with this in view.    United States airlineswould use Amsterdam and probably also Brussels.    The French hadbeen generally helpful to us, and Paris was unlikely to be open tothe Americans.    These diversions would cause great inconvenience,although if they did not last more than a week or so the cost wouldnot be enormous.   As regards tourism, there was unlikely to be5
serious disruption since charter flights were covered by a separate agreement which would not be affected.    There was a further meeting that morning and he would keep his colleagues informed of developments.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had been in touch with president Carter and had received a not very helpful reply.    If theUnited States did not make satisfactory concessions it would be amatcer of fine judgment whether to accept a breakdown when itwas likely that public opinion would not accept a suspension of services for long.    The crucial question was who would suffermost from a suspension and whether we could hope subsequently to revive the negotiations in circumstances which would proveadvantageous tc us.    The situation should be kept under closereview by a small group of Ministers which he would appoint.The Cabinet -3.      Took note.6
TRANSPORT 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theWHITE PAPER Secretary of State for Transport (CP(77) 60) covering a draft of theproposed Transport Policy White Paper.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRANSPORT aaid that the draft white Paper was the end product of a long process of consultations,beginning with the issue of a consultative document 2 years ago.This was a difficult field, in which there were strongly held views,and where there were differences both between and within the trades union involved.    He had attempted to reconcile all these views.The White Paper needed to be judged as a whole, and not by reference to individual parts.    His proposals were framed withinthe constraints of existing public expenditure provisions because hethought it wrong to seek the Cabinet&apos;s approval to additional expenditure.    He had therefore concentrated on reordering prioritiesor proposing policy changes which had no expenditure implications.The main features of Ids policy were a reallocation of resources togive higher priority to public transport;  new powers and obligationsfor local authorities, including powers of traffic management intowns and a requirement on non-metropolitan counties to publishannual public transport plans;  increased emphasis on the transportproblems of rural areas;  the abandonment of the idea of a nationalstrategic network of high grade roads (despite the consequences forthe construction industry); and appropriate emphasis on energyconservation.    He made no proposals for the establishment of anational transport planning authority, because it was difficult to see what functions it would perform, especially with the creation of hisnew own new Department, but he kept open the possibility of anEconomic Development Committee for transport.    His policy wasnot anti-motorist.    There would inevitably be some impact on prices,but his proposals would mean, for example, that the rise in bus fareswould be 10-15 per cent lower than that implied by the last public expenditure White Paper, and the Government could take credit forthis.    His proposals involved no additional loss of jobs in thetransport industries and he had not sought major manpowereconomies on the railways.    The main outstanding problem was thefuture of heavily-loss making and mainly rural railways.    Unless theGovernment were prepared to commit itself to an open ended subsidy to the order of an extra  200- 250 million a year by the mid-1980ssomething had to be done about this problem, and his proposals(which had been modified in discussion with other Ministers),represented a realistic attempt to solve this problem.    Although this aspect of the proposals might be difficult, he did not expect serious criticism of the rest of the White Paper, and indeed it should findconsiderable support in many quarters.    He was anxious to publishit as soon as possible, before the conferences of the Transport andGeneral Workers Union (TGWU) and the National Union of railwaymen (NUR) in July, and he was confident he could successfullydefend it at those conferences.    It would be a mistake to delaypublication further, not least because of the danger of leaks.7
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that at their meeting on 17 May the Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategyhad invited him to take the chair of a small group of Ministers toconsider the draft White Paper in the light of their discussion.That group had made considerable progress, and reached broadagreement on the draft now before the Cabinet.    It now made clear and specific proposals for dealing with the problem of cost-ineffective railway lines, by putting the responsibility upon theBritish Railways Board (BRB) to identify those lines which failed topass a financial test and which contributed nothing to the railwaynetwork as a whole;  by imposing a requirement on the Secretary ofState to decide whether there were any overriding national reasons why a line should be kept open;   and if he did not intervene, by placing ultimate responsibility on the local authorities concerned todecide whether the line should be kept open by a subsidy from them or whether the service could   be better provided by buses.    the losses on some of theiie lines were very high and it was essentialthat a more effective means of bringing about closures should befound.    He thought that the reactions of the TGWU would be broadlyfavourable, and he did not expect very serious opposition from theNUR.    He agreed that the White Paper should be published as soonas possible, and accordingly he had asked that it should be brought forward to the Cabinet direct, without being again considered by the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy.In discussion, it was pointed out that the draft would causes considerable concern to the Governments supporters, particularlyin those shire counties where they had suffered heavy defeats in therecent local elections.    It would be difficult to explain to them whythe Government now proposed to hand over extensive new transportresponsibilities to those local authorities which had recentlychanged hands.    The Government also depended heavily upon thesupport of the NUR for the success of the next wage round, and itwould be unwise to forfeit this by producing proposals which theywould resist.    The proposal to transfer responsibility for theuneconomic local railway lines to local authorities would not reducethe total of public expenditure unless it were accompanied by a morerigorous closure policy.    There was little chance of carrying theproposed legislation, and it was therefore unnecessary to provokecriticism by bringing forward a White Paper at this stage.    Itmight be better to have further extensive consultations with all the interested parties, including the transport unions, before committing the Government to a new policy.On the other hand, it was argued that there had already been extensivediscussions before the White Paper was drafted.    The proposals would not reduce public expenditure in the short term, but wouldtransfer responsibility progressively from central to local government,.The additional expenditure was however small in relation to the budget of any one authority.    Moreover, the adverse reactions of localauthorities could be reduced if the Government were prepared to
meet 100 per cent of the costs of support to threatened railway services in the first year in which local authorities becameresponsible for them, rather than the 70 per cent TransportSupport Grant proposed by the Secretary of State for Transport.But the ultimate aim of the proposals was to reduce total public expenditure, and this implied some reduction in the size of therailway network, .Jn all, some 2, 000 miles, or 20 per cent of thepresent network, was at risk.    Local authorities had alreadydemonstrated, by their rigorous approach to the question of finance for rural bus services, their ability to apply strict tests of costeffectiveness.    It was desirable that they should do so;  for if theGovernment did nothing about this problem, the alternative wouldbe a substantial bid for additional public expanditure in the 1980s.There was general agreement on most of the proposals containedin the White Paper;  the crucial problem was that of localresponsibility for railway closures.    If it were made clear that theproposals in paragraphs 95 - 100 of the draft White Paper weretentative at this stage, and were put forward for discussion with thelocal authorities and others, there would be less objection to early publication.    It would also be helpful if a reference could be includedto improving existing inter-city services.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said theCabinet agreed that the White Paper should be published as soon aspossible.    Paragraphs 95 - 100 dealing with closures of railway lines, should be redrafted to make clear that the cost of supportcould not be allowed to escalate indefinitely, and that some means ofcontaining them, not excluding closures, was needed.    The Secretaryof state is original proposals in that paragraph should then be putforward in a tentative way as one possible solution to the problem,which the Government would now be prepared to discuss with thelocal authorities and other interested parties, together with anyalternatives they might suggest.    The Secretary of State for transport should circulate to members of the Cabinet suitableamendments which should be cleared by correspondence.The Cabinet -1.       Took note with approval of the summing upby the Prime Minister of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Transport to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office16 June 19779
