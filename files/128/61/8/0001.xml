DIRECTELECTIONSTO THEEUROPEANASSEMBLYPreviousReference^CM(77) 5thConclusions,Minute 6The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of the Cabinet(CP(77) 20) covering a paper by officials on the electoral systems of other member States and possible electoral systems open to theUnited Kingdom Government for direct elections;  and a memorandumby the Secretary of State for the Home Department (CP(77) 15)covering the draft of a White Paper on direct elections.THE PRIME MINISTER said that recent discussion both with theNational Executive Committee and with the Parliamentary LabourParty had underlined the major political problems which legislation on direct elections would involve.    On the other hand the Governmenthad certain commitments which it could not ignore.    He suggestedthat there should be a free-ranging discussion concentratingprimarily on the options set out in the note by officials and that inthe light of this the Cabinet should subsequently consider the draft white Paper and the handling of the situation.In discussion it was argued that the introduction of legislation for direct elections in the present Session would lead to seriousParliamentary difficulties.    A guillotine would be required;  and theLabour Party would be deeply divided.    The legislation might passbut the Party would be demoralised.    A substantial number of its members were still opposed to direct elections as such.    Many more were worried about the electoral consequences for the Party of a first past the post system:  and if a form of proportional representation were adopted to avoid an electoral debacle this woulddivide the Party for different reasons.    In accepting a commitment to best endeavours to introduce direct elections in 1978 we had under-estimated the difficulties.    We could not be expected to undertakemajor constitutional changes without the full-hearted support of theGovernment Party a.nd under a guillotine procedure.    Indeed theconsequences to our interests in Europe of a failure to use our best endeavours would be less damaging than those of dividing the LabourParty.    It would therefore be desirable to bring out in a White paper the very great difficult?es of proceeding quickly to direct elections:these were inherent in our constitutional traditions and did not ariseto the same extent for other member States, and they would justify our continuing to nominate members to the Assembly.    Thecontinental electoral systems were not essentially more democraticthan nomination would be in the United Kingdom.    There were seriousconstitutional and political objections to any arrangements whichallowed a divergence to arise between the balance of power at westminster and the Party composition of a United kingdom delegation to the Assembly.    There was also a danger that separateAssembly elections would allow the growth of European Partiesrivalling national Parties and with different programmes.    Thewhole question of the future character of the Community and our role in it should be fully debated in the Labour Party before we undertook
any further political engagement of the kind implied by directelections.    Indeed it was arguable that if we proceeded in this way we shall not be abandoning our best endeavours but would have tomake it clear that there could be no early prospect of legislation.On the other hand it was argued that while the difficulties of proceeding to direct elections might be formidable, our widerinterests in the Community would suffer seriously if we were not seen genuinely to honour our commitment to use our best endeavours to prepare for elections in May/June 1978 even if we ultimately hadto accept failure.    We should therefore fulfil the commitment inThe Queen&apos;s Speech to introduce legislation.    Failure to proceedthus far would also threaten the unity of the Party.    As a first stepwe should present a White Paper in response to the Report of theSelect Committee which would develop the case both for our traditional electoral system and for some form of proportional representation which would accord with the interests of the LabourParty.    It would still be open to the Government to conclude in thelight of reactions to the White Paper that it would be impossible tosecure the passage of the legislation, though there was a risk thatit would become evident that legislation could be passed with opposition support, which would again be damaging to the LabourParty.    On the other hand the Government should not go out of its way to court defeat.    The best course would be to concentrate onreconciling the Party to direct elections and devising an approach which would minimise dissent within the Party and improve itsprospects of electoral success.    A system of proportional representation which clearly reflected the real distinctions betweenAssembly elections and national elections would be most satisfactoryfrom this point of view.    The longer term future of the community would take years to evolve and a decision on direct elections couldnot await on this.    Furthermore the risk of the growth of EuropeanParties rivalling their national counterparts was one of the factorsthat should lead the Labour Party to participate fully in directelections.    There were grave objections to a failure to honourany international commitment and particularly the commitment to direct elections to which the Community attached great importance.This would be damaging to the Governments general standing in thecountry and abroad and a political bonus to the Opposition.    Directelections at some stage were inevitable and a decision could not beindefinitely deferred.    The possibility of an electoral debacle forthe Party should not be exaggerated, and a refusal to allow directelections to take place would in itself be electorally unpopular.In further discussion it was argued that a balance must be foundbetween the Governments obligations in the Community and its responsibilities to the Party.    It would not be possible to proceed to direct elections if the result would be to break up the Party so that it2
would not contest the elections effectively.    Electoral matters were as much the concern of the Party as of the Government.    the dilemma was that our traditional electoral system would produceinequitable results and would court defeat for the Government inthe short term.    On the other hand a proportional system wouldinvolve a hazardous departure from our electoral traditions whichwould have adverse constitutional consequences.    This dilemmacould largely be avoided by holding direct elections to the Assemblysimultaneously with national elections and applying a compulsory dualmandate.    In this way the primacy of Parliament would be fortifiedagainst the federalist threat implied by separate direct elections tothe Assembly.    The Labour Party could accept this course whichwould accord with our Treaty commitment to direct elections andwould correspond in effect to the continental system.    It would not however satisfy our commitment to hold elections in May/June 1978and we would have to continue to nominate members until a GeneralElection was held.    Alternatively direct elections could be held onan interim basis pending a General Election, with candidates chosenfrom the House of Commons to stand in multi-member constituencies.A dual mandate would be no more burdensome to the membersconcerned than Ministerial office and some solution might be foundto the problem of the implications for Party voting strength at westminster.    There were however dangers in a dual mandate,which would tend to expose dissension within the Party at the timeof General Elections, and it would be difficult to prepare for directelections if they coincided with General Elections.In continued discussion there was general support for the view thatwe must be seen to continue to use our best endeavours to proceed to direct elections.    The White Paper should however expose thefundamental constitutional issues and their relevance to electoralsystems rather than necessarily commit the Government to a specificcourse of action.    There should be consultations with the Party bothbefore and after its publication.    Subsequent Parliamentary debatemight then reveal the genuine constitutional difficulties for theUnited Kingdom of proceeding to direct elections, or pave the way for legislation.    Such a White Paper might refer to the options ofthe system recommended by the Select Committee, some form of proportional representation allowing for regional lists and a compulsory dual mandate.    Divergent preferences had been expressed between these options and there need be no finalcommitment to any of them.    But in this way two possibilities for meeting our commitment to May/June 1978 would be kept open, as would be essential if we were to continue to be seen to be using our best endeavours.    A compulsory dual mandate related to the dateof a General Election would not meet our commitment to a date, butit might prove to be the only means of proceeding to direct elections.3
A firm lead might well secure Party support for proceeding to direct elections, given a suitable electoral system.    There wasno reason why a constitutional measure should not be subject to atimetable Motion, or why it should not be carried with Oppositionsupport.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were agreed that the United Kingdom must be represented in the Assembly.    There were also strong arguments for saying thatarrangements should be made by the present Government and not leftto a possible future Conservative Administration.    In that way theywould best accord with the interests of the Labour Party.    Wewere committed to use our best endeavours to proceed to directelections in May/June 1978, but we were faced with genuineconstitutional and Parliamentary difficulties.    To introduce legislation which would court defeat would not be consistent withour commitment.    This would be better served by further discussion.Whether this would allow us to be ready for direct elections inMay/June 1978 was not yet clear.    The Government had a need tocarry the Parliamentary Party, the National Executive Committeeand the Party in the country with it as far as possible, and could notbe expected to carry legislation against the wishes of a majority inthe Government Party.    The Home Secretary, in consultation withthe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary, should prepare a new draft of the White Paper including much of the present material butcovering also the other options identified in the Cabinet1 s discussion.Whether the Government should express a firm preference betweenthem should be considered at a further meeting of the Cabinet in mid-March on the basis of alternative paragraphs representing a firm preference and an open position.    Meanwhile the HomeSecretary should explain to the newly formed joint sub-Committeeof the National Executive Committee the approach of the Cabinetboth on the substance of the issues discussed and on the procedure to be followed.    He would himself write to the Chairman of theParliamentary Labour Party to explain the procedure which theGovernment had in mind, and to offer a discussion of the substanceafter the publication of the White Paper.    He would also arrange toinform the Opposition of the procedure to be followed, as an indication that the Government was pursuing the matter.    In replying to anyenquiries all members of the Cabinet should confine themselves toletting it be known that the Cabinet had held a full and seriousdiscussion, had confirmed its commitment to use its best endeavours to hold direct elections in May/June 1978, had recognised the considerable problems which arose from the difference between ourconstitutional traditions and those of our partners, had discussedpossible courses of action and had reached no final conclusion, but would be publishing a White Paper as a basis for discussion within afew weeks.    Members of the Cabinet should not disclose their4
personal views.    The Cabinet, should also have before it at its next discussion of direct elections a fuller paper on the option oflegislating for a compulsory dual mandate on which the Secretaryof State for the Environment should be consulted, and a furtherpaper on a system of proportional representation allowing for regional lists.The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinisters summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Home Secretary, in consultationwith the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary,to circulate a new draft of the White Paper onthe lines indicated in the summing up fordiscussion at an early meeting.3. Invited the Home Secretary to explain the Governments approach to direct elections to the relevant sub-committee of the national executive Committee.4. Took note that the Prime Minister would communicate as he proposed with the Chairmanof the Parliamentary Labour Party and the leader of the Opposition.5. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinetto arrange for the preparation of further papers on legislation for a compulsory dual mandateand on a system of proportional representationallowing for regional lists.Cabinet Office28 February 19775
