PARLIAMENTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.Water Charges        THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the SecondEqualisation Bill     Reading of the Water Charges Equalisation Bill had now beenrearranged for Monday 24 January.    Owing to the late start to the session there were problems about getting the Bill through by thetime required, which the loss of the business on 17 January had addedto.    But there was nothing to be done except to press ahead with theBill as quickly as possible.f Dtland andWales Bill:Timetable MotionPreviousReference:CM(76) 43rdConclusions,Minute 1THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it would benecessary to wait until the conclusion of the fifth Committee day onWednesday 26 January before considering further the timing of atimetable motion on the Scotland and Wales Bill.    Soundings wouldbe taken next week to assess whether a timetable motion could thenbe carried, and it was conceivable that a recommendation on thematter would be put to the Cabinet on 27 January.The Cabinet -Took note.1
FOREIGNAFFAIRSRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM(77) 1stConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat following Mr Richard1 s first round of consultations, there seemed no possibility of making progress unless we were able to putour proposals on paper.    Following consultation with the PrimeMinister he had therefore authorised Mr Richard to hand over the document attached to his minute of 17 January.    It had been carefullydrafted in the form of suggestions rather than as a cut and driedBritish plan, and its contents were well within the guidelines agreed by the Cabinet on 23 November.    It was difficult to say what theprospects were.    Some of the African leaders had proved veryelusive and it had not yet been possible for Mr Richard to have afurther meeting with Mr Nkomo and Mr Mugabe.    Mr Richard had therefore visited Cape Town first and had now gone on to Salisbury.The Nationalists might be prepared to accept our suggestions as areasonable starting point;  and the South African Prime Minister,Mr Vorster, might possibly support them on the same basis, although no report had yet been received of Mr Richard&apos;s talk with him.Mr Smith had however got himself into a rigid position and it washard to say what his eventual reaction would be.    He was not a veryclever politician;  the sensible thing would have been for him to try to conciliate Bishop Muzorewa but instead, as had been reported inthe Press recently, he had antagonised him by hanging eight of his supporters.    Mr smith s rigidity might be partly explained as reaction to the strong support given by the front line Presidents to the PatrioticFront.    In the meantime thought was being given to possible alternatives should the present initiative fail.The Cabinet1. Took note of the statement by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.Meeting of the        THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that theCouncil of first meeting of the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) under theMinisters British Presidency on 18 January had gone well.    However we faced(Foreign Affairs) a difficult six months on fisheries questions, and our task would not18 January be made easier if there were Press reports, such as had appeared in the Guardian that morning, of alleged differences on this issuebetween the Foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Ministry ofAgriculture, Fisheries and Food.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that several recent Press reports about differences between ministers had probably been the result of deliberate misrepresentation for political reasons.    It was all the more important therefore that ministers should be on their guard against this.2
The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.3
INDUSTRIAL 3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the SecretaryDEMOCRACY of State for Trade (CP(77) 8) on the report of the Committee of--- Inquiry on Industrial Democracy under the chairmanship of statement on Lord Bullock to which was annexed a draft statement which theBullock Report       Secretary of State proposed to make at the time of publication of thereport.    They also had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP(77) 9) to which was attached an amended draft statementfollowing discussion in the Ministerial Committee on economic strategy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that industrial democracy was anexplosive political issue.    The Government was firmly committed by its Manifesto and the social contract to a radical extension ofindustrial democracy by means of the representation of workers onboards of directors.    This would result in fundamental changes insociety and if successfully carried out could bring very great advantages in economic performance.    However the cause ofindustrial democracy would not be advanced by forcing throughlegislation against a commitment from the Opposition that theywould repeal it at the first opportunity.    To proceed in that way as the Tory Government had with their Industrial Relations Actwould involve a great risk of disrupting the improved workingrelationship between management, unions and the Government whichhad been carefully developed.    People needed time to get used toany new idea and he was sure that the first step towards durablelegislation was to provide time for consultation.    The draft statement which he had circulated followed this course.    he believed the draft would be acceptable to leading members of theTrades Union Congress (TUC) but would certainly result in a veryangry response from the Confederation of British Industry (CBI).Even the consultation which he proposed might not in the end avoid the major split and polarisation of views to which he had referredbut the effort should be made.    The legislation which would beintroduced would be a landmark in industrial history and everyeffort should be made to secure its success.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE emphasised his long-standing personal commitment to the promotion of industrial democracy, the achievement of which he would regard as a majoradvance.    He nevertheless did not believe it was necessarily to beachieved on the basis of the recommendations of the majority of theBullock Committee.    Publication of the Bullock report would undoubtedly give rise initially to a hostile reaction by the CBI andby management.    Nevertheless it was his belief that they could be moved to acquiesce in legislation for industrial democracy and thatit was worth a major effort to do this.    It was also necessary tosecure the active support of rank and file trade union members which certainly did not exist at present.    So long as this support4
would only come about at the positive initiative of the employees inthe company, met many of the major points of concern which hadbeen expressed in advance by the Opposition.    The draft circulatedby the Prime Minister maintained a judicious balance betweenindicating that the majority proposals would be the basis for consultation without committing the Government to those recommendations, and should not be weakened.    It was furtherargued that the statement should go further than repeating the commitment already clear from the terms of reference of theBullock Committee and should specifically renew the Government&apos;scommitment to parity of representation which had been set out in the tuc-Labour Party Liaison Committee Document &quot;The Next ThreeYears&quot;.    That document was a solemn agreement with the TUC onwhose support the Government depended.    On the basis of theGovernment1 s commitment the TUC had given the Governmentbacking on many issues which had not been welcome to the union movement.    The opposition of the CBI to industrial democracy waspart of a political policy to defeat the Government and at the sametime was grounded in their fear that the introduction of democracywould destroy management prerogatives.    No concessions on the detailed proposals would lead them to end their opposition.On the other hand it was argued strongly that it was necessary to have full regard to the reactions which the Government statement would arouse.    If it gave the impression that the Government was committed to the majority recommendations which were not wellthought out it would unnecessarily provoke opposition from the CBI.While conflict with them might be inevitable in the end it should notbe brought about unnecessarily or any earlier than necessary.Their opposition, while misguided, was genuine rather thanpolitically motivated.    Open conflict could well result in the CBIwithdrawing from the National Economic Development Council anda range of other organisations in which they participated jointly,and in their putting pressure on the Opposition to commit themselvesto repeal the legislation at the first possible opportunities.    Inaddition the need for flexibility must be a constant objective.    Theadvantage lay in the Government not being identified with these recommendations so that the CBI criticism was directed not at theGovernment but at the majority report itself.    It would be unwise togo further than indicating that the majority report would be the basis on which consultation would start.It was pointed out that although the draft statement referred to aGovernment decision on the extension of industrial democracy in the nationalised industries this issue had not been previously consideredby the Cabinet.    Nevertheless there was general agreement thatemployees in the nationalised industries should be given a right torepresentation at board level though the precise arrangement mightdiffer from those in the private sector.6
In relation to public services it was argued that there werefundamental differences between these services and industry so thatit was inappropriate to refer to industrial democracy in the public services.    There might be some advantage in using in the statement the phraseology used by the Minister of State, Civil service department in his Parliamentary Answer of 11 February 1976.    Onthe other hand it was argued that the existing draft was unspecificand was therefore not objectionable.The Cabinet then considered specific amendments to the draft statement.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theobject of the statement must be to make clear the Governmentscommitment, to avoid unnecessary conflict with the CBI and at thesame time avoid unnecessary strain with the TUC on whose supportthe Government depended.    The Cabinet were agreed that the draft statement which he had circulated should be amended by making thelast sentence of the third paragraph into a new paragraph so as toemphasise the extent of flexibility which could result from theapplication of the majority recommendations.    The third and fourthsentences of the fifth paragraph should be deleted.    In their place anew sentence should be introduced after the first sentence of theexisting sixth paragraph indicating that the Government would beginconsultation on the general basis of the recommendations in themajority report.    The final sentence of the paragraph should bereplaced by the corresponding sentence in the draft circulated bythe Secretary of State for Trade but with the replacement of thewords &quot;mutually acceptable solutions&quot; by the words &quot;a lastingsettlement&quot;.    The paragraph should then conclude with theGovernments intention to bring forward legislative proposals in thepresent Session.    In the penultimate paragraph, dealing with the nationalised industries, the words &quot;as in the private sector&quot; shouldbe deleted.    Further consideration would need to be given to whetherit would be preferable to replace the final paragraph of the existingdraft dealing with the public services by an alternative formulationdrawn from the Parliamentary Answer, Minister of State, CivilService Department on 11 February 1976.    In addition a finalperoration was required.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and noted that he would circulate the revised draft to members of the Cabinet.7
devolution to SCOTLANDAND WALESPreviousReference:CM(76) 42ndConclusionsMinute 4Referendums4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council on the main features of the referendums on devolution to Scotland and Wales (CP(77) 3).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the basicprinciple of having referendums had been settled, and theannouncement to this effect had already proved its worth in parliamentary proceedings on the Scotland and Wales Bill.Paragraph 3 of his memorandum summarised the recommendationsof the Ministerial Committee on Devolution Strategy (DVY) on themain characteristics of the referendums.    The most difficult issuesconcerned the participation of English and Northern Irish voters,and the posing of a question on independence.    DVY were convincedthat both these ideas must be firmly opposed, despite the inevitablepressure for them in Parliament.    As regards the other aspects,having a decentralised count might expose politically awkwardoutcomes in Shetland and Orkney, but this possibility could not be avoided.In discussion, there was general support for the DVY recommendations.Resisting any question on independence might not be easily achieved in Parliament, but the inclusion of such a question would make itmuch more difficult to defend confining voting to Scotland and Wales.It was noted that the position of Service voters was being studied.The possibility of reconsidering the position of Shetland and Orkneyin the light of the referendum results should not yet be finally ruled out.    On the formal status of the referendum, it was desirable toavoid describing the outcomes as binding;  this could be an awkward precedent and indeed might be constitutionally impossible.There was no doubt that in practice the Government would have toact on the results, whatever they were, in spite of the embarrasment in this particular case if there were a low turn-out and/or only an arrow majority in the outcome.    There would be some pressure toextend the referendum to English and Northern Irish voters;  but itwas further argued that the possible outcome of such an extensionwould be likely to create much more difficulty than resisting theextension in the first place.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the recommendations in paragraph 3 of CP(77) 3.Any further related issues concerning Shetland and Orkney could bediscussed later, as necessary.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.8_    J
House of Commons  The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord President of representation        the Council on levels of representation in the House of Commons inthe light of devolution to Scotland and Wales (CP(77) 4).    A backgroundnote by the Constitution Unit was relevant to the discussion(CP(77) 5).THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that aspects of the role and numbers of Members of Parliament for Scottish and Welshconstituencies after devolution had already attracted much attentionon proceedings on the Scotland and Wales Bill.    It seemed certainthat sooner or later amendments requiring change from the presentsituation would be pressed to a vote.    Logically, role and numberswere distinct issues, with the former being the more relevant and important;  but the impractability of any kind of &quot;in-and-out&quot; votingrights meant that no material change in respect of role was feasible.This meant that pressure fell all the more strongly upon the issueof numbers - that is, the present arithmetical over-representationof Scotland and Wales.    The present position would be indefensiblein equity, and to try to stand on it would run a high risk that parliament might impose specific changes damaging to theGovernment.    It would be better to make a measured concession,in the form of agreeing that future levels of representation for allfour countries of the United Kingdom should be considered by the speaker&apos;s Conference if the result of the referendums were to bringthe Scottish or Welsh devolution schemes into operation.In discussion, there was general support for the Lord Presidentsproposal.    In particular, it was noted that evaluations of thepossible effect of reducing Scottish and Welsh and increasingNorthern Irish representation to parity with England in electoratesize suggested that the likely effect in Party terms might be more limited than was often supposed, and that only in quite exceptionallyclose-run General Elections would it have altered the governingParty.    A limited concession of the kind proposed by the lord president would, on the whole, be helpful in the Northern Irelandcontext.    Any changes agreed upon following the Speaker&apos;conference could hardly come into effect until well into the 1980s,and the prospect of possible changes might make necessary somedeferment of the Boundary Commission&apos;s current work programme;such a deferment would not necessarily be disadvantageous.    the timing of the proposed concession, and its presentation toGovernment supporters, would however need careful consideration.It would be important to ensure that the Speaker&apos;s Conference tookinto account the major differences between the Scottish and Welshdevolution schemes.
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet endorsed the Lord Presidents proposal for conditionalagreement to refer levels of House of Commons representation tothe Speaker1 s Conference, and he would write accordingly to the leader of the Opposition.    He would consider further with theMinisters concerned the timing and presentation of this.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.10
PUBLICEXPENDITUREWHITE PAPERPreviousReference:CM(76) 31stConclusionsMinute 45. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP(77) 2), covering a paper by the Chief Secretary,Treasury and a draft of Part 1 of the 1977 Public Expenditure white paper.THE PRIME MINISTER said that there was insufficient time at thepresent meeting to go through the draft White Paper.    However itreflected the expenditure decisions which the Cabinet had already taken, and embodied no new policy issues.    If any Minister hadpoints on the text, these should be put to the Treasury before theend of the week.    Such points should, if possible, be settledbilaterally since if any matter had to be brought back to the Cabinetin the following week (when there would in any case be anotherheavy agenda) it would delay publication of the White Paper.    Subjectto that, the Cabinet agreed that Part 1 of the White Paper should bepublished as soon as possible.The Cabinet1.Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s statement.2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,subject to any amendments to be agreedbilaterally, to arrange for publication at anearly date of the draft White Paper attachedto CP(77) 2.11
ROAD TRAFFICCASUALTIESBILL6. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary ofthe Cabinet (CP(77) 7) to which was attached a note by officials onthe Road Traffic Casualties Bill.previous reference:CM(77) 1stConclusionsMinute 1THE PRIME MINISTER recalled that the three main optionsconsidered by the Cabinet at their last meeting were a flat ratecharge per vehicle as in the present draft Bill, a levy on insurerswhich would allow them to load premiums according to risk and anincrease in Vehicle Excise Duty (VED) or fuel duty.    He invited the further views of his colleagues on these options.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that hehad become more and more convinced that a levy on insurers wasnot a viable option.    The delay involved in further discussions with the insurers would mean that the required savings for 1977-78could not be secured.    The Government would either have to prescribe the method of adjusting premiums, which would presentgreat difficulty, or accept the probability that, left to themselves,the insurers would impose a flat rate charge and blame it on theGovernment.    If therefore an increase in duty were ruled out, he favoured going ahead with the present draft Bill.    But his own view was that the objections to an increase in duty were notoverriding.    The principle of hypothecation of tax revenue hadalready been accepted in the case of the Child Benefit schemewhich involved a transfer of resources from tax allowances to thepayment of benefit.    The Chancellor&apos;s revenue-raising power neednot be pre-empted if the requisite increase in duty were announced by him as being specifically related to the purpose of recoupingthe costs of road accident cases.    The difficulty about treating theadditional revenue as a public expenditure saving was one which applied equally to the present draft Bill which had been ruled to bea taxing measure.    To obtain the sums required by increases induty would offer considerable advantage, not least the ability to dispense with the costly bureaucracy which would be required to collect the money under the proposals for legislation.In discussion there was considerable support for the view that ofthe options presented by legislation to recoup road accidenttreatment costs, a flat rate charge, as provided for in the draftBill, was to be preferred.    Either measure would be veryunpopular and there would be particular difficulties in the proposalto make non-payment a criminal offence, which was unprecedentedin the case of a tax, but the option of a levy on insurers appearedto offer no advantages to offset the further delay which would be involved.    Although the possibility of carrying the Bill in the house in its present form could not be entirely ruled out, there was everylikelihood that it would fail, so that the Government would incur agreat deal of odium with the motoring public without having anything12
to show for it.    It was strongly argued, however, that the alternative to legislation of the kind proposed was not to increase VED or fuelduty but for the Secretary of State for Social Services to findalternative savings from his expenditure programme as had beenagreed by the Cabinet in July and reaffirmed in their discussion on  November.    It would seem nonsensical to attribute a small proportion of VED to National Health Service (NHS) road accidenttreatment costs.    The difficulties and objections of principle to establishing a correspondence between tax revenue and expenditure were very real as had been found in the past in the context of proposals for a Road Fund;  and the Government should be especiallywary at the present time of setting a precedent which might be seized on by the Scottish National Party to justify the hypothecationof oil revenues.    If the Secretary of State for Social Services couldnot find alternative savings, the Contingency Reserve for 1977-78,which at   650 million was already uncomfortably low and lower thanat the corresponding time last year, would have to be reduced by theamount required.It was suggested that out of a total budget of over  5, 500 million for the NHS, it should not be too difficult to find alternative savings of  20 million in 1977-78.    It was pointed out, however, that theSecretary of State for Social Services had already agreed to save 15 million on drugs, which involved difficult negotiations withdoctors and the pharmaceutical industry, and that after prolongedefforts he had, shortly before Christmas, secured the agreementof the Chairmen of the Regional Health Authorities to a programmeof reductions in administrative costs.    The choice for further savings probably lay between prescription charges and a general reduction of services and costs in the NHS, and either of these wouldbe highly unpopular with the Party.    Reductions in general NHS costs in Scotland would be very hard to achieve, and it might there benecessary to find the savings from some other expenditure programme.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas a strong view in the Cabinet that legislation to recoup the costs of NHS treatment of road accident casualties could not be got throughthe House and that even if it could be, the consequences would be politically damaging.    It was agreed, therefore, that the draft Billshould not be taken any further and that there would be no point in pursuing the alternative scheme of a levy on insurers which wouldalso require difficult and contentious legislation.    The Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had made it clear that he was not prepared to increaseVED or petrol duty to offset the loss.    If therefore the sum was notto be a charge on the Contingency Reserve - and thus affect theclaims of other Ministers - the Secretary of State for Social services would have to find alternative and politically achievable public expenditure savings.    He should consider this further and report back to the Cabinet in due course,13
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for social Services to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office20 January 197714
