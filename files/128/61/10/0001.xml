1. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER reported that therehad been a meeting the previous evening between the Secretaries ofState for Industry and for Employment, the management of british leyland and representatives of the Confederation of Shipbuilding and engineering Unions (CSEU).    It had been agreed that two statements,one by British Leyland and one by the CSEU, would be issued at noonthat day.    The British Leyland statement would say that the companymade a positive declaration of its desire to agree a phased programme to pay comparable wages to employees performing the same jobthroughout Leyland cars as and when incomes policy permitted;  thatthe company would be opening all its plants for production on Monday21 March;  and that if the toolmakers did not report for work then theywould be deemed by the company to have terminated their employment.The CSEU statement would say that the desire for separate bargainingarrangements for toolmakers could not be conceded;  that they acceptedthe company decision to reopen the plants involved in the stoppage;and that the Executive of the CSEU endorsed the decision of theExecutive Council of the Amalgamated Union of Engineering Workersnot to support its members if they refused to return to work forthwith.A group of Ministers had considered these statements at a meetingearlier that morning and agreed that, when they had been made, a short statement should be issued by the Secretary of State for Industry onbehalf of the Government, welcoming these steps to end the disputeand expressing the hope that the move would be successful.    Thestatement would also say that the Government would be reviewing thefuture of British Leyland;  and that the Ryder Plan would in any casenow need to be reviewed, though how drastically would depend on howsoon full production was restored.     It appeared that Mr Len Murrayhad not so far been consulted about the latest developments, and the secretaries of State for Industry and for Employment would thereforetake the opportunity during the morning to discuss the proposedGovernment statement with him.The Cabinet -Took note.1

THE 4. THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELANDSHIPBUILDING referred to the minute of 11 March which he and the Secretary ofINDUSTRY State for Industry had sent to the Prime Minister about the needfor an immediate decision on a deal with Shell which would providea major shipbuilding order for Harland and Wolff (H and W).Harland and Wolff       Shell had a requirement for 2 Liquid Gas Petroleum Carriers(LPGs) of advanced design.    They had been on the point of orderingthem from a Japanese shipbuilder but had been dissuaded by ministers.    Discussions with Shell had reached the stage where anorder could be placed for the two LPGs to be built at H and W onthe basis of a package whereby Shell would lease the ships from a specially created leasing company formed by H and W and the fourLondon Clearing Banks.    An immediate decision was neededbecause Shell had indicated that they had an option on an alternativeleasing arrangement which expired today.    The deal would have adirect public expenditure cost to the Government of  12 million,plus a possible  1 or  2 million more if the ships were notdelivered on time.    The proposals involved taking full advantage ofcapital allowances on the same terms as could be done by companies in the private sector.    The package was in line with the Cabinet&apos;sendorsement on 17 February of the use of joint leasing companies aspart of the shipbuilding interim strategy.    The order would provide2, 000 jobs for 2 years at H and W who had not had an order since1974.    Shell were satisfied that H and W alone among UnitedKingdom yards had the professional and technical capability to dothe work.    The LPGs were a new breed of ships and it was important for the future that British shipbuilding had atechnological capability to make them, otherwise a potential newmarket would be lost to our competitors.    If the order were not given to H and W the prospects for the firm and its labour force were very bleak and these difficulties would inevitably worsen thepolitical, social and economic problems of Northern Ireland.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that H and W hadreceived  140 million in subsidies since 1966, over half the totalhelp given to the United Kingdom industry as a whole.    A year agoa corporate plan from H and W had been requested but nothing hadbeen received.    The  12 million direct public expenditure cost wasonly a small part of the real cost of the proposed package.    Thetotal cost to the Government of the leasing package would almost certainly exceed the cost of the direct subsidy ( 34 million) whichwould have been needed to make H and W competitive with theJapanese bid.    Treasury officials had estimated that the total costof the ships under the leasing arrangements, net of any liabilitiesto meet the costs of late delivery, would be  74.9 million as against 70 million under a direct subsidy approach.    The penalty for latedelivery could be up to  3^ million, the last H and W ship was delivered 15 months late;  and the new ships were of a new advancedkind where delays were more likely.    Even the lesser sum of the direct subsidy would represent about 100 per cent subsidy and this
was quite out of line with the 20-30 per cent criteria agreed forsubsidies in the shipbuilding interim strategy.    The packageamounted to a large tax avoidance scheme which wotild give the banks a massive  5.8 million profit in tax reliefs for putting up 20, 000 on the setting up of their leasing company and providingperiodic advances during the construction period.    No private company could indulge in risks of the order involved without government backing so it was a distortion to say that the packagewould simply enable the public sector to enjoy the benefit ofarrangements available to the private sector.    There was a real risk of heavy criticism in Parliament and from the Press andthe business world if the Government accepted the deal, and a riskof pressure for similar deals elsewhere in the public sector whichwould involve tax avoidance to an extent which the Governmentcould clearly not accept.    H and W had orders which would keep them busy to the end of 1978 so there was plenty of time to seekalternative orders if the Shell orders were placed elsewhere.    Inhis view it would be disgraceful to proceed with this proposal.In discussion it was argued that the Japanese price of  36 million was artificially low and reflected 1970 prices.    This was only possible because of massive government subsidy.    If theGovernment wanted * aticoessful shipbuilding industry it would haveto be built on subsidy.    The H and W yards had received massivepublic inve stment which had given them the potential to makeadvanced ships such as the LPGs and it would be wrong now to denythem the chance.    The shipbuilding strategy would not recover ifthese orders went elsewhere;  and the consequent problem atH and W and their implications, political social and economic for northern Ireland were extremely powerful factors in favour of placing the order there.In further discussion it was argued that the Government could not possibly accept a proposal which involved such blatant taxavoidance as the proposed package.    However, given the powerfularguments in favour of placing the order with H and W, it wouldbe desirable to re-examine the case for a direct subsidy and to lookmore closely than had been possible so far at the relative costs ofthe proposals, and to consider modifications or alternatives.    Itwas also suggested that more information was needed about the potential world market for LPGs.    There were also possibleEEC and OECD repercussions of the leasing package which therehad been no opportunity to study.    It was accordingly most desirable to have more time to consider the matter and not toreach a hurried decision on inadequate examination of thepossibilities.    Efforts should therefore be made to persuade Shellto give more time for reaching an agreement with the Government.4
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas unfortunate and undesirable that Cabinet should be faced with matters of this complexity and difficulty at such short notice.    Themajority of the Cabinet felt that the scheme proposed by the secretaries of State for Northern Ireland and Industry was unacceptable because of its tax avoidance aspects;  but everyeffort should be made to find a reasonable means of securing anorder for these advanced technology ships which was of greatimportance to H and W.      Shell should therefore be told that theGovernment had a full appreciation of the nature of the problems involved and were disposed to make a financial arrangement whichwould make it possible for Shell to place an order with H and Wfor the 2 LPGs provided that this could be done at a reasonable cost.The Government were not however satisfied with the presentpackage, and particularly with the element of tax avoidance whichit involved.     The Government hoped therefore that Shell coulddelay a little longer before deciding on alternative arrangements in order to allow all the possibilities to be properly explored.Officials of the Treasury and, if necessary, the Foreign and commonwealth Office should be involved in the further discussions.    The Cabinet would wish to consider revised proposals as soon as possible.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited the secretaries of State for Industry and for NorthernIreland to be guided accordingly.
U&quot; TONMEMBERSHIPAGREEMENTSIN THE CIVILSERVICE5. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to his minute of 10 March setting out the conclusions reached on 8 March(EI(77) 3rd Meeting) by the Ministerial Committee on Economic andIndustrial Policy (El) on the response the Government should make tothe request for union membership agreements (UMAs) in the CivilService received from the unions representing industrial staff andthree of the unions representing non-industrial staff.    Whilst El hadnot been particularly happy that the Government should enter into negotiations for UMAs in the Civil Service most members saw them as unavoidable, given that the Government had promoted legislation in this field and could hardly refuse on principle to enter negotiations.It had accordingly proposed that the Government should accept UMAsin principle for the industrials (where the principle had already beenvirtually conceded) and that in relation to the non-industrials it shouldmake it clear that it was not opposed to UMAs.    In both cases itwould be made clear that acceptance of the UMA would be subject to obtaining satisfactory safeguards to take account of the special position of civil servants in their relations with Ministers and parliament.    El had approved the safeguards set out in his minutealthough the Secretary of State for Employment had strong reservations about the third safeguard (paragraph 6c. of the minute).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that he was strongly against any safeguard in a UMA which could be interpreted as indicating that the Government accepted or condoned the principle ofa political strike.    He feared that the proposed third safeguard(paragraph 6c. of the Chancellors minute) could be understood in that way.    He thought it would be preferable to try to negotiate an arrange-ment whereby a union member who was expelled from the unionbecause he did not take part in industrial action could be asked to paythe equivalent of his membership due into union funds rather than be dismissed by his employer.In discussion it was suggested that there was general agreement thatthe Secretary of State for Employments formulation provided a constructive way of achieving the safeguard El had proposed.    It was argued that UMAs in the Civil Service raised important constitutional issues;  any UMAs entered into by this Government would affect futureGovernments and Parliament.    Although there was a strong anddefensible case for UMAs with adequate safeguards the tacticalhandling of this issue required  -great care.    Prior consultation withother political parties was therefore desirable as soon as theGovernment had agreed on its own negotiating position.    The issuesat stake were such that the Government would need to obtain reallyeffective safeguards if the traditional relationship between civileervantsand Ministers were to be adequately protected.    It was however doubtful whether such safeguards would be either adequate orpermanent.    The right course might be to oppose UMAs in principle,at least for the non-industrials, on the grounds that they wereincompatible with the elective principle and with the non-politicalcharacter of the Civil Service.    It was wrong simply to yield to unionpressure over such a fundamental matter.6
On the other hand it was argued that the unions were pursuing a quitereasonable line in requesting negotiations and that it would beprovocative either to tell them that before there could be negotiations the Government needed to consult other parties, or have a parliamentary debate.    Such an approach would make it much moredifficult to get a sensible result from negotiations and to avoidconfrontation.    As an employer the Government should enter into negotiations in good faith and seek to get an agreement which took intoaccount the special conditions of the Civil Service.    It should then beprepared to defend the outcome publicly.    The case for a UMA forindustrials was in general stronger than for non-industrials but a cleardividing line could not always be drawn (e. g. in the prison service)and there were some areas where a strike by industrials could be aspolitically difficult and sensitive as one by non-industrials.    It would accordingly be difficult to treat the two groups very differently.    Theproposed safeguards should apply to both groups except for the safeguardrestricting any IJMA to junior staff which need only apply to the non-industrials.    It was also argued that widening of the conscientioueobjection clause should be regarded as an essential condition rather thansimply a desirable one, so that objections to union membership onsecular as well as religious grounds could be allowed.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that Cabinetaccepted that it would be necessary for the Government to enter into negotiations with the unions for UMAs in the Civil Service, bothindustrial and non-industrial.    The constitutional and political implications-tions of such agreements could however be serious and it would be essential to obtain adequate safeguards.    The Cabinet broadly endorsed the proposals in the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s minute of 10 March,including the safeguards proposed which should, with the exception ofof the second proposal apply both to industrials and non-industrials.The third safeguard should however be revised to incorporate a proposal on the lines proposed by the Secretary of State for Employment whichshould be cleared with El.    It would be very desirable to obtain somewidening of the grounds for conscientious objection but this should notbe regarded as essential.    The responsible Ministers should when they considered the time was right tell their opposite numbers in theOpposition what was being done.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their aiscussion.2.      Invited the Secretary of State for employment to circulate to El a draft of his revision of thesafeguard in paragraph 6c. of the Chancellor of theExchequer&apos;s minute of 10 March.3.      Invited the Lord Privy Seal to be guided accordinglyin negotiations with the trade unions.Cabinet Office15 March 1977 ,

He emphasised that it was essential that all members ofCabinet should observe absolute secrecy about the discussion.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the measures taken last December had transformed the financial context in whichthe Budget was set.     The Government had secured the loan from theInternational Monetary Fund (IMF);  had successfully arranged asafety net for sterling;  and had subsequently raised a commercialloan of some  1-jr billion.    As a result the sterling exchange rate had risen some 16 cents above its low point in 1976 to stand at $1. 71, atwhich it was now nearly stable.     There had been a big increase inthe reserves, probably because of the reversal of leads and lags,and because of this inflow it had been possible to intervene to steadythe rate on three occasions when it had faltered, and to recover thecost of doing so within a few days.    The new short term economicforecast had been based on the assumption that the sterling rate would decline during 1977 in line with the change in United Kingdomcompetitiveness to around $1. 60.    On that basis, the Retail price index (RPI) would be down to 12f per cent by the fourth quarter of1977 on the year-on-year comparison, compared with the 15 per cent which had previously been forecast.    The balance of payments was expected to be in deficit by  500 million in 1977 and in surplus by 1, 500 million in 1978.    The Public Sector Borrowing Requirement(PSBR) was forecast for 1977 at  1 billion lower than the  8. 7 billionceiling agreed with the IMF, largely because of lower interest ratesand lower forecast prices.    However export demand would be rather less favourable, and growth slightly lower than previously forecast,and - surprisingly - unemployment would be slightly lower, aphenomenon which might be caused by a fall in productivity.1
On exchange rate policy, he reminded Cabinet that the extent to whichthis could be managed was limited.    If there were a loss ofconfidence, the rate would plummet;   conversely if confidence ranhigh this could force the rate up,    The preference of both the TradesUnion Congress and the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) wasto keep the rate more or less where it was now, in spite of the factthat this implied a slightly worse picture on the balance of payments and on unemployment.    He himself felt that it would probably be wise to hold the rate at its present level as long as possible, in view of theadvantage this brought through a lowering of the rate of inflation.Past devaluations of sterling had been made necessary by poorindustrial performance, and this was why the industrial strategy was ofcrucial importance.    If the exchange rate were kept up, the year-on-year increase in the RPI could be down to 10 per cent by the end of1977 - although this was dependent upon a number of factors outsideGovernment control, such as commodity prices.    The lower rate of inflation should make it more possible to hold whatever third round of pay policy the Government might be able to agree.    In his view itwould not be possible to afford a higher increase in earnings underround three than that allowed under round two.    Because of this, itwas important to maximise tax reliefs in the Budget so as to improve the chance of holding the pay policy.    From contacts so far with union leaders it was clear that it would be very difficult to get agreement ona third round.    He emphasised the importance from a political pointof view of avoiding a set-back in the next 12 to 18 months of the kind which the Government had endured in 1976.    This pointed to a cautiousapproach to the Budget, although the need to get a pay agreementpulled in the opposite direction and called for generous tax concessions.The judgment to be made would be a difficult one, not helped by theunavoidably large margins of error in the forecast figures and theerratic behaviour of the balance of payments in the last three months.This degree of uncertainty, coupled with the uncertainty about thethird pay round, suggested that there might be a case for leaving atleast some points in the Budget open for a further 2 to 3 months, sothat they would be conditional on events.    He was contemplating incometax reductions, particularly at the bottom end of the scale and at a levelto help middle-management.    Some increase might be necessary inindirect tax to finance this, but he was anxious to avoid increasing theRPI, and would want to justify such increases on energy conservationor health grounds.    There were some possibilities involving additional expenditure which would be sensible - further employment measures,the extension of the Temporary Employment Subsidy and some help for the construction industry - which he would be considering further.He would also like to do something for small companies.In discussion it was argued that while the management of the exchange rate involved a difficult judgment, it would be wrong to do anything which would allow the rate to become uncompetitive.    Recent trends in exports of manufactures showed that the United Kingdom was notobtaining the volume increases which were needed.    The recent2
attitudes survey by the CBI had shown that price constraints wereinhibiting exports.    It could be argued that it had been a mistake toallow the exchange rate to go as high as it now was, so that itoperated against the ixiterests of the industrial strategy.    Themaintenance of the competitiveness of British industry was vital.Over the next few years the country would have a large oil surplusand a large and increasing surplus on invisibles, but there was a danger that the country would run a deficit on trade in manufacturedgoods.    If this happened, the industrial strategy would not be working and the country would become too dependent upon oil revenues.Against this it was argued, not only that what the Government could do to influence the rate against market pressure was limited, butthat the achievement of competitiveness by way of the exchange rateinvolved the transfer of resources from wages to profits;  and while this might be desirable in view of the need for investment, it might also be the case that the process of price increases withoutcorresponding  wage increases had now gone as far as the unions wereprepared to tolerate.    In any case, the most important single issue in the minds of the public at present was price inflation, and thispointed to the need to manage the exchange rate so as to keep inflationto the minimum.    The increases in Post Office and gas charges had clearly touched a strong chord of public feeling, and unless theGovernment could produce something which looked like an initiative on prices there would be great political difficulty.    Indeed if an agree-ment on a third round of incomes policy proved unobtainable, it wouldbe because the Government had been unable to deliver what had been seen as promises on price inflation when round two was agreed.    Theincrease in gas prices appeared to be a particularly sore issue inStechford, and the Government might well lose the seat at the pendingby-election if no action could be taken to mitigate it.    It was arguable that, if money were available in the Budget for concessions, some of itshould be devoted to general subsidies, particularly fuel subsidies.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theChancellor of the Exchequer would take into account what had been said in reaching his decisions on the Budget.     Tne main points raisedhad been in relation to the sterling exchange rate on which two views were held, and in relation to prices.    It would be necessary to consider what could be done about the latter though he would himself be opposedto reviving wholesale subsidies;  these in any case ranked as public expenditure, which the Government was committed to keeping withinthe published limits.    He enjoined upon his colleagues once again theneed for total secrecy about the discussion they had just completed.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office16 March 1977 3
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no 9CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77)10th Conclusions, Minute 3Tuesday 15 March 1977 at 10.00 amL .LE OF BPSHARESPreviousReference:CM(76) 39thConclusionsThe Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Energy (CP(77) 28) and the Chancellor of the Exchequer(CP(77) 26) about the sale of the public sector shares in british petroleum (BP).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that he wished topress for a reversal of the Cabinet decision of 7 December lastthat 17.4 per cent of BP shares should be sold in 1977-78, reducingthe public sector holding from 68 per cent to 51 per cent.    Thisdecision had been announced and had produced a hostile public reactionMr Murray of the Trades Union Congress (TUC) had written to him in protest.     The Government would be selling the shares at a timewhen they were undervalued - the price would certainly rise whenthe benefits of the Alaska investment came on stream.    There wasno guarantee that the Government would win the lawsuit with theBurmah Oil Company, and if they did not their holding, after theproposed sale, would drop to 31 per cent.    There was no reason inhis view why the British National Oil Corporation (BNOC) should notborrow the money and purchase the shares.    It was absurd to sellthem merely in order to keep down the Public Sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) when the forecast of the PSBR contained sowide a margin of error.    It would be a classic financial mistake tosell a capital asset and use the proceeds for revenue purposes.    Itwould be both psychologically and politically axi error to sell the shares when they were about to rise.    In particular it would be disastrous if foreign governments were able to purchase the sharesand to bring pressure upon BP.    He therefore proposed that a ministerial Committee should be set up to consider how the need to meet the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s financing problem couldbe squared with keeping the BP shares in the public sector.
THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that it was notnecessarily certain that the value of the shares would rise;   they hadin fact fallen by some 28 pence in the last few days.    Of the headroomhe had for concessions in the Budget, half would come from the proceeds of the sale of the BP shares.    The choice was therefore tosell the shares, to let income tax be 2 pence in the pound higher thanit would otherwise have been, to increase the Retail Price Index by1 per cent through indirect taxation increases, or to cut currentgovernment expenditure.    All of these options had been known inDecember when the Cabinet had agreed on the sale.    The last threewould all increase unemployment in a way in which the sale of BPshares would not.    The Government had never intended to hold on tothe shares which happened to come into their possession as a resultof the support given to Burmah, save to the extent needed to raisetheir holding from 48 per cent to 51 per cent.     There was in fact nopoint in holding a higher precentage of the shares unless some changewere made in the relationship between the company and theGovernment, and that would damage BP&quot;s international standing since it would then be seen as a nationalised company.    For the BNOC to borrow for the purpose of purchasing the shares was no help in thepresent situation, since such borrowing would score as part of thePSBR.    It was important for him to have a decision that day on thequestion, since the sale was worth some  800 million in potential taxreliefs.    He would be quite content with the setting up of a ministerial committee to consider subsidiary issues related to the way in whichthe sale should be organised.In the course of discussion the following points were made:-a. The court case with Burmah was likely to take a longtime, partly because of inherent difficulties in the case,partly because it raised points of Crown privilege ofsignificance far beyond the case itself.b. Providing the Governments holding did not fall below 25 per cent, the degree of control the Governmentexercised over BP would not be affected either by the size of its shareholding, or by whether or not it revokedits present undertaking not to exercise voting rights inrespect of the former Burmah shares held by the Bank ofEngland.    The Government had, half a century ago,entered into an agreement limiting the use of their powersof control over the company, and that agreement could notbe changed as long as the Government held a blocking25 per cent of the total shares.    Nevertheless thepossibility of voting the ex-Burmah shares if shares weresold from the Governments portfolio should be further considered.
c. Although the view of the Attorney General that theGovernment were likely to win the case against Burmahwas supported both by the legal advice which the Bank ofEngland had obtained and by independent Counsel, it wasimpossible to be sure of the result.    In this situation itwould be desirable to find some course   whereby the salecould be delayed, and interim financing made available,until the case had been settled, perhaps through using the shares a6 collateral for a loan on the Euro-dollar market.It was, however, pointed out that this would automaticallyincrease the PSBR and count against the international monetary Fund limit.d. The criticism that the use for revenue purposes ofthe proceeds from the sale of a capital asset was badfinancial practice was not relevant, since it had never beenthe Governments intention to hold the shares acquired fromBurmah, which had themselves been purchased from income,except to the extent needed to bring the Governments totalholding in BP to 51 per cent,e. It would be important to avoid sale to foreign government or their agents.    Indeed, it might be possibleconsider restricting the sale to United Kingdom residents,so that the benefit of any increase in the value of the shareswould accrue to the national economy.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that by amajority the Cabinet agreed that the Chancellor of the exchequer should prepare his Budget on the basis that the BP shares would be sold as already agreed and announced.    The discussion had, howeveraised a number of interesting and useful points related to the modeand timing of the sale, and he would arrange for these to beconsidered further by a group of Ministers.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theChancellor of the Exchequer to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office15 March 19773
