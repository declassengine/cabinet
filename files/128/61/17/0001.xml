NORTHERNIRELANDThreat ofDisturbances1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the ministerial committee on Northern Ireland had considered the serious threat of early disturbances and disruptive action by Loyalistorganisations in Northern Ireland led by the United Unionist ActionCouncil, which could interfere with the life of the civiliancommunity.    It was incumbent on the Government to do their utmost to prevent this.    The situation differed from that in 1974in that almost all the Northern Ireland politicians were likely to be opposed to a strike on this occasion and the public generally wouldbe locking to the Government to display firmness and resolutionfrom the start.    It was therefore proposed to declare a state ofemergency in the province on Monday or Tuesday oi the following week, to bring in additional battalions and to make availablespecialist troops to help maintain essential public services.    Hewould be seeing the Leader of the Opposition in order to enlist hersupport for the Government&apos;s action.    The Secretary of State for northern Ireland would make it clear in a speech in Northern ireland on 29 April that the Government were not looking for a. confrontationbut equally were not prepared to abdicate their responsibility for maintaining the life of the community.    He would also refer to the likely effects on the Northern Ireland economy of disruptive action.The cabinet took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;sstatement.PARLIAMENTARY 2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theP &quot;&quot;FAIRS House of Commons during the following week.    It was noted that thepresent intention, which would be announced in the House that afternoon, was that the House should rise for the Spring Recess on27 May and return no sooner than 8 June,It was hoped that the resumption could be delayed until 13 June, but that would depend onthe progress and the state of the business.IndustrialDemocracyin the PostOfficePreviousReference:CM(77) 13thConclusionsMinute 4THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that, following theCabinet&apos;s discussion of this matter on 24 March, there had been further discussions with the Liberals and the Post Office unions,in which the Minister of State, Department of Industry, had played a leading part.    The Liberals had now reluctantly agreed, after muchpressure and argument, to vote with the Government on the Bill toincrease the size of the Post Office Board.    The composition of theBoard would now be 7 management representatives, 7 trade unionnominees and 5 independents, so that there could be two independent members representing consumers, rather than the 6:6:4 formula
previously agreed.    The Liberals were unhappy about proceeding with this experiment in the Post Office in advance of considerationof the report of the Carter Committee on the review of the PostOffice, but had nevertheless agreed to support the Bill.    The waywas accordingly clear to go ahead, and he hoped that anannouncement could be made in the following week, with SecondReading of the Bill in the Commons before Whitsun.In discussion it was noted that the Post Office unions would need to secure authority for their part in the experiment at theirforthcoming annual conferences, and that it was proposed in thefollowing week to reconvene the tripartite meeting between theGovernment and the management and unions in the Post Office to tie up any loose ends.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said the Cabinet agreed that the Post Office (Amendment) Billshould be introduced as soon as any necessary further consultations with the Post Office unions and management and with the Liberalshad taken place.    The Lord President and the other Ministersinvolved were to be congratulated on the success of their efforts to persuade the Liberals to support this Bill, which illustrated the advantages of the arrangement with the Liberals.    without such consultations, the Government would probably have decidedto go ahead without being sure of the attitude to the Bill of the liberals, who might well have voted against it.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Industry toproceed accordingly.OccupationalPensionSchemes bill previous reference:CM(77) 13thConclusionsMinute 5THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that, followingdiscussion of this Bill by the Cabinet on 24 March, he had had ameeting, together with the Lord President and the Secretary ofState for Industry, with Mr Len Murray, who had indicated that theTrade Union Congress were in favour of the Post Office (Amendment)Bill but attached higher priority to the Occupational Pension SchemesBill.    He had then consulted representatives of the relevantParliamentary Labour Party Backbench Groups, and had held a first round of discussions with the Liberals, the Ulster Unionistsand the Scottish and Welsh Nationalists, and these consultationswere continuing.2
previous reference:*   1(77) 16thConclusionsMinute in discussion it was pointed out that, although a two week whitsun recess was desirable and would be generally welcomed, itspracticality would depend upon the number of further government bills which were brought forward.    Moreover there was a risk that, if additional Bills were to be introduced, there would be insufficient time to get them through the Lords as well as the commons in time for Parliament to rise for the Summer Recessby the end of July.    The decision to introduce the Post Office(Amendment) Bill would consequently make it more difficult to accommodate any other new Bills.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said ft was important to ensure that Parliament could rise by theend of July and that there was no need for an overspill.    Membersof the Cabinet who still wished to bring forward additional bills should take full account of this.The Cabinet -2.Took note.FOREIGNAFFAIRSPaki stan3. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYinformed the Cabinet that, while the political position in Pakistanremained unsettled, the introduction of martial law had done agood deal to stabilise the position.rhodesia previous reference:CM(77) 16thConclusionsMinute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thattalks were going on at official level in London with United states representatives and he would be reporting to the ministerial committee on Southern Africa and to the Cabinet next week.    Themain question to be resolved was how to deal with the PatrioticFront, in particular their resistance to the idea of Americanparticipation in a conference.    He did not think this was insolubleand the Americans were keen to go ahead.
Middle East THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said he had just returned from a visit to Syria and Egypt.    There had been achange in the attitude of the Arab leadership and it was now apparent that they wanted a peaceful settlement and might be prepared to takerisks with their public opinion in order to achieve one.    Thesituation should become clearer in July when the United states secretary of State, Mr Vance, would be visiting the Middle Eastagain.    It looked as though there was now a unique opportunity fora settlement.    The Israelis would however have to make somemovement.    This was unlikely until after the election and much would depend on the Americans bringing pressure to bear on them.We might need to reconsider our attitude towards the PalestineLiberation Organisation at a later stage.    President Carter&apos;recent statements about a Palestinian homeland had not beenunhelpful, although the formulation he had used was slightlydifferent from our own reference to a &quot;home for the Palestinians&quot;.During his own tour he had made it clear that we intended to maintain our good relations with Israel and had encountered no criticism onthis account.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.4
4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(77) 38) on the electoral system tobe used for direct elections to the European Assembly and related matters.THE HOME SECRETARY said that his paper set out the considerationsrelating to the choice of electoral system as well as those relating to parliamentary procedure and the timing of legislation.    On the choice of electoral system, there was considerable support in the House forthe simple majority system, but this would be bitterly opposed by theLiberal Party who would also resist any Boundary Commissionrecommendations.     The single transferable vote (STV) system wascomplex and enjoyed little support though it was the first preference of the Liberal Pax*ty.    A regional list system would be supported bysome members of the Conservative Party, despite their preference forthe simple majority system, because they would not wish to delaylegislation.     This was the explanation for Liberal opposition, ofwhich the Government must take account, to a vote on the choice of electoral system in advance of a Bill.    A regional list system would produce less extreme results than a simple majority system.    Itshould be adopted for the whole of the United Kingdom.    On procedurean Affirmative Resolution would be required to give effect to theCommunity Decision of 20 September 1976 on direct elections.    Thiswould provide an opportunity for a vote on the principle of directelections in advance of legislation.    But there would be disadvantages in such a vote, which would not avoid a further vote on the SecondReading of the Bill.    On timing, a Bill providing for a simple majority electoral system would need to be passed in the present session to allow time for Boundary Commission procedures and this might be difficult.    A Bill providing for a regional list electoralsystem would raise a number of unfamiliar issues and might takemore Parliamentary time but would require little or no action by the boundary Commissions and could be introduced in the 1977-78 Session.The substitution at the Committee Stage of a simple majority for a regional list system would be easier than the reverse procedure andwould offer tactical and presentational advantages.    There was littlesupport for a compulsory dual mandate.    A vote on the principle of direct elections should be deferred until Second Reading and a free vote on the electoral system should be held at the Committee Stage ofthe Bill.In discussion of electoral systems xt was argued in favour of a regional list syatem that its complexity should not be exaggerated.Compared with a simple majority system it would limit the effect of electoral swings on the representation of the major Parties.    a simple majority system would deny representation to the liberal party and might result in derisory representation for one of the major Parties.     There was no reason why a delegation to the
European Assembly should be elected by a system designed to providea clear majority at Westminster.    The election of Assembly membersby a regional list system would help to emphasise that their status wasnot that of Members of Parliament,    It was clear that a regional listsystem could be so operated as to render the election of extremistminority candidates improbable.    Further consideration was needed of alternative methods of operating such a system.    But in so far as itlimited the swing between the major Parties it would be helpful to aGovernment faced with direct elections in mid-term.    It would alsolimit the risk of divergence between the Assembly delegation and theGovernment.    A choice in favour of a regional list system should notbe based on short-term electoral considerations, even though theGovernment was at present concerned with the first direct elections,but on its intrinsic advantages.The risk of encouraging pressure for proportional representation in national elections could be discounted by Parliamentary determination to preserve our present system.    Alternatively, this danger might be avoided by a list system based on the four countries of the UnitedKingdom.     Political Parties would thus have considerable influence over candidates without the need for a compulsory dual mandate whichwould raise insuperable problems.     Extremist minorities could be excluded and Assembl/ members could be given local responsibilities.There would be no implications in favour of proportional representation at national elections, while the risks for the Labour Party of the simple majority system would be avoided.In favour of the simple majority system it was argued that it would notexaggerate the effect of electoral swings in a close-fought election.It could be defended as representative, though not proportionately so,and would avoid according substantial representation to the liberal party.    It should not be too readily assumed that electoral rasultswould necessarily be influenced by Labour abstentions, especiallywhere candidates were critics of our membership of the Community.In some areas a simple majority system would help Labour candidates.A regional list system would be unlikely to produce an overallmajority for any Party and might therefore embarrass a Governmentin office.     The Governments interest lay in simultaneous national and assembly elections.    It would be undesirable even if it were possibleto operate two different electoral systems at the same time.    Mid-termdirect elections would favour extremist minorities especially under a regional list system and increase their influence in national politics.A regional list system would enhance the prospect that proportional representation would be adopted as the method of election to theAssembly in the longer term.    Indeed the Assembly might well insist on determining its own method of election.    Substantial Liberalrepresentation in the Assembly would greatly strengthen the pressure
for proportional representation in our national elections.    TheLiberal Party might even secure greater representation in theAssembly delegation than in the House of Commons unless a compulsory dual mandate were applied, in which case their prospects of representation in the Assembly would be minimised.    A compulsorydual mandate would also help to counter the risk that Assemblymembers would strive for equality of status with Members ofParliament and would also discourage candidates who had ambitionsto hold office.In discussion of the recommendations to be made to the parliamentary labour Party it was argued that they would wish to take a decision onthe principle of direct elections in advance of the introduction oflegislation.    They were not bound by the Governments commitments and major constitutional issues were involved.    Moreover the Househad not ratified the Decision of 20 September 1976 and critics of directejections could claim that the issues had not been exposed at the timeof the Referendum.    Our obligations to the Community and the liberals might be satisfied by submitting this Decision (which related to direct elections in May/June 1978) to a free vote.    TheParliamentary Party could not be expected to vote contrary to thedecision of the Party Conference.    Free votes should be allowed at all stages to members of the Cabinet as well as to junior Ministers andbackbenchers.    This need not prevent the passage of the Bill, but itwould minimise conflict between the Government and the ParliamentaryParty.On the other hand it was argued that although the Parliamentary party should be allowed a free vote on the principle of the Bill, it was not for them to decide whether a Bill should be introduced.     TheGovernment were committed to introduce a Bill by Communityagreement, by the agreement with the Liberal Party and by the queen&apos;s Speech, which the House had accepted.     There was a furtherobligation to the Liberal Party to allow for the possibility of aproportional system of election.    A decision to recommend a simple majority system would be unwelcome to the Liberal Party, but theywould have to recognise that they could not impose proportional representation on the major Parties, and Cabinet were not committed to recommend a system of proportional representation.     Theirobligation would be met if a free vote on the method of election weredeferred until a Bill was before the House.    But if legislation were notintroduced the Liberal Party would De bound to withdraw from itsagreement with the Government.    If a General Election ensued andthe Government were defeated a Conservative Administration wouldlegislate for direct elections on a basis unfavourable to the LabourParty, and the Party&apos;s credibility would be damaged to no purpose.This should be made clear to the Parliamentary Party.    It remainedonly for the Government to decide on its proposals and introduce
legislation for the decision of the House.    Tactically there seemed tobe no advantage and some disadvantage in arranging for a vote on theprinciple of direct elections in advance of the introduction oflegislation, since there was a majority in the House in favour of theprinciple and in any event the commitment to introduce a Bill would remain.     There were grave objections to allowing a free vote for members of the Cabinet even if the passage of the legislation were not affected and it was questionable how far the decision of the party conference was binding.     The possibility of a vote on the principle of direct elections in advance of legislation should not however be ruled out.    If the Parliamentary Party had had the opportunity to express their view in advance of legislation they might be prepared to support a Bill on Second Reading to preserve their solidarity and to avoid a situation in which the Government&apos;s ability to honour its commitmentswas seen to depend on Opposition support.    Further consideration was needed of the precise handling of consultations with the ParliamentaryParty, and those consultations should precede any Parliamentaryaction.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that before deciding on their recommendations to the Parliamentary Labour PartyCabinet would need to give further consideration at their meeting on May to the issues raised in discussion and particularly to themodalities of consultation with the Party.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office28 April 19778
