parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.Subjects forgeneral debate the Cabinet then discussed the approach which the Governmentshould adopt in the current Parliamentary situation to government business in Parliament.    In discussion of subjects for general debate, the point was made that there were likely to be demands for a debate on unemployment and that it would be better to arrangesuch a debate than to attempt to fend off the pressure.    TheSecretary of State for Employment was, however, making a statement that afternoon about further measures to relieve unemployment,which might reduce the pressure for debate.    It was also suggestedthat local government finance and the Layfield Report, on which theConservative Party had no credible policy, and new towns andenergy, would be suitable subjects for general debate, though itmight be desirable for the Government to ha^e reached clearerconclusions on policy in the nuclear field before any debate on thelast of these subjects.    It was pointed out that, although the Sessionwas not now likely to be overloaded, there would not be any appreciable amount of Parliamentary time available for additionalbusiness.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that if there were general demands for a debate on unemployment the right course would be to arrange such a debate, though not next week, and to take this opportunity to explain the governments policies.    It was desirable to have recesses of normal length, andthere might not be a great deal of time for general debate.    TheLegislation (LE) Committee should, however, review the questionwhat would be suitable subjects for debate in the presentParliamentary situation, and report back to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.Post Office(Amendment)bill the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had agreed in principlethat the experiment on industrial democracy worked out in agreementbetween the management and unions in the Post Office should go ahead.The Committee had recognised that there would be some dangers and
controversy, but the proposal was for a two-year experiment,involving two of the most sensible trade unions in the country, whowere very keen to go ahead.    The Conservatives had said theyfavoured experiments in industrial democracy and the introductionof agreed arrangements, so these proposals need not be toocontroversial.    It was essential to increase the size of the PostOffice Board from 12 to 16 to enable the experiment to go ahead, butonly in this respect was legislation necessary, and the Bill wouldhave only one clause and could be introduced very quickly.In discussion there was general agreement on the desirability of proceeding now with this experiment, but doubts were expressedwhether it would be possible to do so without cutting acrossconsultations on the Bullock Report, and whether the necessary bill could be carried without amendment.    It was argued that neitherthe Opposition nor the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) couldbe expected to judge this Bill on its merits;  they would be bound totake the opportunity to deploy the case against the BullockCommittee&apos;s proposals.    The Government had made clear theirwish for the widest possible consultation on these proposals;  andto introduce a Bill to enable worker-directors to be nominated by trade unions, when the question whether such directors should betrade union nominees or should be elected was at the heart of the debate on industrial democracy, would be seen as provocative.Some Government supporters in the House, as well as opposition parties and people in the country, favoured the election of worker-directors;  hence there would be no certainty of carrying the bill through the Commons, and it would be even more difficult to get it through the Lords, if the Government held to the position thatworker-directors in the Post Office must be nominated by the unions.The possibility of their being elected should at least be put to thePost Office unions, although this v/ould conflict with the agreed proposals and would mean that the small unions could expect norepresentation on the board.On the other hand it was pointed out that what was proposed was only an experiment, for two years, which might not become permanent inits present form.    The arrangements proposed had been agreed byall concerned in the Post Office after two years of discussion, andthe Conservative Party and the CBI had said they favouredarrangements in industrial democracy introduced by agreement,without any legislative constraints.    A private firm would be free tointroduce comparable proposals without any legislation, and thePost Office experiment required legislation only because of the need to increase the size of the board.    To proceed with an agreedexperiment in the public sector need in no way pre-empt eventualdecisions on legislation affecting the private sector, and if the natureof the experiment and its background were properly explained it2
should be possible to carry the Bill in both Houses without unduedifficulty.    This legislation would be welcome to the parliamentary labour Party (PLP) and its introduction would demonstrate that theGovernment were not acting as a lame duck Administration.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up this part of the discussion,said that the Cabinet agreed on the desirability of going ahead withthe Bill, if it could be carried.    This would give heart toGovernment supporters and would demonstrate to the country theGovernment&apos;s commitment to industrial democracy.    But tointroduce the Bill and fail to carry it would be a setback to industrial democracy.    It would therefore be necessary to put these proposals to the PLP, and to approach the minority Parties, so as to ensure,before any final decision on the introduction of the Bill was taken,that it would have a Parliamentary majority.    The Parliamentarydifficulties would however be reduced if the worker-directors inthe Post Office were to be elected, and the Secretaries of State for industry and for Trade should therefore consult the Post Officeunions to see whether they would be prepared to agree to electeddirectors.    Ministers would then need to consider the matter further in the light of their response.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister and invited the Secretaries of State for Industry andfor Trade to proceed accordingly.The Cabinet then discussed the kind of legislation which theGovernment should introduce in future.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe Government had to consider what strategy to adopt while withouta Parliamentary majority.    The question was whether to introduceBills which would be popular with the Governments own supportersbut likely to be defeated in Parliament, or whether to take special steps to obtain the necessary support for Government legislation.The aim should be to carry through a positive programme ofdesirable legislation, and Ministers would have to construct thenecessary Parliamentary majorities for their legislative proposals,by putting these proposals to the PLP and obtaining support forthem, and by seeking support from the minority Parties, at the planning stage.    The Legislation Committee should now consider this issue in more detail and report back to the Cabinet.    It was important that senior Ministers who were members of the Committee should attend for this purpose.3

FOREIGNAFFAIRSFalklandIslandsPreviousReference:CM(77) 4thConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs,Mr Rowlands, had recently spent three days in the Falkland Islandsfollowed by discussions in Buenos Aires.    In the Falkland Islandshe had secured agreement that we phould, with the approval of theIslanders, try to establish a basis for negotiations with the argentines involving both economic co-operation and sovereignty.Progress had been made in the subsequent discussions in BuenooAires, although the Argentines still wanted two parallel sets of negotiations whereas both we and the Islanders wanted to discussboth issues together.    V/e had not yet decided whether the Islandersshould take part in the negotiations.    This might raise problemseven if they were to do so as members of our delegation.    But atleast we had secured their support for what we were doing.Although there was some activity by the Falklands lobby in thiscountry, the mood of the House of Commons in the debate on 1 Marchhad been restrained and he thought the House was generallysatisfied that we did not intend to go ahead without the Islanders&apos;agreement.The Cabinet1. Took note of the statement by theForeign and Commonwealth Secretary.Uganda and theCommonwealthHeads ofGovernmentI\   etingPreviousRefer ence:CM(77) 7thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that v/ehad not succeeded in getting the United Nations Commission on human rights to agree in their confidential session to our proposal for an investigation of the situation in Uganda.    We were now pursuingthis proposal in open session where there might be rather morechance of securing the support of some of the non-aligned countries who had voted against the proposal in confidential session.    He wasnot however hopeful about the outcome.    As regards the possibilityof President Amin coming to this country we had already drawn a distinction between the Jubilee events and the Commonwealth Headsof Government Meeting and we might need to be more explicit onthis point.    He had discussed with the Commonwealth secretary general, Mr Ramphal, our intention to take soundings with other commonwealth Governments about the question of President Amin&apos;sattendance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.Mr Ramphal had already said publicly that he was deeply troubledabout the situation.    This was a delicate question to handle:  hewould hope to get other Commonwealth Governments to regard theissue as one which they must take seriously but it had to berecognised that there was not the same public pressure in many other Commonwealth countries as there was here.
In discussion it was suggested that the Commonwealth would betotally discredited if President Amin were to come here and thatwe should not allow him into this country.    In reply it was pointedout that no decision was needed about this at the present stage.There was a strong probability that in the event he would not dareto leave Uganda especially since he had overthrown his predecessorduring the latter&apos;s absence on a similar occasion.    If we were tosay in advance that v/e intended to exclude one particular Head ofGovernment we would be certain to be criticised by all the othersand this would do us no good.    This possibility should therefore beleft for consideration only as a last resort.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewas already proposing to send an emissary to the mainCommonwealth countries in order to seek their views on the agenda for the meeting.    This emissary, who he hoped would beLord (George) Thomson, could also take private soundings of the heads of Government concerned on how the problem of President Aminmight be handled.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.6
NATIONALITY 3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for law the Home Department (CP(77) 23) to which was attached the draftof a discussion document on possible changes in nationality law.THE PRIME MINISTER said that a Group of Ministers under his chairmanship had considered the draft discussion document, andsome changes, including the insertion of a preface, had been madeto it in the light of their discussion.    There had been no disagreementin the Group about the substance of the proposals as a basis for public discussion.    The Group had recognised that there would be adversereactions abroad to some of the proposals and that early legislation on nationality law was not practicable.    They had concludednevertheless that there was little alternative to early publication ofa discussion document:  the Government were firmly and publiclycommitted to this and Mr Lyon, MP, the chairman of the working party of Ministers and officials which had drawn up the report onnationality law, would be ready to keep them up to the mark.    Itwas possible that the proposals would be subjected to some criticismat the meeting of Commonwealth Heads of Government in May, butthe preparatory visits of Lord   Thomson to Commonwealthcapitals would help to disarm criticism.    The purely consultativenature of the document would have to be emphasised.THE HOME SECRETARY said that although it might not be practicable to contemplate legislation for two or three years, the complexity of the subject justified early publication of a discussiondocument.    The proposals in the draft had been put more tentativelythan in the report of the Working Party which had includedrepresentatives of other interested Departments apart from theHome Office.    The British Nationality Act 1948 did not reflect the changes which had taken place in the Commonwealth, and a newnationality law would have the additional advantage of enablingimmigration policy to be rationalised.    The proposals were summarised in the preface to the draft discussion document:  themain proposals involved the creation of two separate citizenships -a British citizenship and a British Overseas Citizenship.In discussion, it was suggested that the proposals were of a very far-reaching character and that their publication could give rise tomixed reactions and much uncertainty.    Since, if allowance weremade for a period of consultation with other Governments of atleast four weeks, it would not in any case be possible to publish the discussion document much before Easter, there might now be advantage in waiting until after the meeting of Commonwealth Headsof Government.    This would also avoid any risk of the proposalsbecoming an issue in forthcoming by-elections.    Mr Lyon should not object to this delay provided that he was assured that the Governmentwere going to publish the proposals.    On the other hand, it was
pointed out that Commonwealth Heads of Government would havecause to complain if publication of the proposals followed too closelyon their meeting in May;  and, to judge by the lack of any strongreactions to the recently published Franks Report on the feasibility of a register of dependants, public opinion in this country was unlikely to be much affected by the nationality law proposals.In discussion of the draft text of the discussion document thefollowing points were made -a. The final paragraph of the preface should betransposed to the beginning which should also be expanded to bring out the fact that the Government fully recognised the complexity of the task of preparating any framework of proposals to take the place of historical evolution in a way which would not create fresh grievances.b. The reference in paragraph 14B to separate passportsfor British Citizens and British Overseas Citizens might berephrased in order to place less emphasis on this aspect.c. Subject to further consultation between the foreign and Commonwealth Office and the Home Office, the referenceto Brunei in paragraph 67 should be omitted in view offorthcoming negotiations to be held with the Sultan.d. Although some of the figures in Annex A to the draftdocument were liable to create misunderstanding, to omitthem altogether might simply direct attention to their absence.    It would be better to deal with the figures bymeans of a narrative passage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that, while some apprehension had been expressed about the far-reachingimplications of the possible changes in nationality law discussed inthe draft document, the Cabinet agreed that the proposals provided a suitable basis for public discussion and that they should bepublished as soon as the necessary consultations with commonwealth and other oversea Governments concerned had been completed.    Infinalising the text of the discussion document the Home secretary would take account of the specific changes which had been suggestedin the discussion and would circulate a revised preface, with the modification and expansion suggested, to himself and the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary for any final comments they might have.8
