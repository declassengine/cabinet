PARLIAMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week and of theintention, subject to the satisfactory completion of that business,that the House should adjourn for the Spring holiday fromFriday^ 27 May, to Monday, 13 June.Police Pay In connection with the Private member s Motion on police pay tobe debated on Monday, 16 May, the HOME SECRETARY said he expected that it would be necessary to impose a settlement in theabsence of agreement.    It would, however, be a difficult matter to announce an imposed settlement shortly before the annual conference of the Police Federation of England and Wales, whichwould take place the week after next and which he would himselfbe attending on 25 May.    He proposed to defer any announcementuntil after the Conference and to take the line at the conference that he still hoped there could be agreement on the offer whichhad been made.    The Federation had behaved badly, but therewere some signs of movement and the leadership might come under attack at the Conference.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SCOTLAND said that he wasunder considerable pressure in Scotland to announce this settle-ment, and he was concerned at the prospect of a further fortnight&apos;sdelay.    The leaders of the Scottish Police Federation had behavedwell and would in practice accept a straight Stage 2 settlementalthough they had pressed for more.    The increases would be payable from last September, and if Scotland alone had been involved a settlement could have been announced long ago;  theScottish Police Federation Conference had already taken place.In discussion it was pointed out that some adjustment of a straight Stage 2 settlement, involving the averaging of increasesbut not increasing the total cost, had been offered in an attemptto secure an agreed settlement in England and Wales.    further delay in announcing a settlement for Scotland should if possiblebe avoided;  but if a straight Stage 2 settlement was announcedfor Scotland in advance of the Conference of the Poii.ce Federationof England and Wales, this would raise the question whether there could in practice be a different settlement for England and Wales;and g-ach a difference hardly seemed practicable.    The probableoutcome was a straight Stage 2 settleme nt for the whole country,and it seemed doubtful whether matters would be made any worsein England and Wales by announcing this before the FederationConference,1
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theHome Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland, v/ith the secretaries of State for Education and Science and for employment, should now consider further, and decide on, the timing and form of an announcement or announcements.    Thegeneral feeling of the Cabinet was that an announcement of thesettlement for Scotland should not be delayed beyond the following&apos;veck;  and, svxbject to the outcome of the further consultationsbetween the four Ministers concerned, the Secretary of State forScotland had authority to make an early announcement relating to scotland, even if an announcement relating to England and wales was deferred.    The settlement should not be presented as oneimposed by the Government, but as a decision to pay the increases for which the Pclice were eligible under Stage 2 although it hadnot been possible to reach an agreement.The Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister,and invited the Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.Occupational pension schemes bill previous reference:CM(77) 17thConclusions,minute 2THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, saidthat he was grateful to the Minister for Social Security for thethorough discussions which he had undertaken on this Bill withthe minority Parties, and on which he had reported in his minute of 11 May,    The Minister would now seek to obtain the views ofthe Scottish National Party (SNP), and the Cabinet would considerthe matter the following week in the light of a further report fromthe Minister on the views of the SNP and on the further discussionhe proposed to have with Mr Len Murray.    The main question might then be whether there was still time to take through such legislation during the present Session.The cabinet.Took note.2
1977 UPRATING OF      2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the SecretarySOCIAL SECURITY       of State for Social Services and the Minister for Social security benefits (CP(77) 45), by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(77) 47) and bythe Central Policy Review Staff (CP(77) 49) on the uprating of social security benefits in 1977;   and a memorandum by the Lord privy seal (CF(77) 48) on the 1977 increase in public service pensions.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thattne next uprating of Rocial security benefits would be importantsince it might be the last before the next General Elections.It would be carefully scrutinised to see if the Government werefulfilling their obligations, and if th^ uprating led to a cut in the living standards of beneficiaries it would cause anger in theParty and lose the Government support in the country.    the argument he wished to put forward was not that the Governmentshould guarantee the beneficiaries aa improvement in real terms,but that, having regard to the inevitable uncertainty of anyforecast made in May of the annual rate of price inflation in thefollowing November, some reasonable margin for forecastingerror should be allowed.    In 1976 Cabinet had agreed to anuprating 4 per cent higher than the forecast price increase, andin the event the whole of this margin had been needed and they only just narrowly avoided an uprating which would have meant a fallin the value of benefits in real terms,    Even if his colleagues were all convinced that 13. 1 per cent, the forecast inflation ratefor the following November, was right, it would be extremelydifficult to convince the country at large that this was so at a timewhen the annual inflation rate was running at between 16 and17 per cent.    Furthermore, in order to make the uprating itwould be necessary to carry an Affirmative Order in Parliament,which might well be difficult.    He had a statutory obligation tomake good any loss of value which benefits had suffered as a consequence of price increases, and under the statute he was required to be satisfied that an uprating would achieve this.    Ifthe uprating were in line with the forecast and the forecast provedwrong, it might well be necessary to introduce a further interim increase in May 1978, when there would undoubtedly be pressure to take account of the further inflation which would have occurredbetween November and May.    Such an interim increase wouldinvolve considerable staff problems and expense.    He did not,however, wish to press for the full 16,3 per cent increase whichhe had proposed in CP(77) 45, and would be content to compromiseat a figure, say, 2 per cent above the forecast race of priceinflation.    He reminded Cabinet that in the last year the pensioners&apos; price index (which was directly related to pensioners&apos;purchasing) rose more rapidly than the general price index, andwas in fact above the last increase in benefits.    To give publicservice pensioners 17-18 per cent while giving social securitybeneficiaries 13 per cent would cause serious public dissatisfaction-tion.    If his 15 per cent proposal were adopted for social securitybeneficiaries, it might be possible to persuade public service3
pensioners to accept the same level of increase.    He thereforecommended a 13 per cent uprating to his colleagues.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that he fully accepted that the forecast of price inflation was necessarily uncertain;  butit was the best forecast available and he did not see how theGovernment could disown it for the purposes of an uprating whichpurported to meet the statutory requirement.    A higher figure would imply an intention to give beneficiaries an increase in realterme, which would have to be at the expense of the working population.    The revised proposal which the Secretary of State for social Services had just put forward would mean an increase in therates of long term benefit of  2. 30 for a single person and  3. 70for a married couple;  and while these were only 30p and 50p a weekrespectively more than his own proposal, they would, in a full year, represent a charge of some  170- 200 million on the contingency Reserve.    It was true that the proposal in CP(77) 45would mean increases of  2. 50 and  4 in the long term rates,which were favoured by the Trades Union Congress (TUC) on thegrounds that they would be in line with what was permitted to people in employment under round 2 of the pay policy; but this wasmisleading since wages were subject to deductions of up to41 per cent for national insurance contributions and income taxat the standard rate.    Claims on the Contingency Reserve in thecurrent financial year, including the cost of the proposed uprating,but excluding anything for an improvement in Child Benefit, would leave only about  100 million of the Contingency Reserve uncommitted;while in 1978-79 the Reserve, if all claims were agreed, would be almost over-committed.    He recognised the presentationaldifficulty presented by the forthcoming increase in public service pensions, but the reality was that public service pensions bad risenless rapidly than pensions generally.    The Government had nocause to be ashamed of their treatment of social securitybeneficiaries: pensioners had had an increase of 15 per cent in real terms since the Government took office, at a time when theworking population had suffered a reduction in their real standardof living.    T.f the Cabinet adopted the proposal of the Secretary ofState for Social Services, it would mean that other claims wouldlater have to be refused.THE LORD PRIVY SEAL said that the Cabinet had agreed inDecember 1976 not to try to reduce the increase in public service pensions.    The purpose of the paper which he had circulated wasto draw attention to the relationship between the increase which publicservice pensioners would get and that under discussion for social security beneficiaries.    The public service pensions increase of17-18 per cent was bound to produce a hostile reaction, even thoughfor the average Civil Service pensioner it represented an increase4
of only  3. 50 a week.    To seek to reduce this would produce astrong adverse reaction from the public sector unions;  but if hiscolleagues wished to investigate the possibility he would circulate a paper on che question.In discussion it was argued that the political aspects of the question before Cabinet were crucial.    The Cabinet&apos;s aim in 1976 had been to improve the value of pensions in real terms;  but they had failed to achieve this because of the higher rate of price inflation.To use the Treasury forecast of price increases would run therisk of a shortfall which would be seen as a failure by theGovernment to meet their legal as well as their political obligations and would bring protest from 8 million pensioners and from the tuc.    Indeed, given the fact that to meet the tuc&apos;s preferredlevel of increase would greatly help the chances of achieving anagreement on a third pay round, it would be preferable to go forthe original proposal in CP(77) 45 of a 16. 3 per cent uprating ratherthan the 15 per cent compromise which had now been put forward.It was unlikely that the third pay round would apply limits as tightas the  2. 50- 4 of round 2, and this was a further reason forfavouring a 16. 3 per cent increase.    As a minimum, the compromise proposed by the Secretary of State for Social services should be adopted, since this would give increases only 20p-30pa week below the rates preferred by the TUC.    Presentationallythe Government should not have any difficulty over this, since theycould say that while it provided a safety margin in case the priceforecast proved wrong, it would effect an improvement in real terms if, as was hoped, the forecast proved right.    Conversely,to go for 13 per cent would point up the contrast with public service pensioners (whose increase in 1977 could not be modified becauseof the impossibility of passing the necessary primary legislation in time).    There was the danger that a 13 per cent uprating would cause disaffection among Government backbenchers with the resulteither that the Government would get the Affirmative Orderthrough with the support of the Opposition, which would bedistasteful, or that the Opposition would take the opportunity to defeat the Government on the issue.    In electoral terms it was important that the Government should be able to maintain that,throughout their period of office, and in spite of the deepest economicrecession for 40 years, they had sustained and improved theposition of social security beneficiaries as no Government had done before.    To go for the 13 per cent uprating figure was to riskimpairing that claim.    If it were impossible to bear the cost of higher increases in benefits on the Contingency Reserve, because ofsuch events as the loss of the expected receipts from higher petroltax, then the Government should use the opportunity of the finance bill to raise more revenue for the purpose.5
In further discussion reference was made to the need for areflationary package later in the year to create additional employment for both human and electoral reasons.    A report would shortly be received by the Government from the Manpower services commission which would be relevant to this, and there would clearly be a general desire to take further steps to mitigate theunemployment situation.    This would,, however, cost money; andthe Contingency Reserve was low while the claims on it were high.At the present time the Government could not rely upon reaching an agreement with the trade unions on a third pay round of paypolicy, and if they failed, it would be of the first importance thatthey should be seen to be controlling public expenditure, the public sector borrowing requirement and the money supply.    TheGovernments only legal commitment was to uprate benefits in line with inflation;  and although the present forecast of 13.1 per centcould obviously be wrong, the most up to date Treasury estimatewas somewhat lower (because of the decrease in mortgage interest rates and the reversal of the petrol tax increase); and while itwas true that the forecast was wrong in 1976, it was unlikely thatthe unforeseeable depreciation of the exchange rate which then tookplace, coupled with the effect of the 1976 drought upon food prices,would recur ir 1977.    Any increase above that to which theGovernment were legally committed meant either an additional burden on people in work or a restriction on other public expenditure.    The burden on people in work was already high andled to many complaints which would be intensified the following Aprilwhen the new national insurance contributions came into effect.    Ifthe whole of the 1978-79 Contingency Reserve were pre-empted,the Government faced the risk of either having to refuse any furtherclaims or to undertake, perhaps in an election year, further cuts in public expenditure.    There was therefore a strong case for anincrease limited to 13 per cent.In continuing discussion it was suggested that possible compromisesshould be explored.    For administrative reasons it was not possibleto delay beyond the end of May a decision on the level of the uprating;  but there appeared to be three possibilities not canvassedin the papers before Cabinet:a. Some other compromise between the proposals in cp(77) 45 and 47 might be possible, perhaps differentiatingbetween the increase given to long term and to short termbeneficiaries, with the latter receiving less than 15 per cent.This had some attractions politically, but it was pointed outthat the rate of Supplementary Benefit was linked to that of short term benefits, and this proposal would thereforedepress the relative position of the recipients ofSupplementary Benefit, some of whom were among the poorest people in the country.6
b. If the uprating proved in the event to be lower thanthe actual movement in prices, the position could be made good by giving a Christmas bonus.    At  10 a head this would cost about  120 million, and it was noted that the whole ofthis would fall in the current financial year and cost no lessthan the original proposal in CP(77) 45.    Furthermore itwas argued that, if the bonus were to take account of price increases beyond the forecast rate, it would be impossibleto pay such a bonus before February since it took some four months to make the necessary administrative arrangements.There were differences of view on the political attractionsof such a bonus.    To have any real political impact however,it would need to be paid by Christmas.c. If the uprating proved to be below the price increase,it might be possible to think in terms of a further interimuprating in May 1978, although there were disadvantages,not least in administrative terms, in reverting to twoupratings a year.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that while there was considerable support in the Cabinet for the proposal bythe Secretary of State for Social Services and the Minister for social security for a 15 per cent uprating of social security benefits, otheroptions had been canvassed in discussion on which it would bedesirable to have more information before reaching a decision.Indeed the attitude of some members towards the Chief Secretary&apos;proposal for an uprating of 13.1 per cent was dependent on whether some way could be found to restore the position of pensioners ifthe Treasury forecast of price increases proved too optimistic.    Thetwo basic additional options were a lower percentage increase to be supplemented either by a Christmas bonus for pensioners or by an interim uprating in April or May next year;  and a lower percentage increase for short-term than for long-term benefits.    On the firstoption further information was required on the political and costimplications, including staffing implications, of a Christmas bonusand of an interim uprating;  and on the second option, the relativeadvantages of short-term benefits, in terms of earnings relatedsupplement and the receipt of discretionary allowances, should beevaluated.    The Secretary of State for Social Services and theMinister for Social Security, in consultation with the Chief Secretary,Treasury, should accordingly circulate a further paper, coveringthese further options and showing in each case their effects on the contingency Reserve and on individual pensioners.    The cabinet would resume their discussion in the following week.7
The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services and theMinister for Social Security, in consultation withthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office12 May 19778
