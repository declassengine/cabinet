PI.   LIAMENTARY        1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenAFFAIRS in the House of Commons during the following week.HEALTH AND 2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the SecretarySAFETY of State for Employment (CP(77) 10) reporting his consultationREPRESENTATIVES     with Health and Safety Commission (HSC) and the Trades UnionCongress (TUC) on possible arrangements for phasing the(Previous introduction of proposed regulations under the Health and SafetyReference: at Work Etc. Act 1974.CM(76) 32ndConclusions, THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EMPLOYMENT said that in minute 6 his view when the Cabinet had earlier discussed the introductionof the regulations proposed by the HSC their concern overpublic expenditure had caused them to lose sight of fundamentals.Eight deaths occurred a day in British industry, which lost23 million man days a year through industrial injuries.    TheRoyal Commission on Health and Safety under Lord Robens had estimated the cost of industrial accidents at at least   200 million per annum.     The accident rate was increasing.    It was against this background that the proposed regulations should be considered.As requested by the Cabinet he had consulted the HSC, the TUCHealth and Safety Committee and the Parliamentary Labour PartyEmployment Group.     They had all expressed implacableopposition to any form of phasing of the introduction of theregulations.    The HSC, which included representatives from thelocal authorities as well as from industry and the trade unions were unanimous.    Each employer would have staff in each of thedifferent categories which had been considered for implementationat varying dates and it would result in confusion if rights were tobe given to some staff and not to others.     All the discussions inthe HSC had been on the basis of implementation of the regulationsacross the board at one time.    The Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) saw the regulations as a balanced package whichcould not be split into parts.    Against this background he consideredthat the best course would be to make the regulations at an earlydate but to delay the time in which they were brought into effect,perhaps until 1 October 1978.    As a result of his consultations he believed that if this date were chosen substantial progress could bemade with applying the regulations on a voluntary basis before theyhad statutory effect.    He believed that a realistic estimate of the costs to local authorities for the period from October 1978 to april 1979 would be  12 million although the authorities themselvesstill took the view that it would be higher than this.    In view ofthe difficult public expenditure position he would be willing to find 12 million to meet the local authorities1 costs in the periodOctober 1978 to April 1979 from savings in his departmental budget.Since the public expenditure programme for the period from april 1979 had not yet been reviewed it was not yet possible to see1
how the extra cost of the regulations to the local authorities after that date could be dealt with.    He hoped however it would bepossible to arrive at satisfactory arrangements within the context of the Rate Support Grant.    A final consideration, though onewhich was subordinate to the main argument on merit, was thatto achieve a satisfactory solution to this problem T*?ould removean issue which would otherwise threaten to become an irritantwhich would make more difficult the discussions with the TUCabout the third phase of incomes policy.THE PRIME MINISTER said that it had become known to the TUCthat the Cabinet would be discussing the regulations at 4Mb me.5.tingand he had been very strongly pressed by the TUC to receive a delegation urgently.    He had seen them the previous evening andit was evident that their view that the regulations must beintroduced as a whole without undue delay was very strongly held.He had made clear that a sense of proportion was needed inbalancing the merits of the regulations against the financialconstraints.    He had warned them that it would probably not bepossible to implement the regulations before the year 1978-79and the TUC had indicated their preference for 1 April 1978.la discussion there was general recognition of the strength of feeling in the TUC and of the need to find a satisfactory solution to the problem.    There was however strong feeling the other wayamong Labour groups in local authorities.    It was a regularcomplaint, to which there was a good deal of substance, that theGovernment regularly asked the local authorities to reduce their expenditure and at the same time imposed new obligations upon them.    While there was a need to make a clear commitment tobring the regulations into force, the maximum of scope should beleft for consultation with the local authorities so as to minimise the danger of conflict with them.    For this reason it would be preferable to delay the bringing into force of the regulations until1 April 1979.    It would be preferable to defer a decision on thefinancial arrangements for 1979-80 until they could be fitted in with decisions on public expenditure for that year as a whole.    Itwas most unlikely that the authorities themselves would besatisfied by a commitment on the Governments part to underwritethe costs only for a short initial period.   Nor would a solution which involved the addition of the costs arising under the regulations torelevant expenditure for Rate Support Grant purposes be likely tobe satisfactory for the local authorities who would insist on specificfinancial provisions since they themselves had other priorities for expenditure financed by Rate Support Grant.     There were alsopractical difficulties in a commitment to savings in the budget ofthe Department of Employment since a large part of their expenditure was demand determined.2
Attention was drawn to the additional costs which the regulations would impose on the National Health Service, estimated at 6 million for a full year.    It was argued that the Secretary ofState for Employment should find savings to accommodate the costs of the initial period of operation there in addition to the costs falling on the local authorities.    Attention was also drawn to the effect of the regulations on the education budget and theview was expressed that it would not be tolerable for the costsafter April 1979 to be met out of an unchanged share of the rate support Grant for education.    It was explained that the differingviews between the local authorities on the one hand and industry onthe other about the desirability and value of the regulations wasnatural since circumstances were quite different in the twosectors.    Industry had far more opportunity to absorb costs andthe accident rate in industry was much higher than in most localauthority activities.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas necessary for the Cabinet to come to a solution which would permit an early commitment to bring the regulations into forcewithout undue delay.    The Secretary of State for Employmenthad offered to find savings to finance a reasonable estimate ofthe costs which would fall on the local authorities in the first six months after introduction on 1 October 1978.    This was a generous offer;  to delay implementation after that date would notbe satisfactory.    The view of the Cabinet was that the matter should be settled on that basis.    The Secretary of State for employment should consider whether he could make any contribu-tion to meeting the extra costs which would be incurred in theNational Health Service in 1978-79.    It was however too early tosettle the financial arrangements for the period after 1 April 1979.The local authorities should be informed of the Government1 edecision before any announcement was made, and th* questionof costs after April 1979 would be considered in the normal way.There should be genuine consultation with the local authoritiesabout the -way in which the Governments decision should be implemented, but these detailed consultations need not delay anearly announcement.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.
Ur   )N of post office workers ANDTHE COURT OFAPPEAL3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that if he returned from abroad in time, the Attorney General would make a statement in theHouse of Commons that afternoon explaining his decision not totake proceedings for an injunction to restrain the Union of PostOffice Workers from industrial action directed against SouthAfrica.    This statement would not deal with the question of anappeal to the House of Lords against the judgment which theCourt of Appeal was expected to make that morning.    The decision whether to appeal was one which it was appropriate for the attorney general to take without reference to the Cabinet.The Cabinet -Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.LEGISLATION on human RIGHTSPreviousReference:CM(76) 8thConclusions,Minute 44. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP(77) 6) about legislation on human rights.THE HOME SECRETARY said that in June last year the cabinet had agreed to the publication of a discussion document on human rights legislation partly as a means of heading off an expectedproposal by Lord Hailsham for the reference of Lord Wade&apos;s bill of Rights Bill to a Select Committee.   Lord Wade had reintroducedhis Bill this Session and Lord Hailsham had now put down a motion,which would be discussed in the Second Reading Debate on February, to refer the Bill to a Select Committee.    The time was ripe therefore for a further discussion by the Cabinet in orderto determine the line which the Government spokesman should take in the debate.    His own view was that it would be premature totake any decision about Government legislation on human rights andthat the Government spokesman, while accepting the possible valueof an enquiry by a Select Committee, should reserve theGovernments position on the question of principle.    Public reactions to the Union of Post Office Workers&apos; case currently before theCourt of Appeal made the present an inopportune time to announce a decision on a major constitutional issue affecting the powers ofParliament and the courts.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that he did not believe that theGovernment should support the proposal for a Select Committeesince this would give the Committee and its recommendations thespecial standing which Lord Hailsham clearly intended for it andthere would be a serious danger that the initiative on human rightslegislation would then be taken out of the Government&apos;s handsaltogether.    But it was desirable for the Government to reactpositively, one way or another, to the public pressures whichundoubtedly existed for such legislation.    He had therefore suggested to his colleagues that serious consideration should begiven to the setting up of a Human Rights Commission or similar4
body with appropriate legal and social expertise in order to review the existing law and make proposals for its reform where it mightfail to meet our international obligations on human rights.    In his view, this remedy would be preferable to introducing into ourdomestic law broad statements of principle such as were containedin the European Convention on Human Rights and then leaving it tothe courts to interpret these with little or no guidance.In discussion, there was considerable support for the view that any government commitment to the principle of human rightslegislation as might be implied in the lending of support toLord Hailsham&apos;s motion for a Select Committee would be undesirable.It was also argued that there was a strong case for opposing the motion outright.    Much of the pressure for human rights legislationcame from right wing elements in society who saw it as a means oferecting a judicial barrier against the powers of Parliament and against social reform of the kind to which the Government was committed.    The language of the European Convention was veryimprecise and its interpretation would leave a wide degree of judicial discretion in determining politically sensitive issues.It was alleged by the proponents of human rights legislation thatour existing law was in many respects inadequate to protect therights of the individual;  but if there were defects in the law, theycould be remedied by specific legislation.    To this end and to allay any public concern, there was considerable merit in theLord chancellor s proposal that the Government should considerthe setting up of a Human Rights Commission to review the existing law and make proposals for its reform where necessary.    It was relevant that the new Chairman of the Standing Advisory Commissionon Human Rights in Northern Ireland, after extensive visits in theProvince, had come round to the view that no useful purpose wouldbe served by legislation on human rights, but he had indicated thathe would welcome the establishment of a permanent advisory body to review and suggest improvements to existing law as it affected the rights of the individual.    On the other hand, it was argued thathuman rights legislation was a live issue in the country as a whole;there was a wide measure of support for it in bodies such as theNational Council for Civil Liberties whose sympathies were generally liberal;  and the Human Rights Sub-Committee of theLabour Party&apos;s National Executive Committee had unanimouslyrecommended the incorporation in our domestic law of the EuropeanConvention.    While it might be right therefore for the Governmentto give serious examination to the Lord Chancellor&apos;s suggestion ofa Human Rights Commission, it would be wrong to combine with this a decision actually to oppose the appointment of a House of LordsSelect Committee on Lord Wade&apos;s Bill of Rights Bill.    Such a move,which was in any case unlikely to succeed, would be seen as areactionary attempt to choke off further debate only 6 monthsafter the publication of the Governments discussion document;  andit would be open to widespread criticism.    The Government would5
in any case be in a difficult position in opposing the motion for a select Committee unless it were able to offer a direct alternativesuch as a proposal for aHbu.ee of Commons or Joint SelectCommittee, either of which might be preferable to a House ofLords Committee.    If therefore the Cabinet favoured in principle the Lord Chancellor&apos;s idea of a Human Rights Commission, itwould be desirable to present this not as necessarily excluding a select Committee on Human Rights legislation but as being a moreworthwhile subject for examination.    If nevertheless a SelectCommittee were appointed, the Government would feel the morefree to reject any recommendations which it might make in favourof human rights legislation.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet saw little merit in a reference of Lord Wade&apos;s Bill of rights Bill to a Select Committee of the House of Lords butrecognised that this might be unavoidable.    They agreed that inthe Second Reading debate on the Bill the Government spokesman should take a robust line in defence of the existing position andshould explain the Governments doubts about the proposal for a select Committee.    He could indicate that if any positive action were required at this stage, it would be preferable, in theGovernments view, to examine the case for the creation of a standing body - such as the Lord Chancellor had suggested - whichwould have the ongoing function of reviewing our law to ensure thatit complied with our international obligations on human rights,including the European Convention.    The Government should not however take a formal stance against the motion for a SelectCommittee or put on any Whip.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theHome Secretary to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office27 January 19776
