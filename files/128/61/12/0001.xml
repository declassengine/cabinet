THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY &apos;S government copy NO        8CABINETLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77)lZth ConclusionsWednesday 23 March 1977 at 12. 00 noonTHE THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet that at the end of thePOLITICAL previous week, following the tabling of the Conservative Motion cf NoSITUATION Confidence in the Government, the Chief Whip&apos;s calculation had beenthat without some new accommodation tne Government were almost certain to bo defeated, and this would of course precipitate animmediate General Election.     The Liaison Committee of the TradesUnion Congress and the Labour Party had discussed the matter onMonday when the view had been strongly expressed that it was in theinterest of neither the country nor the Labour Party for there to be anearly Election.     He had therefore been encouraged to undertakeconfidential discussions with the Ulster Unionists and the Liberals tosee whether their support could be obtained without the sacrifice ofLabour Party principles.     The Lord President of the Council hadtaken part with him in these talks, and the Home Secretary and theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland had been brought in on certain matters of direct concern to them.     He had not assumed that agreement had to be reached even if on disadvantageous terms and planning had gone ahead for an alternative scenario if the talks failed,including the timing of an Election and the handling of the Budget.    Hewas grateful to the rest of the Cabinet for their forbearance while these talks were continuing and he now wished to report their outcome.At firrt it had seemed more likely that an accommodation could bereached with the Ulster Unionists than with the Liberals, but thisexpectation had not been borne out.     Two propositions had beendiscussed with the Ulster Unionists which the Lord President of theCouncil a.nd he would have been ready to commend to the Cabinet andwhich they had reason also to believe would not seriously upset theSocial Democratic Labour Party.     The first was a reference to the speaker&apos;s Conference on the number of Members of Parliament at westminster representing Northern Ireland constituencies.     Thesecond was an attempt to make some progress towards greater localgovernment in Northern Ireland:   the Ulster Unionists accepted that
direct rule would have to be renewed for a further year in July, butthey wished to see arrangements to elect some of the members tocertain local boards all of whose members were at present appointed.It had become clear however that while both Mr Molyneaux andMr Powell would have liked to reach an agreemert these twosuggestions would not be sufficient to command the support of themajority of the Ulster Unionists who also wanted a tougher line on security.     The talks had therefore led to nothing, although he had thought it right to Fay that nevertheless the Government wotild follow up the first of the two proposals.The talks with the Liberals had begxui with less expectation and thelatter had indeed pitched their initial demands unacceptably high.     Hehad however received a number of private indications that the liberals were anxious to reach an accommodation and after some veryhard bargaining an agreement had been reached between himself andMr steel on a draft statement, subject to confirmation by the cabinet and Liberal Members of Parliament.The Prime Minister then read the following statement, copies of whichwere subsequently handed round for the Cabinet to study.1.     We agreed today the basis on which the Liberal party would work with the Government in the pursuit of economic recovery.2.     There will be a consultative Committee between the two parties which will meet regularly.3.     The Committee will examine Government policy and other issues prior to their coming before the House, and Liberalpolicy proposals.4.     The existence of this Committee will not commit theGovernment to accepting the views of the Liberal Party, or theLiberal Party to supporting the Government on any issue.5.     We agree to initiate regular meetings between theChancellor and the Liberal Party economic spokesman,  such meetings to begin at once.     In addition, the Prime Ministerand the Leader of the Liberal Party will meet as necessary.6.    We agree that legislation for direct elections to theEtrropean Assembly in 1978 will be presented to Parliament inthis Session.     The Liberal Party reaffirm their strongconviction that a proportional system should be used as themethod of election.     The Government is publishing next week a White Paper on Direct Elections to the European assembly which sets out the choices among different electoral systems,2
but which makes no recommendation.     There will now beconsultation between us on the method to be adopted and theGovernments final recommendation will take full account ofthe Liberal Party&apos;s commitment.     The recommendation will besubject to a free vote of both Houses.7.    We agree that progress must be made on legislation for devolution, and to this end consultations will begin on the detailed memorandum submitted by the Liberal Party today.In any future debate on proportional representation for the devolved Assemblies there will be a free vote.8.     We agree that the Government will provide the extra timenecessary to secure the passage of the Housing (Homeless)Persons Bill, and that the Local Authorities (Works) Bill willbe confined to provisions preserving the existing powers oflocal authorities.9.    We agree that this arrangement between us should lastuntil the end of the present Parliamentary Session, when both parties would consider whether the experiment has been of sufficient benefit to the country to be continued.10.   We also agree that this understanding should be made public.Continuing, the Prime Minister said that if this agreement wereconfirmed both by the Cabinet and by the Liberal Members ofParliament, who were meeting early that afternoon, the Liberalswould vote for the government on the Confidence Motion.     They wouldalso support the Government generally during the remainder of thepresent Session of Parliament, although they might abstain or vote against the Government on particular issues.     There were no privateunderstandings that did not appear in the statement which the cabinet had before them and he had rejected attempts by the Liberals to insertreferences to industrial democracy and nationalisation.     Indeed theyhad been offered little more than the promise of consultation and forthis reason they had felt it essential to insist on a free vote on directelections and on proportional representation for the devolvedAssemblies in Scotland and Wales.    Paragraphs 4 and 9 of thestatement had to be read together:   this was an experimentalarrangement which would not run beyond the end of the present session unless both sides thought it was of sufficient benefit to thecountry to continue it;   and it committed neither side on particularissues other than those mentioned.     The Chairman of the Parliamen-tary Labour Party had been directly involved in the consultations;  andhe had taken the view that, since it would not be possible to change theterms of the statement as a basis of an agreement with the Liberals
it would not be appropriate to put it to a Parliamentary Labour Partymeeting before the Prime Minister announced it.    individual members of Parliament would have to decide whether to support theGovernment or not:   but, before confirming his agreement to the leader ox. the Liberal Party, he wished to know that he would be supported by all his Cabinet colleagues.In discussion some members of the Cabinet strongly expressed theview that the agreement reached went much further than they had expected and should not be confirmed.     This was not to say that thePrime Minister and the Lord President of the Council had not driventhe best possible bargain.     The main effect of it would however be to enhance the position of the Liberal Party to the disadvantage of theLabour Party.     The agreement to introduce legislation on directelections and to allow a free vote would cause great bitterness withinthe Labour Party:   and some of the other provisions in the agreement were unnecessary and humiliating.     The accommodation was said tobe a temporary and experimental one, but it would tend to becomepermanent and could lead into something like coalition government.This, in turn, would make it extremely difficult to develop a SocialistManifesto for the next Election.     It would be far better not to pursuethia path of expediency but to face the consequences of losing theConfidence Motion and to set about winning an early Election.     In anycase it was highly objectionable that, while the Liberal Leader wasbeing allowed to consult all his Members of Parliament, the cabinet were being asked to take a decision without consultation with theParliamentary Labour Party, the National Executive Committee orconstituency opinion.     The Cabinet had no mandate to commit any ofthe se.On the other hand, the large majority of the Cabinet expressed their support for the agreement which had been reached.     The Governmenthad no automatic majority and, even if it survived the ConfidenceMotion, its position was likely to deteriorate as a result of by-elections or maverick behaviour by some of its backbenchers.    It wastherefore faced with the choice either of trying to assemble majoritieson particular issues division by division or of reaching an agreementwith the Liberals which would provide stability over the rest of the session.     The latter was clearly preferable unless the conditions imposed were intolerable:   and this was certainly not the case.Indeed the only concessions of significance involved free votes on twoissues when all members of the Parliamentary Party, includingMinisters, would be free to express their views:   and it was arguable that a free vote on direct elections was the best way of solving one ofthe Labour Party&apos;s own internal problems.     Furthermore, thearrangements for consultation between the two Parties would providea much better chance of success on individual issues and if theagreement was confirmed the Governments position would be stronger
than it was before the events of the previous week.     The offer of consultation with the Liberals was no more than the consultationregularly extended to the Trades Union Congress, the Confederation ofBritish Industry and other sectional interests.     In any case the onlyrealistic alternative was an immediate General Election.    TheGovernment had no need to fear putting their record to the electoraltest but the fact remained that at a time of inflation and recessionGovernments throughout the world had done badly at elections and theLabour Party&apos;s chance of winning an early Election must be veryslight.    A decision not to confirm the agreement with the Liberalswould therefore be tantamount to installing a conservative government.     This in turn could put the whole democratic process at risk if a Conservative Government engaged in confrontation with theunions and was succeeded by one from the extreme right.     The PrimeMinister had achieved a great success which would be overwhelminglyendorsed by the Parliamentary Labour Party in the Vote that night,even though some members would no doubt grumble thereafter.     Itwould however be inadvisable to try to consult the Party in advance.In continuing discussion it was suggested that, even if it was not practicable or desirable to hold a meeting of the Parliamentary LabourParty before the Prime Minister announced the agreement, there wasa strong case for having such a meeting later that day and before the vote was taken.     This would provide an opportunity to explain theagreement to the Governments backbenchers and also to spell out theconsequences of rejecting it.     In such circumstances the Liberalswould not abstain but would vote against the Government.THE PRIME MINISTER,  summing up the discussion, said that a large majority of the Cabinet thought it right to confirm the agreement whichhe had reached with the Leader of the Liberal Party.     His own view was that it would not do serious damage to the morale of the LabourParty and that it would provide the Government with the essential timeto build on the improving economic position and restore theirelectoral fortunes.    If the agreement were confirmed, theGovernment would of course have to deal with the Liberals in good faith:   but he believed that any boost to Liberal fortunes would be atthe expense of the Conservative rather than the Labour Party.    He hadnoted a suggestion that paragraph 2 of the agreement should be amended to refer to a Consultative Committee between the party leaders rather than the two Parties.    He accepted that on this issue the Cabinet could not commit anyone other than themselves and that other Labour Members of Parliament would have to reach their owndecision whether to support the Government on the Confidence Motion.The Lord President of the Council would consult the liason committee about the desirability of a meeting of the parliamentary labour Party before the Vote that evening.    He did not however feel it possible for the Cabinet to be divided on the matter and his under-standing was that his colleagues would all be with him in the DivisionLobby that night.
