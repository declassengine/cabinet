parliamentary affairs, The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in *JheHouse of Commons during the following week.Debates:Mr Agee andMr Hosenball;ToacherTrainingColleges inScotlandThe Cabinet noted that it was important that as many Ministers aspossible should be present to lend their support to the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland who were likely to be underpersonal attack in the debates on Mr Agee and Mr Hosenball and onteacher training colleges in Scotland.    In the decision to deportMr Ag&amp;e and Mr Hosenball the Home Secretary had -fully carried outthe procedures in the Immigration Act 1971 as the courts had confirmedand even if the Government were defeated in any vote on the adjournment there could be no question of him rescinding that decision.The most he might do would be to undertake to look once again at the procedures.BudgetResolutionson PetrelTax andVehicleExcise DutyTHE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that he had discussed with Mr Pardoe the reported intention of the Liberals to vote againstthe Budget resolution proposing increases in petrol tax and VehicleExcise Duty (VED).    Mr Pardoe recognised that these proposals werein accord with Liberal views on switching to indirect taxation andenergy saving, but had explained that the Liberals, who had believedthat the sum involved was  300 million, had a problem with theirconstituents in rural areas who would be adversely affected by theproposals.    In fact, the sum involved was  670 million in a full year.The Liberals were prepared to support increases in VED on commercial vehicles and in the duty on heavy oils, and their concernrelated to the proposals to increase VED on cars and motorcycles(which would raise  150 million in a full year) and to increase the dutyon petrol (which would raise  300 million in a full year).    Theseproposals were all embodied in a single Budget resolution, and itwould be technically feasible to divide this resolution into two, onecovering the proposals acceptable to the Liberals and the other theproposals which they disliked.    But if this were done, and theresolution relating to petrol duty and VED on cars was defeated, theresult would be administrative chaos, and the question would arise of paying refunds of petrol duty.    He was due to see Mr Pardoe that afternoon, and he suggested that he should explain these difficulties andshould make clear that it was the Governments intention to move towards more broadly based indirect tax increases, but that theycould not do so now.    If this did not suffice to persuade the Liberalsto abstain in the vote on this resolution, he suggested saying toMr Pardoe that the Liberals could move an amendment in Committeeon the Finance Bill to reduce the rate of increase in petrol duty by,say, Ip, which would cost  60 million in a full year.1
In discussion it was noted that the Government could expect to win the vote on the resolution provided the Liberals abstained - even if the ulster Unionists voted against and the Conservatives won theStetchford by-eiection - but not if the Liberals voted against.     Thesame problem would have arisen whether or not any arrangement hadbeen made with the Liberals.    It was suggested that attempts to persuade them to change their minds might well fail, and that it wouldbe absurd for the Government to destroy themselves on the issue cfpetrol tax and VED.    Similar situations would regularly recur whilethe Government had no Parliamentary majority, and if they wished tosurvive they would have to accept the views of the Louse on such issues.    If these particulai proposals could not be carried, thenalternative means of raising the money would have to be found, whichthe House would accept.On the other hand it was argued that defeat on a Budget resolutioninvolving  670 million would damage the Government&apos;s credibility and seriously jeopardise its future.     To consolidate Value Added Tax at10 per cent, which the Conservatives favoured, would be acceptable asa longer-term aim, but would increase the retail price index by morethan the increases in petrol tax and VED, thus damaging pay policy,and would particularly affect the housewife, which would be politicallydamaging.    The Government could not govern if all unpopularproposals had to be abandoned.    It should therefore be made clear toMr Steel that the Government could not lose their Budget and survive.It was noted that Mr Beith had said that morning on the radio that the liberals had taken no firm decision how to vote, and they might belooking for a way out of the situation into which their inexperience had led them.    The forthcoming White Paper on transport policy was likely to include proposals to deal with problems of rural transportwhich would be attractive and not too expensive, and if the Liberalswere offered consultations on transport policy this might provide themwith a way out, and with the possibility of some share of the credit for the proposals in the White Paper.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that hewould see Mr Steel after the Cabinet meeting and warn him that the liberals could not expect the Government to carry on until the autumnif they were defeated on VED and petrol duty.    Failure to carry theBudget resolutions would destroy any Government&apos;s credibility, andthe consequences of defeat would be the same whether or not the votewas treated as a formal vote of confidence.    If the Liberals did not wish to bring the Government down, then they must recognise that thiswas the position.     They could not, however, be expected to do morethan abstain on this issue, and they would remain free to raise it again on the Finance Bill.    He would then say to Mr Steel that theGovernment recognised the grounds for the Liberals&apos; concern overproblems of transport in rural areas, and the Government were very
ready to discuss vnth them what might be done to alleviate these problems in the wider context of transport policy.    The chief secretary, Treasury, and the Secretary of State for Transport wouldthen follow up this possibility in their discussions with Liberalrepresentatives that afternoon, but should offer no possibility of any government concessions on the Budget.     The Chief Secretary,Treasury, would also speak to Government backbenchers who were concerned about this aspect of the Budget proposals.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.3
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatwe were engaged in the United Nations in resisting an attempt byAfrican countries and others to secure a major determination under chapter VII that the situation in South Africa represented a seriousthreat to peace.    Such a determination would provide the basis forthe introduction of mandatory sanctions.    In an attempt to forestalla vote for such a determination we were discussing with the Westernmembers of the Security Council a proposal for a strong declarationexpressing abhorrence of apartheid.    We should also have to accept an undertaking to return to the subject in a few months time.    It was clear however that if it were to be effective in buying time thedeclaration would have to be in very strong terms and he felt that hiscolleagues should be aware of the line he was taking.    There hadbeen a major hardening of the American attitude on South Africa andwe were likely to remain under continuing pressure.    He had therefore asked that the Cabinet Office should take the lead in preparing an assessment of the balance of interest as between all our economic links in South Africa and those with Black Africa.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that his general feeling, after talking to our High Commissioner in Delhi,was that the Janata Party would hold together, but there would beinternal pressures and tension within both the Party and the Cabinet.The Indian Government intended to introduce a number of constitutional measures for which they would need a two-thirds majority - 358 votes - although the Janata Party and its alliescould only muster 349.    It seemed probable however that some ofthe younger members of the Congress Party would go along withthese changes.    It was difficult at this stage to see how the newGovernments policies would develop.    In foreign policy they seemed likely to become more strictly non-aligned than their predecessors andthey gave the impression of wishing to improve relations with the West,and particularly with the United Kingdom.    There was a feeling thatthe Prime Minister, Mr Desai, might come to the CommonwealthHeads of Government Meeting in June, but as yet no definite decisionhad been taken.    There would be a Presidential election at the latestby August, that is within six months of the death of the previousPresident, and this might be an occasion for political upheaval.    Itwas possible that Mrs Gandhi might return to politics in the fairlynear future, but if her son was charged with corruption the situation would become more difficult and bitter.    India had adjustedremarkably well to the change, but a good deal would depend now on how Mr Desai and Mr Jagjivan Ram, the Defence Minister, got ontogether and what role Mrs Gandhi decided to play.The Cabinet -1.       Took note,of the statements by the foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.
Meeting of theCouncil ofMinisters(Research) on29 march the SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that the meeting of-he Council of Ministers (Research) in Brussels on 29 March had not succeeded, as we had hoped, in reaching agreement on the siting atCulham in Oxfordshire of the Joint European Torus (IET) project.The German Minister, Herr Matthoefer, had told him privatelybeforehand that the Germans would support Culham if we could be helpful on coking coal and Euratom loans, but it was clear on arrival in Brussels that the German position had been reversed.    In addition,all the smaller countries supported the German site for the project(Gascbing),    It was possible that our firm stand on the Green Poundin the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) which had finished theprevious day had done something to sour the atmosphere, but thiswas unlikely to have been a determining factor.    After eight hours ofdiscussion and some able chairmanship on the part of the Minister ofState for Industry (Mr Kaufman) we had only just been able to avoid a vote which would have produced a majority in favour of the Germansite.    Thus the effective choice in terms of future action seemed to lie between agreeing to the project being located at Garching or no agreement on the project at all.    This represented a major anddisappointing reversal of our expectations.    He would be circulating a paper on this to the Ministerial Committee on European Questions.In a brief discussion it was argued that our standing in the Communitywas not as bad as the Opposition and some of the Press were claiming.The European Council meeting in Rome had gone well and on matters such as the Green Pound we needed tenaciously to defend our interests:but we needed to continue to ensure that we did not becomeunnecessarily isolated on particular issues.    A paper on our furthertactical handling of Community agricultural support prices for1977-78 would shortly be circulated to the Ministerial Committee on european Questions.The Cabinet -2.Took note.PRICECOMMISSIONBILL3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to a minute he had sent the Prime Minister the previous day about anunresolved issue on the Price Commission Bill,   The matter needed tobe passedby the.*nd of July and-the Liberals&apos; agreement that itneednot bediscussed in the new Consultative Committee was conditional on its being published this week.    The issue related to an asymmetry in theprovisions of the Bill.    Large firms were required under the Billto give advance notice of price increases which could then be frozenfor up to 12 months while investigations took place.    Small firmswere not required   to give advance notice of price increases;  and where those increases were deemed by the Price Commission to be excessive, there would be power to roll back the excessive price5
in so far as it was attributable to an excessive pay increase underwhatever were the terms of the current social contract;  but wherethe excessive price was attributable to other causes, includingexcessive profits, no such power to roll back the price was included,and all that could be done would be to freeze the increased price forup to 12 months and require the firm to give advance notice of anyfurther price increases so that the freeze could be extended for afurther 12 months after investigation if necessary.    In earlier discussions between Ministers it had been argued that the power toroil back excessive prices should apply whether or not they wereattributable to pay increases.    Agreement had not been reached onthis issue;  but a compromise proposal had been put forward wherebypower might be taken to roll back prices in the case of firms not covered by the requirement to pre-notify to the level applying 28 days before the price investigation was notified.    This would at leastensure that firms did not raise prices in anticipation of an investigation.In discussion it was argued that the existing power of the price commission to reduce an excessive price, regardless of its cause,should be continued.    To remove it would be interpreted as a significant weakening of price control.    Furthermore, if it were removed, there would be cases of price increases which, althoughthe Price Commission had declared them to be excessive, would continue in force because the Bill gave power to freeze prices but notto roll them back.    Such a situation would make it extremely difficult for the Government to persuade workers to accept a reduction ratherthan a freezing of an excessive pay increase,,    It would also make the negotiation of a third round of pay policy more difficult, since theTrades Union Congress (TUC) would be bound to raise the point.Against this it was argued that, although the TUC had commented onthis point when they sent in views on the Consultative Document, theyhad since made it clear informally that they were anxious for the pricesanction on excessive pay increases to be both visible and tough;  andthat they would on balance prefer not to be consulted further.    Whenthe Ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy had agreed the broadlines of the Price Commission Bill, they had favoured the freezing ofprices, not reductions (save in respect of excessive pay increases),and the subsequent discussions with the Confederation of BritishIndustry (CBI) had proceeded on this understanding.    To depart from it now would risk an attempt by the CB.T to re-open the whole basis of theBill.    It was pointed out that, if the Bill were to provide powers toroll back price increases as proposed, a new  symmetry would beintroduced, with small firms, who did not give notice in advance of price increases, being subject to the roll back power, while largerfirms, who were required to give advance notice of price increases,would not - a situation which would put those who gave advance noticeat an advantage.    It might even mean that some thousands of smallcompanies would elect to give advance notice of the price increases,which could present the Price Commission with an administrativeproblem.6
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thebalaace of vistw i&amp; Cabinet favoured the compromise proposal wherebypowei would be taken in the Bill, in respect of those firms who did notnotify price increases In advance, to roll back prices to the levelobtaining 28 days before the price investigation was notified.     The Billshould be amended in this sense and published in the course of thecurrent week.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office31 March 19777
