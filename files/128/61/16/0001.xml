PARLIAMENTARY 1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to bs taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.1
2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARYreferred to his statement in Parliament on 19 April to which, at thisstage, he had little to add.    There was a good deal of speculationabout whether or not a conference would have the support of thePatriotic Front.    He had discussed the position of the PatrioticFront with President Neto of Angola and had left behind him inLuanda an official from his party who had links with Mr Nkomoand Mr Mugabe.    He had since spoken to the official concernedwho had confirmed his own view that the private position of thePatriotic Front was less hard than their public position:  thePatriotic Front were conducting an armed struggle and to sustainthis found it necessary to maintain a firm position in public.    their declared aim was to take the lead in any nationalist government but they feared they would not achieve this if they were forced to rely on internal support in Rhodesia.    They did not considerAmerican involvement in the settlement negotiations as compatible with their interests and they claimed that Mr Smith should take partonly as a member of the British delegation.    He thought thePatriotic Front were wrong on ail these counts but so far therewas not much sign of their giving way.    There was no immediateurgency for decisions about a conference.    We were awaiting theviews of the United States Administration and he was anxious not tohurry them.    He had kept the Americans fully informed of the outcome of his consultations and would take no steps without thesupport of the United States.    There were still many difficulties and there could be no certainty of success.    We should need toconsider very carefully whether we should embark on a newconference.    If we went ahead we should have to accept the risks and act with the intention of carrying our proposals through.    no decision would be taken except with the agreement of his cabinet colleagues and he hoped within the next week to be able to assess the prospects and to make recommendations to them.THE PRIME MINISTER said that they would all wish to congratulatethe Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary on the fact that the consultations he had conducted during his arduous tour of southern africa seemed genuinely to have opened up the situation.    It was notirrelevant that this development had contributed to improving thestanding of the Government both at home and abroad.    The problemof Rhodesia would be discussed shortly in the Ministerial Group onSouthern Africa, but it should also be considered again by theCabinet before any decisions were taken on the timing of the nextsteps.    What had happened so far had improved the prospects fora reasonable atmosphere at the Commonwealth Heads of GovernmentMeeting, but it would be very important to ensure that this problemdid not go sour before the Meeting took place.2
The Cabinet -1. Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s remarks.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thesituation in Pakistan gave cause for concern.    President Bhuttowas fighting back against criticism and violent demonstrations anda curfew had been declared in Karachi.    There was a real risk that the Army would intervene in order to take over control.    Ifthey did so, their aim would be to ensure the conduct of fairelections.    So far there was fortunately no sign of any inclinationto interfere on the part of the Indian Government.The Cabinet -2. Took note.3
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (CP(77) 36)by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food reporting theconclusions of the Ministerial Committee on European questions on the line to be taken in further consideration of Communityagricultural support prices at the meeting of the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) on 25-26 April.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD,introducing his paper, said that the revised proposals now beforethe Council included an additional increase in prices of \ per centon average, a net increase in the milk price of 2-3 per cent, anda Green Pound devaluation of 2.9 per cent.    The butter subsidyalready proposed of 30 units of account per 100 kilogrammes would more than offset this marginal devaluation, and consumers hadbenefited to the extent of some  15 million from the delay in reaching a settlement.    His expectation in the light of bilateralcontacts was that he could secure an increase in the butter subsidy to a level above the minimum of 33 units of account per100 kilogrammes which would be sufficient to offset the effect onconsumers of the additional price increase as well as the devaluation of the Green Pound.In discussion there was general support for the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture which had been endorsed by the ministerial committee on European Questions.    The settlement now in prospectwould represent considerable progress with our strategy of reducing the level of support to continental producers in real terms and thus discouraging surplus production.    We had been justifiedin defending our national interests in the face of criticism from therest of the Community.    But we should avoid a further clash overan issue which was now small by comparison with the magnitude ofour wider interests in the Community which would suffer if weprolonged the disagreement.    There were grounds for thinking thatwe would be able to negotiate the continuation of the butter subsidy in future years though no such commitment could be obtained atthis stage.    It would be helpful if the settlement could include some delay in the full application of the Green Pound devaluation.Careful presentation of the settlement would be needed against the background of the transitional price increases to which we v/ere inany event committed by the Treaty of Accession.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatour hard negotiating position had been justified by the results nowin prospect.    The Cabinet agreed with the proposals of theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, which had been endorsed by the Ministerial Committee on European Questions, forreaching a settlement on Community agricultural support prices atthe meeting of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture) on 25-27 April.4COMMUNITYAGRICULTURALSUPPORTPRICES 1977-78PreviousReference:CM(77) 13thConclusions,Minute 3
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the summing upof their discussion by the Prime Minister.DIRECTELECTIONSTO THEEUROPEANASSEMBLYPrevious.   ;ference:CM(77) HthConclusionsMinute 74. The Cabinet reviewed the position on direct elections tothe European Assembly in the light of Parliamentary discussion on the first day of the two-day debate on the White Paper on direct elections.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE HOME DEPARTMENT,introducing the discussion, said that Cabinet might wish to considerwhether any fresh guidance was needed on the handling of thesecond day&apos;s debate on 25 April.    The Government1 s presentposition as stated to the Parliamentary Labour Party was that itwould &quot;reconsider the issues raised in the White Paper on DirectElections in the light of the Party&apos;s views and in the light of theviews expressed in the debate in the House.    The Cabinet&apos;conclusions - on both the electoral system to be used for directelections and on the related issues - will then be put asrecommendations to a meeting of the Parliamentary Party.    only after that meeting will the Government bring forward firm proposals&quot;.    The Prime Minister, in describing his arrangement with the Leader of the Liberal Party, had said in the House on23 March that &quot;there will be consultation between us on the methodto be adopted, and the Governments final recommendation willtake full account of the Liberal Party&apos;s commitment.....  whatever the final recommendation on these matters, it willbe subject to a free vote of both Houses of Parliament. &quot;   If theGovernment were to proceed to introduce a Bill without firstsecuring a majority in the House for a particular electoral systemthere was a danger that it might have to be withdrawn if the choice of electoral system ran into difficulties in Committee.    TheConservative Party had asked for a separate vote on the choice of electoral system but this was opposed by the Liberal Party who wished to expose the extent of Conservative support for proportional representation that would emerge if this were essential to thepassage of a Bill.    Consideration would also be needed of the timing of the Affirmative Resolution that would be required to ratify the Community Decision on direct elections of20 September 1976, but this could be arranged before, during, or after the passage of the Bill.    The Cabinet would also need toconsider the circumstances in which free votes might be allowedeither on the principle of direct elections or on the method of election.5
In discussion of the handling of the debate on 25 April it was generally agreed that the Government should not depart from itspresent position as described by the Home Secretary.    Any vote on that occasion would be helpful to the Conservative Party andwould alienate Government supporters.In discussion of voting arrangements it was argued that the decisionto allow a free vote on the method of election, to which the liberal party load agreed, should be maintained.    But there werearguments also for allowing a free vote for members of the cabinet and for junior Ministers, as well as back-benchers on the principleof direct elections.    Although meetings of the Parliamentary LabourParty on this subject had been attended mainly be a relatively small number of Members who were mainly critical of our membership of the Community, there was abundant evidence that direct elections in May/June 1978 would be likely to result in an electoral defeatwhich would be damaging to the Party, to its prospects in a subsequent General Election, and to the Governments relationswith it.    Since direct elections and the choice of electoral systemwere major constitutional issues on which the Party was deeplydivided, the Government would be justified in relaxing the doctrine of collective responsibility.    An agreement to differ had served theParty well during the renegotiation of the terms of our membership of the Community.    The circumstances in which the Cabinet had accepted the commitment to direct elections were different fromthose which it now faced.On the other hand it was argued that while a free vote on theprinciple of direct elections might be possible for the Party, and perhaps even for junior Ministers, members of the Cabinet were committed to support the pledge we had given to our Communitypartners, with the Cabinets approval after full discussion on anumber of occasions, to use our best endeavours to hold directelections in May/June 1978.    Any indication that the Cabinet was seeking to resile from its commitment would destroy the credibilityof the British Government both in the country and in the eyes of theworld.    The loss of Liberal support could well result in an earlyGeneral Election which might leave a Conservative Government toproceed to direct elections on its own terms.    While an agreement to differ had been defensible during renegotiation the use of thisdevice could not be justified now that the referendum on our membership of the Community was behind us.    The doctrine of collective responsibility should not be lightly modified.In discussion of our commitment it was argued that direct electionsshould be deferred until a General Election when it should bepossible to get Labour voters to the polls in adequate numbers.    this might not be unwelcome to some of our partners.    Alternatively they
would have the option of proceeding to direct elections on theunderstanding that direct elections in the United Kingdom would follow in due course.    Such a delay would not call intc questionour support for the principle of direct elections, and could be defended in terms of the special nature of our electoral system.On the other hand it was argued that even if some of our partnersmight be privately relieved by a move to withdraw from our commitment they would unite in censuring it.    There would be the gravest difficulties with other Community Heads of governments and our case for deferment would have to be shown to beoverwhelming.    The risk of electoral defeat in direct elections inMay/June 1978 was exaggerated by those who opposed directelections in principle.The intrinsic importance of direct elections was not sufficient tojustify the risks entailed in seeking to defer them, more particularly since no increase in the powers of the Assembly was entailed.Moreover such a deferment would merely prolong dissension withinthe Party.    Simultaneous direct and general elections would bedifficult to organise, would give undue prominence to Communityissues and highlight the divisions within the Party on those issues.In discussion of future Parliamentary tactics it was argued that aBill would be likely to secure a second reading whatever votingarrangements were made.    A free vote on the method of electionwould be likely to show support from Government back-benchersfor a system of proportional representation.    It would then be forthe Conservative Party to decide whether to support such a systemor to destroy the Bill.    Direct elections would then be delayedunless a Conservative Government secured office in time tointroduce legislation of their own.    For these reasons it would bebetter to whip Government supporters than to be seen to rely onConservative votes.    It would be important both in the drafting ofthe Bill and in the handling of the Committee stage to ensure that a viable electoral system could be enacted.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that therewas no need to carry the discussion further at the present meetingsince no new decisions were immediately needed.    The cabinet had however repeatedly been committed to the principle of directelections and they had also accepted the commitment to use our best endeavours to hold them in May/June 1978.    The arrangementsalready made for the debate on 25 April should stand.    The HomeSecretary should bring forward to Cabinet in the light of the debateproposals for the recommendations to be made to the parliamentary labour Party.7
