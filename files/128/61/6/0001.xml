1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that on Tuesday,22 February it was proposed to take a Timetable Motion on theScotland and Wales Bill.    It was clear from the slow rate of progress on the Bill so far, and the ease with which debates on theBill could be spun out without serious filibustering, that there wasno prospect of getting the Bill through without a guillotine.    the motion would allot 20 further days for the completion of the Commonsstages of the Bill, apart from consideration of Lords amendments,with each allotted day extended by one hour up to 11 pm.    This wouldmean allowing about the same number of days for the Bill as originally envisaged, with some extra days for the referendumprovisions.    It would nevertheless involve a severe curtailment of debate, and if an amendment were put down to allot a larger number of days, this could prove awkward to deal with.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe whole Cabinet agreed that a Timetable Motion on the Scotlandand Wales Bill should be taken in the following week.    There wouldbe no guarantee of success, but the prospects of obtaining aguillotine would not improve with time.    A guillotine was now generally expected, and every possible effort should be made toensure that the Motion was carried.    It was important that thearrangements proposed by the Business Committee should allow forall major provisions of the Bill to be debated before it was sent tothe Lords.    Differing views had been expressed on the desirabilityof an extension to 11 pm on each allotted day, and the Lord president would give further consideration to this question; he would also consider what advance information could be given to Ministers aboutthe days of the week likely to be allotted to this Bill in the comingweeks.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.1
Aircraft andShipbuildingIndustries bill previous reference:CM(76) 34thConclusions,Minute 1THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that the Examiners had reportedthat morning to the effect that the Aircraft and Shipbuilding IndustriesBill, which had been referred to them by the House of Lords, washybrid.    He understood that the report was 15 pages long and of a technical nature, and that it raised some far-reaching issues.    Thenext step would be for the Standing Orders Committee to considerwhether or not Standing Orders applicable to hybrid Bills, but notcomplied with in respect of this Bill, ought to be dispensed with.The Committee1 s conclusions would not be known until the followingThur sday.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said thatthe report of the Examiners would require detailed study before any conclusions could be reached about the nature and extent of theBill&apos;s hybridity and about the options open to the Government.    Hewould arrange for a small group of the Ministers most closely concerned to examine the range of options, taking into account the implications for the industries concerned of further delay, and toreport their conclusions to the Cabinet for discussion next Thursday.In the meantime, the Government could decline to make a statementof their intentions by pointing to the complexity of the report and tothe need to await the completion of the procedures which were in train in the House of Lords.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2
2. THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN and commonwealth AFFAIRS, reporting on the South Africanproposal for trilateral talks, said that this was made afterMr Vorster, the South African Prime Minister, had summonedMr Smith to see him in Cape Town on 9 February.    On the following day Mr Vorster told the British and American Ambassadors thathe was convinced there was a change in Mr Smith&apos;s attitude andthat the latter was sincere in his acceptance of the principle of majority rule in two years and of the establishment of an interim government with the aim of achieving this.    It was clear thatMr Vorster wanted a high level Ministerial meeting.    We wereunderstandably sceptical about the sincerity of Mr Smith&apos;s conversion,but the Americans were anxious that we should take a positiveattitude towards the South African proposal.   The first step would therefore be to have bilateral official discussions with the Americans.\ie would wish to establish that there was no division on policybetween Ambassador Young and the State Department, each cf whom had been saying rather different things about Southern Africa.    Wewould also need to ensure that there was complete solidarity of views between the Americans and ourselves on the line we shouldtake with the South Africans and on our interpretation of Mr Smith&apos;attitude.    These talks would take place on 21 February, after whichwe would wish to assess the results on the following day beforeagreeing to trilateral official level discussion with Ambassador Botha&apos;participation.    The Prime Minister would probably wish to discuss with President Carter during his visit to Washington in Marchwhether we should then move on to trilateral talks at ministerial level.In discussion it was suggested that we should proceed with greatcaution since it was important that we should not be left in anexposed position, as had happened after Dr Kissinger&apos;s initiative.We should bear in mind the political advantage Mr Vorster would hope to gain from a meeting with Mr Vance and the British foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.    There was a case for inviting arepresentative of the front line States, either President Kaunda ofZambia or President Nyerere of Tanzania, to be present at any meeting we and the Americans had with the South Africans.    Thedifficulty would be to find a single African representative who couldspeak for the others.    But it would in any case be desirable toensure in advance that the African Presidents did not object to atrilateral meeting on the lines proposed.    These were all points which would have to be discussed with the Americans at the officialbilateral talks.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing a brief discussion, said that wehad to balance the desirability of not allowing Mr Vorster to derivepolitical advantage from the situation, against the importance of not3
giving the Americans the impression that we were not activelyconcerned in trying to achieve a settlement.    The latter was of major significance to us in a wider context.    We should send a senior official to Washington for bilateral talks on 21 February witha view to working out a common position with the Americans.    Inthe light of the report to Ministers on these talks, we would thenbe in a position, if we and the Americans agreed that this was theright step to take, to move to official trilateral talks with theSouth Africans within a few days.    The question of a trilateralMinisterial meeting could be considered subsequently.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.THE MINISTER OF STATE FOR FOREIGN AND commonwealth affairs said that he had led the European Community delegation at the opening talks with the Russians in Brussels on 16 February.The talks had started well and the Russian approach had beenreasonable.    Mr Ishkov, the leader of the Soviet delegation, had agreed to respond on 17 February to the Community&apos;s proposals on licensing.    In the light of yesterday&apos;s talks the risks of aserious confrontation at sea appeared to be much reduced.    it seemed possible that we should arrive at some compromise forthe interim period during February and March.In discussion it was pointed out that, although we were aiming toreduce the number of licensed Russian ships fishing at any onetime to 17, these ships were each eight times the size of one of ourown.    This made the extent of Russian fishing much greater thanit appeared.    It was pointed out however that the formula forcalculating the number of ships to be licensed was a flexible one and permitted an increase in numbers to balance a redaction in sizeThis could provide the basis for a compromise with the Russians.The Cabinet -2. Took note.4
In a brief discussion, reference was made to the death of theAnglican Archbishop of Uganda, who had apparently been killed byorders of President Amin.    It was suggested that we should make clear our sense of outrage at this event which made it all the moreimportant that President Amin should not attend the CommonwealthHeads of Government Meeting.    We should in any case make clearour view that President Amin&apos;s behaviour was a disgrace to theCommonwealth.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said thatit was not for the British Government to issue invitations to theCommonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.    He agreed with theviews expressed but from his experience, making clear to president Amin that his presence would be unwelcome would onlybe likely to encourage him to come.The Cabinet -3. Took note.5
3. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that theworld prospects for the shipbuilding industry were appalling.    Theprevious year Japan had secured 75 per cent of the free worldorders.    Their prices were 25 per cent below those of europe on average.    Although the British industry was now competitivewith the rest of Europe the merchant shipbuilding sector wasthreatened with the loss of two-thirds of its employment by the endof 1978.    The problems had been considered the previous week bythe Ministerial Committee on Economic and Industrial Policy whichhad approved the establishment of a selective intervention fund to beused to subsidise orders.    There would be a control figure of 65 million on commitments in the period to the end of March 1978.Present estimates were that with this fund it might be possible to limit the redundancies in the shipyards to 11, 000 by the end of 1978;if the large order from Poland at present under negotiation could besecured the rundown might be substantially smaller than that.Taking account of existing commitments the public expenditureprovision required to implement the strategy amounted to 83 million.    The sums involved in 1978-79 and 1979-80 exceeded the present provision by  12 million and  7 million and he recommonded these amounts should be a charge on the contingency reserve.    It would be necessary to start right away to obtain theco-operation of the firms in the industry to enable assistance to be concentrated on those yards where prospects of long term survivalwere best.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY said that the PrimeMinister had asked that a new interim strategy should be preparedfor the shipbuilding industry which should provide for selectivity soas to channel assistance to the yards with the best future prospects,and to provide for a limit on expenditure.    The strategy which hehad put forward met both these requirements.    There was no question about the need for extremely urgent action.    Half of the yards in thecountry would be out of work by the end of the present year unlessnew orders were secuied, and only four had work which would lastbeyond the end of 1978.    Of these three were warship builders.    Theindustry was heavily concentrated in areas where unemployment was particularly high and where other industries such astelecommunications, steel and power plant equipment which were also threatened with rundown were also concentrated.    The key wasthe need to secure additional orders.    The production capacity ofthe merchant sector of the industry was some l^ million tons a year:orders obtained in 1975 amounted to only 70, 000 tons and in 1976 to400, 000 tons.    The competitive position of the United kingdom industry was better now than when the Cabinet had last discussed the prospects in March 1976.    British prices were now competitivewith those of the rest of Europe.    Every effort was being made byhis Department to assist the securing of orders.    One of his officials6REVISEDINTERIMSHIPBUILDINGSTRATEGYPreviousReference:CC(76) 10thConclusionsMinute 5
had been appointed Managing Director of the trustee company whichwould oversee the companies already owned by the Government inthe period before vesting.    100, 000 tons of orders were needed bythe end of March, 480, 000 by March 1978 and 830, 000 tons by march 1979.    The selective intervention fund which he proposed would give discretionary grants to individual yards to enable themto secure particular orders.    It would be operated highlyselectively, but there could be no simple formula to decide whetherassistance should be given in each case.    Decisions would have to depend on the future prospects of the yard, the extent of competition, the work content of the order in question and the location of the yard.    Decisions would be taken, as in the past,by a small group of Ministers concerned.    The trustee company would be used as a vehicle and as a catalyst, though the orders itsecured would not necessarily be steered wholly to yards alreadyowned by the Government.    He proposed to make an early announcement of the new strategy to Parliament but did not intend to announce the size of the intervention fund.    The european commission was already being consulted and there were grounds for optimism that they would give their approval.    The Fund wouldbe welcome to the Confederation of Shipbuilding and EngineeringUnions.    It would be necessary at the same time to make it quite clear that there would be redundancies although it would be a mistake to disclose the level of redundancies expected:  the unions were most unlikely to accept in the abstract that any redundancieswere inevitable.    It was however to be hoped that they would co-operate case by case.In discussion there was general agreement with the analysis of thevery severe prospects of the industry and widespread welcome forthe revised interim strategy put forward by the Secretary of Statefor Industry.    Attention was drawn both to the very high levels ofunemployment already existing in the shipbuilding areas and to thelarge number of additional redundancies amongst suppliers whichwould be caused by the rundown of the shipbuilding industry.Emphasis was placed on the need for investment in addition tothe securing of orders so that as much of the industry as could beretained was fully competitive when the order situation improved.It would also be necessary to improve the national capability inspecialised types of ships, since it was unlikely that the demandfor simple ships such as tankers would recover to the level which existed before the energy crisis.    These were however questions on which it was difficult for the Government to form a view until after nationalisation.    The need to secure orders should not however result in a lack of effort also to attract alternative employment to the areas affected.    Attention was drawn to the major defence interest in the shipbuilding industry.    Naval work at present accounted for 35 per cent of the total employment in the
industry.    The possible Iranian order referred to in the paper before Cabinet now seemed most unlikely to go ahead:  future prospects for naval export orders were not good though there seemed a better chance of sales of marine technology.    attention was also drawn to the problems of Harland and Wolff, which was not covered by the interim strategy.    Despite the very severeemployment position in Belfast and the critical dependence of thecity on the company, employment there was to be run down by 5, 000,a much larger proportional rundown than was envisaged for theindustry in Great Britain.    This was despite the fact that in termsof steel throughput per head the company was probably the most efficient in the whole of the United Kingdom.In further discussion attention was drawn to the extent to whichdelay in the passage of the Aircraft and Shipbuilding Industries bill had damaged the long-term future of the industries.    This factwould need to be given due weight when the Government decided onits reaction to the decision by the House of Lords that the Bill washybrid.Great emphasis was placed on the need for care over presentationin the statement to be made about the future of the industry.Although the Government was proposing to spend very large sumsto support the industry there was grave danger that the confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions would regard theGovernment&apos;s action as negative.    In particular they would arguefor speculative building as a means of avoiding the need forredundancies.    The possibility of undertaking some speculativeconstruction had been envisaged in the previous strategy as a last resort and should not be ruled out in the future.    It should nevertheless not be regarded as anything other than a last resort.In order to preserve relations with the European Commission itwas very desirable that the statement should not be made until their agreement had been secured.    Since the statement might beregarded as unsatisfactory by Northern members it might be preferable for it to be delayed until after the debate on the TimetableMotion for the Scotland and Wales Bill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the extreme difficulty which the shipbuilding industry faced.    They endorsed the interim strategy put forward by the Secretary of State for Industry.    Despite the difficult prospectsit would be wholly wrong to think that the industry had no future.It had come out strongly at his meeting with British shipowners thatthe British industry was fully competitive, perhaps even with Japan,in ships in the 20-25, 000 ton range.    There could also be a good prospect in specialised ships.    He would himself be seeing that afternoon the Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions8
and he would wish, in addition to describing the measures envisagedto secure orders, to advise them of the Government&apos;s intention toprovide after nationalisation for Government finance for a special scheme of redundancy compensation.    The statement to parliament should cover both the need for the intervention sums to be usedselectively and the intention to introduce a redundancy scheme.All concerned in the industry knew that redundancies were inevitable and it would be a mistake not to face up to this.    consideration should also be given to the question whether the balance of advantage lay in announcing the size of the selective intervention fund or not.The terms of the statement would need to be agreed with theChancellor of the Exchequer, the Secretary of State for employment and the Minister of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs.He would himself wish to have advice on what he should say about theworld-wide problem of the industry at the forthcoming meeting of theEuropean Council and at the Economic Summit.The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of State for Industry to be guided accordingly.2. Endorsed the revised interimshipbuilding strategy annexed to CP(77) 18.3. Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinetto ensure that briefing for the forthcoming meeting of the European Council and theEconomic Summit covered the problems ofthe shipbuilding industry.Cabinet Office17 February 19779
