PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.Debate on THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR TRADE said that airports policyAirports was an important subject, and it was unsatisfactory that the debatePolicy proposed for Thursday 26 May should come at the end of the day andshould be arranged for a time when he himself would have to be absenton official business overseas.    He hoped that this debate could be deferred.In discussion it was pointed out that it had previox^sly been decided to defer this debate until after the local government elections, and it was important that the Parliamentary time available to the Government on26 May should be used for suitable business which the Governmentwanted.    Other suitable business would be difficult to find.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that itwas not satisfactory to arrange Parliamentary business at a time whenthe responsible Minister could not be present.    The Chief Whip would consider whether there was any other business which could be taken on26 May, though if there was not the arrangements proposed for that day would have to stand.The Cabinet -1.     Took note.At   ndance of In connection with Mr Michael Brotherton&apos;s Private Member&apos;s MotionPrenident Amin        on the need to exclude the President of Uganda from the Unitedat the Kingdom, which was first order for debate on Friday 27 May, THECommonwealth PRIME MINISTER said that the question of President Amin&apos;s attendanceConference at the Commonwealth Conference needed handling at this stage withspecial care and confidentiality.    It was necessary to take into accountboth the strength of public opinion in the country againstPresident Amin attending and also the possible damage to theCommonwealth, to the success of the Conference and to our relationswith Afro-Asian countries if he were excluded.    A small group ofMinisters under his chairmanship had already considered the matter,and he hoped that the Cabinet would leave it to this group to reach conclusions on the timing and content of an announcement of theGovernment&apos;s position.    It could be important not to make any announcement prematurely.    He would say in response to any questions in the House that afternoon only that the United Kingdom wasnot in diplomatic relations with Uganda and that he understood the stateof opinion in the country.
The Cabinet -2.    Took nots.THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that he had discussed this Bi&quot;l further with Mr Len Murray, and had reported this discussion in his minute to the Prime Minister of 17 May.    He had alsonow obtained the views of the Scottish National Party.     The positionof all the minority Parties was that they would support the principle of member participation in the management of occupational pension schemes, and would vote for the Second Reading of this Bill, but would then seek to amend the provisions which required memberparticipation through the single channel of recognised independenttrade unions.    Mr Murray had made two important points about theattitude of the Trades Union Congress (TUC).    First, the TUC wanted to see the Bill introduced in the current Session, even if it could notprogress beyond Second Reading, largely because of the assistancethis would give the General Council at this autumn1 s Congress inshowing the Governments commitment to legislation.    Second,provided the Bill as introduced contained the single channel provisions,they would continue to support it even if, as seemed likely, those provisions were amended or deleted in Parliament, because they wished to see other provisions of the Bill become law.    These wereconstructive and helpful developments in the tuc&apos;s thinking, whichrecognised the realities of the Parliamentary situation;  but it was most important to them that the Government should be seen to betrying to get the single channel provisions through Parliament, evenalthough the attempt seemed likely to fail.     The TUC could not afford to appear to give any ground on this point because that would weakentheir position in relation to the recommendations of the BullockCommittee on Industrial Democracy.    He accordingly proposed thatthe Government should introduce the Bill this Session, and seek toobtain a Second Reading, acknowledging that it would not be possibleto take the Bill through all its stages this Session;  and should thenreintroduce the Bill at the beginning of the next Session.In discussion it was generally accepted that there was little prospectof carrying the single channel provisions in the present Parliament,and strong doubts were expressed whether it would be advisable tointroduce a Bill containing these provisions, which would be to courta humiliating defeat at the hands of the Opposition and the minorityParties.    Defeats in Parliament on issues of importance damaged theGovernment and its electoral prospects.    The attempt to implement the single channel would offend those strongly opposed to it, and thefailure of that attempt would be claimed by the Confederation ofBritish Industry as a victory over the TUC.    For the Government to
embark upon such a course would not serve the interests of the TUC,and the better course would be to introduce the Bill in the next session without the single channel.In farther discussion it was argued that the Government should not nowappear to be going back on its support for the single channel, and thata clear indication of the Government1 s intention to go ahead with this bill would be helpful to the TUC.    Introduction of the Bill so late inthe Session would give rise to criticism and might make it moredifficult to carry the Bill next Session, and the right course might beto make a statement of the Government1 s mtention to go ahead next session with a Bill including the single channel provisions, or to publish a White Paper containing draft clauses.    On the other handintroduction of the Bill this Session and obtaining a Second Reading inJuly, thus confirming Parliamentary support for the principle of theBill before the TUC Autumn Congress, would be valuable.    But theGovernment would then be expected to take account, beforereintroducing the Bill next Session, of the opposition to the singlechannel likely to be voiced in the Second Reading debate.    It was argued however that the Government should not put itself in theposition of never even attempting legislation in which it believedunless certain in advance that the legislation could be carried.Attention should be paid to the views of the TUC, particularly becauselegislation affecting the rights of trade unionists could probably not be implemented effectively if carried against their opposition;  the rightsof trade unionists under the Employment Protection Act might be relevant to this issue.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had previously decided on the merits in favour of the singlechannel.     Account had however to be taken of the parliamentary situation:   and the standing of the Government was only weakened bydefeats on issues of this kind.    Publication of the occupational pension Schemes Bill before the Summer Recess might well be helpful.    It would, however, be essential to decide before publicationthe basis on which the Government proposed to proceed next Session,and thus whether the Bill as published should include the singlechannel provisions.    It would also be necessary to discuss theproblem further with the TUC and establish whether they reallywished to see the Government defeated on the issue of the singlechannel.    In the first instance, the matter should be considered by theHome and Social Affairs Committee, taking account of the points madein discussion.
The Cabinet -3.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Secretary of the Cabinet to arrangeaccordingly.
NORTHERN 2. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he wished to express bisIRELAND congratulations to the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland on theSTRIKE way in which he had handled the Northern Ireland strike.    Hisdetermined and straightforward approach had gained credit for theGovernment and brought great benefit to the people of Northern Ireland.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 sstatement.5
3v. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said thatthe result of the elections was a bad one which could have serious consequences.     The Likud Party and their most likely coalition partners,The National Religious Party, had gained 53 out of 120 seats andshould have no difficulty in picking up the additional eight votes togive Mr Begin a majority in Parliament.    He had talked of a nationalcoalition, but there was little chance of his getting this.    The LabourParty in opposition might well become more of a peace Party andacquire more flexibility     But there was a real prospect of troublenext year if Mr Begin pursued in office the policies which he hadadvocated during the elections.    The Foreign and commonwealth secretary said that it was clear to him during his visit to Saudi Arabiathat the situation would deteriorate if no progress towards a peace settlement was made by the spring of 1978.    We should face thepos&quot;ribility of increased oil prices and of a cut-back in oil productionand possibly even of war.    The situation had been made worse &amp;e aresult of the elections.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had last talked with Mr Beginthree years ago:  he was a man of personal charm but totallyintransigent.    He had not forgotten his guerrilla background and was unlikely to go back on what he had said in the past.    The prospects ofa settlement had definitely receded and he agreed that we could face aserious situation.    His hope was that the efforts to achieve a nationalcoalition would succeed since this would provide a measure of restraint on the Likud Party.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the shah had told him on his recent visit to Iran that relations with theUnited Kingdom had never been better.    He had had three-quarters ofan hour&apos;s talk with the Shah, during which they had discussed human rights and the latter had told him, in confidence, that he had asked theInternational Red Cross to come and observe the situation.    Therewere signs of movement on the question of human rights in Iran whichwas a welcome development, even though the movement might not be as fast as we would wish.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY referred to therecent incursion by the Rhodesian forces into Botswana and theexchange of messages with Mr Smith and President Kaunda of Zambiaabout Rhodesian intentions with regard to Zambia.    He said that wewere likely to face more incidents of this kind.    The fact was that wecould not get rid of Mr Smith and the Rhodesian Front and the rhodesian Government possessed powerful armed forces.    There was some truth in Rhodesian fears.    Mr Nkomo&apos;s forces were being built6
up in Zambia and there was also a build-up of guerrilla forces inTanzania.    But the Rhodesian attack on Botswana was outrageous.There was no threat to Rhodesia from this country which was peace-loving and unable to defend itself.    On the other hand there was no indication of any serious military threat to the territorial integrity ofZambia.    Mr Smith&apos;s actions were designed, to a large extent, tobuild up his own position internally.    As a result of the PrimeMinister&apos;s messages to President Kaunda and Mr Smith there had beena de-escalation of the situation.    But we had a difficult hand to play.Inevitably during the period of negotiations he would have to maintaincontact with Mr Smith:  our problem was not to become drawn into the disputes between Rhodesia and its neighbours arising out of the armedstruggle, whether as a channel of communications or in any other way.The Cabinet -Took note.7
1977UPRATINGOF SOCIALSECURITYBENEFITSPreviousReference:CM(77) 19thConclusions,Minute 24. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Social Services and the Minister for Social Security(CP(77) 54) about the 1977 uprating of social security benefits.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he andthe Chief Secretary, Treasury, had considered the additional optionscanvassed in the Cabinet1 s earlier discussion.    They had agreed thatthey could not recommend either an interim uprating or a Christmasbonus.    An interim uprating could not in practice be paid until May1978, and would give rise to strong pressure to take account of thefurther inflation between Novembei 1977 and May 1978.    A Christmasbonus had political attractions, but it would be irrelevant to thestatutory duty laid upon him to uprate weekly benefits sufficiently to restore their value;  and it could not in any case take account of pricerises up to November unless payment were delayed until February.It would be very costly - a  10 bonus would cost  100 million - and since it would require legislation the amount of the bonus would not, inthe present Parliamentary situation, be wholly within the Government&apos;control.    He remained of the view, therefore, that the uprating must make proper allowance for his statutory obligation.    Given the inevitable uncertainty of the forecast increase in prices he did notthink that an increase of 13.1 per cent would be adequate from thispoint of view or would be accepted by the House of Commons.    He hadalready reduced his original proposal for a 16. 3 per cent increase toone of 15 per cent for long-term benefits and 14. 7 per cent for short-term benefits.    He did not favour any greater differential betweenshort and long-term benefits than this, since he had the same legal obligations in respect of both, and there were strong social reasonsagainst enlarging the differential which had already been widened inthe 1976 uprating.    He therefore strongly recommended the 15 percent/14. 7 per cent proposal to his colleagues.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that there was no justification for doing other than uprate in line with the best availableforecast.    If the Secretary of State for Social Services&apos; proposal were accepted, the total claims on the Contingency Reserve in 1977-78would leave only  34 million uncommitted while claims in 1978-79would commit more than the total reserve available.    Even if thereproved to be money to spare it did not follow that this was the best way of spending it as against other claims.    He thought therefore that the right course was to uprate by 13.1 per cent but to make itclear that if the forecast proved to be too low the Government wouldmake good the difference.    If however the Cabinet felt that an upratingof 13.1 per cent was too low, they should choose one of 14. 4 per centrather than 15 per cent.    But they should also consider thepossibility of a lower increase for short-term than for long-term benefits; this did not mean penalising the short-term beneficiaries,since they would still be getting an nprating which matched the fore-cast of price increases and was tax-free.
In discussion there was general agreement that, while there werepolitical arguments in favour of a Christmas bonus, a decision on thisshould be taken on its merits separately and later.    It was alsostressed that the Cabinet should bear in mind not just the percentagefigures but the actual sums which pensioners would receive.     the uprating given in 1976 for long-term benefits was  2 for a single person and  3.30 for a married couple, bringing the rates to  15. 30and  24.50 respectively.    The proposal of the Secretary of State for social Services would bring these current rates up to  17. 60 and 28. 20, while those of the Chief Secretary, Treasury, would bring them to  17. 30 and  27. 70.    An uprating of 14. 4 per cent would givebenefit rates of  17. 50 and  28 which arguably had the advantage of producing round figures in addition to giving slightly higher increases in money terms than those of 1976.In further discussion it vas argued that not to give 15 per cent woulddisappoint beneficiaries and have a serious and adverse effect on thediscussions with the Trades Union Congress on pay policy.    TheGovernment so far had been able to maintain that they had treatedpensioners well, and it was important that they should sustain this position.    If there were insufficient revenue available to meetpriorities of this kind - and another might well be the proposals for employment creation which were coming from the Manpower services commission - then more funds should be raised through additionaltaxation.    On the other hand it was pointed out that any departure from13.1 per cent for the uprating would inevitably cast doubt upon the forecast increase in prices.    It would be wrong to do this at a timewhen the Government were still fighting to bring down the inflationrate.    Furthermore, the economic position of the country, and thepolitical situation of the Government, had improved over the last sixmonths, largely because of the firm controls exercised by theTreasury, and it was important to maintain these by sticking to 13.1 percent and leaving any money which might later be available for otherpriorities, including other social expenditure.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that there remained differing views in Cabinet on the uprating which should begiven;  but there was a clear majority in favour of an increase of14. 4 p^r cent for long-term benefits and 14 per cent for short-term benefits.    This should be publicly presented, not as indicating anyuncertainty about the forecast of price increases, but rather as anuprating intended to do rather more than keep pace with inflation.Consistently with this, no undertaking should be given to make good anyshortfall if, contrary to the Government expectations, the forecastshould turn out to be wrong.    Whatever the merits of a higher rate forlong-term than for short-term benefits it was clear that greaterdiscrimination between the rates would be politically unacceptable.
The Cabinet -1. Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Secretary of State for social services to arrange for an announcement that the1977 uprating of social security benefits would produce benefit rates of  17. 50 for a single person and  28 for a married couple on long-term benefits,and  14. 70 for a single person and  23. 80 for a married couple on short-term benefits.10
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for Education and Science and Paymaster General(CP(77) 51) on the question whether the second stage increase tocertain top salaries groups should be reduced by the increase of 208 a year which they would receive under round 2 of the pay policy.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR EDUCATION AND SCIENCE and paymaster GENERAL said that in 1974 the Government had accepted the salaries recommended by the Top Salaries review body (TSRB) for the higher Civil Service, the higher judiciary and senior officers of the Armed Forces, and those recommended by the doctors&apos; and Dentists&apos; Review Body (DDRB) for doctors and dentistsin the National Health Service;  but had decided that for the moresenior of them the increase should be paid in two stages.    Thesecond stage had subsequently been withheld as being precludedby the  8, 500 cut off in vound 1 of the pay policy.    Although therewas now no formal pay policy objection to paying the second stage,no decision to pay it had yet been taken.    The current thinking ofthe responsible Ministerial Committee was that it might be paid from 1 August but this depended upon the terms of round 3 of the pay policy.    The question before Cabinet at the moment was:   should that stage 2 of the increase, when paid, be abated by the  208increase which Ministers had agreed in correspondence should bepaid under round 2 to those covered by the TSRB and DDRB awards?The immediate significance of the question was that the answer would affect the pensions of those who retired, since the whole of theTSRB and DDRB awards was reckonable for pension calculationpurposes.    The argument in favour of deducting the  208 was thatthis was required by a strict interpretation of pay policy, aninterpretation which had in fact been applied in other cases.    TheTrades Union Congress (TUC) had been consulted on the point andhad supported this view.    Against this it had been argued that the pay policy guidelines were concerned with pre-policy agreements which anticipated future increases, not, as here, where theincrease related to an earlier period;  and that to withhold this 208 when the second stage of the increase was payable would beto discriminate further against a group who had already been treatedless than fairly.In discussion it was argued that the requirements of the pay policyguidelines were quite clear, and had been applied to a large numberof other cases, including that of the seamen.    To treat the TSRBand DDRB groups differently would be totally unacceptable.    TheGovernment had already agreed that these groups should be allowedto count their, as yet unpaid, stage 2 increases for pensicn purposes,and there was no justification for giving them the further privilege of counting the  208 in addition.    Against this it was argued that,in the case of the seamen and others, not only had rates for staged11
payments been fixed before the pay policy came into effect, butdates for the increases had been fixed also.    This was not the case with the group under discussion, where no dates had been fixed.It had been a unilateral decision by the Government not to pay inone increase the whole of the new rates recommended by the ReviewBoards.    Against this it was argued that there had been other groups of employees who had similarly had no date fixed for stagedpayments, who had nevertheless been required, in compliance with pay policy, to subsume staged payments within the pay policymaxima.    To pay the  208 in addition to the stage 2 paymentsmight result in many other cases being reopened and even endangerphase 2 of the pay policy.In further discussion it was argued that the group under discussion were in a unique position, and could and should be treated as aspecial case.    The matter was one on which a decision could notbe delayed, because the report of the DDRB had been in theGovernment1 s hands for over a month and must be published at anearly date.    At the same time the Government would have toindicate publicly whether or not they were accepting the Board&apos;srecommendations.    If they rejected them, the Board would resign,and the Government&apos;s relations with the medical profession would suffer a serious setback.    The position of the judiciary would bedifficult if it were decided to abate the stage 2 payments by the  208,since the judges had a statutory right to the stage 2 payments whichthey were at present waiving and if the  208 were to be subsumedin the stage 2 payments they might well abandon their waiver.    one possibility might be to refer the matter to a body set up to deal withanomalies under the pay policy in round 3;  but this was not reallypossible since the TUC were at present much opposed to the creationof such a body.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that itwas urgent for a decision to be taken.    If the Cabinet agreed that the 208 might be paid in addition to the stage 2 increases this would beill-received by the TUC;  on the other hand if they decided that the stage 2 increases should be reduced by the  208 this could lead to serious trouble with the doctors and dentists of a kind which mightforce the Government to change their decision at a later stage.Whether the position of these top salaries groups was unique wasa matter on which two views were held by different members ofCabinet.    On balance, the majority view of the Cabinet was thatthe  208 should be paid in addition to the stage 2 increases.    Thiswould need to be presented in as low key a manner as possible inorder to minimise any problems for the pay policy discussions withthe TUC.12
The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.BP 6. The Cabinet discussed British Petroleum shares.    TheirSHARES discussion and the conclusions reached are recorded separately.previous reference:CM(76) 39thconclusions13
7. The Cabinet considered a note by the Lord Chancellor(CP(77) 50) covering the policy sections of a draft Green Paper onthe housing policy review for England and Wales.    The memorandumby the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP(77) 52), covering thecorresponding draft for Scotland, had also been circulated forinformation.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that when the Ministerial Groupunder his chairmanship began their studv of the housing policy review, they were presented with statistics which revealed a netsurplus, small but growing, of houses over households and areduction in the number of households in unsatisfactory conditions to little more than a quarter of the number 25 years ago.    On theother hand, the Group were conscious that there was still a greatdeal of bad housing and that there were wide local and regionalvariations in the intensity of housing problems which the overallnational statistics concealed.    The main thrust of the Green Papertherefore was on the assessment and more selective treatment oflocal housing needs, involving local housing strategies, housinginvestment plans and a reshaped public sector subsidy system.    Thedraft Green Paper made no specific commitment on the future levelof housing investment; and the issue of the rate of rent increaseswas dealt with on the basis of a proposal that it should be broadlyin line with increases in money incomes.    The main elements of theproposed new policy were set out in paragraph 3 of his note.    Theonly issue which had been left undetermined was that of relief on mortgage interest at higher rates of tax which the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Secretary of State for the Environment were considering further before putting their conclusions to the Cabinet.The remaining sections of the draft Green Paper which were in preparation would contain a more detailed exposition of the policyproposals and after it had been approved by the Ministers chiefly concerned, it would be circulated to members of the Cabinet forinformation.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatthe Ministerial Group had succeeded in resolving all points of disagreement on the policy proposals embodied in the draft green paper, except what should be said about the question of relief on mortgage interest at higher rates of tax;  on this he and theChancellor of the Exchequer expected to be able to circulate agreedrecommendations to members of the Cabinet before their next meeting.    But he hoped that the Cabinet would approve theremainder of the draft in order to enable further work to proceedwith a view to publication in the second or third week of June.14
In discussion the following points were made -a. The proposal to encourage the sale of council houses in the right circumstances would be controversial with someLabour Party supporters.    But it had to be viewed againstthe shift of public opinion in this direction and the fact thatthe Conservatives were determined to make it an entitlementfor any council tenant to buy his house.    It was sensible forthe Government to take a step towards making home ownershipmore easily available provided that sales were confined to areas which had a real easement in their public sector housing situation.    It would not be practicable, however, tointroduce legislation directly to prevent councils from sellinghouses in areas of housing stress.    The relatively smalltake-up of schemes of purchase on favourable terms last yearsuggested that the risk of large sales of council houses could easily be exaggerated.    But the Secretary of State for the environment would aim to impose on councils in stress areasan obligation of &quot;additionality&quot; in the sense that he wouldrequire some relationship to be preserved between whatcouncils received from council house sales and what theyspent on their housing sector generally.    It was noted thatthe Secretary of State for Scotland had doubts about the praticability of imposing an obligation of this kind and thathe would be considering other possible methods of achieving the same objective.b. The proposals to encourage owner occupation more generally should have political appeal.    The proposed schemeof Government assistance for first-time buyers would be onmodest lines, involving a matching loan of  500, with interest and repayments deferred for 5 years, to anypurchaser who had been able to save  500 for the purchase.The initial cost would be about  60 million in a full year,which would diminish as loans were repaid.    The scheme would be directed to purchasers at the lower end of theproperty market and, provided that mortgage loans were also available elsewhere, it should provide material assistance for those who could not at present afford to buy.It was noted that the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterwould put to the Secretary of State for the Environmentcertain ideas which he had for enlarging building societyobligations and for easing the path of prospective home owners.c. Some importance had been attached by the national executive Committee of the Labour Party to an equality ofassistance to the public and the private sectors.    Comparisonsof this kind were unrealistic, but the figures for the total15
amount of assistance to each sector and the amount ofassistance per head at present worked out at approximately 1, 000 million and  210 respectively, with only marginaldifferences between the two sectors.    Nevertheless the draftGreen Paper attempted to form a rough link between the twosectors in suggesting a floor of 35 per cent, or the equivalent of the basic rate of tax relief on mortgage interest, for thesubsidy payable to any local authority.    In Scotlandassistance to the public sector was much greater than to theprivate sector, and partly for this reason the Scottish green paper would not float the idea of a minimum subsidyentitlement for local authorities.    The point was made thatequity within the sectors was also important and that thiswould be achieved by reducing the subsidy for those authorities which did not need it to the benefit of those which did, and by limitations on the availability of tax relief on mortgage loan interest in the private sector.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the policy sections of the draft Green Paperannexed to CP(77) 50, with the exception of the passages relatingto relief on mortgage interest at higher rates of tax which they hadnot discussed and on which the Chancellor of the Exchequer and theSecretary of State for the Environment would be submitting their recommendations before the next meeting.    It was noted that theremainder of the draft Green Paper, dealing with the policyproposals in more detail, would be circulated to members of theCabinet as soon as possible with the intention that the Green Papersfor England and Wales and for Scotland should be publishedsimultaneously in about the second or third week of June.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office19 May 197716
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy no 9CABINETBP SHARESPreviousReference:CM(76) 39thConclusionsLIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 20th Conclusions, Minute 6Thursday 19 May 1977 at 10. 00 am the Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretary of Statefor Energy (CP(77) 53) proposing that the sale of 17. 4 per cent of theBritish Petroleum (BP) shares should be deferred until the autumn, anda memorandum by the Chief Secretary, Treasury (CP(77) 56)commenting on this suggestion.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that in December1976, during their coxisideration of measures to combat the sterlingcrisis, the Cabinet had agreed to sell part of the public sector share-holding in BP, in order to reduce the public sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) in 1977-78 by about  500 million.    Since then theeconomic situation had changed considerably, and it now looked as ifthe PSBR would be considerably lower than had then been expected.Sales of gilts had gone well and sterling had strengthened considerablyas international confidence in the United Kingdom had returned, helped by the increasing production of North Sea oil.    Since the Decemberdecision the BP share price had risen very considerably, though it had also fluctuated quite widely about the general trend.    AfterPresident Carter&apos;s statement on energy it had immediately risen by70p, and the previous day, merely on unconfirmed rumours of a newdiscovery of natural gas, it had risen 18p to stand at 964p.    Atthat price the shares would realise a much larger sum than the 500 million estimated in December, and it would be unnecessary tosell so many to obtain the same benefit.    Moreover by waiting theGovernment could almost certainly get an even better price.Estimates of Alaskar. oil reserves were likely to be increased byabout 20 per cent, a further price rise by the Organisation ofPetroleum Exporting Countries was expected the following month, theUnited States had talked about creating larger stockpiles of oil and BPwere taking a share in the Buchan field.    Their investment in theForties field was proving so successful that it was expected to be recovered in 18 months.    All these events would tend to improve BP&apos;sprofitability and increase the value of the company&apos;s shares.    It now
seemed unlikely that the company would need to make a rights issuefor about three years.    Hence he was seeking his colleagues&apos; agree-ment to postpone the sale until later in the year.    Disposal of the shares was not popular in the Labour Party, nor with the TradesUnion Congress.    If, by disposing of the shares prematurely, the proceeds were less than might have been obtained by waiting longer,the displeasure woald be heightened, particularly in view of the large amount of commission - estimated at  20 million - which would haveto be paid to financial intermediaries.    The Chancellor of theExchequer, in his Budget Speech, had referred to a proposal to restrict the unilateral relief for taxes paid by oil companies.    TheSecretary of State for Energy understood that this proposal mightyield as much as  150 million in the current financial year but that progress on this was beirg delayed in order to avoid depressing theprice of the BP shares.    He was also concerned about the possibility that a foreign Government might acquire a substantial shareholding inBP, as a result of the sale, while the ordinary people of the UnitedKingdom, who ought to be the chief beneficiaries of North Sea oil,were unable to buy shares.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the aim of theoperation was not to reduce the Government&apos;s shareholding in BP butto dispose of most of the additional holding which had been acquired bythe Bank of England from Burmah Oil Company as a result of thesupport operation extended to that company in 1975.    The timing hadbeen intended to relieve the PSBR in 1977-78.    Deferment of the saleuntil the autumn would lose the prospect of getting the full benefit inthat year.    A sale of this magnitude - larger than any previousoperation of the kind anywhere - could only be successfully mountedwhen the market was rising;  when it was, it could always be argued that the price might rise higher if one waited longer, but there was nomeans of knowing for how long one could afford to wait.    If themarket fell, a sale would be much more difficult, and arguments couldbe advanced in favour of waiting until it turned up again.     The brightprospects which had been held out for BP were not a secret:   theywere recognised throughout the financial world, and as a result hadalready been extensively anticipated in the price of the shares.Their price earnings ratio stood at 34, which compared with anaverage of 10. 7 for oil shares in general.    Moreover, someunforeseen development in Alaska or the Middle East could at anytime depress the price of the shares.    It would be possible to try toorganise the sale without taking advice from institutions with long experience and expertise in the stock markets, but this course wouldcertainly result in a much lower yield, and the loss was likely to bemuch greater than the  20 million saved on professional advice and services.    It was not correct that the examination of oil company tax relief was being held up because of this sale.    The oil companiesenjoyed relief against United Kingdom tax in respect of &quot;taxes&quot; which
kthey paid in some Middle East covintries.   The United States Governmentoffered similar credit.     If the United Kingdom restricted this relief itwould need to keep in step with the Americans, or it might gi ve UnitedStates companies a competitive advantage against domestic ones such asBP.     Consultations were continuing, but even if a change were introduced in this year&apos;s Finance Bill, it would not take effect until about 1981and would then only raise  50 million a year.   While it was true that aforeign Government could apply for a very large slice of the shares off-ered, the Bank of England would have discretion over the allotment of the shares, and could determine whether such applications were filled.There was however nothing to stop a foreign Government from buyingshares on the open market at present.    While the PSBR position was now less critical than had been expected in December, unless the salewent ahead soon, the  600 million would not be available in this yearto give the Cabinet more manoeuvring room if they wished to decide on any reflationary measures during the current year.In discussion it was argued that the original decision had been to sellenough shares to raise  500 million, and the number of shares offeredshould be limited to that figure.    Since there could be no certaintywhen the best price could be obtained, it might be better to make the shares available on demand, like a &quot;tr,p stock&quot; rather than in a singlelarge block.    Alternatively, it might be possible to hedge bets by offering thu shares in two stages - some now and a further lot in theautumn.    In this way some benefits might be obtained from thepredicted rise in prices if it took place.    There should also be abetter chance for members of the British public to acquire some of the shares.    It was not clear why, if a sale or part of a sale weredeferred to the autumn, the proceeds would not be available before theend of 1977-78.Against this it was pointed out that when the Cabinet had reviewedtheir December decision, in March 1977, the Chancellor of theExchequer^ paper (CP(77) 26) had made clear that because of the appreciation of the shares in the meantime, the proceeds were likelyto be some  600 million, and Cabinet had agreed that he should takecredit for that in devising his Budget strategy.    The Bank of england had examined carefully whether the shares could be offered like a &quot;tapstock&quot; but had advised that this was unlikely to be more successfulthan a single offering, and would raise difficulties with the rules ofthe United States Securities and Exchange Commission.    It was alreadyintended to allow subscribers to pay for their shares in two instalments,and this was why, if the sale were made too late in the year, some ofthe proceeds would be deferred until 1978- 79.    Splitting the offer into two stages however seemed practicable.    There could be no guarantee that it would increase the amount received for the shares.    The firstoffering might flop if would-be purchasers chose to hold off in the hopeof getting the second tranche at a lower price.    If the autumn pricewere higher the Government might be criticised for not having waited
to sell all the shares then.    Nevertheless this proposal hadimportant political advantages and was well worth further positiveconsideration.    At the same time more thought might be given torestricting the possibility of foreign Governments obtaining a largeshare (perhaps by limiting the number of shares which could be acquired by a single purchaser) and to giving a wider preference forthe British public.    The German Government had given preference tothe German people when it had sold the shares in Volkswagen.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet had decided in December, and had confirmed their decision inMarch, to sell 17. 4 per cent of the Government shareholding in BP.The majority still felt that this decision should not be reversed andthat the sale should commence in June.    However there seemed manyadvantages in dividing the operation into two stages, and offering about half the shares in June arid the rest later in the year.     The HomeSecretary, the Secretary of State for Energy, the Chief Secretary,Treasury, and the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should giveurgent and constructive consideration to the practicability of such a division.    They should also consider whether applications by foreign government could be effectively restricted, say by limiting theallocation of shares to individual purchasers to 1-2 per cent, andwhether there were ar-y additional means of ensuring that members ofthe British public who wished to acquire the shares had every chanceof doing so.    The Cabinet authorised the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to proceed with arrangements for the sale subject to the conclusions ofthis group on these points.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theMinisters concerned to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office20 May 1977
