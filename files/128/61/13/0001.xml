PARLIAMENTARY      1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in affairs the House of Commons during the following week.FOREIGNAFFAIRSMeeting of theEuropean Councilin Rome25-26 March2. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat one issue which would prove difficult at the meeting of theEuropean Council due to be held in Rome on 25-26 March concerned the possible representation of the Community at the meeting of theDowning Street Summit on 7-8 May and in particular the possibility that Mr Roy Jenkins might attend as President of the Commission.When the Council of Ministers (Foreign Affairs) had discussed thisquestion on 8 March the French had been isolated in opposing the representation of the Community as such (that is by the presidency of the Community and by the President of the Commission) at theLondon Summit.    Since then there had been a growing chorus of protest from the smaller Member States, in particular the benelux countries, and the hope had been expressed that the French linemight change after their municipal elections.    But the french foreign Minister had made it clear to him that French opposition was firm and this had been confirmed by a message the previous day from President Giscard to the Prime Minister maintaining Frenchopposition in uncompromising terms.    While, therefore, it was our duty as the Presidency to try and promote agreement it would be most undesirable to let the atmosphere of the forthcoming EuropeanCouncil be soured by prolonged argument over an issue which,though important, was not a major one.In discussion it was suggested that there would now be advantage ininducing the smaller Member States to recognise the hardening ofFrench opinion and the risk in these circumstances that a row atthe European Council would only be counter-productive and distractfrom major and substantive issues such as unemployment and thewo lid economic situation.Indian Elections In a brief discussion on the outcome of the Indian election, it wasnoted that according to the latest information Mr Desai was likelyto be the new Prime Minister.    Although now an old man he stillcombined determination and high moral purpose with authoritarianviews and financial conservatism.    It was however too early toform a reliable judgment of the policies of the new indian government:  and it might be several months before these became clear.    Indeed it was arguable that the Janata Party might not holdtogether for long.    We had welcomed the new Government but weshould not turn our backs on Mrs. Gandhi, who had to some extentbeen misrepresented and of whom we had probably not heard the lastin Indian politics.The Cabinet -Took note.1
COMMUNITYAGRICULTURALSUPPORTPRICES 1977-78PreviousReference:CM(76) 34thConclusions,Minute 23. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP(77) 32 by theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food recommending a basis for the settlement of the Community agricultural support pricepackage for 1977-78.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD,introducing his paper, said that the Ministerial Committee tsnEuropean Questions (CQM) had broadly agreed that we could acceptprice increases at or near the average level of 3 per cent proposedby the Commission.    The main question for Cabinet was whether weshould refuse any devaluation of the Green Pound or whether, as he proposed, we should accept a devaluation of 2 - 3 per cent on condition that its effect on food prices generally was more than offset by a Community butter subsidy for the United Kingdom.    Such asettlement would be in accordance with the strategy for the common agricultural Policy approved by Cabinet on 25 November 1976(CM(76) 34th Conclusions, Minute 2) and with the views expressedin the Economic Review for 1977 published by the Trades UnionCongress (TUC).    A settlement would also be consistent with ourspecific aims which had been endorsed by the TUC.    It would resultin price reductions in real terms for commodities in structuralsurplus.    This in turn would help to improve access to the Communityfor third country and especially Commonwealth foodstuffs, on whichwe had already had some success with beef and potatoes.    We were also seeking to retain the essential functions of the milk marketing boards, to continue the system of beef premiums and more generally to counter inflation.    The choice of a butter subsidy as the means ofoffsetting the proposed devaluation of the Green Pound was justified by evidence from the National Food Survey that butter consumption was higher among the less well-off and the elderly than among thewell-to-do. .    It would help to meet the current political and public criticism of incx*eases in butter prices against the background ofsubsidised exports.    He had circulated with his minute of 23 Marcha note by officials showing that a 2 per cent Green Pound devaluationwould increase consumer prices by  63 million.    A butter subsidysufficient to offset this increase would in practice be equal to theeffect on butter prices of the two transitional steps to full Communityprices that we were due to take in 1977.    Although the Council ofMinisters (Agriculture) were unlikely to reach agreement at their meeting on 25-27 March, it would probably not be possible to defer adecision beyond the end of April or early May.    But it would betactically advantageous to accept a settlement, if satisfactory terms were available, at the Council to be held on 25-27 March, subject toprior consultation with the Prime Minister if the terms were not fully within his authority.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that the ministerial Committee on European Questions at their meeting on21 March had not had the detailed calculation of the proposed buttersubsidy before them.    But the majority of the Committee had beenready to accept a small devaluation of the Green Pound provided that
its effect on food prices was at least offset by a Community buttersubsidy which could be presented publicly as a demonstrableadvantage for the United Kingdom.In discussion it was pointed out that a butter subsidy to offset aGreen Pound devaluation of 2 per cent would require a contribution from the Exchequer on New Zealand butter of  16 million.    Anearly devaluation could have an adverse effect on the climate forthe Budget and the ensuing discussions with the TUC on pay policy.The TUC leaders were less ready to contemplate a devaluation than their Economic Review might imply and were more apt to regard the green Pound as a symbol of the Governments detsrmination to resist price increases.    It would be difficult to demonstrate the off-setting effect of a butter subsidy financed partly by the Exchequeragainst a background of rising food prices, a growth in the Communitybutter surplus far exceeding the increase in consumption attributable to the subsidy, and continuing subsidised exports.    This difficulty would be increased if the subsidised butter was allocated forinstitutional uses.    A devaluation which would increase our farm prices would not help our partners to accept lower prices for theirfarmers.    Moreover, it would be permanent whereas a subsidy would be subject to annual negotiation.    While the proposed commonprice increases could be defended as below the rate of inflation asettlement involving a devaluation should not be accepted at thisstage.    The Community contribution to the proposed subsidy wouldbe financed through a co-responsibility levy on milk production of2j per cent set against a proposed price increase of 3 per cent.This was objectionable as a method of raising additional revenue for the financing of CAP operations in the milk sector and mightset an undesirable precedent for other sectors.    It was acceptableonly as a device for offsetting the inevitable price increase, andfor discouraging high-cash production.On the other hand it was argued that desirable as it might be to avoid a Green Pound devaluation for as long as possible, it was acceptable to contemplate a devaluation for which we were adequately compen-sated.   A butter subsidy would be a useful form of compensationgiven the eharp price increases in proepect and the maintenance of consumption would be helpful to New Zealand,    The effectivereduction of the levy on New Zealand butter would be consistent withour aim of improving access for imports to the Community.    Adevaluation of the Green Pound would also help to mitigate the adversecompetitive effect of the devaluation of the Irish Green Pound on theagricultural industry, notably in Wales and in Northern Ireland wheresubstantial Exchequer subsidies were paid to offset the effects on employment.    More generally, devaluation of the Green Pound wasnot unprecedented.    We would be in a difficult negotiating position if we could not accept any devaluation.    This would reactunfavourably on our other objectives at the price-fixing and on ourPresidency.3
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that cabinet were agreed that the Minister of Agriculture should have authority, if otherwise he would be isolated, to accept a settlementat the Council of Agricultural Ministers on 25-27 March on the basisagreed by the Ministerial Committee on European Questions, and including a devaluation of 2 - 3 per cent in the Green Pound on condition that its effect on the level of food prices generally was morethan offset by a Community butter subsidy for the United Kingdom.There would however be political advantage if a settlement could be deferred to a further meeting of the Agricultural Council.    If theMinister wished to accept a settlement which went in any respectbeyond this authority he should consult the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary who should in turn consult the chief secretary and the Secretary of State for Prices and consumer protection as necessary.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theMinister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to be guided accordingly.INDUSTRIALDEMOCRACYIN THEPOST OFFICEPreviousReference:CM(77) 11thConclusions,M-*mte 34. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to hismimite of 22 March to the Prime Minister reporting that the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (EY) on 21 Marchhad discussed papers on the Post Office Bill, which was required tofacilitate the introduction of a scheme for industrial democracy in thePost Office,    EY had noted that the Bill might run into Parliamentarydifficulties;  and that some people would regard it as prejudicing theGovernment&apos;s attitude on the Bullock Report generally, although on balance the Committee did not think that would be justified.    Thescheme was one which had been agreed between the management andthe unions in the Post Office, and it would have been implementedwithout reference to the Government were it not for the fact that the agreed arrangements required an enlargement of the Post office board from 12 to 16, the maximum size of the Board being fixed by statute.    One reason why it was feared that the Bill might become an occasion for raising matters relevant to the Bullock Report wasthat the scheme provided that worker representatives would beappointed by the Post Office unions, and not elected by all the workersalthough it was noted that 97 per cent of Post Office workers belonged to a union.    The Post Office unions had made it clear that they wouldnot agree to election by all workers;  nor were they in favour of an interim solution operated within the present size of the Post office board.    Since the discussion in EY, a new situation had been created by the agreement with the Liberals announced the previous day, andhe suggested that the best way to proceed would be to seek Liberalsupport for the Bill in its present form.    Some members of EY took
the view that the Bill should be delayed until the shape of thegeneral legislation of the Bullock Report was clearer;  but the PostOffice unions were anxious for an early settlement.    Even if the liberals were not prepared to support the Bill, it was possible thatthe Scottish and Welsh Nationalists would do so.In discussion it was argued that, although the Post Office scheme was undoubtedly a good one, the Bill would provide Parliament with anopportunity to discuss the way in which worker representatives shouldbe selected, and in particular the Post Office proposals for their being nominated by trade unions.    One possibility might have been tohave nominations put forward by the trade unions followed by electionsby all Post Office staff;  but the unions were adamant that they wouldnot agree to non-unioni6ts being involved in the selection of representa-tives.    The Liberals had already said that they would oppose this legislation, and it seemed unlikely that the Government could rely upon the support of the Nationalists.    There was no doubt that toproceed with the Bill would make the Governments handling of theBullock proposals more difficult.    The Bill should therefore be postponed until the Governments position on the Bullock proposals was clear - which meant until the next Session of Parliament - whenthe present difficulties would disappear and the Bill could proceed.Against this it was strongly argued that the likelihood of Parliamentarydifficulty was being exaggerated.    It was only a one clause Bill, andit could be demonstrated that the scheme flowed from discussions which had begun well before the Bullock Committee had reported.The Post Office unions would be both disappointed and puzzled if theGovernment did not go ahead.    One possibility might be to introduce the Bill in the Lords to see how much trouble it provoked.    Defer-ment now would arouse the suspicion that the Government wasretreating because of the deal with the Liberals, and although thiswould be wrong it would be undesirable to give such an impression.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority in the Cabinet would like to proceed with the Post Office Billthis Session.   Under the new arrangements the Government had a requirement to consult the Liberals.    It should be made clear tothem that the Government believed that there were strong arguments for going ahead, and their support should be sought.    A final decisions would be taken when their reaction was known.    In the meantimenothing should be said publicly.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.5
5. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred tohis minute of 23 March to the Prime Minister reporting that the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (EY) had, on22 March, discussed the Occupational Pension Schemes Bill.This Bill would give members of pension schemes the right toappoint up to 50 per cent of the members of the managementbodies, and would do so by giving the right to nominate those members to recognised independent trade unions - as had been proposed in the White Paper &quot;Occupational Pension Schemes:The Role of Members in the Running of the Schemes&quot; (Cmnd 6514).On the latter point the majority of the Committee had favouredsticking to the White Paper proposals.    This had been agreed with the Trades Union Congress (TUC), but opponents   of theBullock proposals - including in particular the Confederation ofBritish Industry (CBI) - would regard it as highly prejudicial tothe Governments position on those proposals.    In his view there was in fact no real analogy with the question of puttingworkers on company boards., since pension was essentiallydeferred pay and therefore a proper concern of trade unions -although not all members of EY shared that view.    There was,however, the question whether the Bill could be got through parliament.    Unlike the Post Office Bill, it contained 17 clausesand would be far more vulnerable to amendment in StandingCommittee - indeed it might emerge in a form which would be unwelcome to the TUC, who regarded the trade union nomination of members as of critical importance.    It would therefore benecessary to discuss the matter with the Liberals.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said thatthe Bill was not about the same issue as the Bullock Report,since it dealt with deferred pay.     If the CBI opposed it becauseof Bullock, the Government could demonstrate that it wat quite different, and could point to the fact that in an increasing numberof companies arrangements of the kind envisaged in the Bill werebeing implemented.    Since the Bill sought to ensure equal rights for men and women it was likely to be electorally popular.    Inhis view the agreement made the previous day with the Liberalsmeant that there was even less justification than previously for not going forward with the Bill, and he favoured consultationwith the other Parliamentary parties as rapidly as possible witha view to its early introduction.In discussion it was argued that, while it was right that contributorsto pension schemes should have up to 50 per cent representation onthe management body, the controversial question would be howthose representatives should be selected.    Inevitably this question would become mixed in the public mind with the issues raised bythe Bullock Report.    It would be quite indefensible to exclude from the process of selection people who were contributing to the pension scheme.    A Bill incorporating such a proposal had no chance of being approved by Parliament, and the Government6OCCUPATIONALPENSION SCHEMESBILLPreviousReference:CM(77) 11thConclusions,Minute 3
would be unwise even to consult the other Parties about introducingsuch a Bill.    It would make the Governments handling of theBullock proposals more difficult and was very unlikely to beelectorally popular.    It was one thing to favour greater  employeeparticipation in the management of pension funds;  but those whoinsisted upon confining to the trade unions the right to appoint suchrepresentatives demonstrated that their real purpose was toincrease trade union participation, not employee participation.The savings of a large number of people were involved, and tosuggest that a large share in the management of those funds shouldbe handed over to trade unionists not elected by all thecontributors would be a political mistake and ethically wrong.On the other hand it was argued that it was mistaken to treat this issue as a major point of principle.     The truth was that the nowwidely accepted collective bargaining process had only become possible because of the existence of trade unions, and those whochose not to join trade unions could not complain if they wereoutside that process.    Trade unions had been given a greater say we industrial training and health and safety matters and it wasnatural to extend this process to the pension field.    It was pointedout that at present many of the 64, 000 pension schemes inoperation were run with no consultation whatsoever with thecontributors to the schemes, being wholly under the authority of management.    Where enlightened management - as in such largefirms as Unilever and ICI and in the electricity supply industry -had entered into arrangements for employee representation,whether by universal ballot or through trade union nomination,those arrangements would remain unaffected by the Bill, whichwould do no more than provide a framework within whichappropriate arrangements would be worked out for all schemes.In continuing discussion it was argued that, if only because twowidely differing views of the Bill were possible, it would benecessary to proceed with caution.    Parliamentary time in thepresent Session was not unlimited, and the Bill, beingcontroversial, would occupy a good deal of time.    It would thereforeneed to be considered in relation to the whole legislative programme,and to the vulnerability of the Government in Standing Committee.Its introduction could mean shorter Recesses than the Governmenthad been hoping for, or it might increase the need for an overspillperiod.    There was the possibility that the House of Lords mightobject to a new Eill being brought forward feo late in the Session.It was also suggested that Cabinets discussion of the Bill hadunderlined the need for Ministers to give more careful collectiveconsideration to the important question raised by Bullock of selection (by trade unions) versus elections (by all employees).THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of Cabinet favoured going ahead with the Bill     sufficientParliamentary time could be made available and there was areasonable chance of ensuring its passage without undue mutilation.7
It would be essential to consult the TUC, and to explain to them thatthe Government might find it necessary, on Parliamentary grounds,to choose between this Bill and the Post Office Bill;  and to make clearthat the latter might be preferred because of its better chance of beingpassed.    There should also be consultations with the Liberals butnot until after the consultations on the Post Office Bill had taken place.The results of these consultations would then need to be brought backto Cabinet for further consideration.    Guidance would be promulgatedshortly about the machinery for consulting the Liberals but in themeantime the Lord President of the Council should be consulted before an approach was made to the Liberals on any subject.    More generallyhe reminded Cabinet of the importance of close consultation with labour Members of Parliament, and drew their attention to theletter of 31 January 1977 which he had sent to Mr Cledwyn Hughes,the Chairman of the Parliamentary Labour Party CPLP), setting outthe basis on which consultations with the PLP would be conducted.These arrangements had been accepted by the PLP, and all ministers should observe them carefully.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of che Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to be guided accordingly.6. THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER referred to his minute of 23 March to the Prime Minister reporting that the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy (EY) had discussed on22 March a proposal by the Secretary of State for Energy that the gas price increase announced for 1 April should not take place.    that price increase had been agreed by Cabinet the previous December inorder to save  88 million in 1977-78 and  100 million in 1978-79, thedecision having been taken on a unanimous recommendation from a ministerial Group chaired by the Secretary of State for Energy.    Ithad been preferred to the alternative of cuts in public expenditure onthe grounds that it would assist energy policy and reduce the total debt of the British Gas Corporation.    It had formed part of the agreementwith the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and had been announced &quot;in the House of Commons.    The increase had been unpopular;  and thePrice Commission had been unable to agree to it within the terms ofthe Price Code, so that, as had always been known, it would benecessary for the Secretary of State for Energy to override the price commission.    The unions naturally disliked seeing what appeared to bea price increase engineered by the Government;  but the Gas Consumers&apos;Council had not complained.    A majority of the members of EY had thought it would be economically damaging and politically counter-productive to reverse the decision now;  but EY were equally divided on whether some concession might be made during the negotiations on the 8
third round of the pay policy.    Since EY had reached their view ongas prices, Ministers had decided upon measures affecting theTemporary Employment Subsidy and inner cities which would betweenthem put an additional demand of some  45 million on the contingency reserve in 1977-78 in addition to the provision which he earlier had inmind for inner cities.     It was impossible to accommodate additionallythe  88 million which a reversal of the gas price increase would entail.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR ENERGY said that since thedecision in December a number of things had changed.    The forecast of the public sector borrowing requirement in 1977-78 had been reducedby  1 billion.    Price inflation was now a much bigger factor in thepublic mind, particularly after Mr Jack Jones&apos; demand for a pricefreeze.    The implications of overriding the Price Commission wereclearer and appeared very difficult.    The significance of the increase for the pay negotiations had become more manifest;  and the reactions of the electorate in Stechford had demonstrated the significance of this issue for the Governments political position.In discussion it was argued that this was an issue on which theGovernment could well at some stage face difficulty in Parliament.Had the Government tabled a normal Motion on the Public expenditure white Paper, it was a point on which the Opposition could have putdown an amendment - which the Government would probably have lost for lack of support from their own side.    There was an EarlyDay Motion on the Order Paper, signed by many Labour members,protesting against this increase in prices.    That Motion would be a continuing incitement to the Opposition to use a Supply Day to seek to embarrass the Government on the question.    The argument that itwould be weak to change direction now was wrong;  rather it would befolly, given the public feeling on the matter to proceed.    one possibility might be to reverse the decision in the context of thefollowing week&apos;s Budget, so that some credit could be taken for this in the subsequent round 3 pay negotiations.    Other alternatives wereto reduce the price increase to a level compatible with the Price Code;or to make it clear that some kind of winter fuel scheme would beintroduced the following winter in order to mitigate the hardship tothe poorest consumers.On the other hand it was argued that the Government had alreadyBuffered whatever political damage the announcement of a gas price increase had brought and that it would gain nothing by reversing thedecision now.    Furthermore, if the arguments for not making theincrease were accepted it would be necessary to settle where alterna-tive savings were to be found.    Ministers had already accepted claimstotalling some  200 million against the contingency reserve of 650 million for 1977-78, and the year had not even begun.    If theGovernment wished to spend a further  100 million on social purposes,it was questionable whether they would choose to devote it to gasconsumers.    There were in any case powerful arguments of energypolicy for the gas price increase, both in regard to conservation and
to choice of fuels.    To include a reversal of the decision in theBudget would convey an impression of both irresolution and anattempt to bribe the electors of Stechford, which would damage the favourable impact of the Budget as a whole.THE PRIME MINISTER,   summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet was that no change should be madein the proposed increase in gas prices at the present juncture.    If itwere the subject of a political attack the Secretary of State for Energywould be able to mount a powerful defence on grounds of energypolicy and energy conservation.    Once the Budget was over, theywould be engaged in crucial negotiations on a third pay round, and itwas possible that the question of gas prices would be raised in thatcontext.    At that stage the suggestion for a winter fuel scheme mightbe a helpful element towards a satisfactory outcome.    It was however premature to take any decision now as to the most cost-effective concession that might be offered.    Any such proposal would of course be brought before Cabinet or a Cabinet Committee as appropriate.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office24 March 197710
