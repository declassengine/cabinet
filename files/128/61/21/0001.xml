parliamentary affairs. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the wssk beginning 13 June.price commission bill previous reference:CM(77) 15thConclusions,Minute 3In a brief discussion of the Price Commission Bill the point wasmade that this Bill needed to reach Royal Assent by 22 July.The timetable for the Bill had been discussed between the Whipsin both Houses and, although it would not be possible to complete the House of Commons stages earlier than the week beginning20 June, it was thought that the date for Royal Assent could be met.iortion BillIt was pointed out in discussion that the Abortion Bill, which hadbeen introduced by Mr William Benyon to give effect to therecommendations of the House of Commons Select Committee onAbortion and had -received a. big majority on Second Reading, was still waiting to go into Standing Committee, and the damagingimpression was gaining ground that the Government was blockingthe progress of the Bill.    It was suggested that the Governmentwould be most unwise to seem to obstruct this Bill;  it dealt with amatter of conscience which was traditionally left to a free vote,and since it had a clear parliamentary majority the House should beallowed to complete consideration of it.    On other occasions theGovernment had given assistance to legislation on matters of thiskind in order to ensure that lack of time did not prevent the commons from completing consideration of a Private member bill which had received a majority on Second Reading.    If the Billfailed to reach Royal Assent this Session, it might be introducedagain in the next Session, and the Government could then run intoconsiderable difficulty if the Bill&apos;s progress was held up for asecond time.It was explained in reply that the Government were not blocking theAbortion Bill but dealing with it in e:.:actly the same way as all other private Members1 Bills.    Mr Stephen Ross&apos;s Bill on Homelessness,which was due to go into Standing Committee C ahead of the AbortionBill, was, however, being moved to another Standing Committee.This was being done in fulfilment of the Government&apos;s arrangements with the Liberals, but would enaole the Abortion Bill to get intoCommittee sooner than would otherwise have been the case,probably on 22 June.    Nevertheless the Bill&apos;s chances of reachingRoyal Assent this Session were small.    Assuming it was reportedout of Standing Committee by 15 July, the last day for considerationof Private Members&apos; Bills in the Commons, it might well fail toobtain Report and Third Reading, because Commons considerationof Lords amendments to earlier Private Members&apos; Bills would take
precedence, and the Abortion Bill would in any event be strongly opposed.    Even if it were sent to the House of Lords on 15 July it seemed unlikely that they would then pass it through all stageswithout amendment before the end of the Session.    It was argued that this Eill aroused strong opposition as well as strong support,and any move by the Government to change the normal rules by giving the Bill special treatment at this late stage would be deeplyresented by many in the Labour Party.    Lf every Private Member&apos;bill which received a Second Reading had then to be facilitated bythe Government, this would amount to treating all such Bills in thesame way as Government Bills, and would be a radical departure from the established arrangements for Private Members1 Bills.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment should take advantage of any goodwill created amongMr Benyon and the supporters of his Bill by the decision to move the Bill on Homelessness to another Standing Committee.    nothing should be done to obstruct any sittings motion moved in StandingCommittee in order to increase the prospects of the Abortion bill being reported by the Committee before 15 July.    It was important to get across to all supporters of the Bill that the Government hadalready taken administrative action to achieve many of the Bill&apos;sobjects, and the Secretary of State for Social Services would arrangefor the material on the background to the Bill and the action taken bythe Government which had been issued at the time of the Bill&apos;second Reading to be brought up to date and given a further widecirculation.    The future handling of the Bill raised difficult issues which would require further thought.    It might be helpful if theHouse of Commons could deliver a final verdict on the Bill this session;  if it did not reach Royal Assent the same problems might arise in the next Session.    For the present, however, the matter could be left until it became clear whether the Bill would emerge from Standing Committee.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the Prime minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for Social Services to proceed accordingly.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought the time had come for theCabinet to have a discussion on general strategy and on matters ofparticular current concern, before any discussion with the leader of the Liberal Party about next Session&apos;s programme, and a meetingat Chequers was accordingly being arranged for Sunday, 26 June.The Cabinet -2.    Took note.

POLICYGREEN PAPER:TAX RELIEF ONMORTGAGEINTERESTPreviousPreference:CM(77) 20thConclusions,Minute 73, The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(77) 58) proposing a restriction on tax relief on mortgage interest.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that after discussion he and the Secretary of State for the Environment had agreed the draft paragraphti, annexed to his memorandum, forinsertion in the Green Paper on housing policy.    Following theabolition of tax relief on most personal loans other than for housing, it had become more difficult to regard mortgageinterest relief as any different from other assistance for housing;and it seemed inequitable that those .vith the highest incomes should benefit from it the most, even though this was an inevitableconsequence of a progressive tax system.    The Government had of course imposed a ceiling of  25, 000 on eligible mortgage loans and had stopped relief on mortgage interest for second homes,but publication of the Green Paper would inevitably raise thequestion of going further than this.    A general withdrawal of higher rate relief would have adverse effects on demand andmobility.    It would also affect three-quarters of a million tax-payers, or up to 2 million voters, starting with those on a grossincome of about  7, 000 a year.    Indeed any further restriction of tax relief on mortgage interest would be resented by better offpeople who would be hit by a number of measures already decided upon,   for example the phasing out of child tax allowances,rating at capital instead of rental values, and higher national insurance contributions under the Better Pensions scheme;   andit would bear hardly on younger people whose mortgages had more than 6 years to run.   He felt however that the proposal ofthe Secretary of State for the Environment and himself, wherebymortgage interest relief would be withdrawn at tax rates over50 per cent represented a reasonable compromise between equityand political reality.    It would affect 165, 000 taxpayers withgross incomes over  10, 000 a year, ie Z\ times the average earnings.    It would be important to have a reasonable period of notice of 6 years and to hold out at the same time the prospect of lower tax rates.    The date from which the period of notice wouldtake effect should be left open as a matter for debate.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIRONMENT said thatit was a widely held view in the country, the Labour Party and thetrade unions that mortgage tax relief was equivalent to a subsidy.It was therefore very difficult to avoid this issue in the context ofa comprehensive review of housing policy or to rest on the presentposition whore the larger the income, the larger was the subsidy.It was necessary to devise a reasonable compromise, whichwould hold the line against far more radical proposals which hadbeen canvassed.    An essential part of the compromise proposed was a Government commitment to maintain mortgage interestrelief.    The transitional period of 6 years, which would apply to
its withdrawal at rates above 50 per cent, would benefit thosetaking out new mortgages within that period as well as existingmortgagors.In discussion it was argued that while there was a case in equityfor restricting mortgage interest relief at higher rates of tax,the proposal would be likely to prove a political incubus in presentcircumstances;  and the odium which it would attract would beiinmediate even though the restriction did not take effect for atleast 6 years.    Attention was also drawn to the particulardisadvantages that the proposal would hit younger people, manyin the managerial group but also couples of modest means in the teaching and other professions, whose financial commitmentswere heavier and that many home owners would be easily led tobelieve that it represented the first step towards a total abolitionof mortgage interest relief.    It was suggested that a better courseof action would be to lay emphasis on the ceiling of  2 5, 000 foreligible mortgage loans and to maintain this at its present level,despite rising prices, though there might be a case for raising it for first-time purchasers only.    It was pointed out, however,that one of the presentational drawbacks of this ceiling was thatit took no account of regional variations in house prices.    It wasalso suggested that the ceiling was strongly resented by many people, albeit a minority, and if a restriction were imposed on mortgage interest relief, there would be a strong case for removing the ceiling.    On the other hand, it was argued that,apart from a clear case in equity for imposing a restriction, thegeneral tenor of the proposals in the Green Paper, which involvedcontaining the subsidy for public sector housing, demanded a counter-balancing proposal in relation to assistance for the private sector.    The proposal represented a carefully judged position which the Government could hold.    Without it there would be aserious risk of the Labour Party Conference this autumn carrying a resolution with much more radical effect, and there could be considerable support for this in the Parliamentary Labour Party.Moreover, the argument in principle against allowing mortgageinterest relief at higher rates of tax had already been effectivelyconceded by the Government in abolishing relief on other loans and in withdrawing child tax allowance.    The proposal was initself a modest one, particularly against the background cf thegeneral emphasis which the Green Paper would give to the encouragement of owner occupation.    The case in equity for theproposal was so strong that it should not be supposed that it wouldbe unpopular with the electorate generally.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that,whatever the ca&quot;.e on grounds of equity, a substantial majcrityof the Cabinet was opposed to any proposal to restrict mortgageinterest relief at higher rates of tax at the present time whenthe political objections to it were considered to be overriding.The Cabinet recognised that the absence of a restriction of thiskind in the Green Paper on housing policy might increase the likelihood of more radical proposals being carried at the LabourParty&apos;s Annual Conference, but it was for the Government todecide whether or not any such proposal should be adopted in the manifesto.    The present position wsg defensible in relation tothe proposals in the Green Paper for assistance to the public housing sector since there had been a sharp increase in the subsidypaid in recent years.    The Secretary of State for the Environmentshould therefore arrange, in consultation as necessary with other ministers concerned, for the relevant draft paragraphs of theGieen Paper to be revised in such a way as to omit any referenceto a proposal to restrict mortgage interest relief at higher ratesof tax.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theSecretary of State for the Environment to be guided accordingly.Cabinet Office26 May 19776
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S government copy NOf*j A01CABINETPARLIAMENTARYAFFAIRSDirect elections to theEuropeanAssemblyPreviousReference:CM(77) 17thConclusions,Minute 4LIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 21st Conclusions, Minute 1Thursday 26 May 1977 at 10. 30 am the PRIME MINISTER said that the issue of legislation in preparation for direct elections to the European Ausembly had been discussedrecently on a number of occasions by the Cabinet.    But views had beensharply divided and no clear conclusion had emerged.    It was,however, essential for the Government to make a move soon sinceafter Whitsun it was possible that the Conservatives might table a vote of censure on the Government and in this eventuality it was possiblethat the Liberals would vote with the Opposition.    Moreover hewould be presiding over a meeting of the European Council in london on 29-30 June and if by then no action had been taken in fulfilment ofour &quot;best endeavours&quot; pledge the United Kingdom position at themeeting would be adversely affected.    Any move by the Governmentwould need to take account of the commitments which the Governmenthad accepted with its Community partners, with the Liberals and inThe Queen&apos;s Speech, but at the same time it was essential to avoiddisruption of the Labour Party.    To meet these various objectives and to allow the Government to survive some measure of flexibilitywould be essential.    Following discussion with a few of hiscolleagues directly concerned he had concluded that a plan which involved the introduction of a Bill after Whitsun might be feasible.On this basis the Government would make no overt move inParliament before the Whitsun Recess but would arrange a meeting ofthe Parliamentary Party on 15 June.    At that meeting theGovernment would say that a Bill would be introduced shortly after -wards providing for direct elections on the basis of regional lists, but with a first past the post system embodied as an alternative in a schedule to the Bill which could be substituted if the House of Commonsso decided.    The Bill would be given a Second Reading in early July.It would then move into Committee Stage on the Floor of the House,and if the majority voted against proportional representation,amendments could be made which would leave the provisions relatingto the first past the post system as valid.    But it was highly unlikelythat the passage of the Bill would be completed during this Session.
In the autumn the Bill could be reintroduced and it would be for later consideration how it would then be dealt with.    But it would in any event then be too late for us to be ready on a first past the postsystem for direct elections by the target date of May-June 1978;  andif the Conservatives were to maintain their opposition to proportional representation, they could be held responsible for the delay.    He had also concluded that, despite the difficulties it would create for his own position, the need to maintain the Government in being involved adecision that a free vote might be allowed for all Governmentsuppoiters including the members of the Cabinet;  thus members of theCabinet would be free, if they felt it essential, to abstain or even to vote against the Bill.    On the basis of this scenario it would bepossible to demonstrate both to the Liberals and to our Communitypartners that we had fulfilled our undertaking to use our best endeavours, but in doing so the unity of the Party would not have beendisrupted.In discussion there was a general recognition that the proposed solution to the Governments dilemma was ingenious.    On the other hand likeall compromises it carried disadvantages for both those who favouredand those who opposed direct elections.    On the one hand it was strongly argued that it would be seen by our Community partners as atransparent device to escape from our obligations.    A free vote for ministers and the introduction of a major and controversialconstitutional measure unaccompanied by a timetable Motion could hardly be regarded as a serious effort to fulfil our obligations:   andthis lukewarmness could do serious damage to our other Europeaninterests.    Furthermore a free vote would be a most dangerous precedent for other matters and could damage the Governmentsauthority.    On the other hand it was argued that the politicalcompromise was not v/orth the price which might have to be paid inconstitutional terms.     The agreement signed in Brussels inSeptember 1976 made it clear that the aim was to establish for laterdirect elections uniform procedures which would preclude any controlof these by the House of Commons;  and the provision that representatives would vote on a personal baeis would mean the absenceof Party control over the line which thene would take.    If a Bill were passed by the House of Commons later this year it would represent amomentous step towards European federalism and would thus revivethe European issue and disrupt the Labour Party.In further discussion it was pointed out that the Governments room for manoeuvre was very limited and that further delay was not a viableoption.    If a Bill were not introduced soon a censure Motion was likely and the Liberals would probably vote with the Opposition inwhich case the Government would fall.     The Tories would thenintroduce and carry their own Bill on the matter.    Whatever views were held about the desirability or otherwise of direct elections this2
was not an isuuj which should be allowed to break up the Government,While the proposals advanced in discussion had a number ofdisadvantages not least in terms of the likely disappointment of ourCommunity partners, they represented a compromise which wentsome considerable way to meet those who had doubts about earlyprogress to direct elections but which could be defended both inEurope and the United Kingdom as compatible with onr obligations.They azso had the result that if we were not in the event ready for direct elections by May-June 1978 the House of Commons would havebeen responsible for the decision and not the Government.THE PPJME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that asubstantial majority of the Cabinet agreed with varying degrees ofreluctance with the course which he had outlined.    If a plan on theselines were to have any chance of success it would be essential not toreveal it until the proposals were put to the Parliamentary Party afterWhitsun.    In the meantime, the Home Secretary should press forward with the preparation of a Bill ir. consultation with a small group otMinisters which he would arrange to be constituted.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up.2.    Invited the Home Secretary to proceed accordingly.Cabinet Office30 May 19773
THIS DOCUMENT IS THE PROPERTY OF HER BRITANNIC MAJESTY&apos;S GOVERNMENTCABINETCOPY NOFOREIGNAFFAIRSUgandaPreviousReference:CM(77) 20thConclusions,Minute 1LIMITED CIRCULATION annex cm(77) 21st Conclusions, Minute 2Thursday 26 May 1977 at 10. 30 am the FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that we stilldid not know President Amin&apos;s real intentions as regards hisattendance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.    Hehad made a number of conflicting statements and it was clearly part ofhis tactics to keep us guessing.    There was however a seriouspossibility of his attempting to come.    The small group of ministers which had been considering the matter under the Prime Minister&apos;chairmanship had therefore decided that he should not be allowed toenter the country:   and President Amin had been privately informed ofthis decision.    While people in this country would no doubt welcome the decision there was a risk that if it were made public too earlycertain Commonwealth leaders would feel it necessary to rally to president Amin&apos;s support.     Some might even decide not to attend theMseting themselves or there might be pressure on us to postpone theMeeting.    His conclusion therefore was that we should delayannouncing the decision for the time being.     This also gavePresident Amin an opportunity to say that he had himself decided not tocome.    The decision was of course related to President Aminpersonally and a delegation from Uganda would be allowed to attend theMeeting.    It had been necessary to consider whether to warn theremaining United Kingdom citizens in Uganda against the possibilityof reprisals.    There were however very few left in Uganda who wouldcontemplate leaving that country and the French, who represented our interests in Uganda, had advised that any new warning would immediately become public and would merely provide an excuse forPresident Amin to take reprisals.    In his view, therefore, it was better to give no warning.    In the debate in the House of Commons cn27 May he would say very little.    If by then President Amin had notreacted to the Prime Ministers message, he would avoid any explicitreference to the decision.     Most people in the House by now understood the situation and he hoped to be able to delay any public announcementof the decision until the middle of next week.    Contingency plans were
being prepared by the Home Secretary against the possibility thatdespite the decision which had been communicated to him,President Amin attempted to enter the country.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the decision to exclude President Amin from the CommonwealthHeads of Government Meeting.Cabinet Office27 May 19772
