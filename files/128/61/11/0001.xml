THE QUEEN&apos;S 1. The Cabinet were informed by the Prime Minister that,SILVER JUBILEE following their earlier decision to mark The queen s Silver Jubileeby a presentation to her, he had informally sought The. queen s previous view on a gift which might be acceptable for her personal use.Reference: This gift had now been purchased and the Prime Minister showed itCM(77) 5th to the Cabinet for their approval.Conclusions,Minute 11
THESHIPBUILDINGINDUSTRYHarlandand WolffPr previous reference:CM(77) 10thConclusions,Minute 42. The Cabinet considered a minute dated 16 March from theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland to the Prime Ministerreporting on developments since the Cabinet discussion on15 March on the proposed Shell order for two Liquid GasPetroleum Carriers (LGPs).THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR NORTHERN IRELAND said thatfollowing Cabinet discussion on Tuesday officials had met yesterdaywith the financial advisers concerned (Hambros Bank).    The financialadvisers said that they thought the financial package proposed was inconformity with the guidelines for leasing arrangements involving the nationalised industries and that several other similar schemesinvolving the nationalised industries had been approved in the lasttwo years.    In his view it was virtually certain that Shell would not wish to consider direct purchase and this option should be regardedas closed.    In the time available the only possible modification ofthe package that could be suggested was an increase in the equityholding by the clearing banks from  20, 000 up to a level morenearly approaching that of the Government&apos;s injection of  12 million.They would then be putting up genuine risk capital for the expectedreturn.    It would take some weeks to establish whether the bankswould be prepared to do eo^   After an approach at the highest levelShell had extended the deadline for a decision until 2. 00 pm on18 March.    Accordingly if a positive answer were to be given to Shellit would have to be on the basis of the package already proposed but with the understanding that every effort would be made to modify itso as to increase the banks&apos; equity holding.    Otherwise the order would be lost.    A further possible order for Harland and Wolff for two LGPs was being considered by an American company but solely on a leasing basis.    If leasing arrangements of the type proposed were rejected there would be no chance of obtaining this or futureorders which were increasingly likely to require a leasing basis.In discussion it was argued that the information in the minute by theSecretary of State for Northern Ireland went virtually no further thanthat available to Cabinet earlier and did not provide a basis for making a positive decision.    The modification proposed under whichthe equity holding by the banks would be increased would notnecessarily reduce the profitability of the deal to the banks as theycould increase the interest rates they charged.    It was questioned whether the leasing arrangements entered into by the nationalised industries in recent years were strictly comparable to the Harlandand Wolff proposal.    The only comparable case had been the BritishRail package in 1972.    That scheme had been severely criticised bythe Public Accounts Committee and the Departments concerned had said that similar arrangements would not be repeated.    Althoughthe Treasury was not against leasing arrangements as such, the package proposed, involving massive tax avoidance, fell well outside
agreed guidelines to the nationalised industries on such arrangements.In view of the size of the tax leakage and the extremely high level of subsidy the package still seemed quite unacceptable.    On the otherhand it was argued that the financial advisers concerned had beenasked to draw up a scheme which did not violate the tax allowancearrangements and fell within the guidelines for nationalised industry leasing arrangements.    Treasury officials had said thatthe scheme proposed did violate them but had not explained why.The imposition by Shell of a further deadline of 12 noon on Friday18 March was regretted but Shell had the chance to take up an attractive leasing arrangement with a French company and needed to take a decision by then.    Shipbuilders generally were now findingthat leasing packages were necessary to do business and the UnitedKingdom shipbuilding industry would be at serious disadvantage ifit could not enter into them.    If this order were not obtained forShell there would be very high social and economic costs for theindustry and for Northern Ireland and full weight needed to be givento those factors and to the Northern Ireland political considerations.Whilst it was not possible to give firm indications of the potentialsize of the market for ships of this kind, there was no doubt that theUnited Kingdom would be a sizeable exporter of North Sea gas andif the Shell order were lost so would be any prospect of the gasbeing exported in British built ships.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet found it. most unsatisfactory to be asked at short notice to make a decision with so little information and where the factswere in dispute.    Indeed a decision could not be taken withoutknowing definitely whether or not this scheme was on all fours withleasing arrangements made by the nationalised industries.    nor should Shell expect to be able to browbeat the Government into adecision by imposing such a short deadline.    It was essential for ministers to go into the matter, including the tax avoidanceaspect, more fully than had been possible so far.    For this purpose the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster should convene a group ofMinisters consisting of the Secretaries of State for Industry,Northern Ireland, Scotland and Trade, the Chief Secretary, treasury and the Attorney General.    The Ministerial Group should urgentlyexamine the issues and, subject to reference back to him by theChancellor of the Duchy, it should have authority to settle thematter.    It was desirable to obtain the order if it could be done at reasonable cost.    The interim shipbuilding strategy approved by cabinet laid down that a subsidy from the intervention fund should not normally exceed 30 per cent of the price of a ship but there might beoverriding political considerations for some variation in this case.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;s summing up of their discussion and invited the Ministers concerned to be guided accordingly.3
PARLIAMENT AR YAFFAIRS3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the following week.Scotland andWales bill previous reference:CM(77) 7thConclusions,Minute 1THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL reported that discussions had been taking place with the Parties, and with allgroups of Members who wished to have discussions with theGovernment.    The aim of these talks was to test out thepossibilities for making progress on devolution, and it had been emphasised in each case that the position of the Cabinet was fullyreserved.    The response of the Conservatives to the initialdiscussions would not be known until the following week.The Cabinet1.Took note.GovernmentBusinessDuring theRest of the1976-77 SessionPreviousReference:CM(77) 9thConclusions,Mi&quot;   te 1The Cabinet considered a minute from the Lord President of theCouncil to the Prime Minister dated 14 March, reporting theconclusions reached by the Legislation (LE) Committee on government business during the rest of the current Session.In discussion the importance was stressed of fitting in a debate onairports policy.    All other interested parties had been consulted,and the House of Lords had debated this subject;  it would createconsiderable difficulties if the Governments policy conclusions were to be announced in the autumn without the House of Commonshaving been given an opportunity to debate the matter.    The factthat a subject was contentious should not be regarded as ruling out a debate, especially where the main object was to listen to theviews of the House.    The Government would be able to adopt thesame posture in a debate on the Layfield Report on localgovernment finance, but there was a risk that this might be used as an occasion to mount an attack on the Government and the levelof the rates.    It was pointed out that considerations of timing wereimportant in arranging debates, and a subject such as airportswould be better avoided in the period immediately preceding thelocal government elections in May.    A half-day debate on new towns would be useful, after these elections but before theGovernment announced any conclusions on new towns policy.
THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR INDUSTRY reported thatconsultations with the minority Parties on the Post Office(Amendment) Bill, following the Cabinet*s discussion cn 3 March,had shown that broad support could be expected from the ScottishNational Party and Plaid Cymru, which should suffice to ensure amajority for the Bill, but not from the Liberals or from NorthernIreland Members.    The Post Office unions had been adamant thatworker-directors in the Post Office should be chosen within theirorganisations - the Union of Post Office Workers would dominateany elections involving the workforce as a whole - and furtherconsideration of this problem would be necessary.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet broadly endorsed the conclusions reached by the LECommittee, and the Lord President and the Chief Whip should proceed accordingly in the management of the Session&apos;s remainingbusiness.    The Committee1 s main conclusions were that suspension of proceedings on the Scotland and Wales Bill had removed aconsiderable burden but did not create spare Parliamentary time.Assuming normal recesses, there would be only a small margin for contingencies.    He wished to underline the need for Ministers andbackbenchers, at this stage in the life of the present Parliament, toget out into the country and their constituencies and put theGovernment&apos;s case.    The Government could not afford to lose Billsregularly, but there might be some Bills which it would be advantageous to bring forward even if it might not be possible tocarry them.    Each Bill should be considered on its merits, and the ministerial Committee on Economic Strategy would be consideringon 21 March whether the Post Office (Amendment) Bill and the occupational Pensions Schemes Bill should be introduced this session.    The LE Committee should have a continuing role in considering subjects for general debate, and Ministers with proposals for debates should put them to the Lord President.The Cabinet -2. Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion,and invited the Lord President of the Councilto be guided accordingly.
4. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat during the early weeks of the new United States Administrationthere had been criticism in some European capitals of president Carter&apos;s lack of consultation with his allies on subjects on which he had made outspoken statements:  and there had beenuncertainties about both the Presidents personality and his policies.As a result of the visit which the Prime Minister and he had paidto Washington in the previous week he felt that President Carter wasa tough and able man, genuinely concerned about racial prejudiceand about human rights, and also intent on making progress onarms control and nuclear non-proliferation.    President Carter was anxious that the human rights issue should be seen within a widercontext than that of East-West relations.    His position on the latter had been fully thought out and he had been in closer contact with theSoviet leadership about it than had appeared.    On economic matters,the American response to our views on the need to stimulateexpansion was satisfactory.    The Americans were ready toencourage Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany to stimulatedemand, although Germany was taking an unresponsive line.    Asregards the Conference of International Economic Co-operation, our views on the Common Fund were close, but the Americans were more reserved about the problem of indebtedness.    their difficulties with Congress mean that they were unlikely to be ableto agree to any large International Development Associationreplenishment.    The President was committed to making a successof the Downing Street Summit of industrialised countries, the preparations for which had begun at a meeting between senior officials from the seven countries involved.    He himself had talkedseparately to Mr Vance, the Secretary of State, who had expressed a wish to work closely with us on a wide range of subjects, includingespecially the problems of Southern Africa.    There was no doubt about the warmth of the reception they had received in Washington,and of the Prime Minister1 s personal success in establishingrelations with President Carter.    The President and other leading members of the Administration they had seen, including mr. Blumenthal, Dr Brown and Dr Schlesinger, had all made it clearthat they would welcome the establishment of a close workingrelationship with us.    We would now have to build on the success ofthis visit.    It was clear that we were dealing with a very able team:we might find some rough edges and they could turn out to be toughcustomers if they felt they were being crossed.    The fact was thatthey wished to work with us and we should take maximum advantageof this.THE PRIME MINISTER said that he had raised the question of concorde with President Carter.    The President stood by what hehad said earlier about the case for Concorde being given a trial in new York.    This was however a highly political issue and it was6
very doubtful if President Carter would be prepared to apply any real pressure on New York.    Mr Meaney, the President of theAmerican Federation of Labour and Congress of industrial organisations, had, in the Prime Minister1 s presence, toldPresident Carter that he ought to have been more forthright.There had been some movement, but he was not optimistic aboutthe prospects for a favourable result.    However, an even moreimportant matter in thi s field was the renegotiation of the air services Agreement about which he had also talked to President CarterOn human rights it was clear that the Presidents public statements were not made out of the blue and that he had had direct contact withMr Brezhnev about them.    In general he had been impressed withthe mastery which the President had achieved of the wide range of subjects they had discussed.    He was a man of great ability, evenif occasionally he might after only a short period in office lack thefeel for handling an unfamiliar subject.    President Carter wasevidently prepared to make some mistakes, but he was determined to test the Russians fully on such matters as a comprehensive testban, knowing that they did not yet trust him.    The President had expressed his firm support for the strengthening of the european community.    He had also appeared anxious to treat the UnitedKingdom as an equal partner.    This was flattering and welcome,but he had found it necessary to warn the President not to expectmore of us than we were able to deliver.    President Carter had however said that he wanted to give the present British Governmentall the help that lay within his power.The Cabinet -1. Took note of the statements by the PrimeMinister and the Foreign and commonwealth secretary.UgandaPreviousRefer ence:CM(77) 9thConclusions,Minute in a short discussion it was suggested that since President Aminhad recently visited Cairo for several days, it might be necessaryto revise the earlier assessment that he would be unlikely in theevent to come to the United Kingdom for the Commonwealth Headsof Government Meeting (CHGM) in June.    He had considerablebacking in Uganda from Libyans and this might give him moreconfidence in leaving the country.    Soundings were being taken of commonwealth Governments about their views on President Amin&apos;sattendance at the CHGM.    Some Heads of Government felt sostrongly about the matter that they would not attend themselves ifPresident Amin were present:  and the majority would probablyaccept the position if we decided not to admit him even if they did not say so openly.    In this connection it was argued that, since popular
opinion here would be strongly in favour of excluding President Arnin,we should avoid a last minute decision lest this appear to have beentaken only in response to public pressure.    On the other hand itwas pointed out that if an early announcement was made it could put the whole meeting at risk.    We had also to consider the positionof the British community in Uganda.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that it waspremature to discuss tactics over the exclusion of President Amin.Most of the Commonwealth countries would probably go along with thedecision not to admit him, even though they would not say so publicly.But the time to consider our position would be when Lord Thomsonreturned from his tour of leading Commonwealth countries at the endof April.    He doubted whether there would be any serious risk tothe British community if we decided to tell President Amin that hecould not come, but we should need to make contingency plansagainst this possibility.The Cabinet -2. Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that he recognised there had been some questioning of his decision not to visit Rhodesia during his forthcoming tour of African countries.The question whether or not to visit Rhodesia was a difficult one.He did not exclude going there, at least on some later visit, but mr Ian Smith had already agreed to meet him in Cape Town.    in considering the matter, we had to be careful not to offend the BlackAfricans, who were only too ready to suspect our motives, or toprovide a boost for Mr Smith&apos;s position.    But his mind was notclosed and he was quite prepared to go to Rhodesia at some point ifthis would be helpful.The Cabinet -3. Took note.8
5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the central policy Review Staff (CP(77) 24) about public expenditure priorities.THE PRIME MINISTER said that the memorandum provided anopportunity for Cabinet to have a general discussion about priorities in public expenditure, without the need at the present stage to reach any firm conclusions.    He reminded Cabinet that the next public expenditure survey would cover the period up to 1981-82, so thatthey were effectively considering the first tv/o or three years of thenext Government, and thus a period to be covered by the next LabourElection Manifesto.    The Cabinet should therefore be considering what were the priorities they would wish to see emphasised during that period.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the Cabinet had tried on a number of previous occasions to bring about a shift in public expenditure priorities, but had usually found this extremelydifficult.    On occasion they had agreed that some particularprogrammes should have very high priority, and had preservedthem from subsequent reductions;  but in general the decisions at theend of the day had been reached by hard bargaining between interestedMinisters each arguing for their own programmes.    Thememorandum before them set out the problem, and paragraph 14suggested the questions to which they should address their minds.However, the time for taking decisions would be in the middle of theyear when the Public Expenditure Survey Report was available.In the course of discussion the following points were madea. Within whatever totality of public expenditure wasagreed, the broad strategic choices were between current expenditure, capital expenditure and transfer payments.b. When the hard argument on programmes was reached,such topics as inner cities and unemployment among the young,which cut across departmental and programme boundaries,tended to get lost.    It was for consideration whether money should not be set aside for programmes of this kind at the start of the public expenditure exercise.c. The standard of housing in the United Kingdom was higher than that of many countries in Europe.    The wholequestion of priorities in housing expenditure was dealt within the Housing Finance Review, which would be coming to cabinet for consideration in due course.    Reviews of thiskind did not however put the Cabinet in a position to considerpriorities between programmes.9PUBLICEXPENDITUREPRIORITIES INTHE NEXTSURVEYPreviousReference:CM(77) 7thConclusions,Minute 3
d. The use of North Sea oil resources was another tcpicof importance.    Such resources should be used to developalternative sources of energy and to improve tha country&apos;industrial capacity, although it was not always clear whatwas the best way for Government to influence industrial investment.    Tax reliefs for investment projects had perhapsbeen too high, although it would be difficult to change at thepresent juncture without appearing to be acting contrary tothe aims of the industrial strategy.    It might be that labour-intensive, rather than capital-intensive, projects should be supported.    However capital intensive industry was needed to produce the goods which we could sell in export markets.The wealth thus created should be channelled into solidprogrammes which provided jobs to replace those not requiredin capital intensive industry.    It was noted that a given sumspent on the building of a hospital produced more employmentthan a comparable sum spent through investment grants.e. Reductions in public expenditure might cut the totalbut they did not eliminate waste.    There was a case forsaying that every Minister should be required to justify histotal spending to a group of other Ministers in order that apolitically critical approach might be brought to bear upon his ongoing expenditures.f. The Government needed a strategy for a return to full employment.    For this it would be necessary to increaseresources in the public sector and to expand public industrial investment since only thus could a credible economic strategyleading back to full employment be deployed.    unemployment was not a major issue in the public mind at present - although this view was questioned - but it could easily, through the actions of either the Press or the Opposition, speedilybecome a public issue of the first magnitude.    In the longer term a view was needed of the level of employment through tothe end of the century, so that policies for shorter working hours, increased leisure, etc. could be considered.g. The publication of planned expenditure figures for five years ahead brought nothing but trouble to theGovernment, since the published figures had so oftensubsequently to be reduced, thus exposing the Governmentto criticism.    Priorities should be discussed, but notnecessarily in public expenditure terms.    There was a case for bringing the annual five year exercise to an end.10
h. With a limited growth of available resources, variousviews were expressed on which programmes should be given priority.    It was suggested that the belief that putting public money into industrial investment led to increased economic growth was the triumph of optimism over experience andthat social expenditure should take priority over government expenditure on industry.    Conversely it was argued that industrial expenditure should have first priority.    Amongsocial programmes those which were redistributive in their nature, such as inner cities, should have most emphasis.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that thepaper by the Central Policy Review Staff had been put to Cabinet inorder to meet the complaint regularly made by Ministers that in thePublic Expenditure Survey procedures the machine took control inadvance of a political input.    The present point, where prioritieswere still open, was the stage at which it was possible to inject semepolitical dimension.    On inner cities, he doubted whether thetimescale of 3-5 years, which they had been discussing, was theright one, since action there needed to be taken more urgently.The Cabinet had recognised that both investment and unemploymentwere important priorities;  but they had made no clear choice betweensocial programmes.    Any Ministers who had further thoughts on thematter should communicate them direct to the Chief Secretary,Treasury.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.11
PUBLICEXPENDITURESURVEY 19776. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the chief secretary, Treasury (CP(77) 25) to which was attached a draft ofthe guidelines to be used in the 1977 Public Expenditure Survey.GuidelinesPreviousRefer ence:CM(77) 7thConclusions,Minute 3THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY said that there was noquestion at the present stage of asking Cabinet for any decisions on public expenditure.    The time for decisions would be when cabinet had the options displayed before them, and the purpose of the draftguidelines was merely to ensure that the Survey was set up in sucha way as to set out the options which Ministers would need toconsider.    What was essential was to provide some benchmarkswhich could then be varied when decisions were taken.    The cabinet had already agreed the expenditure for 1977-78 and 1978-79;  andthey had also agreed that in 1980-81 and 1981-82 the overall increase on the preceding year&apos;s level should be of the order of 2 per cent.1979-80 had been left as an awkward transitional year.    At present -because the cuts agreed in December had not been carried beyond1978-79 - the figures for 1979-80 showed a 6 per cent increase on those for 1978-79.    However, of this, 2 per cent was attributable to an increase in borrowing from the National Loano Fund by the nationalised industries for refinancing purposes, and could be discounted for the present exercise.    This left the increase at per cent.    In his view, international confidence in the pound was still sufficiently fragile to be badly shaken if the Government, intheir next public expenditure White Paper, were seen to be planningan increase in spending of 4 per cent in 1979-80,    He thought itwould be wiser to set up the figures so as to produce an increase of2 per cent, which would thus provide a smooth transition between1978-79 and 1980-81.    He emphasised that Cabinet would still be free to decide upon a higher figure in July if they then thought that appropriate.    On this basis, he recommended that Cabinet approve the guidelines attached to CP(77) 25.In discussion the following points were made -a. Given the uncertainty about what the rate ofeconomic growth would be over the period under review,there would be advantage if Ministers could consider public expenditure programmes based on increases of 2 per cent,2% per cent and 3 per cent a year from 1979-80 onwards.b. The requirement in the guidelines to provideillustrative cuts of Z\ per cent in 1978-79 and 5 per cent in later years might cause difficulty.    It would require discussionwith local authority representatives, who would be greatlyalarmed, and from whom the exercise might become public,which would be damaging to the Government.    In the defence12
field, cuts of this order could only be identified by a mini-Defence Review, which could cause both national and international turmoil, and would be very likely to be noticedin the Press.c. The proposal to reduce the 4 per cent increase in 1979-80to 2 per cent should not be treated lightly, since it impliedreducing the total of axisting programmes by  1. 5 billion.d. If the Cabinet was to get a broad view of the problemof allocating resources, it was essential that crucialdefinitions, such as that of the public sector borrowing requirement, should be meaningful.    The borrowing requirement still contained certain conventional elementswhich had no real meaning for resource allocation.e. Some capital programmes - such as those for prisonsand for law courts - had been very severely cut indeed in last year&apos;s reductions.    It would be essential in the nextSurvey to consider the effect of these reductions on individual departments.    There would also be advantage if considerationwere given across the board to the need to place someemphasis on construction, given the present state of theconstruction industries.    The illustrative figures for health and personal social services quoted in the Chief Secretary1 s paper did not allow for demographic growth.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet accepted the point about nationalised industry refinancingwhich the Chief Secretary had explained.    It was clearly understoodthat no commitments relating to any individual programme werebeing taken that day, and that when the Public Expenditure SurveyReport came to Cabinet in the summer they would be free to makewhatever adjustment within the overall quantum already settled whichthey were able to agree.    The possibility of deciding then on a growth in public expenditure from 1979-80 onwards of more than 2 per cent a year was not ruled out.    It had to be recognised that it was alwayspossible that some change in external circumstances - eg relatingto the Soviet threat - might upset the calculations upon which presentthinking was based.    Subject to this, the Cabinet acquiesced in theguidelines attached to CP(77) 25 and agreed that they should beadopted as the basis for the conduct for the 1977 Public expenditure survey.The Cabinet -Took note with approval of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up and invited the Chief Secretary,Treasury, to be guided accordingly.13
7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Home Department (CP(77) 31) covering a revised draft of the White Paper on direct elections;  and notes by officials on a list system (CP(77) 29) and on a compulsory dualmandate (CP(77) 27).THE HOME SECRETARY opening the discussion, said that the revised draft of the White Paper reflected the Cabinet&apos;discussion on 25 February.    Greater emphasis had been placedon the constitutional issues and a variety of electoral arrangementswas discussed including the single transferable vote.    Somerevision of the proposed Annexes (especially CP(77) 27 which hadnot been written for publication) would be required to bring them into line with the main text.In discussion a number of suggestions for amendment were agreed.In particular it was agreed that the description of the powers ofthe Assembly might be somewhat amplified.    It was further agreedthat the draft White Paper struck in general a fair balance between our traditional electoral system and the alternative systemssubject to some minor drafting amendments.    The characteristics of the system used in this country for national elections should notnecessarily determine the choice of electoral systems for directelections.    And the implications of alternative systems for party organisations should not be exaggerated.    The importance under any system of a democratic procedure for the selection of candidates should however be recognised.In discussion of the compulsory dual mandate it was agreed that reference should be made to the long standing application of the compulsory dual mandate in the nomination of Assembly members,and that changes in the organisation of Parliament should not be ruled out if it were applied to direct elections.    However a compulsory dual mandate would not necessarily contribute to the supremacy of Parliament.    It should also be recognised that itwould exclude peers, whose views on the legislation would be important and whose role in filling seats in the Assembly had proved valuable.    There were in any event doubts as to thecompatibility of a compulsory dual mandate with our Communityobligations.    The implications for the disqualification of candidatesshould however be brought out.In further discussion there was general agreement that theGovernment should not express any preference as between electoralsystems, but that a preference should be expressed as in the draft white Paper between alternative Boundary Commission procedures.It was further agreed that the extent to which the Government1 sresponse to the Select Committee in relation to procedural matters14
was unaffected by the choice of electoral arrangements should bemade clear.    A reference should be made to the Governmentsestimate of the cost of financing direct elections from the consolidated Fund, but no reference should be made to the prospectof Community or other assistance to political parties.    TheGovernments response to the Select Committee should be extendedto cover the compulsory dual mandate, even though this was not infact an electoral system comparable with the others discussed inthe White Paper.In discussion of the timing of direct elections it was recognisedthat simultaneous Parliamentary and Assembly elections, thoughcompatible with any electoral system, would be incompatible withour Community obligations.    It would therefore be desirable forthe compulsory dual mandate to be presented, in conformity withthe different electoral systems, as a device which would be compatible with direct elections in May/June 1978.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet agreed to the publication of the White Paper at about thebeginning of April with a view to a Parliamentary debate soon afterthe Easter Recess.    The Home Secretary should revise the text ofthe White Paper and Annexes in the light of the discussion and circulate the revised version to the Cabinet before publication.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office17 March 197715
