1. THE PRIME MINISTER said that he thought that theCabinet would wish to mark The queen s Silver Jubilee bypresenting a token to her, as had been done in 1935 on theoccasion of King George Vs Silver Jubilee.    Preliminaryenquiries had indicated that this would be acceptable to The queen and he now sought his colleagues agreement to the proposal.The Cabinet -Agreed that this presentation should be made and took note that the Prime Minister would give further consideration to the form which it shouldtake.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons during the following week.The following points were made in discussion:-a. Although it was hoped that difficulties would not arise on the Report Stage of the Social Security (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, there was likely to be a considerabledebate on the amendment to Clause 13 relating to supplementary benefit for students.b. Discussion of the new provisions on referendums in the Scotland and Wales Bill was likely to continue on bothTuesday 15 and Wednesday 16 February.c. The Housing (Homeless Persons) Bill, introduced byMr Stephen Ross, was the Government Bill on this subject,for which it had not been possible to find a firm place inthe legislative programme, and it should be given all necessary support to ensure a Second Reading on18 February.d. The Chief Whip was putting forward measures designedto avoid recurrence of the situation which had resulted inthe Reduction of Redundancy Rebates Bill not obtaining aSecond Reading on 7 February, and the Secretary of Statefor Employment had under preparation proposals for adifferent Bill which would achieve the same result.The Cabinet -Took note.1
F   1EIGN AFFAIRS    3. THE PRIME MINISTER said that the latest indications hehad received were that the Summit would be held in London andthat the most suitable time would be early May.    He would beEconomic Summit       considering the most favourable date from our point of view andit would be his responsibility, as the representative of the hostGovernment, to call the meeting.    He would report further to theCabinet on the proposed arrangements.The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of thePrime Minister1 s statement.Meeting of the THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reporteduncil of on the outcome of the meeting of the Council of Ministers (foreign ministers Affairs) in Brussels on 8 February.    Three points in particular(Foreign Affairs)        were worthy of comment.    On pigmeat we had suffered an February irritating setback in that the Danes had secured support from allother Member States apart from ourselves for a view that our recent action in subsidising pigmeat producers was incompatible with the Rome Treaty.    The Commission would therefore be considering this question further and it was possible that we mightbe taken to the European Court.    On Portugal there had been alengthy discussion on the line to be taken by Member States in thediscussions which the Portuguese Prime Minister, Dr Soares,would shortly be having in Community capitals on Portugal1 e desireto accede to the European Community.    A substantial difference of emphasis existed between ourselves, the Germans and the Daneson thetosie hand and the $tench, who were much more reserved intheir attitude to Portuguese accession, on the other.    Agreement,however, had been reached on a general line which while recognising the goal of ultimate membership would effectively provide for anyPortuguese application for accession to be the subject of a good dealof discussion and negotiation before the Commission proceededunder Article 237 of the Treaty of Rome to give an opinion.    Thiswas satisfactory in that all Member States would now give a broadlyidentical answer to the Portuguese Prime Minister, althoughdifferences in emphasis would doubtless emerge later.    discussion on fishery questions had kept the Council up till 4. 00 am on9 February.    The action being taken on the external regime hadoccasioned little argument and discussion had concentrated onconservation.    A wide measure of agreement had emerged oncommon action in this field, but the Danes had maintained atemporary reserve on the grounds that they could not agree tounilateral action by the United Kingdom.    We had maintainedagainst strong opposition our right embodied in an agreement reached at a meeting of Foreign Ministers in The Hague in october last year to introduce, if necessary and after consultation with theCommission, unilateral conservation measures.    The outcome2
therefore from the United Kingdom standpoint could be regardedas reasonably satisfactory.    More generally, the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary had put to the Council that an excessiveamount of time at their meetings was being devoted to highlytechnical fishery questions without adequate discussion beforehandof the policy implications.    He had therefore suggested that more of the detailed discussion should be undertaken in future by theCouncil of Ministers (Agriculture).    Agreement had also beenreached to set up a high level group of officials to deal withfisheries questions and to prepare the ground for their discussion in the Council of Ministers.In discussion it was suggested that the setback we had received on pigmeat was not irretrievable.    It should be possible to put this item on the agenda of the Council of Ministers (Agriculture)on 14-15 February and for us again to make our case.    One majordifficulty was that the Danes were clearly taking a tough line onthis in view of the imminence of their elections early next week.It was maintained that, if the issue were referred by the Commissionto the European Court, we should have a good case in that we couldargue that our subsidy was designed to reduce the distortion oftrade which was the subject of the Danish complaint.    FurthermoreMr Gundelach, the Agricultural Commissioner, was reported asbeing willing to consider some compromise.    Further develop-ments in this matter, including the length of time the Court would need to consider the case if referred to it by the Commissioncompared with the duration which we had in mind ourselves forthis scheme, would need to be considered by the ministerial committee on European Questions.In further discussion it was argued, in particular in relation to thediscussion on Portuguese accession, that we were not adequatelyexploiting the negative line which the French were taking on a wholenumber of issues.    On Portuguese accession they were the mostreserved of all Member States.    They had also inflexibly opposedour suggestions, put forward in the interests of developing a community policy, for informal meetings of Ministers of energy and Transport.    It was however the United Kingdom and not theFrench which was popularly supposed to be the most obstructivemember of the Community.    It was argued that the Frenchexploited skilfully the use of European rhetoric, were skilful in finding legalistic cover for their actions and had the advantage ofa Press which, unlike ours, tended to support Government action.It was also necessary to bear in mind that, as seen by manyEuropeans, we had the hesitations and doubts of renegotiation to live down.    On the other hand it was argued that the picture of anisolated United Kingdom in the Community was exaggerated.    Ourreputation in the Community was good and had been enhanced by the positive nature of the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary1 skeynote address to the European Assembly in Luxembourg inJanuary.    It would be ill advised for us to spend too much time
worrying about the French.    We should define our interestcarefully, defend it tenaciously and bear in mind that the french were doing the same.The Cabinet -Took note.DHSSEXPENDITURESAVINGSPreviousReference:,1(77) 2ndConclusions,Minute 64. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary ofState for Social Services (CP(77) 11) and the Chief Secretary,Treasury (Annex to CP(77) 12) about the social security and healthpublic expenditure programmes, and a Note by the Secretary ofState for the Home Department (CP(77) 16), to which was annexeda note by officials, about various suggestions for savings in thesocial security field, some of which had been discussed by theHome and Social Affairs (HS) Committee.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that the table of losses and potential losses of savings set out inparagraph 3 of the Chief Secretary&apos;s memorandum required somequalification.    The losses consequent on the abandonment of theRoad Traffic Casualties Bill were attributable to a decision of theCabinet as a whole;  he himself had always been ready to proceedwith the Bill.    The estimated full-year losses of  40 million for1978-79 and subsequent years in any case fell outside hisdepartmental responsibility since it had been decided that theNational Health Service (NHS) should not benefit from the revenuewhich the Bill was aimed to secure.    The potential losses were most unlikely to be realised.    He and the Minister for social security were confident that they would be able to carry thenecessary regulations on student access to unemployment benefit and the amendment to the Social Security (miscellaneous provisions) Bill dealing with the discretionary withholding ofsupplementary benefit from students in the short vacations.    Hehad offered savings, which went some way to offset the losses,of  3-31 million in 1977-78 and  6 million in 1978-79.    In the health field he had already gone to the limit of finding savings ondrug costs and although he recognised that there might be scope,beyond the 5-j per cent reduction in management costs which he had agreed with the Chairmen of the Regional Health Authorities, forfurther savings in NHS administration costs, these were of a longer-term nature and could not be determined in advance of thereport of the Royal Commission on the NHS.    Therefore, apart fromthe further savings of  1-1-1 million which he had been able to offerin respect of centrally financed services, the choice lay betweenincreasing prescription charges and cutting down Health authority expenditure.    The latter would involve further ward closures and staff redundancies which could adversely affect the welfare, and
even endanger the lives, of patients, and for these reasons was unacceptable.    Although he fully recognised the political difficulties of an increase in prescription charges, he had no doubtthat the public would see this as the more reasonable of the twooptions.    In the social security field, there were severeParliamentary constraints against securing any further savings.For the reasons set out in CP(77) 16 HS Committee had found theTreasury suggestions for further savings politically unacceptable.They would hit lower-paid workers and other disadvantaged groups.Of the further possibilities for savings, set out in the note by officials annexed to CP(77) 16, a reduction in the supplementary benefit scale rates would be quite unacceptable.    It would meantaking from the poorest section of the community what might otherwise have been secured from occupational pensioners whowere relatively well off.    The proposal for abating the benefit to national insurance beneficiaries in hospital was less objectionableon that score but there would be great difficulty in getting thenecessary regulations through the House and there might be an adverse report from the independent National Insurance AdvisoryCommittee.THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that it was necessaryeither to find additional savings or to acoept an equivalent reductionin the Contingency Reserve which would affect the expenditure claims of other departmental Ministers.    It was for the Secretary of Statefor Social Services, and not for himself, to identify ways in whichsavings might be made.    But it was difficult to believe that out of atotal budget of  18 billion more of the required savings could not befound, particularly since there had been substantial underspends in1974-75 and 1975-76.    Although an   increase in prescription charges would present political problems it would not be inequitable since60 per cent of all prescriptions, including those for the poor andchronically sick, were exempted.    It seemed a gross exaggerationto say that a \ per cent reduction in NHS costs, where the totalbudget wa8 over  5 billion, would put patients at serious risk.    Onthe social security side, a lOp reduction in the scale rates ofsupplementary benefit, though he recognised the political difficulties,would be distributed across nearly 3 million beneficiaries.    Apossible measure which would not hit the poor would be to shorten the period of full payment of national insurance benefits to hospitalin-patients from 8 weeks to 4 and to alter the percentage reductions of benefit.    This would save  7.75 million which, together with theother savings already offered, would cover the shortfall in social security savings.In discussion, it was argued that DHSS expenditure in 1977-78 and subsequent years was already under severe constraint throughplanned reductions and the imposition of cash limits and that it wouldbe wrong to rely on any underspend in place of savings.Prescription charges had remained the same since April 1971 and5
there was no case on the merits for resisting an increase now,but the political objections to such action at the present time were overriding.    There were limits as to how far the Governmentcould go in trying to secure any further savings in the face ofParliamentary and political opposition.    The International monetary fund must recognise these limits but they were in any case onlyconcerned with the aggregate of expenditure.    Although there wasa large sum of potential claims on the Contingency Reserve for1977-78, which at present stood at  650 million, the firm claims were small.    Nevertheless, if alternative savings were not foundto offset those which had been foregone, unpalatable decisions mighthave to be taken later on in order to maintain the agreed limit ofthe Contingency Reserve.    So far as 1978-79 was concerned, thepossibility of increasing the NHS element of national insurance contributions should not be ruled out.    On the other hand, there wasno relationship between these contributions and savings in public expenditure;  it was known that the national insurance fund was insubstantial surplus and the Trade Union Congress were alreadyusing this as an argument for higher pensions.In discussion of the proposed method of giving effect to the Cabinet&apos;decision, in November last year, to save  25 million in 1978-79and subsequent years by withdrawing child tax allowances (CTAs)from the parents of non-resident children, it was argued that intaking this decision the Cabinet had envisaged that the CTAs wouldbe phased out over a period sufficient to enable parents to secureentry for their children into this country;  and it had been thoughtthat this period would be about 18 months.    On the other hand, itwas pointed out that the Cabinet had taken a firm decision on the savings required, leaving the detailed implementation of this to be worked out later, and there were very clear operational advantages in the method of implementation which had been agreed between theSecretary of State for Social Services and the Chief Secretary,Treasury.    This would bring in savings of  29 million in 1978-79but the effect on individual families of the additional  4 millionsavings thus secured would be very marginal, would be unlikely tomake any difference to individual decisions about whether to bringchildren into the country and would therefore be consistent with thegeneral principle which the Cabinet had favoured.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the political difficulties of adopting any of the suggestions for alternative savings in the DHSS field which had beenput forward by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, or set out in the note by officials annexed to CP(77) 16.    They agreed therefore that these possibilities should not be pursued.    In the health field the only practical scope for significant savings lay in an increasein prescription charges, for which there was a case on the merits,but the Cabinet had concluded that this would not be politicallyacceptable at the present time.    Some members of the Cabinet had6
expressed opposition to the proposal for withdrawing CTAs fromthe parents of non-resident children, but the majority of theCabinet accepted this as a logical extension, in practical and operational terms, of the decision taken in November 1976 tosecure savings of  25 million ?n 1978-79 by this means.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP(77) 14) covering a memorandum by theChief Secretary, Treasury, to which was attached a report by thePublic Expenditure Survey Committee covering all major ongoingand planned reviews, whether or not they were formally regardedas Programme Analysis and Review studies (PARs).    They also had before them a note by the Central Policy Review Staff(CP(77) 17).THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that when the cabinet discussed the PAR system in October, they had asked him to bring forward a stocktaking paper in order to enable them to agree upona 1977 programme of studies.    The report attached to his memorandum reviewed all major ongoing studies and set out, inPart 2 on pages 31 and 32, a summary of the reviews which it was proposed to undertake in 1977 under the PAR label.    he recommonded to Cabinet that they should agree that the proposedreviews should proceed.In the course of a short discussion the suggestion was made thatreviews undertaken by officials ought also to cover or do more totake into account documents or ideas emanating from Labour Partysources.    The prime responsibility for arranging this kind ofpolitical input lay however with departmental Ministers, many ofwhom had already arranged for their junior Ministers to establishclose links with the appropriate Party groups or committees.    Inthis way there could be both a contribution from the Department tothe Party deliberations and a feedback to the Departmental work.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet were content with the stocktaking report which was attachedto CP(77) 14, and approved the programme of PAR studies for 1977included therein subject to further consideration by the ministers concerned of the provisional studies.    They also took note of the continuing need for close liaison by Ministers with the appropriateParty groupings, though this should not of course detract from thefact that the responsibility for decisions lay with the Government.PAR:STOCKTAKINGAND PROPOSALSFOR 1977PreviousReference:CM(76) 26thConclusions,Minute 3
The Cabinet -I.    Took note with approval of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2. Invited the Chief Secretary, Treasury,to arrange for the approved PAR studies toproceed.WHITE paper on DIRECTELECTIONSPreviousReference:CM(76) 27thConclusions,Minute 5.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Home Department (CP(77) 15) to whichwas annexed a draft White Paper on Direct Elections to theEuropean Assembly.THE HOME SECRETARY said that the draft White Paper raisedsome difficult political issues.    But there were advantages inpublication at an early date.    Our Community partners would bereassured.    The Government would be seen to have given carefulconsideration to the issues raised in three separate reports by theSelect Committee on Direct Elections to the European Assembly.And it would also be useful to bring out the difficulties, of which many of those who supported direct elections were unaware,raised by the delimitation of the new and larger constituencieswhich would be needed.In discussion it was argued that not to give evidence soon that wewere going ahead with preparations for direct elections would have serious consequences.    It was now clear that all our Communitypartners would be ready for direct elections by the target date ofMay/June 1978;  doubts about whether the French and the Daneswould be ready in time had recently been removed.    If we were to talk of continuing to nominate our members the French would saythat under their constitution their agreement to direct electionswas necessarily dependent on reciprocity.    In theory we could then seek to put the blame on the French, but in practice we wouldincur the odium from all our partners.    In any case we had under-taken to use our best endeavours to be ready to hold direct elections in May/June 1978.    If we introduced a Bill but could not carry it this would not be inconsistent with best endeavours:  but not even tointroduce a Bill would be held by our Community partners to be a breach of faith.    This in turn would have adverse consequences fora number of objectives which we needed to pursue in the Communitycontext.    On the other hand it was argued that publication now ofthe present draft White Paper would raise a number of serious difficulties.    In the first place, those Government supporters inthe House who were opposed to direct elections might takepublication to imply a firm resolve by the Government to carrylegislation this year.    This could induce them to delay the 8
passage of the Scotland and Wales Bill in order to obstruct a Billon direct elections.    This argued for not publishing the white paper until after the guillotine on the Scotland and Wales Bill andalso for omitting from it clear dates by which under various optionsthe Bill needed Royal Assent.    Even so it had to be recognisedthat a debate on the White Paper, as was proposed, would show asubstantial majority for direct elections.    In the light of this itwould be difficult to argue afterwards that passage of the bill through the House was impracticable.    Yet the Bill could only begot through by relying on Opposition support, and at the cost ofexacerbating difficulties in the Labour Party.    Moreover, therehad been no adequate discussion in the House of Commons of thefundamental issues raised by the relationship between parliament and a directly elected European Assembly.In further discussion it was argued that insufficient consideration had been given to the major differences in electoral practice which existed between the United Kingdom and the rest of the Community.Our Community partners in agreeing to direct elections were more concerned to promote a symbol of unity than democratic control.Denmark, for example, intended to make the dual mandate (thatis an obligation that members of the European Assembly should at the same time be members of a national Parliament) compulsory.Other Member States such as France would operate on the basis ofa single list.    The delimitation of a number of large constituencies in the United Kingdom with a first past the post system generallyapplied would in all probability mean the absence of any Liberalmembers, a very small perhaps single figure Labour share of our81 members, and an overwhelming Conservative membership.This would undermine the position both of the Labour Party in office and individual Labour MPs in relation to their constituencies and a result as distorted as this would not be good either for theEuropean Assembly or for the regard in which it would be held inthis country.    We had too readily assumed that the first past thepost system was right in this country.    In particular there were strong arguments for a single list.    Admittedly if we decided toadopt a single list this would mean the adoption of proportional representation which had been resisted in the case of the scottish and Welsh Assemblies but the circumstances, and in particular the size of the constituencies, were quite different.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet recognised the advantages of early publication of a white paper on direct elections as an indication to our European partnersthat we were continuing to use the best endeavours to which we hadpledged ourselves.    However, the electoral system proposed inthe White Paper raised a number of fundamental issues which required full examination.    Officials should therefore prepare amemorandum on the electoral practices of our Community partners9
and the options, including the single list and the dual mandate,which it would be open to us to adopt.    He would then arrange for it to be given some prior political consideration by a Group ofMinisters before it was circulated for further discussion by theCabinet towards the end of February.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office10 February 197710
