PARLIAMENTARY   1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in the affairs House of Commons during the following week.Social THE MINISTER FOR SOCIAL SECURITY said that the Home and security Social Affairs Committee had taken decisions the previous day about(Miscellaneous Government amendments to the Social Security (miscellaneous provisions) Provisions) Bill at Report Stage.    Royal Assent for this Bill wasBill needed in March in order to secure public expenditure savings in1977-78, and it was important that Report and Third Reading should betaken as early as possible.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theLord President of the Council would do his best to find a time for theremaining stages of this Bill as soon as possible.The Cabinet -1.     Took note.Scotlandand WalesBill:TimetableMotionPreviousRe    rence:CM(77) 2ndConclusions,Minute 1The Cabinet then had a general discussion of the parliamentary situation in the light of progress to date on the Scotland and WalesBill.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet took the view that the prospect of carrying atimetable Motion would be improved if the new clauses providing for post-As sent referendums were debated first.    These clauses should therefore now be tabled and should be proceeded with as quickly aspossible.    No announcement of a guillotine should be made meanwhile.The Cabinet would consider this at a later meeting.The cabinet.     Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion, and invited the Lord President of the Council to be guided accordingly.1
THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that the ministerial committee on Devolution Strategy (DVY) had now agreed on the termsof the questions that would be put in the Scottish and Welshreferendums.    For Scotland, they recommended that the question should be:&quot;The Scotland and Wales Act 1977 provides for an electedScottish Assembly and Executive.    Scotland would remain partof the United Kingdom.     The new Assembly and Executivewould exercise substantial powers devolved by Parliament.These provisions will however come into force only if approved in this referendum in Scotland.DO YOU AGREE THAT THE PROVISIONS OF THE SCOTLANDAND WALES ACT 1977 SHOULD BE PUT INTO EFFECT INSCOTLAND?&quot;.The question for Wales would be identical apart from the appropriatereferences to Wales in place of Scotland.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a short discussion, said that theCabinet agreed with the terms proposed for the questions.The Cabinet -3.     Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.2
FOREIGNAFFAIRSFalklandIslandsPreviousReference:CM(76) 4?.ndConclurions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY saidthat the statement which he had been authorised to make in theHouse of Commons on 2 February had been received withoutcontroversy.    Attitudes seemed to have changed since 1968 when thesubject aroused strong feelings and he thought it should now bepossible to avoid major Parliamentary difficulties.Rhodesia1   previous reference:CM(77) 2ndConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said he would prefer to delay a detailed report on Mr Richard1 s mission until hewas in a position to put specific proposals to the Cabinet.    He had however had a useful preliminary talk with Mr Andrew Young, theUnited States Representative to the United Nations, on the previous day.    Mr Ivor Richard was now back in London and it was hoped tohave informal talks with the Americans in the following week.Abducted THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that thereChildren were conflicting accounts of what had happened to the 400 children who had crossed the frontier between Rhodesia and Botswana.     TheRhodesians claimed they had been abducted to Botswana:  while theBotswana Government said they had come to Botswana voluntarily.Botswana officials said that the situation in which the children had to live in Rhodesia was intolerable and that, as others had donepreviously, they had made their own decision to cross the border.Their ages ranged from 13 to 18 and they might therefore be presumedto be able to make up their own minds.    The incident had occurred in an area which was a long way from any British representative andwe had no means of discovering the true facts.    We had no practicalresponsibility in the matter and it was unfortunate that the Speakershould have allowed an emergency debate on the matter.    he proposed that Mr Rowlands should make only a brief reply.THE PRIME MINISTER said that, while it was true that there was nothing which we could do about the matter, this was the sort of case which, because of the involvement of children, aroused humanitariansympathies in the House.    He hoped that, while making clear ourposition, Mr Rowlands would adopt a generally sympathetic andhumanitarian approach.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Prime Ministerand the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary.3
3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secretaryof State for Defence (CP(77) 13) to wMch was attached a draft of theStatement on the Defence Estimates 1977.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR DEFENCE said that in layout thedraft attached to his memorandum was similar to previous defence white Papers.    The main issues were treated in Chapter I, in whichthe passages describing the military capability of the Warsaw pact and the response to it of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (NATO)had been considered with particular care by the Defence and overseas policy Committee (DOP).    There could be no doubt about the continuing growth in Soviet military power, and its essential featureswere described in Chapter I, as they had been in the 1975 and 1976Defence White Papers.    But he had sought to expand the account of nato&apos;s response as far as he could within the limits imposed bysecurity and what our Allies would be prepared for us to say about their own military contribution to the Alliance.    It was not possibleto please both those who thought we spent too much on defence andthose who thought we spent too little:   but he believed that a generally satisfactory balance was struck in the present draft of Chapter I,which included amendments agreed by DOP.In discussion of Chapter I of the draft Statement the following points were made -a. Purchasing power parity was a more satisfactory basisthan the United States dollar for international comparison ofdefence spending.    Since recent purchasing power figures werenot available, an explanation of the limitations of the dollarstatistics had been included in paragraph 143 of the draft statement.    It was suggested that use of the dollar basissignificantly understated our comparative defence spending per capita:  if account were taken of purchasing power parity, ourranking in the Alliance might be as high as it was if defencespending were measured as a proportion of national output.This point should be made during the defence debates.b. The disappointingly slow progress in the negotiations onmutual and balanced reductions of forces in central Europemade it the more important that the United States and theSoviet Union should reach a further agreement this year on strategic arms limitation.    The new American Administrationwished to give a fresh impetus to the talks, and this waswelcome.     The Soviet Union too seemed willing to work for anagreement, but there were genuine difficulties on both sideswhich made an early agreement unlikely.4
In discussion of the remaining Chapters of the draft Statement thefollowing further points were made -a. The draft Statement contained no reference to the future of gibraltar Dockyard.    A decision to close the dockyard wouldhave to be announced soon if the savings envisaged in the 1975public expenditure review were to be achieved.    Theannouncement of such a decision would however be receivedvery critically in Gibraltar:  and on this account there mightbe advantage if it could be made during the debate on theDefence Estimates rather than as a separate announcement.Such a decision would also be very badly received by theTrades Union Congress.b. In the section of the Statement dealing with the operations of British forces in Northern Ireland the last sentence ofparagraph 230, referring to the Peace Movement in NorthernIreland, might be counter-productive and should be deleted.In the preceding sentence the phrase &quot;a majority of thecommunity&quot; should be changed to &quot;a majority of the people&quot;.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the text of the Statement on the Defence Estimates1977 subject to the points made in discussion and agreed that itshould be published on 28 February.    No decision could be taken aboutthe future of Gibraltar Dockyard on which there were no papers beforethe Cabinet:  this would require separate and careful consideration bythe Ministers concerned.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion.Cabinet Office3 February 19775
