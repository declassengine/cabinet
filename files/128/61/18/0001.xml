PARLIAMENTARYAFFAIR.S1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons during the following week.Petrol TaxPreviousReference:CM(77) 15thConclusions,Mintite 1THE CHIEF SECRETARY, TREASURY, said that the Governmenthad two options in deciding how to handle tha vote on 9 May on petroltax:   to fight to maintain the budget proposals and face a strong riskof defeat, or to make some concession.    The Liberals had howeverchosen to make this a major issue, and even if the Government wonthis vote it could well lead to difficulties with the Liberals over other amendments to the Finance Bill and would sour the workingarrangement with them.    Furthermore every vot0! lost by theGovernment affected its credibility.    Accordingly he favouredmaking a concession.      The Liberal amendment on the Order paper would however remove the duty from both petrol and DERV.    Hethought that the Liberals would agree to the removal of the petroltax only with effect from August:   this would save one-third of therevenue in 1977-78 and would avoid administrative problems.    Thecost would be  140 million as compared with the  180 millionentailed by the Liberal amendment.    The Government would need tosay in the debate that this loss must be offset, but provided thepetrol duty remained in force untij August, there was no need for anearly decision on how this should be done.    The matter should beconsidered later in the context of progress on the Finance Bill as awhole and taking account of what could be carried in the House:  forexample some Labour backbenchers might well vote against anincrease in the duty on beer.    Although the proposed concessionmight look like a climb-down, the Government would gain some creditsince many of its supporters were also unhappy about the petrol tax.It would be necessary to ensure that the motorist received thebenefit of the concession and not the petrol companies.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that the concessionwas preferable to being humiliated by losing the vote.    Working withthe Liberals was difficult but necessary, and he proposed that the concession should be offered on condition that the Liberals would notonly support the Government amendment on petrol tax but would alsosupport the Government on other issues arising on the Finance Bill.This concession should not be presented as due to the Liberals alone;the view of the House as a whole was against the Government.    he agreed that the Government would have to be in a position to demonstrate credibly that the motorist would get the benefit.    a difficult decision would be involved over offset, but at the presenttime the size of the ultimata requirement following amendment to theFinance Bill was uncertain.    He had previously indicated that some measure of further stimulation might be possible in the context ofthe Third Pay Round.   At present there was some  200 millionheadroom on the public sector borrowing requirement, and furtherheadroom might be obtainable.    On the other hand, the decision not
to over-rule the Price Commission on telephone charges would cost 100 million, and more might yet be lost through amendments to theFinance Bill,    He would therefore like to give further considerationto the beat presentation of the Governments position on offset,In discussion there was general agreement that, while there was atheoretical possibility of winning a vote on the budget proposals, inpractice there was no reaJ chance of success and that the concessionproposed by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, should be made.    It was argued that representations had been received from all parties andthat this point should be brought out clearly in defending the concession which would also be helpful in the consultations on paypolicy.    It would be desirable not to allow any impression to gainground that the likely alternative was an increase of 3p on beer, whichwould be unpopular among Labour supporters.    It was also suggestedthat it would be preferable not to be firmly committed tc the proposi-tion that some offset would be unavoidable.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved the proposal by the Chief Secretary, Treasury, totable a Government amendment removing the 5p duty on petrol from august.    This would need careful presentation, and it would be forthe Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider this, taking account ofthe points made in discussion.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister1 summing up of their discussion.
2. THE PRIME MINISTER informed the Cabinet about thearrangements for President Carter&apos;s visit to the North-East ofEngland on 6 May, the Downing Street Summit to discuss mainlyeconomic matters on 7-8 May at which the Heads of Government ofCanada, France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Italy, Japan, theUnited States and the United Kingdom will be present, the meeting between President Carter, President Giscard, Chancellor Schmidtand himself on 9 May to discuss Berlin and certain other political matters, and the NATO Ministerial Meeting which would be opened in the presence of 14 Heads of Government on 10. May.    At theDowning Street Summit the first day was likely to be taken up by a wide-ranging discussion of the world economic situation.    Followinghis own briefing meetings he had thought it right tc send a personal letter to President Carter expressing his deep concern about a situation in which the growth rates of the stronger economies mightnot be achieved or, even if achieved, would be insufficient to lead therest of the industrialised world out of the recession.    He had made itclear that no country had the right to ask another to take action whichit believed to be unwise:  but the question then arose of how theweaker economies, who had pursued policies of restraint, were todeal with their own unemployment problems.    One possibility wouldbe through action by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to ease the financing problems of the weaker industrialised countries and the developing countries, but even if the IMF&apos;s own proposals were accepted in full they might well be inadequate.    He had said therefore that he would like to talk to President Carter privately about thisbefore the Summit opened.    This was a major issue of substance:but its presentation would also need careful thought.    ChancellorSchmidt took the view that the policies now being pursued by the seven countries at the Summit were broadly correct and that nofurther action was necessary other than to strike a firm not3 ofconfidence to correct what he saw as an unjustified malaise.    In other words the Summits job was to restore confidence.    This was indeedan important argument, but it was also questionable whether confidenceor credibility would be maintained by an optimistic communique ifthere was little substance to justify it.     The second day of the Summitwould be attended by the President of the Commission of the european communities and items of Community competence such as trade andthe dialogue with the developing countries would be discussed.     Inthis connection it was noted that energy was a cloudy area:  we did not accept that the Community had necessarily or on all aspects of thesubject to speak with one voice, but there was a Community interestand we were ourselves promoting discussion of a Community energypolicy.The Cabinet -Took note.3
THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that hehad undertaken to give a further report to the Cabinet and he hoped to be in a position to do so next week.    It was not yet clear what theAmerican position on the next steps would be.    He would be seeing the United States Secretary of State, Mr Vance, on 6 May, and hewould also be seeing Mr Nkomo on the same day.    He had circulatedto his colleagues on the Ministerial Group on Southern Africa (GEN 12)a minute indicating the course of action to which he proposed to seekAmerican agreement,,    This was to go ahead, jointly with the americans, with bilateral consultations in Southern Africa, but not,at this stage, to do anything about calling a conference.    In Ms view it was desirable to avcid trying to bring the parties together too early and the more that could be agreed before a conference was held the better.    He thought it probable that the Americans would go along withthis line.    It was important to keep them involved at all stages.There was no reason to think that they were backtracking on their undertaking to give us full support, but they had not taken kindly to thePatriotic Front&apos;s rejection of their participation and they still had to face up to the fact that if they became involved with ue they were boundto get a good deal of criticism.    Alter his meeting with Mr Vance he proposed to make a statement for which he would seek approval inadvance.In discussion the point was made that despite what the Foreign and commonwealth Secteiaiy Iwd achieved, there was some risk ofdrifting into a position where we would be pressed to enforce asolution reached as a result of the consultations on which we were nowembarking, without having the power to do so.    3efore there was any chance of this point being reached, Ministers should consider carefullywhere the balance of our advantage lay.    The hope was expressed that the Foreign and Commonwealth Secretary would circulate a paper in the fairly near future which would set out the political and economic implications of our proposals for a settlement of the Rhodesian problem..The Cabinet -Took note.
GUARANTEED 30 The Cabinet considered a note by the Secretary of State for price FOR MILK      Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs (CP(77) 42) seeking decisions on the level of the guaranteed price for milk and on the timing and extent of the consequent increases in the retail milk price;   and amemorandum by the Minister of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food(CP(77) 43) suggesting that the guaranteed price should not be lessthan 47p per gallon and that this should be financed by increases inthe retail price of l^p on 22 May and jrp in mid-October.THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY, introducinghis paper, said that the guaranteed price for milk was a matter for national determination separately from the Community price-fixing,The Ministerial Committee on European Questions had been unableto reach a decision.    The agricultural Ministers had favoured a significant increase reflecting their assessment of the need to restore confidence in the industry while other Ministers had favoured a more modest increase taking account of the consequences forretail prices and incomes policy.    But the Committee had narrowedthe area of disagreement to the difference between 46p per gallonwhich would have been acceptable to the majority of Ministers and47p per gallon which was preferred by the agricultural Ministers.On the one hand the policy of agricultural expansion embodied in theWhite Paper &quot;Food from our own Resources&quot; called for the expansionof milk production on import saving grounds,,    On the other hand itmight be difficult to defend a price increase for our own producerslarger than we had been prepared to accept in the Community,    on balance he recommended a guarantee of 46p per gallon.THE MINISTER OF AGRICULTURE, FISHERIES AND FOOD,introducing his paper, said that Cabinet need not be influenced bythe relationship between our guaranteed price and the Communityprice for milk.    The Community recognised that producers in deficit areas could be expected to secure some advantage from their position.    At a realistic exchange rate the guarantee of 47p per gallon which he proposed would be some 25 per cent below theCommunity target price, which was in turn below the pricereceived, for example, by German producers.    The guarantee nowto be fixed would be the last to be determined before 1 January 1978when the full Community support price would become applicable.The policy laid down in the White Paper was one of expansion in the dairy herd in milk production with the aim of reducing our massivedependence on imports.   There was no inconsistency in seeking to expand efficient production in the United Kingdom and to reduceinefficient production elsewhere in the Community,    The numberof dairy heifers in calf had declined by over 14 per cent in the past year as a consequence of declining profitability.    In view of the retail price implications he was seeking a guarantee of 47p whichwas the minimum at which in favourable conditions some expansionmight be secured and the credibility of the Governments policymaintained.    It would represent an increase of 7 per cent inproducers&apos; returns against an inflation rate of 15 per cent.    Such5
an increase in the guarantee would aot have required a retail price increase untii the end of 1977 were it not for the phasing out of food subsidies which would in any event require a retail price increase oflp this summer,    A guarantee of 47p would require an additionalincrease of fp at an early stage and a further -jrp in mid-October.A guarantee of 46p would not greatly reduce the retail price effect,but would involve abandoning the policy of expansion.In discussion it was argued that the Government should maintain its policy of expansion for an important and efficient industry on importBaving grounds.    The dairy herd was also our main source of beefsupplies.    The decline in the breeding herd in Wales was particularlyserious.    If the herd were allowed to decline in the short term a disproportionate increase in support would be needed later to reverse the trend.    A guarantee of 47p would be disappointing to producers and there was Liberal support for a higher figure provided that thefood subsidy wa3 continued.    The difference between an increase of2p and one of 3p in the guarantee would be more critical forproducers who were facing an increase of 5p in costs than it wouldbe for consumers who were in any event facing the loss of the subsidy.On the other hand it was argued that each additional lp on theguarantee would increase the income from an average herd by over 400 per annum.    If expansion were not secured in the short termit could be encouraged at a later stage, whereas damage to theprospects for a satisfactory incomes policy would be irreversible.The price of milk was highly sensitive for consumers.    A guarantee of 45p would be sufficient on present forecasts to avert a seriousdecline in milk production.    A guarantee of 47p would increase thepresent healthy level of producers1 returns to record levels andwould add 0; 6 per cent to the retail price index - nearly as much asthe abolition of food subsidies, or five times the benefit gained fromthe Community butter subsidy.In discussion of the size and timing of retail price increases, it waspointed out that an early increase of lp in the retail price was inevitable.    The further increase needed to finance the guarantee should therefore be deferred until the expected easing of retail priceslater in the year.    While the prospects for retail prices could beinferred from the level of the guarantee, there would be advantages inlimiting any retail price increase during the present negotiations on incomes policy to lp and in avoiding a further increase before theannual conference of the Trades Union Congress (TUC).    Thepossibility of reintroducing the milk subsidy was not attractive since it would not avoid some increase in the milk price..    It would be helpful to producers&apos; confidence if they could be assured of themaintenance of the retail price from January to March 1978, but such a decision would require furthe r consideration.6
THE PPJME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theproblem was to balance the need for adequate support to the dairyindustry against the need to hold down retail prices in the interestsof incomes policy P    The level of the guarantee ar.d the size and timing of the retail price increases were interlinked.    Bothfactorb were subject to some uncertainty.    The Cabinet agreed on balance that the guaranteed price for milk should be 46jp per gallon.Such a figure although not popular with the farming community wouldtake account both of the requirements of incomes policy and of theneed for import saving.    It need not imply a departure from theGovernment&apos;s expansion policy, though it might have to bo acknow-ledged that expansion would not continue if there were an untowardincrease in production costs.    There should be an early increase oflp in the retail price of milk with the intention of deferring anyfurther increase until after the annual conference of the TUC.    no assurance could be given as to the maintenance of the retaix priceafter the end of 1977, though the Minister of Agriculture would be free if necessary to bring the issue back to his colleagues.The Cabinet -1.      Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.      Invited the Minister of Agriculture,Fisheries and Food to proceed accordingly.
4. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Home Secretary(CP(77) 39) and the Secretary of State for Social Services (CP(77) 41)about compensation for vaccine damaged children,THE HOME SECRETARY said that when Home and Social Affairs (HS)Committee first considered this problem, it had not yet beenestablished whether a commitment in principle to compensation forvaccine damaged children would be compatible with the likelyrecommendations of the Royal Commission on Civil Liability and compensation for Personal Injury which was sitting under lord Pearson;  the commission s report was expected towards the endof the year.    At their second meeting, however, the Committee hadthe benefit of Lord Pearsons views, as set out in paragraph 3 of bismemorandum, and of a note by officials, annexed to the memorandum,listing the questions which would need to be settled before a scheme ofcompensation could be introduced.    There was ho doubt about tliesympathy with which the Committee had viewed, the claims of parentsfor vaccine damaged children, though the style of the campaign byMr Jack Ashley MP was open to criticism.    The Committee felt that compensation would have to be conceded sooner or later but they were unable to reach a clear view on the wisdom of announcing a commitment in advance of the Pearson Report, as the Secretary of State for social services was proposing.    Paragrapn 5 of his memorandum set out the reservations which had been expressed, and the Committee had been particularly influenced by the interventions of the Lord Chancellor andthe Attorney General on the wider legal implications.    He himself was ready to trust the judgment of the Secretary of State for Social Servicesthat a commitment in principle to compensation would in fact enable theGovernment to reverse the fall in the take-up of vaccination;   and heinstinctively believed also that vaccine cculd be treated as an exceptional case on the basic ground that we had a state health service which actively promoted vaccination programmes for children.    he recognised, however, that some of his colleagues had seriousreservations about proceeding in advance of the Pearson Report;  andhe had just received a letter in which the Secretary of State for employment, who was in Brussels, had pointed out that, while he didnot wish to dissent from the proposal by the Secretary of State for social Services, it would make it the more difficult for him to continueto rest on the need to await the Pearson Report as a reason for resistingpressures for compensation schemes for people, such as disabled slatequarry workers, suffering from certain industrial diseases.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR SOCIAL SERVICES said that he agreed with the view, expressed in the Home Secretary1 s memorandum,that the question was one essentially of political judgment.    He did notbelieve that it would be difficult to maintain that vaccine damageconstituted an exceptional case for a scheme of payments on a no-liabilitybasis:  although vaccination was not compulsory as it was in many othercountries, nevertheless it was Government policy to promote it;  andthe public would recognise it as a special caaeg    If there were to be8
problems in holding the line against other claims, they would in anycase have to be faced after the Pearson Commission had reported and recommended payments for vaccine damaged children, as theywere unanimously agreed to do.    But, on the basis of waiting forthe Pearson Report, it could be 18 months before the Governmentreached a conclusion, and meanwhile the political pressures wouldhave become very great.    Apart from the political considerations,however, and his own strong personal feeling that the parents ofvaccine damaged children deserved compensation, he was greatlyconcerned about the public health aspects of delay.    He was convincedthat it would be impossible to get the vaccination programmes off theground until the principle of compensation had been conceded and thepolitical campaign abated.    If the Government failed to do this, theywould bare a heavy responsibility for the greater incidence ofcrippling diseases.    There were already an increasing number ofpoliomyelitis cages because children had not been vaccinated.    Hehad seen the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation sinceHS Committee&apos;s last discussion.    They expected to have a paper bythe end of May pointing out the very small risks and major benefitsattaching to the vaccination programmes, but they had no confidence that their findings would succeed in restoring the take-up of vaccinationif the campaign for compensation continued to concentrate public attention on the risk of damage.THE LORD CHANCELLOR said that there had been considerableargument in HS Committee about whether a commitment in principle to compensation would favourably affect the vaccination programme butif this were accepted, the further area of difficulty was whether itwould be possible to treat vaccine damage as being in a class of its own.The principle of paying compensation without evidence of fault orliability could have far-reaching implications in the medical field asa whole, for example in relation to blood transfusions or other treat-ment which had untoward side effects, and also outside the medicalfield, for example in relation to death or injury exceptionally caused tomotorists by the wearing of seat belts.    Although Lord Pearson had said that his Commission would recommend some form of payment for vaccine damage, they had not yet been able to relate this to ageneral principle or to consider criteria and other details of a possiblescheme,    A wide range of difficult questions, for example, thetreatment of claims in respect of children already dead, remained tobe answered.    The Government had perhaps not given sufficientprominence so far to the serious risks presented to children by failure to have them vaccinated;  the paper by the Joint Committee onVaccination and Immunisation would presumably help to redress thebalance.    In his view, therefore, provided that the political pressureswere not judged to be too great, it would be pieferable to a,wait publica-tion of the Joint Committee&apos;s findings and the Pearson CommissionsReport before taking a decision on the principle of a scheme ofpayments.    He himself had done his utmost to encourage the RoyalCommission to make more rapid progress with their Report.9
In discussion, it was argued that the principle of no-fault liability was already implicit in schemes of compensation for industrial or warinjuries.    Acceptance of the principle of compensation for vaccinedamage should not prejudice the Government1 s stance on compensationfor industrial diseases since there was already separate machinery for considering claims for the classification of such diseases.    There wasno such machinery for vaccine damage, and it should be possible toobtain an assurance from Lord Pearson that a commitment to theprinciple of compensation for this would not involve its extension more widely.    It was suggested however that there was a strong case, on public health grounds, for considering a comprehensive schema ofpayments to cover vaccine damage and for divorcing this altogether from the issue of compensation and from the Pearson Report.Alternatively, the Pearson Commission could be asked to considervaccine damage as a separate exercise, though it was noted that lord Pearson had already rejected the idea of an interim report.    If astatement were to be made, it would be preferable to avoid the appear-ance of a concession to Mr Ashley1 s campaign and to address it to thevaccination programmes as such.    In any publicity campaign to restore confidence in the programmes the services of the schools should be fullydeployed.On the other hard, it was argued that a commitment in principle topayments for vaccine damage would do little to mcllify the parents andMr Ashley.    Experience of the thalidomide campaign, to which thepresent campaign bore some resemblance, suggested that those con-cerned would not rest content until the details of a scheme were settledto their satisfaction;   and there would be a risk of raising false hopesin individual parents.    Moreover, the political strength of the campaignwas not out of the ordinary in comparison with that of other pressuregroups.    There was considerable support for the reservations whichhad been expressed about the wider implications of a commitment to compensation without evidence of fault or negligence.    In the medicalfield, for example, the safety of medicines, which could have harmfulside effects, to some extent received the Government&apos;s imprimatur;and the British Medical Association might well have a view on whetherit was right to extend the principle of compensation beyond cases ofnegligence.    There would be a major difficulty about devising any schemeof payments without reference to the context of the Pearson Report.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that he himself had great sympathy with the claims of parents of vaccinedamaged children and this was wholly shared by his colleagues.    Therewas a clear division of opinion, however, on whether a commitment inprinciple to a scheme of payments should be made now, and he had been persuaded, as had a majority of the Cabinet, by the arguments against.There was a strong case, however, for mitigating the effects of delaybefore the Pearson Commission reported and a more informed decision could be taken, and he would consider the possibility of a publicexchange of letters between himself and Lord Pearson in which he wouldexpress the Governments concern at the rundown of the vaccination-   10
programmes, refer to the need to restore public confidence in themand enquire how soon the views of the Royal Commission on the issueof payments for vaccine damage might be expected.    The letter might also refer to the forthcoming paper by the Joint Committee onVaccination and Immunisation and the need to ensure the success of anyassociated publicity campaign.    The Lord Chancellor, in consultationwith the Secretary of State for Social Services, the Chief Secretary,Treasury and Lord Pearson as necessary, should consider the possibleterms of an exchange of letters and let him have his advice.    Thepurpose of the exchange of letters would be to provide further justifica-tion for the Governernnt1 s deciaion to await the Pearson Report.    Atthe same time, however, the Secretary of State for Social services should arrange for work to be carried forward on the formulation of apossible scheme of payments in order that the Government should beable to take a decision without unnecessary delay after the PearsonReport was received.The Cabinet -Took note, with approval, of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up of their discussion and invited theLord Chancellor and the Secretary of State for social services to proceed accordingly.GOVERNMENTRESPONSE TOTHE LAYFIELDREPORT ONLOCALGOVERNMENTFINANCE5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of Statefor the Home Department (CP(77) 40) covering a draft Green Paperembodying the proposed response by the Government to the LayfieldReport on Local Government Finance.THE SECRETARY OF STATE FOR THE ENVIBO NMENT said that ithad been hoped, when the Layfield Committee was appointed, that theCommittee would find a way to get rid of the local rating system,instead they had come up with a possible supplement, to it in the formof a local income tax which would reduce the need for centralgovernment grant.    Layfield had identified two possible approaches -&quot; centralist&quot; and &quot;localist&quot;  - to the problems which arose in the field of local government finance;    but the Ministerial Group who had considered the Layfield Report had rejected both - and local incometax with them - in favour of a middle way.    Rates would remain, butvarious changes to the present system were proposed.    The relationship between central and local government should be one of partnership;and the Green Paper floated the possibility of both a continuation of thepresent rate support grant (RSG) system, with some modifications, or its replacement by a unitary grant, which would be more selective thanRSG in that it would impose on the ratepayers in the local authority areaconcerned the burden arising from a high level of spending by aparticular authority.    The Green Paper indicated the Governmentspreference for the latter, but left the question open for further discussion - the local authority associations were unanimously opposed11
to it as being a step towards &quot;centralism&quot;.    Politically the major issues would be rates and excessive local spending.    On the first,the Opposition had announced their intention to abolish domestic rates,but had been unable to say how they would make good the lost revenue.On the second, floating the proposal for a unitary grant would show thatthe Government were giving serious consideration to the problem of controlling local authority expenditure.    He proposed to publish the green Paper, subject to the revision of one paragraph, and to make anaccompanying Parliamentary statement, about the middle of May.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up a brief discussion, said that theCabinet agreed that, while there was little political advantage to be gained by the proposed Green Paper, it was necessary to publish aGovernment response to the Layfield Report, which Lad now been available for a year.    The document should therefore be presented inlow key, and the Secretary of State for the Environment should inparticular point up the scope and the need for further public debate and discussion and for more consultation with the local authorities.    Theynoted that a parallel document relating to Scotland would be published at the same timeThe Cabinet -1.       Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.       Invited the Secretary of State for the environment to publish the Green Paper aboutthe middle of May, and in his parliamentary statement to take full account of the Prime Minister&apos;summing up.3.       Took note that the Secretary of State forScotland would publish a parallel Scottish green paper on the same day.Cabinet office May 197712
