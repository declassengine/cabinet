PARLIAMENTARY     1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inA* FAIRS the House of Commons during the following week.    The importance was noted of ensuring that the private business set down forMonday, on behalf of the Greater London Council, did not fail forwant of support on the Government side.THE PRIME MINISTER said that while the Government had suffered a serious reverse in the vote on Tuesday on the timetablemotion on the Scotland and Wales Bill, it was clear that no blame for the situation should attach to the Government Whips.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that it was essentialto make, in Parliament that afternoon, some statement of theGovernment1 s intentions in the light of Tuesday&apos;s vote.    He had circulated to the Cabinet the draft of such a statement.    It shouldhave three themes:  the Governments continuing commitment todevolution, their willingness to embark on talks with other partiesto seek a wider measure of agreement, and their intention tocontinue with the Bill,    He saw no high likelihood that inter-Partytalks would lead to positive results, but they might valuablyexpose the hollowness of rival policies.    He had considered the ideaof immediate recourse to a referendum, for which there was considerable support in the House, but this would raise gravepractical and constitutional difficulties.     He had it in mind thatthere might prove to be merit later on in declaring an intention tointroduce a motion for the carrying-over of the Scotland and WalesBill to the next Session of Parliament.    This would demonstrate theGovernments resolve, and might offer the best hcpe of keepingScottish and Welsh opinion (including nationalist Members ofParliament) in support of the Government.    He did not however seek a decision on this concept at the present stage.    The immediate need was for a holding statement on the lines he had suggested.    Meanwhileofficials should study both the modalities of inter-Party talks and possible fall-back options if the talks proved unfruitful.In discussion, there was general support for the view that theGovernment must firmly uphold and stress its basic commitment toa policy of devolution, and must be seen to offer better prospects ofaction on the subject than any other Party.    This was particularly important to the Governments position in Scotland and Wales, bothnow and at a future General Election.    At the same time, the vote on Tuesday had underlined the growing importance of the Englishdimension.There was general support also for the view that study should beundertaken of alternative options, as the Lord President had proposed.    This study should identify major criticisms of thepresent Bill and consider how they might be met.    It would however be an illusion to suppose that better schemes were easily to be had.Scotland and WalesBillPreviousReference:CM(77) 6thConclusions,Minute 11
The Bill reflected a great deal of work, during which Ministers hadidentified and discussed at length all the issues on which theParliamentary debate was focusing.     There was little ground foroptimism that renewed efforts would produce fresh solutions ofwider appeal within anything like the same basic concept of devolution.    It was argued that in this situation the fundamentalfact which the Cabinet must face was that no substantial devolutionmeasure could be expected to pass in the present Parliament,where the Government commanded no secure majority.It was suggested that the idea of an early referendum on devolutionhad certain attractions;  many of the Governments Scottishsupporters in the House favoured it, and the results might help theGovernment against the Bill&apos;s critics.    There were however very powerful objections.    It would seem a device for going over thehead of Parliament;  legislation to set it up would be contentious andmight not pass;    Labour supporters in Wales might particularlydislike the concept; it would be difficult to resist a proliferation of questions, and the extension of voting to all parts of the UnitedKingdom;  no clear and realistic proposition would be placed beforethe voters, who might as a result express ill-considered opinions,including perhaps an uncomfortably large Scottish vote for independence;  and the results would offer no guarantee, and perhapslittle prospect, of dissolving the Parliamentary impasse.As regards the idea of inter-Party talks, it was noted that these would entail some risk of the Governments seeming to lose controlof events;  but for the immediate future there appeared to be no alternative course available, poor though the prospects of ultimatesuccess might be.    It would be best to conduct the initial contacts,directed towards establishing the agenda and machinery forsubstantive discussion, on a bilateral basis.    The Governmentshould keep options as open as possible for the structure of the substantive phase.    A Select Committee of Parliament might well prove suitable, but other possibilities should not be excluded.    TheGovernment1 s aims in the talks should include the exposure of the divisions within the Conservative ranks and their lack of any trulyviable devolution schemes.    If it became clear that no inter-Partyprocess could deliver a useful agreement, one device that mightmerit consideration would be to set up a special commission of theCabinet itself to take evidence in public and to make papers widelyavailable.    Whatever consultations were undertaken, it was important that the Governments own backbenchers should not feelignored.Differing views were expressed on whether to continue withproceedings on the Bill.    It was strongly argued that to do so with no prospect of its eventual passage would be a patently pointlessexercise, placing the Ministers concerned in an impossible positionand likely to lead to sharp discontent and even demoralisation amongthe Government1 s supporters in the House.    To continue while2
inter-Party talks, entailing the possibility of major changes, werein progress would seem all the more absurd.    Against this, it wagurged that to suspend all action on the Bill immediately would beregarded as tantamount to its abandonment, which in turn would beseen particularly by the nationalist parties and in Scotland andWales generally, as the end of the only existing process whichoffered any prospect at all of leading to action within a reasonabletimescale.    One intermediate possibility might be to schedule days of debate, without votes taken, on particular major aspects of theBill, such as taxation powers.    This might be a useful way ofeducating opinion in the House and elsewhere about the problems which any realistic scheme of devolution must address.    It mightincidentally reduce the risk that, in the absence of any proceedings on the Bill, the Parliamentary timetable during March might haveto embrace debates on matters inconvenient to the Government atthis stage.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that theGovernment had suffered a serious setback;  but it would be quitewrong to view the situation as disastrous.    Although there could beno prospect now of securing the passage of the Scotland and WalesBill in the current Session, and no better scheme of devolution layeasily to hand, the Government must nevertheless remain clearlycommitted to the principle of devolution, and must also, while recognising the importance of English concerns, keep its positionin Scotland and Wales as the only Party likely to deliver it.    In themeantime, the fact was that the Government had not now the powerto force its own views through the House of Commons, and moreoverthey might not wish to concentrate excessively on devolution duringthe remaining life of the present Parliament.    The Cabinet agreedthat an immediate holding statement should be made in Parliament,and that this should promise inter-Party discussions, initially on a bilateral basis to explore the possible scope, agenda and machineryof any substantive talks;  he would refer to this when, as the cabinet agreed, he saw the leaders of the Scottish National Party and ofPlaid Cymru at their request.    For the present, both proceduraland substantive options should be kept as wide open as possible(though the majority of the Cabinet clearly saw little attraction in a referendum) and the Constitution Unit should undertake studies on the options as the Lord President of the Council had proposed.    TheCabinet was not yet ready to reach a firm view about future proceed-ings on the Bill itself;  for the moment, the Lord President of theCouncil should say merely that no proceedings were being scheduledfor the coming week.    The Cabinet agreed that in other respects theLord President&apos;8 statement that afternoon should be generally on thelines he had proposed, subject to any necessary adjustment in thelight of the point6 made in discussion.The Cabinet -1.     Took note, with approval, of the prime minister s summing up of their discussion.3
At :raft andShipbuildingIndustries bill previous reference:CM(77) 6thConclusions,Minute   1The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord Presidentof the Council (CP(77) 22) reporting the conclusions of a Group ofMinisters which had considered the implications of the ruling by theHouse of Lords Examiners that the Aircraft and shipbuilding industries Bill was hybrid in respect of the shiprepairing companiesscheduled for nationalisation.THE LORD PRESIDENT OF THE COUNCIL said that two optionswere available.    The first would be to allow the Bill to follow thenormal procedure for hybrid Bills, which would mean reference toa Select Committee, and to pass it under the Parliament Acts in itspresent form at the end of the Session.    The second would be to seek a deal under which the shiprepairing companies would be dropped from the Bill in return for a clear commitment from theOpposition in both Houses that they would allow the remainder ofthe Bill to proceed to Royal Assent without further delay or amend-ment.    A majority of the Group had reluctantly reached theconclusion that the industrial consequences of delay and the politicalrisks of proceeding under the Parliament Acts made it necessaryto adopt the second option.    He himself was one of the minority whohad favoured the first option.    The second option would mean asking the Commons to agree to Lords amendments excluding the ship-repairing companies.    The reaction of Government supporters would be hostile, and they were likely to vote against these amendments while Ministers had to vote in the same lobby as the conservatives.    The Bill had been found hybrid on the most trivialgrounds, quite different from those raised in the House of commons at an earlier stage.    The Examiners had set aside the rulings oftwo Speakers of the House of Commons, and if the government accepted their conclusions, future legislation might be affectedunless the Government could take steps to rectify the situation.The industrial difficulties in the aircraft and shipbuilding industries were great, but the Parliamentary difficulties of a deal with theOpposition would also be very great, and the Cabinet should considervery carefully before deciding to seek such a deal.THE MINISTER OF STATE, DEPARTMENT OF INDUSTRY, saidthat he would agree with the Lord President of the Council if it was completely certain that the Bill would go through at the end of the session in its present form;  the industries would just be able to manage until then.    But the Parliamentary situation was uncertain,and although the use of the Parliament Acts did not require the Billto come back to the Commons later in the Session, there could beno confidence that the advice given to the Speaker on any attemptmade at that stage to secure further consideration in the commons would be of a kind helpful to the Government.    The conclusion reached by the Examiners was not open to challenge, and he reluctantlyfavoured seeking a deal with the Opposition, ridding the Bill ofhybridity by leaving out shiprepairing.    Any such deal should besubject to two firm conditions:  that the only amendments to be made
should be those excluding shiprepairing companies;  and that theOpposition gave cast-iron guarantees in both Houses that thepassage of the Bill with these amendments would be expedited.The Confederation of Shipbuilding and Engineering Unions (CSEU)saw the industrial considerations as more important than thepolitical ones, and had said they would back the Government eitherway.    Mr Bailey of Bristol Channel Ship Repairers would have atriumph, and it would be important to consult the parliamentary labour Party (PLP), perhaps through the Industry Group and thosewho sat on the Standing Committee on this Bill, and also to reaffirmthe Governments commitment to the nationalisation of shiprepairing.In discussion of whether to seek a deal with the Opposition, it was argued that the political reasons against doing so were overwhelming.Such a deal would be bitterly resented in the PLP and would have avery bad effect on morale, especially when combined with theconclusion which had just been reached on the Scotland and WalesBill.    The Government had decided in the Autumn not to give wayon shiprepairing because their supporters would not have stood for it, and it would be very damaging for the Government to seek a dealwith the Opposition unless they could carry the PLP with them.Under the Parliament Acts it seemed clear that the Bill could been acted in its present form at the end of the Session.    more generally if the Government became a minority one it was better tofight for policies in which they believed than to avoid issues on whichthey might be defeated.     In favour of seeking a deal it was argued that the industrial considerations were more important than thepolitical ones, and pointed strongly to getting the Bill passed assoon as possible.    Further delay and uncertainty would involve serious risks of further damage to the prospects of both industries,with adverse effects on employment, exports and new projects.These risks should not be taken.    Moreover, the possibility couldnot entirely be excluded,of loaing the whole Bill at the end of the session.    There were indications that members of the PLP were coming to the view that the better course would be to obtain thegreater part of the Bill now.In discussion of the timing of the next steps and the nature of thediscussions with the PLP, differing views were expressed on whether the Cabinet should first decide to seek a deal and theninform the PLP of this decision before starting negotiations with theOpposition; or whether there should be consultations with the PLPbefore any final decision on seeking a deal.    It was pointed out thattime was short, in that the Standing Orders Committee of the Houseof Lords had recommended that notices should be placed in the Presson Friday, 4 March, informing those affected of their right topetition against the Bill;  it was not clear procedurally what theposition would be if no such notices appeared.    The Minister ofState, Department of Industry was about to announce the Government&apos;decision to establish an intervention fund of  65 million to help the shipbuilding industry, and this would help to create the rightatmosphere for the discussions with the PLP.5
THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that themajority of the Cabinet took the view that the better course was todecide now to seek a deal with the Opposition, subject to the twofirm conditions specified by the Minister of State, Department ofIndustry.    The Minister of State, in consultation with the chief whip, should arrange to inform Members of the backbench IndustryGroup and those who had sat on the Standing Committee on the bill of this intention on Monday.    The necessary approach should thenbe made by the Lord Privy Seal to the Opposition, in the House ofLords in the first instance.     The Lord Privy Seal should informthe Lord President of the Council when this had been done so thatany necessary approach could be made to the Opposition in the commons.    The results of these approaches should then be reportedto the meeting of the Parliamentary Labour Party on 3 March.The Lord President of the Council should prepare a paper on how thegeneral question of hybridity might be pursued, for considerationby the Cabinet or the appropriate Ministerial Committee.The Cabinet -2.       Took note, with approval, of the summing up of their discussion by the Prime Minister,and invited the Ministers concerned to proceed accordingly.6
FOREIGNAFFAIRSRhodesiaPreviousReference:CM(77) 6thConclusions,Minute 22. THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY reporting on the talks in Washington said that the Americans shared our generalscepticism about the intentions of Mr. Smith and the South AfricanPrime Minister, Mr, Vorster.    A trilateral meeting had been heldon 23 February with Mr Botha, the South African Ambassador to washington, but nothing substantial had come out of it.    We were nowhaving further bilateral talks with the Americans, in the light of whichwe would need to consider carefully whether to take up the South Africanproposal for higher level trilateral talks.    No decision had yet beentaken on this.    Meanwhile, we were doing our best to reassure the african Presidents and others about the nature of the talks with theSouth Africans.u gandaPreviousReference:CM(77) 6thConclusions,Minute 2THE FOREIGN AND COMMONWEALTH SECRETARY said that therewas little doubt that the story that Archbishop Luwum and hiscompanions had been killed in a car accident was a cover up.    Oursense of outrage had been publicly expressed and we were now trying to bring the matter up in the United Nations Commission on human rights.    We were faced with a filibuster by the Philippines, Cubansand others which had so far prevented us from getting the subject onto the agenda, but we were continuing to press our request.    Asregards the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting, his ownbelief was that President Amin would not, in the event, leave his country.    But it was necessary to make dispositions in advance against all contingencies and he was in contact with the Home Secretary on thequestion of President Amin&apos;s right of entry into the United Kingdom.Delicate issues were involved and he had spoken to the Shadow foreign and Commonwealth Secretary about the handling of them in Parliament.It would be necessary to play the matter very much by ear.    But he wasimpressed by the advice he had received that if a decision had to bemade among all members of the Commonwealth on the question of preventing President Amin&apos;s attendance, we would be likely to find ourselves in a small minority.The Cabinet -Took note of the statements by the Foreign and commonwealth Secretary.7k
PUBLICEX   SNDITUREEXERCISE 1977:ECONOMICBACKGROUNDIn discussion it was argued that the Cabinet should devote more time than was possible at the present meeting to considering the implications of the Chancellor&apos;s proposals.    Public expenditure was being sharplyreduced in 1977-78 and 1978-79, and the Government would not wish to approach the next election with plans which meant that future public spending would grow less rapidly than the economy in order to increasepersonal consumption.    Against this it was argued that in consideringthe increase in personal consumption, a distinction had to be drawn between what was privately financed (from take-home pay) and what waspublicly financed (from social security and other benefits).    At presentthe gap between social security benefits and low pay was dangerouslysmall, and that was fuelling a backlash against the welfare state.Since there was to be no change in the statutory basis on which benefitswere increased annually, that gap would narrow for a further year if asatisfactory Stage 3 pay policy was negotiated.    It therefore becameimportant to leave room at least to revalorise tax allowances year by year, and if possible to reduce the income tax burden in real terms.There was a balance to be struck in the allocation of additional resources flowing from economic growth.    Some  5-6 billion a year would be needed up to about 1985 to service and repay the existing levelof overseas debt.    After that, and other prior claims, such as invest-ment, had been met, it would be a matter of judgment how far to allow a reduction of income tax and how far a modest increase in public expenditure.3. The Cabinet had hetiore them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (CP(77) 21), covering a note by theTreasury, on the economic background, and a proposed approach,to the 1977 Public Expenditure Survey.THE CHANCELLOR OF THE EXCHEQUER said that his paper set outthe broad picture and put forward what in his view were sensibleproposals on which to plan public expenditure from 1979-80 onwards.He hoped and believed it would be possible to avoid emergencypackages of expenditure cuts, and to resume a modest real growth in public expenditure of some 2 per cent a year from 1979-80 on.    this could only be achieved if the Government adhered to their counter-inflation strategy and their industrial strategy.    He emphasised thathis proposals were only a basis upon which planning should proceed,and that there would be time at later stages to consider the matter further.    The underlying assumption was that Gross domestic product would increase by 3f per cent per annum from 1979-80, andthis assumption itself postulated an improvement in the United Kingdom&apos;industrial performance.    It would be vital to avoid any resurgence of inflation, and since it would not be possible over future years to rely upon as tight a wages policy as had been achieved in the last year or so,it would be necessary to rely upon tax reductions to achieve increases in take-hoine pay without adding to iaduja trial cost.    Ho hoped to makea *tart by including t&amp;jc reductions in his forthcoming Budget;  but inthft later yaars, if public expenditure was to bp.allowed to grow at psr coat, there would be no room for continuing cuts in. income tax.unless economic growth of 3f per cent was in &amp;a.ct achieved.
In continuing discussion it was maintained that the proposal toincrease public expenditure from 1979-80 on at an annual rate of2 per cent a year implied a reduction in public expenditure in 1979-80itself which had not yet been agreed and which would be unacceptable.In the absence of a medium term economic assessment including anestimate of what unemployment might be in 1979-80, it was verydifficult for Cabinet to take decisions on what the expenditure levelshould be.    It would be wrong to settle, without a full-scale debate in cabinet, cuts in public expenditure to transfer resources to private consumption.    The figures for 1979-80 and later years in Part II of cmnd 6721 did not make allowance for the continuing cost of existing policies in all programmes.    On the other hand, it was recognisedthat 1979-80 would be a difficult transitional year.    The Cabinet, bytheir decisions to reduce public expenditure in 1977-78 and 1978-79,but without carrying the effect of these into later years, had left a suddenrise of some 4 per cent (perhaps as much as 6 per cent if nationalised industry refinancing were included) in the figures between 1978-79 and1979-80;  and the problem was how to adjust this so as to make itconsistent with the proposed steady increase in public expenditure in later years.    It was emphasised that what was involved was no morethan cuts in programmed expenditure, not cuts in actual expenditure,which would, on the Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s proposals rise by per cent a year from 1979-80.In further discussion it was argued that too little account was taken,particularly when additional expenditure to reduce unemployment wasunder consideration, of the net as opposed to the gross cost of that expenditure.    However, it was maintained that in recent discussions of proposed additions full allowance had been made for such offsetting savings, including reductions in the cost of eg. unemployment benefit.THE PRIME MINISTER, summing up the discussion, said that what theChancellor of the Exchequer had proposed was a first step in theprocedure for mounting the 1977 Public Expenditure Survey.    decisions had already been taken on the level of expenditure in 1977-78 and1978-79.   The Cabinet were now embarking on a planning exercise for1979-80 and later years.    The Chancellor of the Exchequer&apos;s paperset out the economic background, and although this had been subject tosome challenge, there was general agreement in Cabinet that it wouldbe wise for the time being to plan on the assumption of an increase ofZ per cent a year in public expenditure in 1980-81 and 1981-82,    Therewould be opportunity to argue for higher figures later if Ministers wishedto do so,    1979-80 was an awkward transitional year, and the assumedlevel of expenditure in it would need to be considered further whenCabinet looked at a joint Treasury/Central Policy Review Staff paper on priorities and the draft guidelines for the survey.    These papersmight provide Ministers with some indication of the meaning inprogramme terms of the proposed 2 per cent increase in 1979-80 andpossibly with options for alternative guidelines.
The Cabinet -1.    Took note, with approval, of the PrimeMinister&apos;s summing up of their discussion.2.    Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer toarrange for the circulation of a joint paper bythe Treasury and the Central Policy Review Staffon priorities and of draft guidelines for the 1977Public Expenditure Survey taking account of theCabinet&apos;s discussion.Cabinet Office24 February 197710
