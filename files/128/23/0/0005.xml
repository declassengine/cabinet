Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for handling theBusiness in the remaining stages of the Debate on the Address, which would beHouse of concluded on 13th November. They agreed that the Secretary ofCommons. State for the Colonies should reply to the Debate that evening, andthat the Government spokesmen on the following day should be theMinister of Food and the President of the Board of Trade. On 12thNovember, when it was expected that the Speaker would call theOpposition amendment regarding steel and road transport, theGovernment spokesmen would be the Minister of Supply and theHome Secretary. On 13th November, when the second Oppositionamendment would be debated, the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the Minister of Health would speak on behalf of theGovernment.The Cabinet were also informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons during the remainder of the following week.The proposed debate on foreign affairs was likely to be held in theweek beginning 19th November, and would probably last for two days.The Cabinet reviewed the proposal for a long Christmas Recess.It now seemed unlikely that Parliament would be able to finish before7th December the business which must be completed before christmas; and it seemed expedient that the Government should go some way to forestall the objections which the Opposition were likelyto raise to a proposal for an exceptionally long Christmas Recess.The Cabinet therefore agreed that it should be announced, early in the debate on 13th November, that it was the Government^ present intention that Parliament should be adjourned from 7th Decemberuntil the end of January.Judges&apos;Salaries. 2. The Cabinet were informed that the Legislation Committeehad considered the draft of a Judicial Offices (Salaries, &amp;c.) Bill, whichwould increase the salaries of County Court Judges, metropolitan magistrates and certain other judicial officers. The proposals in this bill had been put forward by the previous Government and welcomed by the other political Parties; and the Legislation Committee recom-mended that the Bill should be introduced forthwith.The Prime Minister said that, as this was a non-controversialmeasure, it might go forward at once. He hoped, however, that theLord Chancellor would examine the possibility of granting some formof expense allowance to Judges of the High Court. This proposal,if it were found feasible, might be put forward when Parliament metagain after the Christmas Recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Judicial Offices (Salaries, &amp;c.) Bill should beintroduced into Parliament forthwith, in the formapproved by the Legislation Committee.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to consider, in consultation withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer, whether some form of allowance should not be granted to Judges of the HighCourt.Malaya. 3.   The Prime Minister said that he was disturbed at the high(Previous        cost of our military commitments in Malaya.   He suggested that the reference:      Secretary of State for the Colonies, before he left for Malaya on 26thC.C. (51) 1st     November, should submit to the Cabinet an appreciation of theConclusions,    present position and his proposals for remedying it.Minute 8.)The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to submit fortheir consideration a memorandum on Malaya.
iron and Steel 4.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theindustry. Cabinet (C. (51) 8) covering a draft of a direction which the Minister(Previous of Supply proposed to issue to the Iron and Steel Corporation. the reference: purpose of this direction was to instruct the Corporation not to takeC.C. (5i)4th any action, without the Ministers consent, which would alter theConclusions, management or financial structure of any company under their minute 6.) control, or might prejudicially affect the transfer of such a company to private ownership.In discussion the question was raised whether the Minister had power under the Iron and Steel Act, 1948, to issue a direction whichin effect instructed the Corporation not to carry out duties which were laid upon them by the Act. It would be most unfortunate if, afterthe issue of the direction, doubt were cast upon the competence ofthe Minister to make it.The Minister of Supply said that as required by law he had shown the draft of the direction to the Iron and Steel Corporation, who had offered no comment upon it.The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Supply to issue a direction to theIron and Steel Corporation in the terms of the draft annexed to C. (51) 8, provided that the Law Officers (who should beasked to consult with the Lord Chancellor) confirmed thatit was within his statutory powers to issue it.The Festival of 5. The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had askedBritain and the the Minister of Works to take general responsibility for the windingFestival up of the Festival of Britain and for the future of the Festival Gardens.Gardens. He had asked the Minister to work in close consultation on this withthe Minister of Housing and Local Government, particularly inrelation to questions affecting the future of the South Bank site. ThePrime Minister said that an urgent decision was required on the futureof the Festival Gardens.The Minister of Works explained that the Lord Privy Seal wasunder an obligation to make an order appointing 11th November(being six months after the opening of the Gardens) as the date fortheir formal closing. If the law remained unchanged, the Minister of housing and Local Government would thereafter make an ordersetting a date for the completion of reinstatement of Battersea Park.Immediate legislation would therefore be required if the Gardens wereto be continued.The Minister of Works handed round a memorandum (subse-quently circulated as C. (51) 10) setting out estimates of the profitswhich might accrue if the Festival Gardens were kept open for afurther period. He would propose that in future years the Gardensshould be open only from 2-30 p.m. to 10-30 p.m., which wouldmake it possible to employ one shift only, and that the Fun Fairshould be closed on Sundays. On that basis, and on the conservative estimate that the numbers visiting the Gardens would be only halfof the figure for the 1951 season, there might be a net profit of  360,000over the next two years, after taking account of further capitalexpenditure of  150,000. On the same basis, continued operation for five years would wipe out the total indebtedness of  1,162,000. he believed that there was a continuing demand for a pleasure resort. of this kind in London, since it was estimated that 70 per cent, of thevisitors in the 1951 season had been Londoners. The London CountyCouncil were willing to see the Festival Gardens continued for afurther term of five years, subject to their being consulted on their further continuance after an initial experimental period of two years.Local opinion in Battersea was believed to be somewhat divided, butthere was not likely to be serious objection to the continuance of the
Gardens. The Minister hoped that no difficulty would be felt in approving the further capital expenditure of  150,000 contemplated,since very little of this would be spent on scarce building materials and the management of the Gardens did not propose to spend morethan  1,000 on any one project. If the Gardens were continued hewould take steps to ensure continuity of efficient management.The Minister of Works recommended that legislation should beintroduced enabling the Festival Gardens to be continued for a periodof five years, subject to the Governments being empowered to closethem after the first two years of this period should they and the L.C.C.so desire.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he supported theproposal made by the Minister of. Works. On the basis of the attendance given in the estimates (which he thought might well be exceeded) the initial return to the Exchequer in the first two years would be only  52,000, since the share of the initial loss to be borneby the London County Council was limited by agreement to.  40,000.But if attendances reached two-thirds of this year&apos;s figure, the returnto the Exchequer in the first two years would be as much as  472,000.From his point of view he believed that the balance of advantage wasin favour of keeping the Gardens open.The President of the Board of Trade also supported the proposalsince he was advised that the Gardens might continue to provide someattraction to visitors from abroad.Discussion then turned on the question whether it would be wise to proceed, at a time of great economic stringency, with what was apure amenity unless Parliamentary opinion had freely endorsed it.It was suggested that it might be well on this account to allow a free vote of the House of Commons on a Motion approving the con-tinuance of the Festival Gardens, though if such a vote were favour-able the subsequent legislation would be handled as ordinary Govern-ment business. On the other hand, it was argued that a free voteshould not be allowed on a proposal which was mainly financial in character. It was the general view of the Cabinet that this was nota matter which could properly be left to a free vote of the House.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Works to announce forthwith that theGovernment had decided to provide for the FestivalGardens to be continued for a period of five years, subjectto a provision enabling the Gardens to be closed after an experimental period consisting of the first two of these years,(2) Invited the Minister of Works to prepare the necessary legis-lation for introduction in Parliament after submission tothe Legislation Committee.6. The Prime Minister said that he had discussed with the Chiefsof Staff their latest proposals regarding the organisation of the middle east Command, which it was desired to form following the admissionof Greece and Turkey to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Turks were most reluctant to join any command structure whichwould be confined to the Middle East and placed under a british commander. They were anxious to be included within general eisenhower&apos;s European Command, partly because this would implyrecognition of their claim to be a European country and partly because it would give them a better assurance of receiving military equipment from the United States. In these circumstances the Chiefs of staff had formulated new proposals for the establishment of a supreme allied Command for the Eastern Mediterranean and Middle East,which would be divided into four sub-commands, namely, Greece,Turkey, the Mediterranean and ^aegean, and the Middle East.
The Prime Minister said that he was doubtful whether this plan would prove acceptable to the other Governments concerned. Afterconsultation with the Chiefs of Staff, however, he had accepted theForeign Secretary&apos;s suggestion that it should be put forward as a basis for further discussion by the Standing Group in Washington. Theimportant objective, which must be kept in mind throughout all these discussions, was to secure that the United States should commit someforces, even token forces, to the defence of the Middle East.The Cabinet took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.Persia. 7.   The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel(Previous        and Power said that at the Prime Ministers request he had examinedReference:      the latest American proposals for a settlement of the Anglo-PersianC.C. (51) 1st     oil dispute, which the United States Secretary of State had put to theConclusions,    Foreign Secretary in Paris.  These had been formulated after discus-Minute 7.)       sions with the Persian Prime Minister in Washington; but it was farfrom clear that he would accept them, even if we were willing to take them as a basis for renewed negotiations. In fact, however, they were quite unacceptable to us; for they would provide a wholly inadequatefinancial return on the capital which we had invested in Persia, andthey contained no assurance that the refinery at Abadan would be operated by British technicians. Alternative proposals had therefore been formulated for discussion with Mr. Acheson in Paris.  these were based on the principle that United States oil companies should join with us in operating the refinery at Abadan and should, in return,give us some share in the operation of their oil concessions inSaudi-Arabia.In discussion there was general agreement that the latestAmerican proposals could not be accepted as a basis for renewednegotiations with the Persian Government.Cabinet Office, SWA,Sth November, 1951.
