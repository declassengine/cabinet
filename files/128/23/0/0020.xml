Malaya.(previous reference :C.C. (51) 10thConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (51) 59) covering his report on his visit to Malaya.The Colonial Secretary gave the Cabinet a short account of the impressions which he had formed as a result of his visit and described the steps which he was taking to find suitable persons to fill the vitalposts of High Commissioner and Commissioner of Police.In discussion there was general support for the colonial secretary&apos;s approach to the problem of restoring order in Malaya.The Cabinet  .Appointed a Committee consisting of the Lord Privy Seal,the Home Secretary, the Colonial Secretary, the Ministerof Housing and Local Government and the Chancellor ofthe Duchy of Lancaster to consider the Colonial Secretary&apos;sreport in detail and to frame specific proposals for approval by the Cabinet in the second half of January.Prime 2.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the arrange-Minister&apos;s ments made for his forthcoming visit to Washington and Ottawa.Visit to The Foreign Secretary, who would not be accompanying him to washington     Ottawa, was expected to return to London on 13th January.   Theand Ottawa.     Prime Minister himself hoped to be back in this country by20th January.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said, with reference to the cabinet&apos;s discussion of 11th December (C.C. (51) 16th Conclusions,Minute 7), that soon after the Prime Ministers departure forWashington an announcement would be made regarding the financial aid to be made available to this country by the United States Govern-ment under their Mutual Security Act during the current American* fiscal year.    This would amount to $300 million; but, under theprovisions of the Act, 10 per cent, of this would be granted as a loanon which no interest would be payable for the first four years. It was satisfactory that this matter would have been settled before the PrimeMinister reached Washington.investment programme.Civil investment in 1952 and theHousingProgramme.(previous reference:C.C.(51) 19thConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the following memoranda on civil investment in 1952:  C. (51) 45: a note by the Chancellor of the exchequer covering a report on the investment programme prepared by officials at the request of the Sub-Committee of the economic policy Committee;C. (51) 52: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer com-menting on the proposals in the officials&apos; report;C. (51) 43: by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment on the effect of these proposals on the housing programme and the building industry.C. (51) 44: by the Minister of Housing and Local Govern-ment on the provision, within the approved housing programme,of houses urgently required by other Government Departments.Investment The Cabinet first considered those aspects of the proposals forother than reductions in civil investment in 1952 made in C. (51) 52 and inon Housing. C. (51) 45 which did not concern the housing programme. the broad consequences of the recommendations before the Cabinet were that building work, excluding housing, would be set at approximately the same level in 1952 as in 1950; and that reductions would be madein the programme approved by the previous Government for essentialbasic industries, such as fuel and power and railways; for manu-facturing industry (which would bear the main weight of the41813-1 B 2
reductions); for public services, such as water and sewerage, educa-tion and the health services; and for miscellaneous buildings for social and trading purposes.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, while theCabinet might approve reductions in the investment programmebroadly of the size and character proposed in C. (51) 45, he should in the near future discuss the details of the revised programme withthose of his colleagues who might feel difficulty about particularaspects of it, with a view to reaching such agreed adjustments as might be practicable. In so doing he would have regard tosuggestions which had been made for mitigating the reductions pro-posed in relation to electricity generation, rural electrification andother more important forms of investment at the cost, if necessary,of greater reductions in the less important parts of the programme.As regards electricity generation, the Cabinet asked that every effort should be made to achieve the greatest possible capacity, with theallocation of money and materials available, by improvisation andsimplification in the construction of generating stations.The Cabinet (1) Approved reductions broadly of the size and character pro-posed in C. (51) 45 in the level of investment in 1952 indirections other than housing; and invited the Chancellorof the Exchequer to examine those reductions in detail with the Ministers concerned with a view to making such adjustments as might appear practicable.As regards housing, the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that since the Cabinefs meeting on 20th December he had discussed theprogramme with the Ministers concerned. He thought that the objective of a rate of construction of 300,000 houses a year couldbe achieved in three years&apos; time, but that further study of the impli-cations of accepting this aim might be undertaken by a group of officials under the chairmanship of the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster. He was willing to accept the immediate aim of completing230,000 houses in 1952 subject to three stipulations, viz.: (i) that thelabour force engaged on house building should not be increased aboveits present level; (ii) that no increase should be made in the amountof steel allocated for house building unless we were successful inobtaining a substantial alleviation of the present shortage throughsupplies from the United States; and (iii) that the provision ofsoftwoods costing dollars, which would have to be increased in thelatter part of 1952, should not go beyond a level to be determinedlater by the Cabinet after the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancasterhad studied this aspect of the programme.The Minister of Housing and Local Government expressed agree-ment with the proposals made by the Chancellor of the Exchequer,but asked that the Cabinet should decide forthwith though no announcement should be made until it became necessary that it was their policy to reach a level of production of 300,000 houses a year as rapidly as possible, having regard to the limited resources of man-power and materials which could be made available; and that theyshould endorse his provisional aims of completing 230,000 houses in 1952 and 260,000 houses in 1953. These figures should be regardedas objectives, to be improved upon if possible, and not as limits.The Cabinet (2) Endorsed the objective of completing 300,000 houses a year as rapidly as possible, having regard to the resources avail-able; and . endorsed a provisional aim. of completing230,000 houses in 1952 and 260,000 houses in 1953 withoutat present increasing the labour force employed or theallocation of steel.

The Foreign Secretary said that, partly as a result of sugges-(Previous tions by the Canadian Government, further changes had been made reference: in the form of the warning statements which were to be issued if anC.C.

The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerindustry.        of Health (C. (5.1) 56) reporting the progress made by the Steel Com-(Previous        mittee in preparing a plan for returning the iron and steel industryReference:      to private enterprise.   It was the view of the Committee that theC.C. (51) 6th    Bill, which was in preparation, should include provision for windingConclusions,    up the Iron and Steel Corporation; for transferring ownership ofMinute5.)       the steel companies to a Realisation and Management Agency; andfor the supervision of prices and development in the industry by aBoard including independent members as Well as representatives ofthe industry, of trade unions and-of consumers.   The Committee&apos;sproposals would be acceptable to the Iron and Steel Federation.The Colonial Secretary doubted whether it would be expedient to give the Minister wide powers to carry out schemes of develop-ment at public expense. Would it not be preferable to rely for thison special legislation which would be introduced only if the need arose for the Government to participate directly in the industry? TheCabinet were, however, informed that the Steel Committee contem-plated such public intervention only in the case of developments whichwere required on strategic or social grounds and could not reasonably be undertaken by private investors on a commercial basis.Attention was drawn to the bearing which the Workers&apos; Charterissued by the Conservative Party might have on the arrangementsfor the return of the, industry. to private enterprise. The Minister ofSupply said that he had already opened discussions with the Ironartd Steel Federation on certain matters of this kind: he would pursuethese further and consult with the Steel Committee upon them.The Cabinet  .:*   (1) Took note of the Interim: Report of the Steel Committee(C. (51) 56). &apos;(2) Invited the Steel Committee to consider further with theColonial Secretary the point which he had raised in thediscussion regarding development , and; expansion inthe industry.Road and Rail        6.   In connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingTransport.       Minute the Cabinet considered the timing of legislation on road and rail transport. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power, in consultation with other Ministers concerned, was now examining a scheme of reorganisation which involved more(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster to examinewith officials concerned the implications of adopting this programme, particularly on the requirements of scarcematerials; and to report to the Cabinet on the extent towhich imports of softwoods would have to be increased and on any other matters which he might wish to bring totheir attention.   .(4) Approved the proposals in C. (51) 44 for building, within the approved housing programme, houses required to meetthe urgent needs of other Government Departments.
radical changes in the road haulage industry than had previously been contemplated and a new approach to the financial problems andrelationships of road and rail transport. A scheme of this characterwas much to be preferred to lesser measures affecting only part ofthe road haulage industry, but it would require careful study,especially in its financial aspects, and it could not be cast in the formof a Bill in a few weeks. On the other hand, to delay reform of thetransport industry until a later session would be damaging to theefficiency of the industry, to the morale of these engaged in it andto the credit of the Government. It now seemed likely that an Ironand Steel Bill could be introduced soon after Parliament reassembledand might be passed before the Summer Recess. It would thereforesuffice if a Transport Bill were to receive its Second Reading in theearly summer and were passed through its later stages after the summer Recess. On this basis the Government could take longertime to study the plan for transport.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Prime Minister to appoint a Cabinet Committeeto examine proposals for the reorganisation of road and rail transport.(2) Agreed that this Committee should prepare legislative pro-posals for introduction and Second Reading in the Houseof Commons in the early summer, with a view to their passage through their remaining stages after the summer recess.Food Imports. 7.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president and the Minister of Food (C. (51) 60) on food imports in1952.The Lord President said that the Government must set them-selves to make more food available as quickly as possible, even though this meant some increase in overseas expenditure. Paragraph 7 ofthe memorandum indicated some of the directions in which increased supplies might be sought, and the measure of the cost involved.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the various proposals outlined in paragraph 7 of the memorandum, taken together, would go a long way towards cancelling the savings on overseas expenditurej- which were to be secured by the cuts in food imports which theGovernment had authorised soon after they took office. In view of- the continuing deterioration in the balance of payments he could not contemplate so large an increase in overseas expenditure at this stage.He was, however, willing that meat offals should be. bought in the sterling area, without any financial limit, and from the Argentinesubject to a financial limit which could be settled in consultation between himself and the Minister of Food. He would also be readyto support the Minister of Food in an attempt to end the rationing of cheese and eggs. As regards animal feeding-stuffs he saw no prospect of doing more than maintaining the existing ration: even to do this an additional  15 million in dollars would have to be spent in the current year.The Prime Minister said that all practicable steps should betaken to increase the pig population in this country.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, together with the Minister ofFood and the Agriculture Ministers, to consult with theChancellor of the Exchequer regarding the measures whichcould be taken to increase food supplies in 1952, and tosubmit a plan of action for approval by the Cabinet towardsthe end of January.
8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (51) 57) to which was annexed ageneral account of the sterling balances prepared in accordance withthe Cabinefs decision of 1st November.The Cabinet-Took note of the statement on the sterling balances annexed to C. (51) 57.9. In his covering note to the memorandum on sterling balances(C. (51) 57) the Chancellor of the Exchequer invited the Cabinet toagree that he should not withhold from Egypt the sterling releasesfor which she was expected to ask on 1st January, 1952, under theAgreement made earlier in the year. Denunciation Of the agreement would be a serious economic sanction. If we were to embark oneconomic sanctions against Egypt, we should do so with a full appre-ciation of what was involved and with a determination to make them as complete and as powerful as possible. But the Cabinet had on 7th December decided against imposing economic sanctions against egypt, and that still appeared to be the right decision. The with-holding of sterling releases might moreover provoke retaliation against the Lancashire cotton industry by the withholding of rawmaterials. It might also have an adverse effect on world confidence in sterling and would be an unfortunate prelude to the meeting of commonwealth Finance Ministers.On the other hand it was pointed out that financial pressure wasone of the few weapons in our hands in dealing with the egyptian government. It was most distasteful, at a time when they haddenounced the 1936 Treaty and were encouraging activities in the canal Zone which did not fall far short of war, to make available tothem sterling resources which they had built up during the last warand to which they had little claim in equity. If we withheld the sterling releases we could indicate that a later change in our attitude would depend on a change in theirs.The Foreign Secretary drew attention to the wording of the sterling Releases Agreement, which did not refer to any specific date in 1952 but to releases to be made &quot; in each of the years 1952 to 1960.&quot;It might be possible to withhold payment at the beginning of 1952, onthe footing that this involved neither breach nor denunciation of the;Agreement, and to indicate privately to the Egyptian Governmentthat our ability to make the agreed releases in the course of 1952would be governed by future developments in the relations betweenthe two countries. If this were to be done, we should take no initiative-tive to give publicity to the deferment of the releases, in order ifpossible to avoid provoking the Egyptians into retaliation.Mention was also made of the Sterling Payments Agreement,providing for trade between Egypt and the sterling area and for theuse of sterling by Egypt outside the sterling area. This agreement would expire on 31st December, 1951, and the Egyptians had sought to open discussions on the arrangements which should replace it.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it would be possible toplace new restrictions on the use made by Egypt of the sterlingaccruing to her from current trade; but, if such restrictions wereenforced, this also would amount to an economic sanction and wouldbe open to similar objections to those applying to denunciation of the sterling Releases Agreement. He agreed that in the case of the sterling Payments Agreement it would be best to keep the Egyptiansin uncertainty by delay in discussing new arrangements with them.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, if after further consultation with the Foreign Secretary it appearedpracticable to do so, to defer for the time being any releaseof Egyptian sterling balances on the ground that the sterling Releases Agreement provided for releases, noton any named date, but in each of the years 1952 to 1960.
(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United states ambassador in London privately of the attitude which wewere adopting towards the release of Egyptian sterling balances.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to delay for the timebeing the settlement of any fresh arrangements to replace the Sterling Payments Agreement with Egypt.The Foreign Secretary invited the attention of the Cabinet to therecent appointments by King Farouk of Hafiz Afifi Pasha to be Chiefof the Royal Cabinet and of Abdel Fattah Amr Pasha to be adviser on Foreign Affairs attached to the Royal Cabinet. Both were welldisposed towards us, and these appointments were therefore an encouraging sign, even though there were still considerable disturbance-bances in Egypt. The Foreign Secretary had asked His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Cairo to ascertain privately how we could best help the King to diminish tension, perhaps by such measures as the avoidance of public statements on both sides.The Cabinet (4) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Migration 10.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-Policy, wealth Secretary (C. (51) 58) seeking authority (i) to negotiate release from our obligation to pay up to  500,000 a year under the assisted passage Agreement with Australia, and (ii) to introduce legislationextending the Empire Settlement Acts until 1957. They also had before them a memorandum by the Minister of Labour (C. (51) 61)on the impact of Australian migration policy on the supply of skilledman-power in the United Kingdom.The Minister of Labour said that, so long as we made some con-tribution towards the cost of assisted passages to Australia, we had some power to influence the choice of emigrants and to restrain theAustralian Government from taking an undue proportion of skilled workers whose services were urgently required in this country. Hewould not, however, oppose the Commonwealth Secretary&apos;s proposalif he could be assured that the Australian Government could be persuaded by other means to act reasonably in their selection of emigrants.In further discussion it was suggested that the United Kingdom&quot;., Government should convene at an early date a conference withrepresentatives of the Commonwealth Governments principally con-cerned with a view to formulating a considered policy on migrationwithin the Commonwealth.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary to open negotia-tions with the Australian Government with a view to securing our release from the Assisted Passage Agreementwith Australia, on the understanding that satisfactory- arrangements would be made to ensure that assistedemigrants from this country to Australia would not include an undue proportion of skilled workers.(2) Agreed that legislation extending the Empire Settlement Acts, until 1957 should be passed in the current session, and invited the Commonwealth Secretary to submit a draft Billto the Legislation Committee.The Cabinet. 11.   The Prime Minister said that while he and the foreign secretary were in North America the Minister of Health, as leader of the House of Commons, would preside over . meetings of theCabinet. \Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2%th December, 1951.
