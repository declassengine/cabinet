United States 1.   During the sitting of the Cabinet the Prime Minister sent to aid. Mr. Harriman a message, on the lines agreed at the Cabinefs previous(Previous        meeting, suggesting that the announcement on United States financialReference:      aid to the United Kingdom should be made in the next two or threeC.C. (51) 2lst    days.   He subsequently received a reply indicating that the united conclusions,    States Government would find it impossible to agree that the minute 3.)       announcement should be made forthwith and in advance of theannouncement of the state of the United Kingdom gold and dollar reserves.   They would, however, be willing to hold over theirannouncement until towards the end of January.  In the view of theCabinet this represented an acceptable arrangement, since it was widely known that a decision on financial aid had already been taken.When the announcement came to be made it would be possible toexplain that the decision had been reached before the Prime Ministersvisit and had not formed part of the matters discussed between thePrime Minister and the President.Atomic Energy. 2. The Paymaster-General said that it was desirable to makeSecurity rapid progress with the establishment of amended security arrange-Arrangements. merits in connection with atomic energy in order to improve theprospects of American co-operation and of better exchange of infor-mation. The Permanent Secretary to the Treasury had submitted areport to the Prime Minister on this subject.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of the Home Secretary,the Colonial Secretary, the Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment and the President of the Board of Trade toexamine the report made by the Permanent Secretary tothe Treasury; and to submit their recommendations on it* to the Prime Minister on his arrival in the United States.Egypt        . .       3.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that, in consul-Sterling tation with the Chancellor of the Exchequer, he had examined furtherBalances.        the problems arising out of the Sterling Payments Agreement and the(Previous        Sterling Releases Agreement with Egypt in the light of the CabinefsReference:      discussion on the preceding day.  It was in his view clear that in theC.C. (51) 21st   eyes of the Egyptians the Sterling Payments Agreement which conclusions,    governed current trade was the more important of the two; and the minute 4.)       decision to keep them in uncertainty about the future arrangements to replace it might act as a desirable check on them.   The SterlingReleases Agreement was less important; but it had now been foundthat of the total&apos;of  15 million, for the immediate release of whichthe Egyptians were expected to ask on 1st January,&quot;  5 million couldnot be withheld without breach of the terms of the Agreement.Though the Egyptians would no doubt regard deferment of the pay-ment of the other  10 million as a breach of the spirit of the agreement and of normal practice, we had a valid counter-argument based onthe wording of our obligation to release this sum &quot; in the year 1952 &quot;;and in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s view we should defer the release onthe basis decided by the Cabinet on the preceding day. If, however,we also deferred release of the  5 million, we should have no answer to the contention that because of the denunciation of the 1936 Treatywe were on our side breaking or at any rate failing to carry out the sterling Releases Agreement.  He felt on balance that we should not do this, since it might mar the prospects which he had mentioned tothe Cabinet on the preceding day of an improvement in the situation.The Cabinet re-affirmed the view that the settlement of any firmarrangements to replace the Sterling Payments Agreement with egypt should be delayed, and that the release at any rate of the  10 million
under the Sterling Releases Agreement should also be delayed. Dis-cussion turned on the release of the additional sum of  5 million, towhich the Foreign Secretary had referred. On this opinion was divided. On the one hand, it was urged that it would be wrong inprinciple to do anything to assist a Government which had denouncedits Treaty obligations towards us and which was involved in hostileacts towards us. Whatever the legal position, we were under no moral obligation to carry out our undertakings towards a Government whichwas behaving in this way; and to defer fulfilment of our undertakingwould not amount to denunciation of the Agreement. Such a defer-ment need not be expected to have a serious effect on confidence in sterling, since other countries holding sterling would not expect toput themselves into a position comparable with that of Egypt. Onthe other hand, it was felt that to defer payment of the  5 million would, in view of the terms of the Agreement, lay us open to a charge,which we could not rebut, that we were imposing economic sanctions.We ought not to embark on sanctions at all unless we were preparedto wage general economic war against Egypt. We had hitherto con-fined ourselves to entirely defensive action against them. The with-holding of the  5 million would be an act of counter-aggression. Itshould not be assumed, moreover, that there would be no effect on general confidence in sterling.The Chancellor of the Exchequer explained that our obligation under the Sterling Releases Agreement was to transfer the  5 million,if asked to do so, from the Egyptian No. 2 Account to the No. 1Account, which was the Account through which Egypt paid and received sterling arising out of current transactions. As soon as the 5 million became part of the No. 1 Account, it would be subject, inview of the lapsing of the Sterling Payments Agreement on31st December, to a power on our part to control all the uses to whichEgypt could put sterling. We could at any time impose restrictionsof any desired degree of severity on the current sterling transactionscarried out through the Account. He thought it might be possibleto arrange that the Bank of England would consult the Treasurybefore any large operations on the Account were carried out on egyptian instructions.After further discussion the Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their previous decisions not to re-negotiate forthe time being the Sterling Payments Agreement and to delay release of the sum of  10 million under the SterlingReleases Agreement.(2) Approved the transfer, if requested by the Egyptian Govern-ment, of  5 million to the No. 1 Account on 1st January,1952, on the understanding that the uses which Egyptmight make of sterling in that Account would becomesubject to our control and to such restrictions as we mightlater decide to impose.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to keep the position under constant review; to make arrangements to preventabuse by the Egyptians of the facilities accorded to them;and to investigate the possibility of arranging for prior consulation with His Majesty&apos;s Government before any large or unusual withdrawals were made.(4) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to report to thePrime Minister after further consideration of the mattersrecorded in Conclusion (3) above.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,29th December, 1951.
