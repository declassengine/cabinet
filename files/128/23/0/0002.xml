The Cabinet discussed the arrangements for the Debate on business in the. the Address.   The House of Commons would expect that six daysHouse of        should be allotted to this; but, as the Foreign Secretary would haveCommons.      to be in Paris during part of this time, it might be more convenient to offer facilities for a separate debate on foreign affairs after his return, and in that event it might suffice to allot five days to the debate on the Address. The Chancellor of the Exchequer would make a full statement on the economic situation on the second day of the Debate.It had therefore been arranged that the corresponding Debate in theHouse of Lords should be adjourned, after the opening speeches,until 13th November, when they would be able to discuss the situationin the light of the statements on behalf of the Government whichwould by then have been made in the Commons.The Prime Minister said that he had it in mind that, after theconclusion of the Debate on the Address, the House of commons should meet in secret session to discuss the defence situation. this debate might perhaps be held on 15th or 22nd November. A corres-ponding discussion should be held at the same time, in secret session,in the House of Lords.The Cabinet were informed of the legislative and financialbusiness which must be completed before the end of the year. Itwas hoped that it might be possible to dispose of this in time for parliament to be adjourned early in December.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 1stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C. (51) 1) analysing the current economic positionof the United Kingdom and outlining the measures necessary to remedy the situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there had been two meetings of the Committee which the Cabinet had appointed on 30thOctober to assist him in considering this situation, and his memo-randum took account of suggestions which had been made by hiscolleagues on the Committee.In a preliminary discussion of this memorandum the followingpoints were made:  (a) Would the proposed reduction in the building programmemake it impossible to achieve any increase in the number of houses to be completed in .1952? The Minister of Housing and LocalGovernment said that, by concentrating on completing the housesalready in course of construction and preventing more from beingstarted, it should be possible to achieve some increase in the numbersplanned to be completed in 1952. In subsequent years any expansionof the programme would depend on success in exploiting substitutematerials and other improvisations. The main difficulty was theshortage of softwood timber.(b) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there must be some increase in the rate of interest on loans raised by local authori-ties.   Special steps must, however, be taken to ensure that this did
not result in an immediate increase in the rents of local authorityhouses. He was prepared in principle to increase the housing subsidyby an amount sufficient to offset the increased rate of interest on the loans raised by local authorities for housing purposes. He would discuss the details of this arrangement with the Housing Ministers.(c) The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the Coloniesmight be able to give some assistance in this emergency, particularly with sugar and timber. He had instructed his Department to con-sider urgently what contribution the Colonies could make towardsrelieving the situation.(d) Reference was made to the increasing indebtedness of theUnited Kingdom to the Colonies. The Chancellor of the exchequer said that this was part of the general problem of sterling balances,on which he was proposing to submit a memorandum to the Cabinet.(e) Would the proposed suspension of strategic stockpiling havean adverse effect on the defence production programmes? TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that the materials mainly affectedwere food, tobacco, softwood and rubber; that even under his pro-posals about  180 million of these supplies would have been accumu-lated by the end of 1952; and that he doubted whether his proposals would have any direct adverse effect on the defence production programmes.(/) The Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport,Fuel and Power said that he was satisfied that it would be necessaryfor us to buy some foreign coal during the autumn if we were to avertthe risk of a breakdown in supplies during the coming winter. Itshould, however, suffice to import about 1 million tons, at a costof  8 or  9 million. The figure of 4^ million tons, which had been mentioned in earlier conversations, was unnecessarily large and couldnot in any event be obtained in the time now available. The UnitedStates was the only source from which this coal could now be obtained,and it would be necessary to arrange for it to be brought here inUnited States ships,(g) It was proposed in C. (51) 1 that there should be a reductionof  100 million in private imports of unrationed food, including winesand spirits. The Lord President said that he would do his utmost tosecure the total cut in food imports suggested by the Chancellor; buthe asked for discretion to decide, in consultation with the Minister ofFood, which particular imports should be reduced or dispensed with.The detailed proposals submitted by the Treasury included a substan-tial reduction in the importation of canned meats from Europe. Hewas satisfied that, in spite of their high cost, these were being boughtby workers, e.g., for packed mid-day meals; and he would prefer to dispense with other imports which were more clearly in the category of luxuries.(h) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was essentialto secure a substantial reduction in Government expenditure. Thiswould, however, involve some changes of policy, and he needed more time in which to discuss these with the Departmental Ministers con-cerned. He would therefore prefer to confine himself, in the initialstatement to be made in the Debate on the Address, to a broad state-ment of the Government^ firm intention to reduce government expenditure and to refrain at that stage from going into the matter inany detail. He would circulate to his Cabinet colleagues a draft of thestatement which he proposed to make on this point in the Debate.There was general agreement with the Chancellor^ suggestion.The Prime Minister said that the Treasury should call on all Depart-ments to reduce their expenditure, and should suggest specific meansof doing so. In addition, all Ministers in charge of departments should themselves consider what proposals they could make for reducing expenditure. By a combination of both these methods, sub-stantial savings could be secured.(i) Every effort should be made to enlist the support of the TradesUnion Congress for the measures outlined in the Chancellor^
memorandum. No approach could, however, be made to them until after the Chancellor had made his statement to Parliament. ThePrime Minister said that he intended to see representatives of theTrades Union Congress at an early date, and he would take thatopportunity of discussing these matters with them.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet approved in principle the general approach to this problem which was outlined in the Chancellors memorandum (C. (51) 1).Some of the detailed proposals in the memorandum would need to bediscussed further with the Departmental Ministers concerned; and theCabinet itself should have an opportunity of considering the broad outline of the statement which the Chancellor would be making in the debate on the Address. The Cabinet would meet for this purpose on 5th November: meanwhile further consultations should be held between the Ministers principally concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with theLord President and the Minister of Food the detailed pro-posals for reducing the programme of food imports.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss with thePrime Minister, and to circulate to the Cabinet, a draftof the statement which he proposed to make in the debate on the Address regarding reductions in government expenditure.(3) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would sub-mit to the Prime Minister a note on the effect which his proposal to suspend strategic stockpiling was likely tohave on the defence production programmes.(4) Took note that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would indue course submit to the Cabinet a memorandum on thegeneral problem of the sterling balances.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to submit tothe Cabinet a memorandum on any emergency measureswhich the Colonies might take to relieve the current economic difficulties of the United Kingdom.(6) Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (51) 1 at a meeting on 5th November.Cabinet Office, SWA,1st November, 1951.
