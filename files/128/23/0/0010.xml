Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Health reported that the Leader of the liberal party was content that there should be no Liberal on the SelectCommittee which was to consider the problem of parliamentary questions about the nationalised industries. Mr. Clement Davies had undertaken that, when he thought it would be desirable and practi-cable to arrange for Liberal representation on such Committees as this in future, he would inform the Leader of the House.The Cabinet were reminded that the major Bills in the legislative programme for the current session (viz., the Steel Bill, the road haulage Bill and the Monopolies Commission Bill) should be ready for introduction soon ofter Parliament reassembled at the end ofJanuary. The Prime Minister said that he would call for periodical reports on the progress made in the preparation of these Bills.Malaya.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 5thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (51) 26) bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies on the situation in Malaya.The Colonial Secretary drew particular attention to the existingdivision of responsibility between the various British authorities in malaya. One of the primary purposes of his forthcoming visit wasto find means of securing stronger direction and more unified controlof the campaign for restoring law and order. His present bias was infavour of concentrating in the hands of a single individual the powersof Governor-General and Commander-in-Chief. He would not,however, ask the Cabinet to take a final decision on this point until he had been able to see the conditions on the spot.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, while.the police and the military were already under unified command for operationalpurposes, he would favour more radical measures for unified control on the lines suggested by the Colonel Secretary. The situation in malaya would not, in his view, be remedied until the civil administra-tion was strong enough to ensure stable government.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, in adopting a more forceful policy towards the Chinese as recommended in paragraph (b) of C. (51) 26, care should be taken toavoid alienating the sympathies of Chinese communities elsewhere inSouth-East Asia. The Colonial Secretary said that this was largely amatter of timing: it would clearly be inexpedient to take a strongerline with the Chinese in Malaya until we could show that we were ina position to protect them from the bandits.The Cabinet Took note of C. (51) 26; and invited the Colonial Secretaryto submit his further recommendations immediately after his return from his forthcoming visit to Mai ay a.Hong Kong. 3.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum (C. (51) 25) bythe Secretary of State for the Colonies outlining the statement whichhe proposed to make if he were pressed to define the governments intentions towards Hong Kong&apos;during his forthcoming visit to theColony.The Cabinet Authorised the Colonial Secretary to say, if it became necessary for him to make a public statement on this point,that His Majesty&apos;s Government were resolved to maintain their position in Hong Kong, and would discharge to the41492-2 B 2
utmost of their ability their responsibilities towards theColony as regards both defence and the welfare of its population.European Coal        4.   The Home Secretary said that, in his speech at the forth-and Steel        coming meeting of the Consultative Assembly of the Council of community.     Europe, he would be expected to make some favourable reference tothe Schuman Plan for the integration of the coal and steel industries in Europe. He handed to the Cabinet the text of his proposed state-ment on this matter.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It seemed possible that the Treaty would not be ratified by allthe European Governments concerned. In that event the UnitedKingdom Government- would be well-advised to participate in any fresh effort which might be made to find a better solution of this problem.(b) The Schuman Plan was viewed with suspicion by workers inthe coal and steel industries in this country. Simultaneously with theproposed statement in the Council of Europe, the Government shouldmake it clear to public opinion in this country that they had no intention of surrendering to any European authority the control of thecoal and steel industries of the United Kingdom.The Cabinet Authorised the Home Secretary to make the following state-ment at the forthcoming meeting of the consultative assembly of the Council of Europe: &quot;His Majesty&apos;sGovernment recognise that the initiative taken by the FrenchGovernment concerning the creation of a European coal andsteel community and a European defence community is a major step towards European unity. They welcome the schuman Plan as a means of strengthening the economy of western Europe and look forward to its early realisation.They desire to establish the closest possible association withthe European Continental Community at all stages in its development. If the Schuman Plan is ratified. His Majesty&apos;sGovernment will set up a permanent delegation at the seat of the Authority to enter into relations and to transactbusiness with it.&quot;Becbuanaland 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C. (51) 21) by the protectorate. Commonwealth Secretary outlining the policy which he wished toChieftainship of pursue in connection with the chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribe.Bamangwato    This involved three proposals, viz.:  Tribe- (i) That Tshekedi Khama should be allowed to return to theterritory in a few months&apos; time as a private citizen and, if his returncreated no undue disturbance, to remain there on condition that he made no attempt to re-enter political life.(ii) That an attempt should be made to build up RasebolaiKhama as prospective chief.(iii) That Seretse Khama should be permanently excluded fromthe chieftainship and from residence in the territory.The third proposal would not, however, be announced for thetime being. In the first instance the Commonwealth Secretary wouldrely on the existing policy announced in the White Paper (Cmd. 7913)by which Seretse&apos;s return to the territory was excluded for a periodof five years. Any premature announcement that he would never beallowed to return would have an adverse effect on the plans for federation of the Central African territories.
In discussion the point was made that, when the time came tomake the statement reproduced in Annex A of C. (51) 21, the decisions should be presented as decisions of His Majesty&apos;s Government.Discussion showed that the Cabinet were in general agreementwith the proposals put forward in C. (51) 21 and, in particular, withthe proposal for early publication of the reports of the observersreproduced in Annexes C and D of the memorandum. The PrimeMinister said, however, that before any public announcement wasmade he would be glad of an opportunity to go into the proposals inmore detail with the Ministers primarily concerned.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward in C. (51) 21, subject&apos;to their being first examined by a small Committee under thePrime Minister^ Chairmanship comprising the Lord privy seal, the Commonwealth Secretary, the Minister of health and the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the colonial secretary (C. (51) 22) on the balance of payments of the colonial territories. In his paper the Colonial Secretary sought the general support of his colleagues for the following views:  (i) The United Kingdom should recognise the claim of theColonies to a volume of imports adequate to promote progress in development and some improvement in standards of living.(ii) There should be more favourable allocations from theUnited Kingdom of scarce goods, such as steel and tinplate.(iii) The import policies of Colonial Governments should take account of the special position of the Colonial balance of paymentswithin the sterling area balance of payments.(iv) Industry should be encouraged to consider present andfuture needs for consumer goods in the Colonies.The Colonial Secretary said that he did not ask his colleagues totake specific decisions on his paper.It was pointed out that the allocation of steel to the colonies would be considered at a meeting to be held by the Chancellor of theExchequer on the following day.The Cabinet Took note of the Colonial Secretary&apos;s memorandum.7. The Cabinet endorsed a number of proposals made by theMinister of Housing and Local Government in a memorandum on thehousing programme (C. (51) 23).The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Housing and Local Government (a) To allow local authorities at their discretion toincrease the proportion of houses to be built under licencefrom one in five to one in two of their total programmes.(b) To authorise the sale of municipal houses, subjectto safeguards regarding re-sale and to withdrawal of thesubsidy on houses sold;(c) To encourage building of smaller houses by localauthorities in accordance with plans to be published byhim.
(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for Scotland similarly toincrease the proportion of their total programmes which local authorities might allow to be built under licence inScotland by substituting a maximum proportion of one in five for the present proportion of one in ten.(3) Appointed a Committee of the Cabinet to watch over theprogress of the national building programme in order toensure that all parts of it are carried out economically and effectively.Home Guard. 8.   The Secretary of State for War. informed the Cabinet that itProvision of would be impracticable to provide uniforms and boots for the HomeUniforms. Guard without drawing on the reserve of outfits held against mobilisa-tion. This reserve was already 300,000 below requirements and he did not wish to reduce it further during the next six months, whichwas the period required for the production of further outfits in thenumbers likely to be required by the Home Guard. It was desirablethat he should make some announcement on the subject later in theday in the House of Commons. An indication that initially the home guard would be provided neither with uniform nor with a cashallowance in lieu would have an adverse effect on recruiting.After discussion the Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for War to inform theHouse of Commons that uniform and boots would not beavailable initially to the Home Guard; but that, for so longas outfits were not issued, an annual allowance of  2 12^. Od.would be paid to each man.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd November, 1951.
