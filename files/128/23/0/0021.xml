French Government, if the results of the present six-Power meeting in Paris should warrant it, indicating more fully than we had donehitherto the nature of the association with the European defence community into which we were willing to enter. Annexed to thememorandum was a list of proposals which the United KingdomGovernment might make for this purpose. If the six Governmentsnow meeting in Paris were able to resolve their differences about theEuropean Defence Community, it might be helpful for the UnitedKingdom Government to make a public declaration embodying these suggestions before the agreement was submitted for ratification by the six National Parliaments concerned.The Cabinet-^ Authorised the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the FrenchGovernment at an appropriate moment that the UnitedKingdom Government should make a declaration on thelines indicated in the Annex to C.

The statement on our reserves was to have been minute 7.) made on 8th January, i.e., some nine days after the announcement about financial aid. If the two were to be made together the earliest practicable date appeared to be 3rd January.The Cabinet considered that the statement on financial aid should not be made on the eve of the Prime Ministers arrival in theUnited States, and they were still more strongly opposed to thelinking of financial aid with the statement on our reserves.

Subsequently the Prime Minister informed the Cabinetthat he had explained to the Ambassador the reasons for their strong opposition to any association between the announcements on financial
aid and on the state of our reserves at the end of the year.
