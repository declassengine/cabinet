The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that at their last meeting the North Atlantic Council had appointed a TemporaryCommittee to examine the capacity of the States members of theCouncil to sustain the economic burden of meeting the stated military requirements for the defence of Europe.

Subject to the Cabinefsviews, he proposed to make a full explanation of this country&apos;economic difficulties, on the lines of the statements which had alreadybeen made to Parliament, and to say that the measures already approved by the Government would go some way towards meetingthe prospective deficit in our balance of payments. He proposed,however, to claim assistance from the United States under three heads.First, he would ask for additional imports of steel from the UnitedStates, amounting to 1^ million tons a year. Secondly, he would putin a claim for general economic aid amounting to $600 million by june 1952. Thirdly, he proposed to maintain the claim for freetransfer of finished military equipment from the United States.The Chancellor said that the statement which he was expected tomake to the Temporary Committee of the North Atlantic Council wasin the nature of an opening bid. The Prime Minister would be ableto take this up at a higher level in the discussions which he would beholding with President Truman during his forthcoming visit to washington in January.The Cabinet Approved the general lines of the statement which theChancellor of the Exchequer was proposing to make in pre-senting, to the Temporary Committee of the North atlantic council, the United Kingdom&apos;s claim to further assistancefrom the United States.Egypt.(previous reference:C.C.
