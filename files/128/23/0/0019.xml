2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the results ofhis further consultations with the United States government regarding the warning statements which were to be made if an armistice were concluded in Korea without effective arrangements for supervising compliance with its terms. The United States Govern-ment now proposed that the material part of the warning should statethat, if there were further aggression, &quot; it would in all probabilitynot be possible to confine hostilities &quot; to Korea. They had acceptedthe other amendments which he had suggested. Moreover, the UnitedStates Government had themselves communicated their proposals tothe Governments of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and SouthAfrica. The Foreign Secretary proposed to accept the revisedformula suggested by the United States Government.The Cabinet endorsed the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposal.3. The Cabinet resumed their consideration of the memo-randum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (51) 48) covering a first report by the Sub-Committee of the Economic PolicyCommittee appointed to formulate proposals for remedying theeconomic situation.The Cabinet first examined, on the basis of a list of possiblesavings handed round by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, theproposals mentioned in paragraph 2 (g) of C. (51.) 48, aimed atreducing civil expenditure in the coming year below the level providedfor in the current year.(a) Health services the Chancellor of the Exchequer showed in his list possiblesavings on the Health Services totalling alternative maxima of 39 million or  35-5 million. These totals represented the aggregatesavings which might be achieved in a full year by the following measures:  (i) A charge of Is. on prescription forms, estimated to save 12 million in a year. The Cabinet favoured this proposal as a minimum.  There would be advantage in adopting41671-2 b 2Korea.(previous reference:C.C.(51) 16thConclusions,Minute 6.)StThe EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 18thConclusions,Minute 8.)civil expenditure.Coal Prices. 1.   The Cabinet were informed that, in view of the recent increase in miners&apos; wages and the rising cost of materials, the national coal Board considered it necessary to raise the pit-head price of coalby 10 per cent. This would mean an average increase of 5s. a tonto the consumer. The Economic Policy Committee, who had con-sidered the matter on the previous day, were satisfied that theincrease was inevitable and recommended, that it should take effect from 31st December in order to coincide with the increase in railway freight charges.In discussion it was pointed out that, if price increases and rationcuts could be announced in batches, they could be presented as partof a considered plan for handling the economic situation. If theycontinued to be announced piecemeal, the Government would appearto be at the mercy of events. It was, however, recognised that thisparticular price increase could not have been made until the settle-ment of the wages claim had been accepted; and that the national coal Board could not now postpone it without incurring serious financial loss.The Cabinet Agreed that the pit-head price of coal should be increasedby 10 per cent, from 31st December, 1951; and authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to take forthwith the. necessary preliminary steps for bringing this increase intooperation.
the figure of Is. as being the charge proposed by theprevious Government. It might be practicable to contem-plate an even higher charge, though the saving to be made would not rise proportionately with the increase in charge,since any increase would stimulate recourse to publicassistance and consequently would have a smallerdeterrent effect on excessive use of the Health Services,(ii) A suggestion, which the Cabinet did not favour, for the suspension of the general dental service which would save 20 million a year. The Cabinet preferred that theMinister of Health, in consultation with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, should examine alternative ways of reducing the cost of the dental service, either by theimposition of a charge on users of the service or by other methods. The measures to be worked out for this purpose should be designed, not only to reduce the cost of theservice, but to increase its efficiency and to improve thetreatment afforded to children and to expectant and nursing mothers; and they should be defended on thosegrounds. A charge to the public of the first  1 of thecost of each course of treatment would yield  7 - 5 million.If other measures were taken in substitution for this, the saving might be smaller.(iii) The suspension, which the Cabinet did not favour, of the supplementary ophthalmic service, saving  5 - 5 million a year.(iv) Charges for certain appliances and an adjustment in thecharge for &quot; amenity beds &quot; in hospitals, yielding a saving of  1-5 million a year. The Cabinet gave provisional approval to these proposals,(v) An increase, which the Cabinet also favoured, in theNational Insurance contribution towards the health service, equivalent to an increase of 2d. on the stamp.This would yield an additional revenue of  9 million ina full year, but only a part of this sum in the coming year.It was suggested to the Cabinet that the need for any of themeasures suggested above, other than the imposition of a charge ofIs. on prescriptions, might be avoided if the financial provisionfor the hospital services were limited to the amount provided inthe current year. The Cabinet did not, however, favour this sugges-tion, as they were informed that it would, because of the rise in costs,lead to a substantial lowering of the standards of the hospital serviceand the closing of beds.The Cabinet approved the further examination of the proposalslisted by the Chancellor of the Exchequer with a view to savings beingmade under those mentioned in (i), (ii), (iv) and (v) above reaching atotal of some  25 million in 1952-53.(b) EducationSavings on education shown in the paper prepared by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer amounted to nearly  25 million a year, ofwhich  20 million represented direct budgetary saving. This total was made up of the following items:  (i) Savings, which might yield  1 - 6 million a year, to be madeon the administration of school meals, without affectingeither their food content or the charges to parents.(ii) Reduction by 5 per cent, of the expenditure of local educa-tion authorities, which should be possible without funda-mental damage to the education service. This would save 8 - 5 million a year in the grants made to them. A reduc-tion of  2 million a year could similarly be made in grantsmade by the Ministry of Education to directly assistedinstitutions.-
(iii) An increase in the contributions made for teachers&apos; super-annuation required to put the superannuation finances ona sound basis; this, if made later in the year, might increase revenue in 1952-53 by  1 - 4 million. The cabinet felt that this proposal should be considered again in somemonths&apos; time in the light of the general economic situationand of the savings which it had been possible to makein the meantime; though it would be necessary.for the finances of teachers&apos; superannuation to be put on a self-supporting basis.(iv) Miscellaneous savings, which might amount to  3-8 million a year, obtained mainly by revision of the grants payable to education authorities in respect of expenditure in thecurrent year.(v) Savings in Scotland corresponding to the savings on education, listed above for England and Wales andamounting to  2-5 million a year.(vi) In addition to the budgetary savings listed above, a reduc-tion in the school building programme by  90 million over the next seven years. This could be achieved byeconomies which would not reduce the number of school places provided and would reduce expenditure notentering into the budget by  4 million or more in thecoming year.The Cabinet gave provisional approval to savings on education tobe achieved by the changes listed above. The Chancellor of theExchequer was asked, however, to give further consideration, inconsultation with the Minister of Education, to the optional reductionby one year of the school-leaving age during the period of rearmament -ment, and to submit to the Prime Minister a memorandum examining the advantages and disadvantages of such a course.(c) Other Civil expenditure the examination of other estimates had not proceeded sufficientlyfar to enable the Chancellor of the Exchequer to say what totalsavings might be achieved on them. The Cabinet were, however,informed of the following proposed savings under individualheads:  (i) A reduction in the subsidies required by the airways corporations, combined with other savings achieved bythe Minister of Civil Aviation, reducing expenditure bythe Ministry in the coming year by  6 million below that of the current year.(ii) Cuts in the Information Services saving at least  1-2 million.(iii) First reductions in Civil Service numbers, saving some 3 million a year, which it was hoped would be followedby further staff economies.The Cabinet (1) Subject to the views recorded in paragraphs (a) (ii), (a) (iii)and (b) (iii) above, gave general approval to the prepara-tion of civil estimates which would reflect the savingsdiscussed by them.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Ministers concerned, to examine all the civil estimates in the light of Conclusion (1) above and of their discus-sion, with the object of reducing total civil expendituresubstantially below the level of expenditure in the current year.(3) Agreed to reconsider the level of civil expenditure and the savings made in the estimates with a view to reaching final conclusions in the latter part of January.
(4) Agreed that the financial provision to be made in the coming year for - the hospital service should be settled betweenthe Minister of Health, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the Chancellor of the Exchequer on a basis whichwould not require the closing of hospital beds.Purchase The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ChancellorTax and the of the Exchequer and the President of the Board of Trade (C. (51) 50)Utility Scheme, relating to the purchase tax and the utility scheme. This matter wasalso mentioned in paragraph 2 (d) of the memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (51) 48) on the economic situation.The Cabinet were informed that the existing operation of the utilityscheme, with its total exemption from purchase tax for utility goods,was seriously hampering the export trade in textiles, and certain other commodities, because of the unwillingness of manufacturers toproduce goods of medium quality which would be subject to full ratesof purchase tax. The matter was under examination by a Committee,under the Chairmanship of Sir William Douglas, which was expectedto report shortly in favour of a modified system of purchase taxdesigned to produce a charge more evenly graduated between goods of lower and of higher quality. It was Urgently necessary to prepare and to introduce legislation to bring this scheme into effect.The Cabinet (5) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Presi-dent of the Board of Trade, in consultation with the lord president and the Home Secretary, to examine the pro-posals of the Douglas Committee when received and toput in hand the preparation of legislation to amend thepurchase tax and utility schemes on the lines proposed.(6) Agreed to consider the matter further when the proposals had been more fully worked out.The memorandum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (51) 48) included a proposal in paragraph 2 (e) that, in order toreduce the overload on the engineering and metal-using industries, thelevel of production of certain goods made for the home market bythe metal-using industries should be reduced by  60 million a year.In view of the importance of the export trade in these goods andthe reductions which were to be made in the demands of the fightingservices on the production of the metal-using industries, it was essential that home consumption in these goods should be curtailed.The Cabinet (7) Agreed that the production of goods made for the homemarkets by the metal-using industry should be reducedby  60 million a year.Civil 4.   The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda on investment      civil investment in 1952:  a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer covering a report on the investment programme prepared by officials at the request of the Sub-Committee of theEconomic Policy Committee;by the Chancellor of the Exchequer commenting onthe proposals in the officials&apos; report;by the Minister of Housing and Local Governmenton the effect of these proposals on the housing programme and the building industry.Metal Goodsin the home market.C. (51) 45:C. (51) 52:C. (51) 43:The Cabinet had some preliminary discussion about the effect whichthese general investment proposals were likely to have on thehousing programme.    In this the Minister of Housing and Local
Government developed his objections to restrictions on investment which would prevent him from attempting to reach the housingtarget to which the Government were pledged. There was generalsympathy with the view that the Housing Ministers should be free to try to build as many houses as they could within whatever allocs-tion of labour and materials might be made to them.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, before the cabinet took final decisions on the issues raised by these memoranda, hewould be glad of an opportunity to discuss them with the HousingMinisters, the Minister of Works and some of the other ministers most directly concerned.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to discuss thesememoranda with the Ministers most directly concerned.(2) Agreed to resume their consideration of these memoranda ata later meeting.5. The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a circular issued bythe Ministry of Supply regarding the Ministerial use of official cars.The arrangements proposed in this circular seemed to be inconvenient,if not impracticable. The Minister of Supply said that the circularhad been issued without his knowledge. He would arrange for it tobe recalled and would send the Prime Minister a report covering,not only this question, but also the proposals for reducing the numberof car pools in London and restricting the use of cars by officials.6. The Minister of Labour recalled that on 13th December theCabinet had invited him to submit a draft of the announcement whichhe proposed to make about the re-introduction of a Regulation of engagement Order and the revival of labour supply inspection. Hecould not settle the terms of this announcement until he had discussedhis proposals with both sides of industry; and, subject to the viewsof his colleagues, he now proposed to proceed with thoseconsultations,The Cabinet Authorised the Minister of Labour to discuss with repre-sentatives of both sides of industry his proposals forre-introducing a Regulation of Engagement Order andreviving labour supply inspection.Cabinet Office, SWA,20th December, 1951.
