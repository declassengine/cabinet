EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.G. (51) 4thConclusions,Minute 4).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, despite the statements made on behalf of the Government during the Debate on the Address,the drain on our reserves of gold and dollars was continuing at an even higher rate than in the third quarter of the year. It was essentialthat this should be arrested, and he was satisfied that the Governmentshould announce at the earliest possible moment such measures for restoring the national economy as would revive confidence in the stability of sterling. He outlined to the Cabinet the measures whichhe had in mind for this purpose.The Cabinet&apos;s discussion turned mainly on the timing of suchan   announcement.   Any   statement   made   before   Parliamentadjourned for the Christmas Recess would have to be very general in character; and a statement which drew public attention to the dangers of the situation without indicating how the Government proposed to remedy it was likely to shake confidence still further both in thiscountry and abroad.   On the other hand, there would be disad-vantages in postponing any public statement until after the PrimeMinisters return from his visit to North America.   The Cabinetfinally agreed that the best course would be to give some preliminarywarning before Parliament was adjourned on 7th December, toamplify this in a broadcast talk by the Prime Minister on 22ndDecember, to recall Parliament a week earlier than had hitherto been intended and to make a full announcement of the government&apos;s policy in the first week after Parliament reassembled in January.Meanwhile a few members of the Economic Policy Committee shouldformulate detailed proposals for remedying the situation.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Sub-Committee of the Economic Policy Com-mittee consisting of the Chancellor of the Exchequer (inthe Chair), the Lord President, the Minister of Labour, thePresident of the Board of Trade and the Paymaster-General to formulate for consideration by the cabinet proposals for remedying the current economic situation.(2) Authorised the Minister of Health to announce, in his statement on Business on 6th December, that parliament would reassemble a week earlier than had previously been proposed in order to deal with urgent business arisingfrom the economic situation.(3) Invited the Prime Minister, in a broadcast which he was pro-posing to make on 22nd December, to give some furtherindication of the problems with which Parliament wouldhave to deal when it reassembled after Christmas.(4). Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer should present to Parliament, immediately after it reassembled inJanuary, comprehensive proposals for remedying theeconomic situation.Cabinet Office, S.WA,29th November, 1951.
