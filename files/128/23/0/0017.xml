Tin and Steel 1.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theNegotiations. Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster and the Minister of Supply (C. (51) 42) proposing that animmediate approach should be made to the United States Governmentwith a view to reaching agreement before the Prime Ministers visiton an arrangement for the exchange in 1952 of 20,000 tons of Britishtin for 500,000 tons of United States steel.The Cabinet were informed that the United States Governmentwere finding great difficulty in obtaining necessary supplies of tin,They had recently refrained from buying tin from Malaya in orderto break the price, and because of Congressional and public opiniondid not wish to re-enter the market, though their reserves were runninglow. An offer of a barter deal of tin for steel would, it was believed,be most welcome to them. If we bought tin to exchange with themfor steel, the price of tin would rise from its present artificially low level of  900 a ton; but at a price of  1,000 a ton we should not loseon an exchange of the quantities proposed, having regard to thepresent price of United States steel. It was likely, however,- that theprice would rise to a level at which we should have to pay more forthe tin than the market value of the steel. This extra cost wouldhave to be borne, as was the present excess in the price of UnitedStates steel over our price, by raising the price of all steel to Britishconsumers. If our purchases forced up the price of tin unreasonablyit might be desirable to use tin from our strategic stockpile temporarilyfor part of the barter deal.The object of the proposal was to reach firm arrangements bywhich we might obtain 500,000 tons of steel from the United Statesnext year and to prepare the way for the Prime Minister to seek toobtain further supplies up to a total of an additional 1 million tons^ as free aid.In the course of discussion it appeared doubtful whether such anarrangement would in fact be helpful in the attempt to obtain morethan 500,000 tons of steel from the United States next year. Even ifwe did obtain more, it would be difficult to maintain a clear distinctionbetween the steel which was exchanged for tin and the rest; we mightbe asked for more tin and United States opinion might hold that wewere in fact seeking to obtain the whole of the 1,500,000 tons of steelwhich we required in exchange for an inadequate offer of tin. TheCabinet thought it would be preferable that no negotiations on tinshould be begun in the short period before the Prime Ministersdeparture; but that the Prime Minister should be in a position, whenseeking supplies of steel, to offer a gift of tin to the United states to relieve them of their difficulties, without linking closely the mutual assistance given by the two countries each to the other or suggesting that our gift to them was of comparable value to a part of what wewere seeking from them. But if the matter were to be dealt with inthis way it would be necessary to give some preliminary warning tothe United States Government, since they might otherwise be forcedby their immediate difficulties into re-entering the tin market.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster toarrange for the United States Government to be informedprivately that the Prime Minister would be glad to discuss with them in Washington the possibility of our assistingthem in their difficulties in relation to supplies of tin; andto suggest to them that in the meantime they should refrain from re-entering the tin market.(2) Invited the Prime Minister during his forthcoming visit to handle the matter on the lines proposed in their discussion.
EconomicSituation.Prime MinistersBroadcast.(Previous;Reference:C.C. (51) 12thConclusions.)2. The Prime Minister said that the broadcast which he hadbeen proposing to make on 22nd December had been described inthe Press as a Party political broadcast. It would be a mistake to revive political controversy immediately before his visit to washington, and it might be better to postpone the broadcast until after his return.In discussion there was general agreement that an authoritativestatement should be made before Christmas about the gravity of thesituation which had confronted the Government when they took office. It was further agreed that this statement could not be madeeffectively within the limits imposed on Ministerial broadcasts towhich the Opposition had no right of reply.The Prime Minister undertook to give a broadcast talk on22nd December, as previously planned, and agreed that this could beregarded as a political broadcast to which the Opposition would havea right of reply.Man-Power. 3.   The Minister of Labour said that the Sub-Committee of the(Previous Economic Policy Committee had now endorsed the proposals which reference: he had put forward in C. (51) 18 for the introduction of a RegulationC.C. (51) 13th of Engagement Order and the revival of labour supply inspection.Conclusions, He would like to have the Cabinefs authority to discuss these minute 2.) proposals with both sides of industry.The Cabinet agreed in principle that this measure of control overthe supply of labour must now be introduced, but asked for anopportunity to consider the terms in which the decision would be announced.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Labour to submit to them, at their next meeting, a draft of the announcement which he pro-posed to make about the re-introduction of a Regulation of engagement Order and the revival of labour supplyinspection.Cabinet Office, SWA,13th December, 1951.
