1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.The Committee and remaining stages of the Festival PleasureGardens Bill would be taken on Wednesday, 5th December. TheCabinet agreed that, if an amendment were moved to allow the FunFair to be opened on Sundays, the decision on this point should beleft to a free vote of the House.Man-Power. 2.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLabour and National Service (C. (51) 18) proposing that, in orderto bring about a better distribution and use of man-power and to divert skilled workers to essential occupations for defence and export,the following measures should be taken:  (i) A Regulation Of Engagement Order should be made, so asto ensure that workers could only take up employment through theEmployment Exchanges.(ii) Technical labour supply inspection should be revived toprevent the extravagant use of labour.(iii) Each industry should undertake a comprehensive examina-tion of its training arrangements.The Cabinet were informed that the second of these proposalsneed not lead to an increase in the number of civil servants; existing staff could be diverted to this work from other duties.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Minister of Supply and the First Lord of the Admiraltysaid that, unless measures of this kind were taken, the defence programmes would fall further into arrears. It might be necessary to* supplement these measures by introducing a &quot; designated list &quot; of vitalprojects urgently needing further labour, to which the Ministry ofLabour would give high priority in the supply of labour.(b) Special difficulties arose from the calling-up of certain skilledengineering workers on completion of their apprenticeship. But anyfurther extension of deferment from call-up for particular categorieswould greatly increase the difficulty of operating a system of compulsory National Service in time of peace. Moreover, the armed forces themselves needed an adequate number of skilled tradesmen.(c) The first two of the proposals made by the Minister of Labourcould best be considered as part of the review of remedies for thecurrent economic situation which was to be carried out by the Sub-Committee of the Economic Policy Committee appointed by theCabinet on the previous day (C.C. (51) 12th Conclusions).The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Labour to proceed with his pro-. posals for a comprehensive review of training arrange-ments in particular industries.(2) Invited   the   Sub-Committee of   the   Economic   PolicyCommittee to examine the proposals for a Control of engagement Order and for labour supply inspection aspart of their review of proposals for remedying the current economic situation; and to report on these to the Cabinet.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to consider, in consultationwith the other Ministers concerned, the desirability of afurther limited measure of deferment for ex-apprenticesemployed on essential parts of the defence production programme which would be seriously delayed by the calling-up of these men for National Service.
Egypt. 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary oj(Previous        State for War (C. (51) 31) on the means of exercising disciplinaryReference:      control over civilian labour which was now being brought into tjijC.C.. (51) 6th    Canal Zone from other parts of the Middle East.Conclusions, jne Secretary of State for War said that, if these workers were minute 2.) not heid iQ De subject to British military law, they would be subjectControl of to Egyptian law; but it would not be desirable to hand them over for civilian trial by the Egyptian courts for offences committed in the Canal Zone.Labour in They would be subject to British military law if our troops in the ZoneCanal Zone. were de facto on active service; but our troops there were onljdeemed to be on active service by virtue of a declaration undersection 189 (2) of the Army Act, and the Law Officers had advised that it was doubtful whether this declaration had the effect of makingcivilian labour subject to military law. It was therefore proposed that-a Bill to remove this doubt should be passed forthwith, in the terrasof the draft annexed to C. (51) 31.In discussion attention was drawn to the difficulties of passingsuch a measure before Parliament rose for the Christmas Recess. Itwas suggested that the better course would be to instruct theCommander-in-Chief to proceed, with due discretion, as though these workers were subject to military law- Action taken on that basismight not in fact be challenged; but, if it were, legislation could be passed after Christmas and could, if necessary, include indemnityprovisions.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Commander-in-Chief should in due courserenew the declaration under section 189 (2) of the army act, by which the British troops in the Canal Zone weredeemed to be on active service.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for War to instruct theCommander-in-Chief to proceed, with due discretion, onthe basis that, so long as such a declaration remained inforce, civilian workers employed by the British Army inthe Canal Zone were subject to British military law.; (3) Invited the Secretary of State for Air to take corresponding action, under both the preceding Conclusions, as regardsthe Royal Air Force in the Canal Zone.Cabinet Office, S.W.I,  -29th November, 1951.
