1. The Prime Minister gave the Cabinet an account of thediscussions which he and the Foreign Secretary had held with french ministers and with General Eisenhower during their visit to Paris on17th and 18th December. The visit would, he thought, be of benefitto Anglo-French relations: in particular, it should have removed any French apprehensions lest their interests should be overlooked in the talks which he and the Foreign Secretary would shortly be having in washington. It had also been valuable to have a free exchange of views with the French Ministers about the European Army. He hadbeen able to make plain, in private conversations, his disappointmentat the shape which the European Army was assuming under thePleven Plan: but, as the United Kingdom was not to be a memberof the European Defence Community, he had not felt able to pressthese technical points too far. The communique which had beenissued at the end of the talks had made it clear that the UnitedKingdom Government favoured the creation of a European defence community, though they could not join it, and that they were readyto associate themselves with it as closely as possible in all stages ofits political and military development. This should forestall anyfurther suggestion that the delay in securing agreement to the creationof a European Army was due to the unhelpful attitude of the UnitedKingdom&quot; Government.The Cabinet took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.2. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of an interviewwhich he had had with the Egyptian Foreign Minister during his visit to Paris. He had spoken in strong terms about the existing stateof Anglo-Egyptian relations, and had made it clear that it was thefirst duty of the Egyptian Government to see that order was restoredand the present tension relaxed. Thereafter he hoped that it mightbe possible to resume the search for a lasting settlement and he had urged the Egyptian Government to study the four-Power proposalswhich had already been placed before them, the Egyptian ForeignMinister, whose mood had been more reasonable than had been expected, had promised to put these points to .his Government.The Foreign Secretary said that he had no great confidence thatthe attitude of the Egyptian Government would be changed as a resultof this interview. He had in view, however, other possible methodsof breaking the present deadlock. The position now looked a little less intractable.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.3. The Cabinet had before them two memoranda by the foreign secretary (C. (51) 53 and 54) on the future treatment of German war criminals.When the Cabinet had considered on 7th December the proposal(C. (51) 36) that periods spent in custody before trial should be reckoned as counting towards the sentence imposed, it had beensuggested that the Foreign Secretary should first ascertain the extentto which the courts had taken account of the period of pre-trialcustody in assessing sentences. In C. (51) 54 the Foreign secretary reported that at this date it was impossible to establish this in each particular case; and he recommended that the period of pre-trialcustody should now be reckoned as counting in all cases towards the sentence imposed, even though this might involve extending a doublebenefit to some of those still in custody. The application, pf this principle would have the result that forty persons now in custodywould qualify for immediate release. He had, as requested, given thePrime Minister a list of the persons affected.-1 b 2
The Cabinefs discussion turned mainly on the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s long-term proposals (C. (51) 53) for transferring to the german federal Government the responsibility for the custody of all german war criminals save those sentenced by the International Tribunal atNuremberg and confined under quadripartite control in Berlin.Under these proposals clemency would be exercised on the advice ofan independent tribunal of three judges one Allied, one German andone neutral. In the Cabinefs discussion the following points weremade:  (a) This plan would be unpopular with those sections of publicopinion in this country which believed that no further clemency shouldbe shown to Germans convicted of war crimes. On the other hand,the announcement of this policy might well revive pressure for therelease of some of the better-known German Generals, such, forexample, as Manstein and Kesselring.(b) The plan would have to be negotiated with the Germans aspart of the arrangements for placing on a contractual basis therelations between the three Occupying Powers and the german federal Government.(c) The constitution of the tribunal would have the result thatthe decisive voice would lie with the neutral. This would be appro-priate if the tribunal were concerned with issues of justice. In fact,however, they would be concerned solely with clemency; and it wouldbe more logical to reserve powers of clemency to the Governmentwhich had imposed .the original sentence. This, as noted in para-graph 5 (iv) of C. (51) 53, was the system which it was proposed toapply in Japan. Against this it was argued that the Foreign Secre-tary&apos;s proposal could be defended on the ground that these war crimes had offended the conscience of the world, and that it was thiswhich justified the proposed composition of the tribunal.(d) It would be preferable that the neutral representative shouldbe a Swiss rather than a Swede.(e) The tribunaFs revision of sentences should be based solely on grounds of clemency. It would be inappropriate that a mixedbody of this kind should be empowered to pass judgment on the&quot; justice &quot; of sentences imposed by a British military court.The Cabinet-(1) Reaffirmed their decision of 7th December that, as regardsGerman war criminals in British hands, periods spent in custody before trial should now be reckoned as countingtowards the sentence imposed.(2) Approved, subject to amendment on the point noted in para-graph (e) above, the long-term proposals in C. (51) 53 for transferring to the German &quot;Federal Government theresponsibility for the custody of war criminals held in thethree Western Zones of Germany; and invited the foreign secretary to put these proposals in the first instance to theUnited States and French Governments and thereafter tothe German Federal Government.. Persia. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignInternational Secretary (C. (51) 46) on the suggestion of the Internationa] Bank thatBank Proposals, they might make temporary arrangements for the operation of the(Previous Persian oil industry pending a final settlement. The Bank were reference: likely to formulate early in January specific proposals with a view toC.C. (51) 7th the management of the whole Persian oil industry on behalf of theConclusions, Bank by a suitable staff headed by a &quot; neutral.&quot; The bulk of the minute 2.) operating staff would probably have to be provided by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and profits would be divided equally betweenthe Persian Government and those operating the industry.
The Foreign Secretary suggested that, while in public we shouldbe well advised to appear indifferent to the fate of the Persian oil,we should assist and encourage the Bank in drawing up their scheme.If specific proposals were received we should not publicly commit ourselves to a view on them until the Persian Government had accepted them as a basis for negotiation. The intervention of theBank offered some prospect of an ultimate arrangement with the persians not materially less favourable to us than the terms whichwe had been willing to offer in the early stages of the dispute. Itwas important, however, that the United States Government shouldnot grant any financial assistance to the present Persian Government,since this would only have the effect of prolonging them in office.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The Kashmir 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Common-Dispute, wealth Secretary (C. (51) 47) summarising the history of the Kashmirdispute and proposing that United Kingdom policy should aim at sercuring through the United Nations further progress towards the holding of a plebiscite and the essential demilitarisation which mustprecede it. Direct intervention would be likely to prove fruitless. Asolution could only be reached between the two Governmentsconcerned. It was, therefore, proposed to promote a resolution inthe Security Council favouring the immediate appointment of a plebiscite administrator and calling upon the two parties to settlewithin two months their differences on methods of &quot;demilitarisation.We should aim to work in close consultation with the United StatesGovernment and with the other Governments of the commonwealth in putting this resolution forward.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary and the commonwealth secretary to approach the United States Government andthe Governments of other Commonwealth countries with aview to the promotion in the Security Council of a resolution on the Kashmir dispute on the lines suggested in paragraph 8of C. (51) 47.The High 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theCommission     Commonwealth Secretary (C. (51) 49) recommending that no actionTerritories.      should be taken to anticipate the demand which the Prime MinisterTransfer to      of South Africa was expected to make for transfer of the Highthe Union of    Commission Territories (Basutoland, Bechuanaland and Swaziland)South Africa.    to the Union of South Africa. This demand, when made, would haveto be met with a firm refusal.  Public opinion in this country wouldbe whole-heartedly behind the Government in refusing to transfer the territories without the consent of their inhabitants; and this, ifsought, would certainly be refused.   Any attempt to dissuadeDr. Malan from raising the matter, on the ground that we shouldhave no option but to refuse transfer, would create resentment andwould not secure any substantial deferment of the question, sinceDr. Malan was committed to raising it.The Cabinet Agreed that no action should be taken to anticipate the expected demand for the transfer to South Africa of theHigh Commission Territories.
Bechuanaland . 7.   in connection with the discussion recorded in the precedingProtectorate. Minute,, the Cabinet again considered their decision that, althoughChieftainship Seretse Khama would have to be permanently excluded from theof the chieftainship of the Bamangwato tribe, they would announce for the bamangwato time being only that they adhered to the intention of their predecessorsTribe. to review the situation within five years.   So long as this was left(Previous in uncertainty, relations with the Government of South Africa would reference: be made more difficult.  On the other hand, the Governments policy .C. (51) 11th regarding Tshekedi Khama had been well received and ParliamentaryConclusions, difficulties could not be raised over Seretse Khama so long as the minute 4.) Government were able to say that they would maintain the policy announced by their predecessors.The Cabinet-Agreed for the time being not to vary their public statement that as regards Seretse Khama they adhered to the policyof their predecessors as set forth in the White Paper(Cmd. 7913) of March 1950.The EconomicSituation.(previous reference:CC.(51) 12thConclusions.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer (C. (51) 48) covering a first report bythe Sub-Committee of the Economic Policy Committee appointed tofomulate proposals for remedying the economic situation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the proposedParliamentary statement on the economic situation would not be made until the end of January, decisions must be taken on some of theconclusions set out in paragraph 2 of his memorandum before theend of the year, notably on those relating to textile exports, the health service and education, since these might require the preparation oflegislation. A decision on the level of expenditure for the hospital service should be taken before Christmas in order that the estimatescould be worked out in detail in consultation with the hospital authorities. -Discussion turned mainly on proposals designed to reduce thecivil estimates for the coming year at least to the same figure as thetotal (inclusive of supplementary estimates) for the current year.Without special cuts, the total of the civil estimates for next year would rise to a level some  60 million higher than the total for thecurrent year. The Sub-Committee had examined possible economies which would reduce this figure by  100 million, i.e., to a level some 40 million below this year&apos;s expenditure.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion of C. (51) 48 at their next meeting.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,19th December, 1951.
