There seemed, however, to be need for closer political control overthe actions of the British military authorities in the Canal Zone.Iron and SteelIndustry.(previous reference:C.C.(51)2ndConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Minister of Health reported that his Committee on thefuture of the iron and steel industry had now come to the conclusionthat it would not be practicable to pass before Christmas legislationrestoring the industry to private ownership.Welsh Affairs. 3.   The Prime Minister said that he understood that it would begratifying to public opinion in Wales if the Home Secretary, who was. to be the member of the Cabinet responsible for Welsh Affairs, could have an additional Under-Secretary to assist him in this part of his duties. He therefore proposed to recommend the appointment of anadditional Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department, whowould be a Welshman.King&apos;s speech on the Openingof Parliament.(previous reference:C.C.(51)lstConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Minister of Health(C. (51) 2) covering a draft of The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening ofParliament.The Prime Minister said that he had discussed this draft with theMinister of Health on the previous evening and had suggested variousamendments: he handed to the Cabinet copies of a revised draftincorporating these amendments.In discussion of the draft various changes of wording were suggested and approved. The following specific points were also made: -(a) The Cabinet were informed that the Home Guard could notbe established in time of peace without legislation. They agreed,however, that the Speech should include a reference to the re-estab-lishment of the Home Guard. If legislation was in fact required forthis purpose, the Secretary of State for War should submit proposals in time for legislation to be passed before Christmas.(b) The reference (paragraph 8 of the draft) to the Government^intention to preserve the free use of the Suez Canal should not be framed in terms which would be read in the Middle East as implyinga determination to force the passage through the Canal of oil tankersbound for Haifa. After discussion it was agreed that it would suffice to refer to the Government^ intention to &quot; safeguard the internationalhighway.&quot;(c) A reference to the Sudan should be included, in the following terms: &quot; Nothing can be allowed to interfere with the rights of the sudanese to decide for themselves the future status of their country.&quot;id) It was suggested that if the University franchise were restored,as proposed, on the basis of one vote only by each voter, it waspossible that very few people would choose to use their Universityvote and that University Members would be elected by disproportionately-disproportionately small constituencies. Some Ministers thought that forthis reason the Government should not at this stage commit themselves finally to the view that, when the University franchise wasrestored, it should be on the basis of one vote only by each voter. Onthe other hand it was argued that, if their intentions on this pointwere not made clear in The King&apos;s Speech, the Government would at once be asked in the Debate on the Address whether they proposedthat persons entitled to the University franchise should have a secondvote in the constituencies where they lived. The preponderant view in the Cabinet was against this restoration of plural voting; and it
was agreed that the paragraph on this subject in The King&apos;s Speechshould be framed as. follows: &quot; A Bill will be laid before you tomake provision in the next Parliament for the representation of the universities in the House of Commons, on the basis of one vote only by each voter.&quot; W(e) The Lord Chancellor said that an earlier draft of the Speechhad promised legislation improving the salaries of county court judges and comparable judicial officers. He hoped that the omission of this reference from the later draft would not be taken to imply that theGovernment were unwilling to proceed with this measure, which hadbeen agreed between the political Parties before the General Election.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, this Bill was not of such importance as to warrant specific mention in the Speech; but this wasno reason why the Bill should not, if the Cabinet so decided, beincluded in the Government^ Legislative Programme for the session and introduced at an early date.The Cabinet-Approved the draft for The King&apos;s Speech on the Openingof Parliament in the form annexed to C. (51) 2, subject tothe amendments noted in paragraphs (b)-(d) above and tothe other drafting amendments which had been agreed in thecourse of their discussion.Parliament. 5.   The Minister of Health proposed that notices of motions for business in the the Addresses to renew the emergency legislation should be handedHouse of        in to both Houses immediately after the Opening of Parliament. ThisCommons.      was necessary in order that the proceedings for the renewal of this legislation could be completed before 10th December, when it would otherwise expire.The Minister proposed that the Government should take allPrivate Members&apos; time up to Christmas and that thereafter arrange-ments should be made on the same lines as those in operation in theprevious Session regarding Private Members&apos; Bills and Motions andthe introduction of Bills under the ten-minute rule.The Cabinet Approved the proposals put forward by the Minister ofHealth.Meat6. The Minister of Food said that shortly before the GeneralElection his predecessor had announced that, as supplies of home-killed meat were falling off, the meat ration (which now stood at 12. 7d.) would have to be reduced progressively to Is. 5d., at whichfigure he hoped to be able to maintain it throughout the winter. TheMinister said that current stocks of meat represented only a little over  weeks&apos; supply on the basis of a Is. 5d. ration; and it was estimatedthat, before home-killed meat became available again, stocks wouldhave run down to a level representing only 1^ weeks&apos; supply. Therewas no prospect of securing any immediate increase in shipments from the Argentine and other overseas sources. He therefore recommended that the weekly meat ration should be reduced at once to Is. 5d.The Lord President supported the proposal put forward by theMinister of Food.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Food to announce forthwith thatthe weekly meat ration would be reduced to Is. 5d. from11th November.(2) Agreed that during the Debate on the Address a full statement on the meat situation should be made in both Houses ofParliament.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2nd November, 1951.
