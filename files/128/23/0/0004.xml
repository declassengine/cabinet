The King&apos;sSpeech on theOpening ofParliament.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 3rdConclusions,Minute 4.)Parliament.Business in theHouse ofCommons.2. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Minister of Health said that, as little legislation would beready for introduction in the early weeks of the Session, it might be convenient that in the period before the Christmas Recess the house should not sit on Fridays. There was reason to believe that suchan arrangement might be acceptable to the Leaders of the Opposition.On the other hand, it was pointed out that back-benchers on both sides of the House might think it unreasonable for the Government to takePrivate Members&apos; time and then make no use of it for government business. It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inexpedient to put forward the proposal that until after Christmasthe House should not sit on Fridays.The Prime Minister invited the Cabinet to review their decision that legislation to restore the University franchise should be intro-duced in the first Session of the present Parliament. If, as the Govern-ment intended, there was to be no representation of the Universitiesin the present Parliament, this legislation was not of such urgencythat it must be passed in the current Session. And, if this Bill were now given a prominent place in the legislative programme for the first session, it might be represented as a mere manoeuvre in Party politics.In discussion there was general support for the view that it wouldbe preferable to postpone this legislation until a later Session. Thiswould give the Government more time to consider the difficulties involved in restoring the University franchise on the basis of one voteonly by each voter. It would also enable them to ascertain whatviews were held on this question by Government supporters generally.The Prime Minister said that in the course of his speech in the debate on the Address he would make it clear that it was the Govern-menfs intention to legislate on this subject, though not in the current session. He would also state that the legislation would not providefor University representation in the present Parliament, and that, asat present advised, the Government considered that the Universityfranchise should be exercisable in future on the basis of one voteonly by each voter.The Lord Privy Seal said that another matter which, he hoped,would be taken up in a later Session was the reform of the Houseof Lords. The Government should not allow it to be inferred that,because this was not mentioned in The King&apos;s Speech on this occasion,the Government had abandoned the idea of dealing with it during the life-time of the present Parliament.The Prime Minister said that he had one further amendment to propose in the text of The King&apos;s Speech which the Cabinet had approved on 2nd November. He suggested that the paragraph onthe social services should refer, not to &quot; promoting economy,&quot; but to&quot; providing value for money spent.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Agreed that The King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of parliament should contain no reference to the restoration of theUniversity franchise, and that the paragraph on thissubject should be deleted from the draft which they had approved on 2nd November.(2) Agreed that the paragraph in The King&apos;s Speech dealing withthe social services should be amended to read: &quot; Iri theirpolicy towards the social services My Government will-g^fjj pursue the aim of ensuring efficiency and providing value. ;;r&apos;v.&quot;;.. for money spent.&quot;
The Minister of Health said that this made it even more urgentthat a Standing Committee of the Cabinet should be appointed tcsupervise the Governments legislative programme. This Committeeshould as their first task put in hand the preparation of a number ofsmall Bills suitable for introduction early in the Session.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet, after consultationwith the Minister of Health, to submit to the Prime Ministerproposals for the constitution of a Standing Committee ofthe Cabinet to supervise the Governments legislative programme.Ministers&apos; 3.   The Prime Minister said that it had been brought to his noticeSalaries. that there might be some doubt whether a provision in the Ministers(Previous        Salaries Act, 1946, which enabled a Minister whose salary was lessReference:      than  5,000 a year to draw  500 a year as a Member of the House ofC.C. (51) 1st    Commons, might apply to Ministers who had accepted a voluntaryConclusions,    reduction in salary,  Any arrangement enabling them to draw partMinute 6.)       of their House of Commons salary would of course defeat theCabinet&apos;s intention.   He had therefore thought it right to mention the matter to the Cabinet so that all Ministers who had undertaken to draw only  4,000 of their Ministerial salary would understand thatthey were also expected to refrain from drawing any salary as members of the House of Commons even if, on a strict constructionof the law, they might be technically entitled to do so.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.EconomicSituation.(previous reference:C.C. (51) 2ndConclusions,-Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the economicsituation.They first considered a note by the Chancellor of the Exchequer(C. (51) 3) covering a draft of what he proposed to say about Govern-ment expenditure in his speech in the Debate on the Address. in discussion of this draft the following points were made:  (a) The draft dealt mainly with economy in administration, andit might perhaps be taken.to imply that no savings were to be sought by changes in policy. It was recognised that the Chancellor wouldnot be in a position, when he spoke in the Debate, to announce any specific changes in policy; but it would be expedient that he shouldmake it clear in his statement that changes of policy were not excluded.(b) The draft included a promise that the Government would announce their economy measures as soon as they had been deter-mined. It would be preferable to omit this phrase, since it might lead to repeated requests for information about the progress of the chancellors proposed review of Government expenditure.(c) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was anxiousto emphasise the fact that in his efforts to reduce government expenditure he could count on the full support .of all his Ministerial.colleagues.  The Cabinet agreed that this point should be stressed inthe statement.(d) The Prime Minister said that he relied upon the Treasury tobe specially vigilant on this occasion in their scrutiny of the estimates for the coming financial year. The Chancellor of the exchequer should not hesitate to bring to the Cabinet any questions on whichhe could not reach agreement with the Departmental minister concerned.
The Cabinet (1) Subject to amendment on the points noted in paragraphs (a)and (b) above, approved the general lines of the draft statement annexed to C. (51) 3.The Cabinet then considered what should be said in the Debateabout dividend limitation and the excess profits tax.The Chancellor of ike Exchequer said that he must make it clearthat he did not intend to proceed with his predecessors proposalsfor dividend limitation, and that he would bring forward in the nextBudget measures imposing special taxation on excess profits earnedduring the period of rearmament. He had been advised that heshould state at the outset that these measures would applyretrospectively from 1st January,, 1952. He himself was inclined tothink that it might suffice if he caEed on firms to follow- a cautiouspolicy in the distribution of profits. He intended to see representa-tives of employers and trades unions on the day following his speech,and he could take that opportunity of offering informal advice to employers on this question. He would, however, be glad to know what his colleagues thought about this.In discussion the point was made that it would be undesirable to give the impression that firms would enjoy until April a free period in which to declare large dividends. The Government would also bevulnerable to political criticism if it could be said in the BudgetDebates that they were introducing retrospective legislation without having given adequate warning in advance.The Cabinet: (2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make it clear inthe Debate on the Address that the excess profits legisla-tion would apply retrospective!)7 from 1st January, 1952.In the Cabinefs discussion on 1st November the question hadbeen raised whether the proposed suspension of strategic stockpilingwould have an adverse effect on the defence programmes. TheChancellor of the Exchequer said that he had looked further into thisquestion and had sent the Paymaster-General a note dealing with it.The Paymaster-General said that in his. view the proposed suspension of strategic stockpiling was a regrettable necessity and, so far as hecould see, it would not have any adverse effect on the defence production programmes.The Cabinet next discussed the monetary measures which wereto be taken.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, after further discussions with the Governor of the Bank of England, he had cometo the conclusion that it would not be right to increase the bank rateby more than 0-5 per cent. In discussion the point was made that,if reliance wfere being placed solely or mainly upon an increase inthe bank rate to reduce investment and to check current inflationarytendencies, the increase would have to be so large that it would,impose a disproportionate burden on the Exchequer throughincreased interest on the floating debt. The Chancellor of theExchequer said that he recognised this, but he was satisfied that eventhe small increase which he proposed would have a valuable psycho-logical effect on the market. There had been no movement in thebank rate since 1939, and salutary results would flow from the mereknowledge that the Government were prepared to use this monetaryinstrument for countering inflation. The Secretary of State for theColonies endorsed this view.The Cabinet were informed that the Chancellor of the exchequer had held further discussions with the Housing Ministers regardingthe effect of this increase in the bank rate upon the rate of interest on borrowing by local authorities. As a result of these discussionsit had been agreed that local authorities should be required to pay
the current market rate on borrowings for all purposes, includinghousing, but that special steps must be taken to prevent the increased cost of loans for housing purposes from leading automatically to anincrease of rents. It was now proposed that the Government should at once announce that they proposed to bring forward the annual review of the housing subsidy, which would otherwise take place inJune, and to open discussions forthwith with the local authorities.The increase in the interest rates would be one factor in these discussions, which would go as wide as was needed, and might leadto a change in the present structure of the subsidy. The Minister of housing and Local Government and the Secretary of State forScotland said that, while they expected that there might be some political criticism based on the fear of an increase in the rents of localauthority houses, they were satisfied that in all the circumstances theformula which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was proposing to usein his speech in the Debate was the best that could be devised. they thought it right to warn the Chancellor that, once they had embarkedupon a general review of the housing subsidy, the Government were likely to be strongly pressed by the local authorities to bring intoaccount increased costs due to causes other than the rise in the rateof interest on local authority borrowings, e.g., the increased cost of repairs and maintenance.In connection with the proposed reduction of the import programme the Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in order toprevent forestalling, some of the open general licences to importwhich were now in force would need to be revoked simultaneously with his statement in the Debate on the Address. He asked for the cabinet&apos;s authority to arrange for the Departmental ministers concerned to give the necessary instructions.The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange forthe revocation of open general licences necessary to imple-ment the approved reductions in the import programme.Coal. 5.   The Cabinet had before them (i) a note by the Secretary ofImports from   State for the Co-ordination of Transport, Fuel and Power (C. (51) 5)the United      covering a memorandum by the Minister of Fuel and Power pro-States, posing that immediate steps should be taken to import half a million tons of coal from the United States; and (ii) a memorandum by theMinister of Supply (C. (51) 6) on the possible effects of this plan on steel production in the United Kingdom.The Secretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power said that, in order to avert a breakdown in coal supplies during the coming winter, he would have liked to be able to import1 million tons of foreign coal. At this late date not more than half amillion tons could be imported in time to be of service; but it was essential that all practicable steps should be taken to secure thislimited amount without delay. This was bound to involve some inter-ference with other import programmes; but he hoped to be able to mitigate this to some extent by the use of United States reservesnipping and possibly by the diversion of coal shipments already allo-cated to France.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Minister of Supply drew attention to the reduction inshipments of iron ore which had resulted from the importation ofcoal from the United States in the previous winter. If the present proposal were carried through at the expense of iron ore shipments,United Kingdom steel production in 1952 might be reduced by some200,000 ingot tons. This deficiency, if it fell entirely on exports bythe engineering industries, might reduce our export earnings by as:.   much as  50 million.
Iron and Steel 6.   The Minister of Health said that his Committee on the futureIndustry. of the iron and steel industry were satisfied that the Minister of(Previous Supply should give formal directions to the Iron and Steel BoardReference: requiring them to refrain from making any further changes in theC.C. (51) 3rd organisation of the industry pending the legislation which the Govern-Conclusions, ment proposed to introduce after Christmas.   He read to the cabinet minute 2.) a draft of the direction which the Minister was proposing to give.The Minister of Supply said that he was under a statutory obli-gation to consult the Board before giving this direction. This he proposed to do on the following day. He thought it important thatthe terms of the direction should be made public during the debate on the Address; but, before he finally issued the direction, hewould submit it for the Prime Ministers approval.The Minister said that, as the Iron and Steel Board would shortly be abolished, he saw no advantage in changing its composition at thisstage. There would in any event be some difficulty in persuadingresponsible people to accept appointment to a Board which would so soon be discontinued. The direction which he was proposing to givewould, however, prevent the existing Board from doing any further damage to the industry.The Cabinet Took note of these statements by the Minister of Health andthe Minister of Supply.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th November, 1951.The Prime Minister said that every effort should be made to compensate for this by obtaining increased supplies of finished steel from the United States.(b) The cost of importing half a million tons of coal from theUnited States would be in the neighbourhood of  4 million, includingfreight charges.(c) This emergency programme of coal imports was likely toencourage some general increase in freight rates.(d) The United States Government would find great difficulty in increasing substantially the rate at which they were repairing andmanning ships from their reserve fleet. It was not likely that theUnited Kingdom could help by providing crews for these ships: therewas already some difficulty in manning existing British ships.(e) This proposal to import coal might have some adverse effecton food imports, especially the import of oil seeds from West Africa.(/) Ministers should at an early date review the coal budget forthe coming year. Exports of coal and steel were an importantbargaining-counter in trade negotiations, and our bargaining position had been seriously weakened by the failure to provide anadequate amount of coal for export. Special difficulties were arisingfrom our inability to supply Sweden with the coal which she needed.(g) The Prime Minister said that statements on the coal situation should be made in both Houses of Parliament during the Debate onthe Address. These statements should make it clear that the Govern-ment had been compelled to import foreign coal in order to avert a crisis with which they had been faced on assuming office; and that, ifthis crisis had been foreseen, the coal could have been imported duringthe summer with far less risk of dislocating other import programmes.The Cabinet-Approved the proposal made in C. (51) 5, and authorised theSecretary of State for the Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power, in consultation with the Ministers of transport and Fuel and Power, to take immediate steps to secure theearly importation into this country of half a million tons ofcoal from the United States.
