government expenditure.(previous reference :C.C.(51) 11thConclusions,Minute 2.)PublicAnnounce-ments.1. The Prime Minister referred to the circular on expenditure which the Ministry of Education had issued to local authorities at theend of the previous week. The timing of this had been unfortunate.The Government should aim at announcing all their proposals forcurbing expenditure at one time, when Parliament was sitting. Nofurther announcements of policy affecting major items of expenditure should be made without the authority of the Cabinet.The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Ministers statement.legislative programme.1951-52 Session.(previous reference:C,C.(51)10thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Health (C. (51) 41) covering a draft legislative programme for thecurrent session prepared by the Legislation Committee.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) It was unlikely that all the Bills included in the programmed could be passed in the session. Time would have to be found for afew essential additions, particularly the legislation arising out of the review of the economic situation.(b) Most of the time available for legislation in this session would fall in the early months of 1952, and the three major Bills on iron andsteel, road haulage and monopolies should therefore be ready for introduction as quickly as possible. Major questions of policy arisingon the first two of these would be submitted to the Cabinet in thenext few weeks; and the Monopolies Bill, which was likely to be lesscontroversial, was expected to be ready for introduction early inFebruary.(c) A small Bill should be added to the programme to preventGerman nationals from prosecuting in our courts claims against british citizens for acts arising out of the circumstances of the war.(d) A further Bill would be needed if a settlement was reached on the question of Germany&apos;s pre-war debts.The Cabinet (1) Approved the draft legislative programme annexed toC. (51) 41, subject to the points noted in paragraphs (c)and (d) above.(2) Authorised the Legislation Committee to add to theprogramme later in the session any Bills which were urgently required; and to delete from it any Bills thepreparation of which was unduly delayed.Dunkirk 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C. (51) 39) by the memorial. Secretary of State for War inviting their views on the nature of the memorial to be erected at Dunkirk. The Imperial War graves commission were prepared to erect there, at a cost of  23,000, a smallarchway to commemorate the 4,600 soldiers who fell in the 1939-40campaign and have no known graves. It was for consideration whether something more noteworthy should be erected there as anational memorial of one of the outstanding incidents of the war.That would cost about  100,000 and an Exchequer grant would be needed.In discussion it was suggested that, if the primary object was tocommemorate the missing, it would be appropriate to adopt theproposals of the Imperial War Graves Commission. different considerations arose if the memorial was to commemorate the greatdeliverance of Dunkirk. In either event a garden of remembrancemight be preferable to a monument.41564 B 2
The Cabinet (1) Invited the Secretary of State for War to provide (!) drawingsillustrating the alternative possibilities; and (ii) informa-tion about the precedents for raising funds for suchmemorials by public subscription.(2) Agreed to consider the matter again when this furtherinformation was available.Counsellors 4.   The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet that when Theof State. King went abroad in the spring Counsellors of State would beappointed to act in His absence. The persons qualified by statute tobe so appointed were The Queen, Princess Elizabeth, PrincessMargaret, the Duke of Gloucester and the Princess Royal. At this time Princess Elizabeth would herself be abroad and, if The Kingwere accompanied by The Queen and Princess Margaret, only two ofthose qualified to be appointed Counsellors of State, viz., the duke of Gloucester and the Princess Royal, would be in the UnitedKingdom. It was doubtful whether the functions falling to theCounsellors could be exercised by only one of their number; and, if only two Counsellors were appointed, there would be a risk that theconduct of business would be impeded if one of them were to be inany way incapacitated.The other Commonwealth countries were opposed to the transaction of Royal affairs by anyone other than a Royal Counsellorand it might be wise, therefore, to introduce legislation before TheKing&apos;s departure enabling Queen Mary to be appointed as aCounsellor during His absence.It would not be possible to leave such legislation to be passedonly if the difficulty actually arose through incapacity of one of theRoyal Counsellors, since in those circumstances there would be nocompetent authority to authorise the giving of Royal Assent to thelegislation. The only practical alternative to legislation before TheKing&apos;s departure would be to appoint Princess Margaret as a thirdCounsellor with the intention that she should be asked to return at short notice to the United Kingdom if difficulty arose during herabsence in the discharge of their functions by the other twoCounsellors.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to prepare and to submit to HisMajesty for approval an announcement, to be madeconcurrently with the announcement that PrincessMargaret would accompany Their Majesties on theirvoyage, indicating that the operation of the Council ofState during His Majesty&apos;s absence was under considera-tion by the appropriate authorities.(2) Agreed to defer their further consideration of the matter untilnearer the time of The King&apos;s departure.Egypt- 5.   The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that he had seen(Previous        the Egyptian Ambassador earlier in the day. Although the EgyptianReference:      Government had not yet decided to sever diplomatic relations with c.C. (51) 15th   the United Kingdom, the Ambassador feared that they would do so,Conclusions,    that relations would then be very difficult to restore and that internalMinute 3.)       disorder in Egypt would increase.  The Foreign Secretary had giventhe Ambassador a factual statement of the reasons for our action inclearing the new road to the Suez filtration plant, had pressed that thedisorders and terrorism in Egypt should be brought to an end, andhad reaffirmed our readiness for immediate four-Power talks on defence arrangements to take the place of the Treaty of 1936.   He
hoped that these representations would be conveyed at once to theEgyptian Cabinet and would have a steadying effect upon them.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.6. The Foreign Secretary said that he had received from theUnited States Government a draft of the warning statements whichwere to be made if an armistice were concluded without effectivearrangements for supervising compliance with it. He thought that theterms of the United States draft, which in the material part said thatany further aggression &quot; will result in hostilities outside &quot;Korea,&quot; were too threatening. He proposed to suggest a revised formula declaring that further acts of aggression would find us united and prompt inresistance and would have &quot; consequences so grave that it might beimpossible to confine hostilities to Korea.&apos;&apos;The Foreign Secretary said that he would like to comply withthe United States wish that discussions at the present stage shouldbe confined to the two Governments, since this was the first occasion on which they had consulted us in this matter. On the other hand,the other Commonwealth Governments which were contributingforces to Korea had already been told of the earlier exchanges andwould expect to be kept informed of further progress. A possible solution of this difficulty would be to inform those Governments now that, while it was not practicable to consult them at all the inter-mediate stages in the discussion of a formula, they would be informed as soon as an agreed recommendation was reached between ourselves and the United States Government.The Cabinet (1.) Approved the revised formula which the Foreign secretary was proposing to suggest, to the United States Govern-ment.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Commonwealth Secre-tary to consult further about the communication whichshould be sent at this stage to other commonwealth governments.7. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet that the UnitedStates Ambassador had enquired whether the Prime Ministerintended, during his forthcoming visit to Washington, to ask for financial aid from the United States. The visit would follow shortly after the United Kingdom&apos;s payment of the first instalment of theinterest on the American loan, and the Ambassador thought it wouldbe preferable that the question of financial aid should be settled either before or after the Prime Ministers visit.The Prime Minister said that it was not his intention to ask for financial aid in the course of his discussions in Washington. Hewould ask for American assistance in the form of materials and equip-ment, for the purpose either of assisting our defence programmedirectly or of assisting our exports and thus furthering the defence programme indirectly. In &quot;this connection he attached greatimportance to steel. We should try to secure a decision on financial aid before the end of the year; but, if this proved impossible, thequestion should be left over until after his visit to the United States.The Cabinet-CD Took note of the Prime Minister&apos;s statement.(2) Agreed that the intention of the Government to pay the first instalment of the interest on the United States loan shouldbe announced before Christmas.
European 8.   The Prime Minister read to the Cabinet a letter which he hadArmy. received from Field-Marshal Montgomery on the subject of the(Previous        European Army.  The Field-Marshal considered that it was imprac-Reference:      ticable in present political circumstances to fuse the armies of theC.C. (51) 14th   European countries into a single force under single direction; and conclusions,     that, although the French were in favour of attempting to do soMinute 4.)       because they were apprehensive of the creation of a German NationalArmy, it was impossible by these means to produce an effective mili-tary force. The Field-Marshal was strongly in favour, however, of a european Army made up of units maintaining their national character and spirit but integrated under one United Nations Command.  Hewould not recommend that the United Kingdom Government should at present participate in the attempt to build up a European Army;but he thought they might indicate that in their view integration ofnational units into a European Army was right while attempts atfusion were wrong.The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet that he had told Field-Marshal Montgomery that he was in general agreement with these views.The Foreign Secretary said that the French Government hadto take into account the strong body of feeling in France againstthe re-creation of a German Army. It was also important to keepin mind the effect of these plans on the Soviet Government: theywere likely to regard the creation of a German national army as more provocative than any of the steps so far taken in building upthe defence of Western Europe. And they would certainly bedisturbed by any proposal which seemed to foreshadow the admissionof Germany into the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Wth December, 1951.
