Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet reviewed their decision of 28th November thatLength of Parliament should reassemble, after the Christmas Recess, a weekChristmas earlier than had previously been proposed.   The Chancellor of the recess. Exchequer was anxious that, in any announcement to this effect which(Previous was made before the House rose, the decision should not be related to reference: the economic situation.   On the other hand it was felt that, if noC.g.&apos;(51) 12th reference were to be made to economic business, it would be difficultConclusions.) to give any convincing reason for bringing the House back earlier.After discussion, the Cabinet Decided to make no change in the existing arrangement bywhich Parliament would reassemble, after the Christmas- Recess, on 29th January.Korea.2. The Foreign Secretary reported the latest developments inthe negotiations for an armistice in Korea. There was reason to fear that it would prove impossible to secure effective arrangements for ensuring, by supervision, full compliance with the terms of thearmistice. The Communists seemed to have been building up their forces under cover of the armistice talks; and, in the absence of effective supervision, they might continue to do so with a view toputting themselves in a position to launch a further attack on theUnited Nations forces. The Foreign Secretary had discussed this situation with the United States Secretary of State during his visit to rome. Mr. Acheson had proposed that General Ridgway should beauthorised to conclude an armistice, even though he was not com-pletely satisfied about the supervision arrangements, but that in that event he should report his doubts to the United Nations. A publicwarning could then be given about the serious consequences whichwould follow if the Communists made any serious breach of thearmistice terms.The Foreign Secretary said that, since his return to London, hehad discussed these proposals with the Prime Minister and the Chiefsof Staff and had now conveyed his considered views to the UnitedStates Government. He had suggested that the warning statementsshould be made by the United States, the United Kingdom and as many as possible of the other countries contributing to the united nations forces in Korea. They should be in general terms but might indicate that, in the circumstances envisaged, it might prove impossible to localise the hostilities in Korea as hitherto. As regardsthe two specific measures which the United States authorities hadin mind, he had made it clear that we could not support proposalsfor a naval blockade of China, which could not be effective, and had indicated that the preferable course would be to authorise the bombing of Chinese airfields, bases and junctions north of the Yaluriver. There would be no question of any general air attack onChinese towns.The Cabinet (1) Took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s state-ment.(2) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to explain the position tothe Leader of the Labour Opposition, in confidence, at theappropriate stage.New Towns. 3.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeLiquor Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (C. (51) 33) pro-licensing,       posing the immediate announcement of legislation to repeal theprovisions of the Licensing Act, 1949, extending State management to New Towns.
European 4.   The Prime Minister informed the Cabinet of the terms of theArmy. statement which he was proposing to make, in his Speech in theDefence Debate in the House of Commons on 6th December,regarding the latest developments in the negotiations for the formationof a European Army.TransportRailwayFreight, dock and CanalCharges.5. The Secretary of State for Co-ordination of Transport, fuel and Power asked that an immediate decision should be taken on theproposals relating to railway freight, dock and canal charges set outin the memorandum by the Minister of Transport (C. (51) 34). Indue course the Transport Commission^ charges would be fixed by theTransport Tribunal after public enquiry. But the settlement of freight charges in this way would take many months and, if immediateincreases were to be made, the Minister of Transport would have tomake Regulations under section 82 of the Transport Act beforeParliament rose. The Minister&apos;s proposals would increase chargesby  21 million a year: to delay the increases until after the Recesswould therefore cost the Commission some  3 million.The Transport Tribunal were about to fix passenger charges ata level beyond which further increases would not produce increasedrevenue. Additional revenue could therefore be found only by increasing freight charges. Even when the new passenger charges were fully operative the Transport Commission would largely because of recent wage increases be faced with a prospective deficit of about  16^ million in a full year. It was, therefore, proposed toincrease freight rates by 10 per cent., subject to a maximum increaseof 10s. per ton on most goods traffic. Even when this had been done,little provision would have been made for wiping off the accumulated deficit of the Transport Commission;, which was likely to stand at about  45 million at the end of 1951.The Cabinet were informed that there would be no administrative- difficulty in reversing the present law on this point, since the plansr Tor putting it into operation had not advanced beyond the preparatorystage. The purpose of the extension of State management to the new towns (viz., the provision of public houses of a high standardaccording to a proper plan) could be largely secured by the Develop-ment Corporations themselves. But, in order to avoid possibledisputes between the Corporations and the licensing justices, it was proposed to establish in each New Town a Statutory Committee repre-senting both these authorities. This arrangement had been adopted for the heavily-bombed areas, under the Licensing Planning(Temporary Provisions) Act, 1945, and had worked well.In discussion the following additional points in favour of theproposal were mentioned:  (a) If the construction of public houses in the New Towns were left to private enterprise, there would be a substantial saving in development costs falling on the Exchequer.(b) State management in a number of small and widely-separatedtowns would be administratively inconvenient, and would beanomalous when the towns had been fully developed and handed overto normal local government.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the preparation of legislation to repeal the pro-visions of the Licensing Act, 1949, extending Statemanagement to New Towns and to substitute provisions on the lines proposed in C. (51) 33.(2) Authorised the Home Secretary to make an immediate announcement of the Governments intentions.
The Cabinet Authorised the Secretary of State for Co-ordination ofTransport, Fuel and Power to arrange for the Minister ofTransport (i) to announce forthwith that the Government were under-taking as a matter of urgency a comprehensiveenquiry into the efficiency of the national transport system;to announce at the same time that, in order to coverincreased costs arising in particular from recent wage increases, immediate steps were being taken to raisethe level of railway freight, dock and canal charges;(iii) to make Regulations under section 82 of the transport act, authorising increases in those charges to theextent proposed by the Minister of Transport inC. (51) 34.(ii)Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,4th December, 1951./ The Permanent Members of the Transport Tribunal, acting as a consultative Committee, had, with minor changes, endorsed theproposals made by the Transport Commission for immediateincreases. ,,The Cabinet felt that, while it was desirable that the consequentialincrease in Charges should follow closely on the wage increases whichwere their principal cause, it would be undesirable to announce further increases in transport charges&quot; without indicating that the efficiency ofthe whole of the transport system of the country was under urgent examination.
