Ministers&apos; Cars.(previous reference :C.C. (51) 1stConclusions,Minute 6.)2. The Prime Minister said that he had now formulated his proposals regarding the use of official cars by Ministers. those ministers for whom police protection was provided must be able touse official cars for all purposes. No other Ministers would, however,have cars allotted to them. Cabinet Ministers or Ministers in chargeof Departments would draw on a central pool of cars for officialpurposes, including journeys to and from their official work withinseven miles of the Palace of Westminster. The arrangement bywhich Ministers had been able to use official cars for private purposeson repayment would be discontinued. All official cars in london would be operated from a single central pool. Consequentialarrangements would be made for the use of cars by serving officersand civil servants in the London area.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Prime Minister said that he wished to consider further whether those Ministers who used official cars for all purposes becausethey were provided with police protection should not make some payment for their use of these cars for private purposes.(b) It was suggested that there might be some loss of efficiencyif all official cars in London were operated from a single pool. Carpools were now being operated in London by several Departmentsother than the Ministry of Suppply, and there might be advantage in allowing some of these to continue.The Cabinet-Approved the Prime Minister^ proposals regarding the useof official cars by Ministers, subject to further considerationof the two points noted above.Pa^feujpit 3.   The Cabinet agreed that a debate on Defence should be heldBusiness in the in the House of Commons, in open session, on 6th December. TheHouse of        Prime Minister would speak in that debate.Commons. The Opposition were anxious that the House of Commons shouldhave an opportunity to debate, before the Christmas Recess, theproposals for federation of the Rhodesias and Nyasaland. If this were conceded it would be impossible to hold before Christmas theusual,debate on Welsh Affairs. The Cabinet agreed that the leader of the House of Commons, in his discussions with the Opposition,should indicate a preference for a debate on Welsh affairs, but might,if pressed, accept the alternative of a debate on federation in central africa.41503-1b 2State of Nation. 1. The Prime Minister said that he wished to have prepared a comprehensive account of the state of the nation&apos;s affairs at the date on which the Government assumed office. It had been suggested tohim that this might be presented to Parliament as a White Paper.Some of its contents could not, however, be published at the presenttime for example, those relating to the state of our defences. Andthere would be objection to publishing in the form of a White Paper a document which might be said to serve the purposes of Party politics.The statement should therefore be prepared, not with a view to publi-cation, but for the use of the Cabinet.The Cabinet Instructed the Secretary of the Cabinet to collect from theDepartments concerned factual statements which could be assembled into a comprehensive account of the state ofthe nation&apos;s affairs at the date when the Governmentassumed office.
4. The Prime Minister reported the results of the discussion which he had held with the Ministers primarily concerned, since the cabinet&apos;s meeting on 22nd November, on the proposals in C. (51) 21regarding the Chieftainship of the Bamangwato Tribe.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Commonwealth Secretary, in his futurehandling of this question, to pursue the general policy outlined in C. (51) 21.(2) Agreed that a statement regarding Tshekedi Khama shouldbe made in the House of Commons on 6th December inthe following terms: &quot; His Majesty&apos;s Government havedecided that Tshekedi Khama&apos;s private rights in the bamangwato Reserve should not be restricted for longer than is necessary in the public interest. He has alreadyrenounced the Chieftainship; and His Majesty&apos;s Govern-ment are convinced that the interests of peace in theReserve demand that he should be excluded from thepolitical life of the tribe. The sooner this exclusion isshown to be effective, and it is His Majesty&apos;s Govern-menfs intention to make it so, the sooner will it be possibleto allow him progressively greater freedom to look after his private interests in the Reserve and ultimately, if allgoes well, to let him live there as a private person.&quot;(3) Agreed that the answer to any supplementary Question aboutSeretse Khama should be: &quot; As regards Seretse Khama,the Government intend to adhere to the policy of their predecessors as set forth in the White Paper on the bechuanaland Protectorate which was presented in March1950.&quot;(4) Agreed that the reports of the observers who visited the bamangwato Reserve in July 1951 (reproduced in annexes C and D of C. (51) 21) should be published asa White Paper on 6th December.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (C. (51) 30) on agricultural prices by the Minister of Agriculture, the Home secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland.The Minister of Agriculture said that the three ministers concerned recommended that the recent increase in agricultural wages,which would increase the cost of production of the main farm products by  16 million a year, should be offset by a corresponding increase in the prices paid for those products; and that, in addition, a subsidy of not more than  10 million should be paid on phosphates inthe current fertiliser year to offset increases in fertiliser costs whichwere not foreseen when current agricultural prices were fixed. Thiswould mean that out of a total increase in agricultural costs amount-ing to over  40 million a year since prices were last fixed, farmers would be compensated to the extent of  26 million.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The announcement of these changes should be so worded asto avoid drawing attention to the fact that the wage increases werebeing completely offset by price increases.(b) Nothing should be said which would appear to prejudge theannual price review of next February and might give rise to expectation-tations of a programme of expansion which would bring into use high-cost marginal land. On the other hand an increase in home foodproduction was fundamental to the policy of the present Governmentand the statement should contain nothing which would appear to castdoubt on this.
(c) An addition should be made to the statement foreshadowingthe projected increase in food prices (see Minute 6 below).(d) The reference in the second paragraph of the draft statement annexed to C. (51) 30 to retrospection in the price increase for woolshould be deleted.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised increases in prices of the main farm productsamounting to approximately  16 million a year.(2) Authorised the introduction of a subsidy of not more than 10 million on phosphates for the current fertiliser year.(3) Invited the Minister of Agriculture, in the light of thediscussion, to amend the draft statement annexed toC. (51) 30 in consultation with the Ministers concerned;and to make the statement in the House of Commons.Food Subsidies 6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofand Retail Food (C. (51) 29) proposing increases in food prices designed to keepPrices. the total of the food subsidies within the limit of  410 million in thecurrent year.The Minister of Food said that, after taking account of theadditional cost in the present year of the proposed increases in farm prices and of the phosphate subsidy (see Minute 5 above), the present level of retail prices would result in an excess of  22 - 5 million overthe subsidy limit. After consultation with the Lord President he proposed to recover this excess by the increases in retail food pricesset out in his memorandum.In discussion the following points were raised:     ,(a) The announcement should make it plain that the increasesnow being made were larger than they need have been if the previous government had made increases as soon as the need for them was seen.(b) The proposed increases, caused as they were in part by therise in agricultural wages, would in turn strengthen the upwardpressure on wages and contribute to the spiral movement by whichwages and prices forced each other upwards. Nevertheless, the levelof the food subsidies was such that no increase in the present limitcould be permitted. It would be important to try to ensure that rises in wages resulting from these price increases were subject to delay and did not fully compensate for them.The Cabinet Approved the following increases in food prices:  (i) lOd. a lb. on bacon from 30th December;(ii) \0d. a lb. on rationed cheese from 30th December;(hi) Id. a quart on milk from 1st December for four months.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,21th November, 1951.
