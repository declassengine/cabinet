Royal Visit to 2.   The Prime Minister said that his attention had recently beenAustralia and drawn to the fact that the cost of using the S.S. Gothic for the forth-New Zealand, coming Royal Visit to Australia and New Zealand was likely to total 1,100,000. The cost of hiring &quot;the vessel would be about  600,000.The cost of converting it, and re-converting it after the end of the visit, had originally been estimated by the Admiralty at  139,000,but this estimate had been progressively increased and now stood at 550,000. It had been suggested that the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand should be asked whether they were willing to bearsome part of this expenditure.After discussion it was agreed that it would be inexpedient tosuggest to the two other Commonwealth Governments at this stage that they should bear a share of this cost. The Cabinet considered,however, that on the occasion of Royal Visits in the future thequestion of sharing the cost should be raised at the outset with theother Commonwealth Government or Governments concerned.Ministers also expressed concern about the extent to which the-- -   - - cost of the work on the S.S. Gothic had exceeded the original estimate.The Cabinet ^ (1) Agreed that the Governments of Australia and New Zealand&quot; should not at this stage be asked to bear any part of thecost of using the S.S. Gothic for the Royal Visit.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to establish by meansof a formal enquiry the reasons for the heavy expenditure involved in the use of the S.S. Gothic for the Royal Visit,and to report the results of this enquiry to the Cabinet.Egypt.0?previous reference:C.C.(51) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (51) 40) on the situation in Egypt.The Foreign Secretary said that the Commanders-in-Chief had asked for powers to detain, to try and to punish Egyptian terroristsin the Canal Zone. The grant of the full powers for which they had asked was likely to lead to the establishment of Military Governmentin the area, and this would give rise to the serious difficulties outlined in paragraph 6 of his memorandum. He therefore recommended thatthe Commanders-in-Chief should be authorised to detain Egyptianterrorists indefinitely, but should not for the present be empoweredto try or to punish them. Administrative preparations should,however,&apos; be made for the introduction of Military Government in. ; the Canal Zone; and, if the situation had not improved by the timethese preparations were completed, a stern warning could then begiven to the King of Egypt that drastic measures might have to betaken.The Foreign Secretary also recommended that the Cabinet shouldnot authorise the application of economic sanctions to Egypt, and,in particular, that the existing restrictions on the movement of oil from Suez to Cairo should not be increased.     ;.41560 b2Government I.   The Cabinet discussed a suggestion, made by the AssistantPublicity. Postmaster-General, that better arrangements could be made toensure that Government policy was effectively presented and explained to the public. In discussion the point was made that thiswas more a matter for the Conservative Party Headquarters than forthe Public Relations staffs of Government Departments.The Cabinet Invited the Lord President, the Lord Privy Seal, the Ministerof Housing and Local Government, the Chief Whip and the assistant Postmaster-General to consider this question and submit recommendations to the Prime Minister.
The Cabinet were informed that the Chiefs of Staff supported therecommendations made in C. (51) 40. In addition, however, they recommended that the Commanders-in-Chief should be authorised todisarm Egyptian police, if they thought that the local situationdemanded it.The Cabinet were also informed that the Egyptian Governmentwere now withdrawing all Egyptian officers from military courses inthis country. It was suggested that it might have a salutary effect onthe Egyptian Government if Egyptian officers were invited to with-draw from military courses in the United States. This suggestionmight be made to the United States Government and any other of our friends who had Egyptian officers under training.- The Cabinet (1) Approved the recommendations in paragraph 11 of C. (51) 40.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to instruct the Commanders-in-Chief, Middle East, in the terms proposed in para-graph 10 (a) and (b) of C. (51) 40 and, in addition, toinform them that they were authorised in the last resort todisarm Egyptian police if they considered that the localsituation made this necessary.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the United StatesGovernment that they might demand the withdrawal of egyptian students from military courses in the UnitedStates, and to make a similar suggestion to any other friendly country in which Egyptian officers were nowundergoing military training.United Statesand CanadianLoans.Waiver ofInterestPayments.4. The Cabinet considered a proposal, made in a memorandumby the Chancellor of the Exchequer (C. (51) 37), that the Governmentshould not seek to secure waiver of the first interest payments whichwere due to be made on 31st December, 1951, on the United Statesand Canadian credits of 1946.The Foreign Secretary said that he supported this proposal.The Cabinet Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for payment to be made of both the interest and the amortisa-tion due on the United States and Canadian credits on31st December, 1951.War Criminals. 5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C. (51) 36) recommending that, in the case of German war criminals held in British custody in Germany, periods spent in custodybefore trial should now be reckoned as counting towards the sentenceimposed. This would mean that about 30 of the 197 war criminalsin British custody would qualify for immediate release and that advantage would accrue to all the rest.The Foreign Secretary said that in addition he would shortlysubmit to the Cabinet more far-reaching proposals which wouldrelieve him of all future responsibility for tne exercise of clemencytowards German war criminals. Under these proposals responsibilityfor war criminals would be transferred to an international commission with a neutral Chairman, which would be empowered to reviewsentences from time to time.-    In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Before adopting the practice recommended in. C. (51) 36 theForeign Secretary would verify that the Tribunals which had con-demned the prisoners concerned had not stated that pre-trial custodyhad already been taken into account in assessing sentences.
(b) Reasonable exercise of the power of clemency was animportant factor in our future relations with the German people andit was desirable that we should not allow those relations to be adversely affected in the future by proceeding in what appeared to bea vindictive spirit.(c) Large sections of public opinion in this country would be opposed to anything which could be regarded as undue clemencytowards these persons.The limited proposal put forward in C. (51) 36 was generally acceptable to the Cabinet. The Prime Minister asked, however, that before any announcement was made he should see a list showing thepersons who would be released as the result of applying this principle and the important prisoners whose release would not be secured bythis means.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the limited proposal put forward inC. (51) 36.(2) Took note that, before any announcement was made, theForeign Secretary would send to the Prime Minister a listof the war criminals who would be released, and of thosewho would not be released, as a result of adopting thisproposal.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to them a further memorandum explaining his long-term proposals fordealing with the problem of German war criminals.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1th December, 1951.
