The Cabinefs attention was drawn to the fact that their plans for reducing imports were being criticised on the basis that,while food imports were to be reduced, no cuts were proposed in imports of tobacco, wines and spirits.The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to send a note onthis point to the Prime Minister, and to furnish the Lord Presidentwith material which would enable Government speakers to meet this criticism.2. The Foreign Secretary said that the balance-sheet of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company was due to be published early in thefollowing week. Its publication at this stage would embarrass him,both in the forthcoming debate on foreign affairs in the House ofCommons and in his negotiations with the United States government regarding the future handling of the Persian oil dispute.The Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to consider together means of deferring for a timethe publication of the balance-sheet of the Anglo-iranian oil Company.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.3. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.They were also informed that the proposed debate on Defencemight now be postponed until early in December.Germany. 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignFinancial Secretary (C. (5.1) 15) on the steps to be taken to determine the amountContribution and form of the financial contribution to be made by Germany to theto Defence. defence of Europe. Germany&apos;s total contribution was unlikely tocover the combined cost of maintaining Allied troops in Germanyand providing German units for the European Army. Unless theUnited States were willing to fill the gap we should be faced with threedifficult choices, viz. (i) to reduce our own forces in Germany oreconomise elsewhere in our defence programme in a manner whichwould relieve our balance of payments; (ii) to depart from our present policy of declining to accept any additional defence burdens or any additional external burdens; or (iii) to see the German military contribution substantially reduced.The Foreign Secretary recommended that in the first instancehe should seek agreement with the Americans and the French toproceed to negotiations with the Germans at an early date, making it clear that our agreement to enter into such negotiations did not mean that we should at any time be prepared to accept any additionalfinancial burden. If the Cabinet agreed, he would put this, proposalforward at the meeting of the three Foreign Ministers on21st November.In discussion it was pointed out that the figures given in thememorandum were admittedly rough estimates and might prove tobe substantially higher than the expenditure which would actually be incurred if our occupation costs had to be defrayed from theExchequer. These estimates would require careful scrutiny before they were used in international discussion.The Cabinet were disposed to agree that the Foreign secretary should open discussions in the coming week with United States andFrench Ministers, with a view to negotiations with the Germans inthe near future. They asked, however, that before final decisions were taken the issues should be further examined by a CabinetCommittee.
The Cabinet Appointed a Committee (consisting of the Lord Privy Seal,the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Paymaster-General anda representative of the Foreign Secretary) to review theproblem set out in C. (51) 15 and to submit a report early inthe following week.Central 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the african Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations and the SecretaryTerritories, of State for the Colonies (C. (51) 11) on closer association in CentralFederation of    Africa.Southern The Cabinet were informed that the case for federation of the rhodesia,        three Central African territories was based in part on their inter-Northern        dependence economically and in part on the necessity for creating aRhodesia and    stronger unit of Government which would be better able to resist the nyasaland.      infiltration of Afrikaners from the Union of South Africa.   Federa-tion would serve the real interests of all the peoples of the three territories.   When the plan had been discussed with local represen-tatives, there had been general support for federation from the whitepopulation of the territories but general opposition from the nativepopulations.   A firm lead from the United Kingdom Government atthis time might, however, have a substantial effect on native opinion and, given such a lead, the prospects of achieving federation next year were better than they would become later.The Cabinet Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to make astatement in the House of Commons in the following week in the terms of the draft set out in Appendix I of C. (51) 11.;and simultaneously to make the statement available toParliament in the form of a White Paper.Sudan. 6.   The Cabinet had before them a note by the Secretary of theCabinet (C. (51) 16) covering a draft of a statement which the foreign secretary proposed to make on the future of the Sudan.Discussion turned on the question whether this statement should hold out the hope that a constitution providing for self-government might be in operation by the end of 1952. The Cabinet were informed that this hope was already entertained in the Sudan, as aresult of announcements made by the Amendment Commission, andthat the object of the statement would be defeated if it contained no reference to this date.The Cabinet-Authorised the Foreign Secretary to make a statement inthe House of Commons on the lines of the draft appended to C. (51) 16.Cabinet Office, SW. 1,\5th November, 1951.
