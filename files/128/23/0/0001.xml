Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed that the Opposition had beenElection of consulted through the usual channels about the choice of a Speaker,a Speaker. it had been suggested to them that Mr. W. S. Morrison might, be elected Speaker, and that one of the Chairmen of Committees mightbe a member of the Labour Party. They had at first shown readiness to fall in with this proposal; but they had subsequently indicated that&apos; they would propose Major J. Milner as Speaker and would not be willing to provide, from among their supporters, one of the chairmen of Committees. The Cabinet agreed that, when Parliament met onthe following day, the Government should propose that Mr. W. S.Morrison be elected Speaker, and that Sir Charles MacAndrewshould be Chairman of Ways and Means and Mr. R. Hopkin MorrisDeputy Chairman. The Prime Minister undertook to consult the leader of the Liberal Party in order to enlist his support for theseproposals.TheKing&apos;s 3.   The Cabinet had a general discussion on the content of the speech on the King&apos;s Speech on the Opening of Parliament on 6th November.Opening of They agreed that it should include references to the repeal of the parliament. Iron and Steel Act, 1949, the restoration of the University franchiseand the amendment of the law relating to private road hauliers. Itwas suggested that the Speech might also include some promise of social legislation-for example, measures . affecting the elderly orregulating conditions of employment in factories.The Cabinet agreed that it should be made clear in the King&apos;sSpeech that the Bill restoring the University franchise would not become effective until elections were held for a new Parliament and,further, that it would not perpetuate the old system of dual voting a person qualified to vote for a University candidate would in futurehave to choose between exercising that right and voting in the constituency in which he resided. It was suggested that, as theUniversity constituencies would be so much smaller than the ordinaryconstituencies, there was much to be said for limiting Universityrepresentation in the Commons to one member for each University.It was agreed that this was a point which might be considered whenthe time came to draft the legislation.The Prime Minister said that he hoped it might be possible for parliament to complete by the end of November all the essentiallegislative and financial business which must be disposed of beforethe end of the year. Parliament might then be adjourned for a longrecess until the middle of February.The Cabinet-Appointed a Committee consisting of the Minister of Health(in the Chair), the Lord Privy Seal and the Minister of housing and Local Government to prepare a draft of theKing&apos;s Speech and to submit it for the Cabinefs approval by the end of the week.The Cabinet. 1.   The Prime Minister welcomed his Cabinet colleagues at their first meeting. He said that later in the day he would be making a formal submission to the King recommending the appointment ofLord Simonds as Lord Chancellor, Mr. Peter Thorneycroft as president of the Board of Trade and Lord Cherwell as Paymaster-General. This would complete the composition of the Cabinet. TheKing had already been consulted informally, and it was with his knowledge and approval that Lord Simonds and Mr. Thorneycroftwere attending the present meeting as Ministers designate. LordCherwell was expected to join the Cabinet at their next meeting.
iron and steel 4.   The Prime Minister said that urgent consideration must beIndustry. given to the means of implementing the Governments pledge to repeal the Iron and Steel Act, .1949, and to restore the industry to free enterprise. If a short and simple Bill would suffice for thispurpose, it might be passed into law before Parliament was adjourned for the Christmas Recess. If, however, complicated legislation wasnecessary, its introduction would have to be postponed until after christmas.In discussion it was suggested that the restoration of the industryto private ownership was likely to involve complex questions whichit would take some time to resolve. The most urgent need, therefore,was to appoint a new Board to control the industry in conformitywith the policy of the new Government, while those questions werebeing considered.The Cabinet Appointed a Committee consisting of the Minister of Health(in the Chair), the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster,the Minister of Supply and the Attorney-General, to con-sider and report to the Cabinet what action was requiredto implement the Government&apos;s pledge to restore the ironand steel industry to free enterprise and, in particular,whether legislation for this purpose could be passed beforeParliament adjourned for the Christmas Recess.Economic 5.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer handed to the Cabinet a situation. note by the Permanent Secretary to the Treasury analysing the current economic situation and the prospects for 1952. The ChancellorStressed the gravity of the situation disclosed by this note. It was clear that there had been a progressive deterioration for some weekspast and that the previous Government had taken no steps to arrestthis while the General Election was pending. The Government mustlose no time in making the facts of the situation known to Parliament,and a full statement on this subject would have to be made in thecourse of the Debate on the Address. If, however, confidence was tobe restored, the Government must at the same time state whatremedies they proposed to apply. The Chancellor outlined to theCabinet the remedies which he thought would be necessary.The Prime Minister suggested that, before the Cabinet considered this matter more fully, the Chancellor of the Exchequer should discuss with a small group of Ministers his detailed proposals for remedyingthe situation. This group could meet at once, and the chancellor should be in a position to lay his recommendations before the cabinet at their next meeting. Meanwhile, a copy of the note by thePermanent Secretary to the Treasury should be sent to the Leader ofthe Opposition; he should at once be made aware of the factualposition as it had been made known to the Government when theyfirst took office.The Cabinet (1) Appointed a Committee consisting of the Chancellor of theExchequer (in the Chair), the Lord President, the lord privy Seal, the Secretary of State for the Colonies, theMinister of Housing and Local Government, and thePresident of the Board of Trade to consider the current economic situation and the measures necessary to remedyit.(2) Invited the Chancellor of  he Exchequer to report further-to the Cabinet at their meeting on 1st November, in thelight of his consultations with this Committee.
Government 6.   The Prime Minister said that it was his wish that during theExpenditure. period of rearmament or for three years, whichever ended first,Ministers&apos; Ministers entitled by statute to a salary of  5,000 a year should drawSalaries.  4,000 a year. He himself proposed to draw during that period  7,000a year, instead of his statutory salary of  10,000.Ministers&apos; Cars. The Prime Minister said that substantial reductions must be madein the use of official cars by Ministers. Detailed proposals to this end should be worked out without delay.The Cabinet Approved the Prime Minister^ proposals regardingMinisters&apos; salaries and the use of official cars by Ministers,and took note that a public statement on both points wouldbe issued by the Prime Minister that evening.Foreign Affairs. 7. The Foreign Secretary said that since assuming office he hadEgypt. been in consultation with the Chiefs of Staff about the military situa-tion in Egypt. The local commanders had now been given discretion to arrest any persons who constituted a threat to military security in the Canal Zone; but they had been instructed that any persons soarrested should, where possible, be deported from the Zone ratherthan detained in it.15 The Foreign Secretary said that, at the Prime Minister^ request,he had considered a proposal by the Chiefs of Staff that the balanceof the 3rd Infantry Division should be sent to Cyprus in order tostrengthen the forces available in the Middle East generally. So faras he was concerned there was no objection to this proposal.The Prime Minister said that the despatch of these reinforcements tothe Middle East would mean that, apart from the 6th armoured division which was due to go to (Germany in the near future, therewould be no strategic reserve in the United Kingdom. It might benecessary to postpone the despatch of the 6th Armoured Division toGermany; but, before taking any final decision on this point, he would consult with General Eisenhower. It would certainly be necessaryto consider means of strengthening the defences of the United King-dom, e.g., by pressing on with the organisation of a Home Guard andby calling up Territorial Army divisions in rotation.On the political aspects of the situation in Egypt, The PrimeMinister said that he endorsed the policy followed by the previous government regarding the Sudan. For the rest, he suggested that policy should now be based on the principle that it was the duty ofthe United Kingdom Government to keep the Suez Canal open to theshipping of the world, using such force as might be necessary for thatpurpose. It would be consistent with that principle that oil tankersbound for the refinery at Haifa should be allowed to pass through the canal. The Foreign Secretary said that, while he fully endorsed theprinciple suggested by the Prime Minister, he doubted whether itwould be expedient to apply it at the moment to the passage of oiltankers bound for Haifa. This was a matter of timing. Our imme-diate aim should be to prevent the other Arab States from supporting the attitude taken by the Egyptian Government in abrogating theAnglo/Egyptian Treaty of 1936; and precipitate action on our partregarding the passage of tankers through the Canal would be likely to arouse resentment in some of the other Arab States.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would send to the leader of the Opposition a copy of the note by the permanent secretary to the Treasury analysing the current economicsituation and the prospects for 1952.
Persia. The Foreign Secretary said that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in tehran had been recalled to London for consultations. Mr. Harrimanwould also be in London at the end of the present week. This wouldprovide him with a valuable opportunity for consultations on thefuture handling of the Persian oil dispute.Germany. The Foreign Secretary said that complicated negotiations were now proceeding between the three Occupying Powers regarding thefuture status of Western Germany. The objective was to give western germany a greater measure of independence, while preserving safe-guards against any resurgence of German militarism. The foreign secretary said that he need not trouble the Cabinet at this stage withthe detail of the proposals. Broadly speaking, the present position was that we and the Americans were in agreement about the conces-sions which we considered reasonable, but the French were stillreluctant to go so far. He had now instructed our representative inthese discussions to join with the Americans in pressing the French toaccept our proposals.The Cabinet were reminded, that the visit which the Chancellorof the German Federal Republic had intended to make to this countryin October had been postponed on account of the General Election.It would be appropriate that arrangements should now be made forDr. Adenauer to visit this country at the end of November.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statements.Malaya. 8.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was con-cerned about the situation in Malaya, and would like to take an early opportunity of visiting the territory in order to confer with theauthorities on the spot. A Conference of Governors was due to beheld in Singapore towards the end of November. If the parliamentary situation permitted, he proposed to go out to Malaya then. He hoped to be able to pay a visit to Hong Kong at the same time.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,31st October, 1951.
