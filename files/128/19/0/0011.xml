79Parfiameat.Business inthe Houseof Commons.CM. II (51)1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.On 7th February, a Supply Day, there would be a debate on ironand steel. It was agreed that the Minister of Supply and his Parlia-mentary Secretary should speak for the Government in this debate.On 8th February, another Supply Day, there would be a debate onMeat. On this basis the Opposition were willing that the consolidate fund Bill and the Supplementary Estimates for the Service Depart-ments should go through without discussion late in the evening of 7th February.The Defence debate would be held on 14th and 15th February.Caritoo 2.   The Cabinet were informed that serious misgivings had beenHouse expressed in the House of Lords about the design for the new ForeignTerrace. Office building in Carlton House Terrace.  There was a widespreadfeeling that, although the existing facade was to be incorporated in thenew building, the height of the super-structure which was to be addedwould destroy its effect and impair the amenities of The Mall.The Prime Minister said that he would look into this matter again, and would consider the plans for the new building, in consulta-tion with the Minister of Local Government and some of his other colleagues.Coal.Release of miners fromthe armed forces.(previous reference :CM. (50) 81stConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (51) 6) and the Minister of Defence (CP. (51) 12)regarding a proposal that miners who had recently enlisted in the armed Forces as regulars should be encouraged to return to the mines.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that there was likely to bea severe fuel crisis in the next three months, and the more distantprospects were far from encouraging. It was now generally agreedthat coal output could not be raised without an increase in the labour force of the industry; and recruitment, though not unsatisfactory atthe moment, was expected to fall off in the near future. past experience had shown that it was quite practicable to withdraw minersfrom the Forces. It had been done in each of the two world wars,at times when military needs were much greater than they were to-day;and it had been done in peace-time, in 1947. The numbers involved were not large: he estimated that, if his scheme were adopted, notmore than 3,000 men would return from the Forces to the mines.But 3,000 men might produce as much as 20,000 tons of coal a week;and, even more important, their return to the mines would have a powerful psychological effect in discouraging wastage from theindustry, in encouraging recruiting and in making it easier tointroduce Italian workmen into the mines.The miners&apos; leaders were strongly in favour of the scheme, andthey had persuaded the General Council of the Trades Union congress to support it. The Minister believed that the Government would find it impossible to withstand the trades union pressure which was beingexerted in favour of the scheme; and he therefore hoped that theCabinet would approve it and authorise him to announce their decision in the debate On the coal situation which was being held in the Houseof Commons that day.. The Secretary of State for War said that the Minister of defence and the Service Ministers were strongly opposed to this scheme. they agreed that the numbers affected would be small. They estimated that not more than 6,000 miners had joined the Forces as regulars duringthe last two years; and they doubted whether, if the scheme were adopted, as many as 3,000 of these would be willing to return to the mines. He therefore agreed that the Cabinefs decision on thisproposal should be based on their estimate of its psychological effects.40124-1 B 2
He did not dispute the psychological advantages which the.-adoptionof the scheme might have for the coalmining industry. It was his duty to represent its psychological disadvantages from the point of viewof the Governments defence programme. Public opinion wouldsurely find it difficult to reconcile this scheme with the decisions,announced earlier in the week,-to call up reservists and to retain in theForces regulars whose period of colour service had expired. More-over, while the scheme might encourage recruitment for the coal-mines, it could hardly fail to discourage recruitment for the Forces.It was for the Cabinet to decide whether the man-power needs of theForces, or of the coalmining industry, should have priority at thepresent time.In discussion it was pointed out that the production side of theincreased defence programme could not be achieved unless coal prq-duction was maintained; and that there were good precedents forwithdrawing miners from the Forces even in times of grave militarydanger. The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of encouraging miners who had recently joined the Forces as regularsto return to the mines at this time.Discussion then turned on the details of the scheme proposed in cp. (51) 6. It was agreed that the scheme should be restricted tominers who had worked underground and had been in the forces for not more than two years. It was also agreed that miners whowere released under the scheme, but subsequently left the mines andwere recalled to the Forces, should be allowed to deduct the periodspent in the mines from the unexpired period of their colour service;and the Service Ministers were invited to consider sympatheticallywhether the period so spent in the mines could also be countedtowards pension.In discussion reference was also made to the proposal to employItalians in the mines. It was agreed that, although this proposal had* been accepted in principle by the National Union of Mineworkers,great care would be necessary in applying it at particular collieries.There was a serious risk that the introduction of Italian labour atsome pits might cause friction with British miners and their families,and might possibly lead to strikes.The Cabinet (1) Approved the scheme, outlined in the Annex to CP. (51) 6,for the release of underground miners who had recentlyjoined the Armed Forces as regulars.(2) Agreed that this scheme should be confined to men who, atsome time before joining the Forces, had been employedin underground coalmining for at least six months, andhad been in the Forces for not more than two years.(3) Agreed that these men should be approached on behalf of theGovernment and urged to return to the mines on theground that this was now the most important form ofnational service which they could give.(4) Agreed that miners released under this scheme who subse-quently left the pits and were recalled to the Forces shouldbe allowed to deduct the period spent in the mines fromthe unexpired period of their colour service; and invited the Minister of Defence to consider, in consultation withthe Service Ministers, whether the period thus spent in the mines could also be counted towards pension.(5) Approved the proposals regarding the administration of thescheme which were set out in paragraphs 4-7 of CP. (51)6.coal - 4.   The Minister of Fuel and Power said that he had found itIncreased necessary to propose to the Production Committee that there shouldPrices. be an immediate increase of 45. 2d. per ton in the price of coal and6s. 3d. per ton in the price of coke. The need for these price increases
arose partly from the losses incurred by the reduction of coal exports from this country and the importation of coal from the United States,but mainly from increased costs arising from wage increases and from increased prices of stores and materials. The Production Committeehad agreed that there was no alternative but to increase prices, as hehad proposed; but they had invited him to seek the directions ofthe Cabinet on the question whether these increases should be announced in the debate on the coal situation which was to be held inthe House of Commons that afternoon. It was desirable that the price increases should operate from 1st February; but, if they were notannounced that day, their introduction would have to be postponed for at least a fortnight.In discussion it was suggested that critics of the principle of public ownership would make great play, in the debate, with the increasingcost of coal to the consumer. In reply, it was pointed out that these increases were largely due to the rising cost of labour and materials,which were causing similar increases in the price of commoditiesproduced by private industry.The suggestion was also made that there would be political advantage in postponing these price increases until, say, 1st May-when the weather would be warmer and some of the other burdensnow afflicting housewives might have been relieved. As against this,it was pointed out that, if these prices remained unchanged until May,a much steeper increase would then be necessary if the Coal board were not to incur a loss on the year&apos;s working as a whole.The Cabinet agreed that the balance of advantage lay on the sideof bringing these price increases into operation forthwith, andannouncing them in the House of Commons that afternoon. TheMinister should give a full explanation of the reasons for the increases,and should place special emphasis on the increased cost of labour and materials.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the National Coal Board should be authorised toincrease the prices of coal and coke by 45. 2d. and 6s. 3d.per ton respectively as from 1st February.(2) Authorised the Minister of Fuel and Power to announce theseprice increases in the debate on the coal situation whichwas being held in the House of Commons that afternoon,and to give a full explanation of the reasons for them.War Crimes. 5.   The Cabinefs attention was drawn to a report of a recent(Previous        statement by the United Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany,Reference:      in which he was alleged to have said that he was reviewing the cm. (49) 32nd  sentences of German war criminals still in custody, that hatred and conclusions,    revenge were bad counsellors and that it was now necessary on minute 4.)       political and humane grounds to review these sentences.   This state-ment was likely to be interpreted as casting doubt on the fairness ofthe Nuremberg trials.   It might also have unfortunate effects, from a wider point of view, at a time when considerable anxiety was felt inthis country about the policy of re-arming Western Germany.   the statements attributed to the High  Commissioner had alreadycaused some alarm among Government supporters.   If he had beencorrectly reported, it seemed unfortunate that he should make suchstatements without prior consultation with Ministers.Attention was also drawn to a report that the United States HighCommissioner in Germany had decided to annul the order for theconfiscation of the property of Alfried Krupp von Bohlen undHalbach; and that this decision had been taken after consultationWith the United Kingdom and French High Commissioners. Thisdecision was also likely to be ill-received by Government supporters
in this country; and if, in fact, the United Kingdom High Commis-sioner shared responsibility for it, it would have been preferable thathe should have consulted Ministers before concurring in it.The Minister of State said that he had already initiated enquiries into the first of these matters and he would see that an early report on both was submitted to the Prime Minister.Germany.Soviet Proposalfor a Meetingof the Councilof foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 10thConclusions,Minute 4.)6. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the memorandumby the Minister of State (CP. (51) 33) regarding the preliminary dis-cussions to be held in Washington between representatives of theFrench, United States and United Kingdom Governments in prepara-tion for the proposed meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.The Minister, of State said that he sought the views of the Cabineton the two memoranda annexed to his paper, which had been pre-pared as briefs for His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington. Thesepreliminary discussions, which were now in progress, were designed tosecure some agreement between the three Governments on their approach to the forthcoming reply from Moscow. The Soviet Gov-ernment had not rejected the proposal for a preliminary meeting ofthe representatives of the four Governments to recommend an agenda for the meeting of Ministers; but they had not disclosed whether theywould be prepared to discuss questions other than German questions,and the latest note from the three Western Powers was designed toelicit whether they were willing to agree to an agenda on a widerbasis. The Foreign Office had taken the view that a unified anddisarmed Germany, from which occupation forces had been with-drawn, would probably fall a prey to communism and come withinthe Soviet sphere of influence. It was significant that all the demo-cratic parties in Western Germany were opposed to the unification of Germany on the basis of disarmament and would regard any settle-ment with the Russians on these terms as tantamount to the desertionof Germany by the Western Powers. At the first meeting of represent-atives of the three Governments in Washington on the previous day,the French representative said that a neutralised and disarmed Ger-many was not an acceptable solution of the German problem. Themeeting in Washington had also shown that it was common groundbetween the Americans and the French that the major cause of tensionwas not Germany but the weight of Soviet armaments, and that asolution of the German problem could not be found without some agreement on the general level of armaments. If the Russian replydisclosed an unwillingness to discuss any subject other than germany at the proposed meeting of Ministers, the question would arise whetherit was better to hold the meeting on an agenda relating solely toGermany, or to insist on a wider agenda and risk a breakdown beforethe Ministers met. The Foreign Secretary, while he had been anxious that the conference should take place, would almost certainly haveagreed that it could not take place on the basis that Germany alonewas to be discussed.In discussion, there was general agreement that, while every effort should be made to secure that the proposed meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers was held, it would not be practicable to pro-ceed with the meeting if the Soviet Government insisted on confiningthe agenda to the demilitarisation of Germany and other purelyGerman problems.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that the refusal to restrict discussion to Germany alone should be based on the need to secure some relaxation of the tension between East and West, towhich Russia must show a willingness to make some contribution,rather than on any fear that a unified but disarmed Germany wouldbe likely eventually to become Communist in character. Whileadmittedly a; disarmed but unoccupied Germany might in certain
contingencies be the victim of an armed Communist rising, the general trend of opinion in Western countries, including Germany, was movingagainst communism and it seemed reasonable to assume that free elections in a unified Germany would show a majority for the demo-cratic parties. Moreover, the existence of a unified Germany might cause discord between Russia and the Eastern European satelliteStates, since the latter would fear that Russia might woo germany by offering territorial gains at their expense. In any event, it must beassumed that occupation troops would not be withdrawn until aGerman peace treaty had been signed, and the negotiation of a treaty(as experience of the Austrian peace treaty had shown) would be alengthy business. This would giv,e time for a democratic regime ina unified Germany to gather strength.On the basis that the Soviet Government would profess a willing-ness to discuss wider issues than Germany, the Cabinet then con-sidered what general attitude they should adopt towards the proposed meeting of Foreign Ministers. Russia had a long record ofexpansionist policy and aggressive moves, and the policy of thiscountry could not be determined by the terms of the forthcomingRussian reply, whatever that might be, without regard to Russia&apos;policy in recent years, including her maintenance of very large armed forces. At the same time it would be a mistake to proceed on theassumption that Russia was irretrievably committed to a policy ofeventual war against the West. She must view with considerableapprehension the prospect of a third world war, and the chances ofsecuring some easement of the present international tension shouldnot, therefore, be rated too low. The Cabinet considered that thedraft briefs attached to CP. (51) 33 were unnecessarily pessimistic andfailed to reflect the general policy of the Government on this point.While it was arguable that the cause of ultimate world peace could best be advanced by a period of stalemate, during which the Westerndemocracies built up their defences, it seemed preferable to aim at sercuring, through a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers, some measure of agreement which would lead to a reduction in inter-national tension. If Russia was bent on aggression she mightendeavour to secure a temporary settlement of some outstandingdifficulties, with a view to lulling the Western democracies into a falsesense of security and making it difficult for them to go ahead withtheir defence preparations; but the three Western Governments wouldbe alive to this danger and could expose any Russian moves which did not appear to be actuated by a genuine desire for a peaceful and lasting settlement.The Cabinet then considered what questions, other than Germany, might be suggested if Russia agreed to an agenda on a widerbasis, and the following points were discussed:  (a) The five-point agenda, set out in paragraph 12 of Annex Bto CP. (51) 33, proposed the discussion of a disarmament pact as thefirst item. The general view of Ministers was that little effectiveprogress was likely to be made if so wide and difficult a subject was placed at the head of the agenda. Experience before the war had shown the difficulty, under conditions which in many respects wereeasier than those prevailing to-day, of making progress with a project for general disarmament. Thus, discussion of the control and inspection of atomic energy might easily occupy many months. if russia entered the meeting without any real desire to reach a settle-ment, she wcftild be able to put forward specious disarmament pro-posals which the Western Powers would have to reject; andCommunists would then represent the Soviet Government as desiringdisarmament and the Western democracies as opposing it. Moreover,while admittedly the major cause of international tension was the weight of Soviet armaments, it was unlikely that Russia or any other country would be prepared to make any substantial reduction inarmaments until other causes of tension had been relaxed and until
the element of fear, which accounted in part for the present level of,armaments, had been reduced.(b) Nor was it likely that much progress could be made in a discussion of the elimination of hostile and subversive propaganda.The Soviet Government would dissociate themselves from themeasures taken by the Cominform. It was always a matter of greatdifficulty to pin responsibility for subversive propaganda on the SovietGovernment. Even if an agreement were signed on the subject, therewas no guarantee that covert propaganda might not be continued,which the Soviet Government could disown.(c) Some Ministers thought that the discussion of a non-aggression pact might prove to be more fruitful, especially if theWestern Powers made it clear that they would expect the pact to applyto all European countries, including Yugoslavia. If the SovietGovernment declined to discuss such a pact or endeavoured to securethat it should not extend to Yugoslavia, their aggressive intentionswould become plain to the world. On the other hand, some doubt was expressed about the value of a pact of this character. russia had non-aggression pacts with a number of other countries, includingGreat Britain and France, but this had not prevented an increase in international tension. Moreover, as the experience of Czechoslovakiahad shown, Russia might secure her ends by internal trouble and civil war without resort to armed attack.(d) It was suggested that the agenda set out in paragraph 2 of annex B to CP. (51) 33 might provide a more fruitful basis fordiscussion because it started on the basis of less-important issues wherethere was conflict between East and West and did not proposediscussion of Germany until a later stage. If the projected Four-Power meeting tackled, in the first instance, one or two relativelysimple issues on which there was some chance of agreement, an atmosphere might be created in which some of the more contentiousissues could be approached with greater hope of an ultimate solution.It might be useful if the Foreign Office prepared a list of concreteissues on which there was disagreement between Russia and the West,of which a number might be set down for discussion. In reply, itwas stated that the Foreign Office had already prepared such a list and that the lists set out in paragraphs 2 and 12 of Annex B to cp. (51) 33 were a selection including the items on which the ForeignOffice felt that discussions might most usefully proceed.The general view of the Cabinet was that, at this stage, thearrangements for the agenda for the projected meeting of foreign ministers should be left as flexible as possible, and that in the currentWashington talks His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador should avoid committing himself to any procedural decisions which would make it more difficult for the Foreign Ministers to meet and might seem to be based on apessimistic view of the probable outcome of the negotiations. TheWashington talks would serve a useful purpose in clearing some preliminary points between the three Governments, and would thusexpedite the preparation of a reply to the forthcoming Russian note.To that extent the talks would meet the objection, which wasfrequently voiced, to the long delay which appeared to elapse beforereplies were sent to Russian proposals.. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadorwould, however, have to make it clear in the course of the talks that,until the Soviet note had been received and considered, the Cabinetdid not wish to be committed on the items to be included in the agenda for the Foreign Ministers&apos; meeting, or the order in which the itemsshould be taken. Meanwhile, the Ambassador would be able toascertain and report the general views of the representatives of theUnited States and France on the items which might be suggested fordiscussion.In the course of the discussion, reference was also made to thesubject of German rearmament. There was general agreement thatthe threat of the rearmament of Western Germany would be a powerful bargaining factor in the hands of the Western Powers in any
forthcoming Four-Power meeting, since Russia and the satellitecountries greatly feared the rearmament of Germany. While thepolitical parties in Western Germany seemed at present to be opposedto German rearmament on the terms which the Western Powers were likely to propose, it was doubtful whether in the long term theGermans could expect to be defended by the Western democraciesagainst Russian attack without making any contribution of their own.At the same time, there was a good deal of anxiety in this countryabout the proposal to rearm Germany. Moreover, German rearmament -ment would keep the Eastern European countries firmly under Russianinfluence through their common fear of Germany. The Cabinet had decided in principle in favour of a German contribution to western defence, but there would have to be a very careful examination of allthe issues involved before a decision was taken on the manner and timing of Germany&apos;s rearmament.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the memoranda annexed to CP. (51) 33 couldnot be regarded as reflecting the views of Ministers andshould not therefore be used by His Majesty&apos;s Ambassadoras a brief for the preliminary discussions in which he was now engaged in Washington.(2) Invited the Minister of State to inform His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington accordingly, and to acquainthim with the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussion.(3) Agreed to resume their discussion of these matters when the expected reply from the Soviet Government was received.Korea. 7.   The Cabinet were informed that the United States resolution(Previous        on Korea had in the event been submitted to the First Committee ofReference:      the United Nations Assembly in a form which met the views expressedCM. (51) 10th   in the Cabinefs last discussion on 29th January.   The united conclusions,     Kingdom representative at the United Nations had therefore been minute 3.)       able to vote in favour of it; and the resolution had been carried by44 votes to 7.  The representatives of 8 States had abstained from voting.   The resolution was likely to be carried in the general assembly that day.The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested to him thathe might make a statement on this subject in the House of commons that afternoon. This would give him an opportunity to make it clearthat the Government regarded their vote in favour of the amendedresolution as fully consistent with their determination to continue to seek a peaceable settlement of the Korean problem through negotia-tion with the Peking Government. It would also give him theopportunity to bring out the extent to which the original resolutionhad been modified as a result of the efforts made by the UnitedKingdom Government. The Cabinet welcomed the suggestion thatthe Prime Minister should make a statement on those lines.In discussion it was suggested that further publicity should begiven in this country to the main speeches made on this subject bythe United Kingdom representative at the United Nations by puttingthem more permanently on record, e.g., in a White Paper.The Cabinet Invited the Prime Minister to make a statement on Korea inthe House of Commons that day, on the lines suggested inthe discussion.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15/ February, 1951.
