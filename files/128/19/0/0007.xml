1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.It was agreed that the Prime Minister should make a statement on the defence programme on Monday, 29th January.The Opposition had asked for early debates on coal, defence,foreign affairs and iron and steel nationalisation. The Cabinet agreedthat an effort should be made to postpone the debate on coal until they had decided whether to introduce a coal allocation scheme for industry. They also agreed that the request for a further debate onthe nationalisation of iron and steel should be resisted, on the groundthat the House of Commons had already expressed its view on thisquestion on numerous occasions. Early debates must be held on defence and foreign affairs. The timing of these, and the questionwhether a separate day should be set aside for discussion of theeconomic aspects of the defence programme, could be discussedthrough the usual channels. There might be a case for holding some part of the defence debate in secret session.2. The Minister of State said that the Indian Ambassador in peking had now obtained a further elucidation of the attitude ofthe Chinese People&apos;s Government towards the negotiation of a settle-ment of outstanding issues in the Far East. From this it appeared that the Peking Government were now ready to give an assurance that Chinese volunteers would be withdrawn from Korea as soon asthe principle of withdrawing all foreign troops had been accepted andwas being put into practice. Secondly, they were agreeable that theterms and period of a cease-fire should be arranged as the first item of business of the proposed conference. Thirdly, they were ready toagree that the conference should determine the principles on whichthe internal administration of Korea should in future be based.Fourthly, as regards Formosa, they now confined themselves todemanding the withdrawal of United States troops from the island and from the Straits. And, lastly, as regards their recognition andadmission to the United Nations, they asked merely that this shouldbe affirmed in the course of the conference. The Indian representa-tive at the United Nations would presumably disclose this furtherinformation when the debate in the First Committee was resumedlater in the day.On the other hand, before this information was received, manyof the Western Powers had seemed to be coming round to the viewthat they would in the end be obliged to vote in favour of the UnitedStates resolution. All the other non-Asiatic members of the Common-wealth, and most of the European countries, now seemed to be willingto support that resolution. And there seemed to be some reason to fear that, if it were carried, the United States Government would notin fact be content, despite their protestations, with having Chinabranded as an aggressor, but would go on to press for the applicationof political and economic sanctions against China.In discussion the view was expressed that this latest message from Peking was further evidence that the door to negotiations hadnot been finally closed, and that the possibilities of arranging for aconference should be fully explored before a vote was taken on theUnited States resolution.The Cabinet Took note of these statements.

3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (51) 31),circulated by the Minister of Defence in pursuance of the request madeat their meeting on 22nd January, putting forward further considera-tions bearing on the question of the representation of &quot; other ranks &quot;on Service courts-martial and giving such information as was available about the working of the United States system.The Prime Minister said that, in his view, the further considera-tions outlined in this memorandum tilted the balance of the arguments against any alteration of the present system. Now that all officersgraduated from the ranks, there was much less danger of their beingunfamiliar with the circumstances of &quot; other ranks.&quot; The &quot; other ranks &quot; in the United States Forces did not seem to have taken muchadvantage in practice of their right to elect that a court-martial before which they were tried should contain a representative of the non-commissioned ranks.In discussion it was pointed out that the proposal actually madeby Mr. Blackburn, M.P., as a member of the Lewis Committee, wasthat a non-commissioned officer should serve on a court-martial but should be allowed to express a view only on the issue of guilt orinnocence and not on the sentence to be imposed. There should beno difficulty in exposing the disadvantages of that proposal.The Chiefs of Staff said that the responsibility for maintainingdiscipline in the Armed Forces rested with the officers, and it followed that courts-martial should be composed of officers alone. Apart fromthis, officers were better qualified to serve as members of courts-martial. Nowadays, they had almost all had experience in the ranks:they had been selected from the ranks as the most suitable for promc-tion; they had received some training in military law; and, finally,they were not regarded as eligible for membership of a court-martialuntil they had at least two years&apos; service as officers. The presentsystem was necessary for the maintenance of discipline.In discussion several Ministers indicated that they were not disposed to accept the arguments advanced by the Chiefs of Staff. TheCabinet agreed, however, that as &quot; other-rank &quot; representation oncourts-martial had not in fact been recommended by either the lewis committee or the Pilcher Committee, there was no necessity for theGovernment to express sympathy with this proposal in the courseof the debates on the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Bill.The Cabinet Decided not to proceed further with the proposal for&quot; other rank &quot; representation on courts-martial; and agreedthat, if this proposal was pressed in the debate on theSecond Reading of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Bill, theGovernment spokesman should stress the fact that it hadnot been recommended by either the Lewis or the pilcher committee.Service Courts-Martial. .&quot; OtherRank &quot;Representa-tipn.(previous reference:CM.

The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onthe acceleration of defence preparations in the period 1951-54:  CP. (51) 16: by the Chiefs of Staff, containing their pro-posals for increasing the preparedness of the Armed Forces.CP. (51) 18: by the Defence (Transition) Committee, con-taining proposals for accelerating the war planning of the civil departments.CP. (51) 19: by the Home Secretary, on civil defence preparations.CP. (51) 20: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer, on theeconomic implications of the proposals put forward in CP. (51)16 and 18.
CP. (51) 25: by the Minister of Defence, commenting onthe proposals in CP. (51) 16.CP. (51) 26: by the Secretary of State for War, on theproposals for recalling Class Z reservists.CP. (51) 32: by the Prime Minister, reporting the pro-visional views of the Defence Committee on the proposals in cp. (51) 16, 18 and 19.CP. (51) 22 and 29: by the Minister of Labour and theMinister of Defence respectively, on the supply of national servicemen for the Forces.CP. (51) 23: by the Minister of Agriculture and theSecretary of State for Scotland, regarding the proposal to dis-continue the policy of deferring the calling up of agricultural workers for National Service.The Prime Minister recalled that at their meeting on 18th Decem-ber, 1950, the Cabinet had authorised the Foreign Secretary to announce that the Government had decided to increase and acceleratetheir defence preparations still further and were considering what form and direction this increased effort should take. The proposals in CP. (51) 16 and 18 had been prepared in pursuance of that decision.He suggested that the Cabinet should first consider the need for anincreased defence programme on the scale proposed in these memo-randa and should then go on to consider its impact on the national economy and on public morale.In discussion of the necessity for an increased defence programme on the scale proposed, the following points were made:  (a) The Soviet Union had never disarmed after the war and hadretained their fighting Services on a war footing. They were nowbuilding up their forces still further and must also be presumed to beaccumulating a stock of atomic weapons as speedily as possible.There was a secret treaty between Russia and Communist China,which would place the man-power resources of China at the disposal Iof the Soviet Government in certain contingencies. The satelliteStates in Eastern Europe had increased their defences by 30 per cent.since September last; and Bulgaria, for example, was building up two additional armoured divisions. The forces at present at the disposalof the democracies in Western Europe could offer no serious resistance to a Russian attack; and, if such an attack were to be launched in thenear future, it would rapidly overrun the Continent. While russia might not possess the industrial potential for waging a long war against the democracies, she would in an early war be able tomake formidable gains, including acquisitions of fresh industrialpotential.(b) It was difficult to form an estimate of Russia&apos;s real intentions.It might be argued that her large defence preparations were actuatedby fear of the free world. In fact, however, the moves she had madesuggested an aggressive intent. The Berlin blockade had been an aggressive move, and the invasion of South Korea had clearly been planned with the assistance of Russia. The Soviet Government hadincited the North Korean Government to invade South Korea in theknowledge that this might unleash a train of events leading to general war. The Russians had now moved air and land forces intoManchuria, and this suggested that they were prepared to risk thepossibility of armed conflict with the United States Forces in Korea.Even if the Korean conflict were&apos; settled, there remained other-dangerpoints notably Persia and, possibly, Yugoslavia where an aggre-sively-minded Russia might seek by armed intervention to expand hersphere of influence. In considering the manner in which incidents in Persia or elsewhere might lead to general war, regard had to bepaid to the present temper of public opinion in the United States.The Soviet Government must see that the United States were nowembarked upon a rearmament programme which would, within aperiod of two or three years, greatly lessen Russia&apos;s prospects ofsurviving any world conflict without defeat.40067-1       &quot;    &apos; b 3

(c) The Chiefs of Staff, in their proposals, had not assumed thata major war was inevitable within the next two or three years but hadaimed to strengthen the active defences of the country for the purposeof preventing a major war. The aim had been, not only to carry out such preparations as would place our own defences on a more securebasis, but also to encourage the Governments of Western Europe to greater efforts. The Chiefs of Staff had paid regard to the fact that war was possible in 1951 and that, in 1952, Russia would be powerfulenough to go to war if she so desired.(d) The naval programme outlined in CP. (51) 16 was designedto accelerate the modernisation of the naval forces required to meetthe formidable potential menace from Russian submarines and othercraft. As regards the Army, we were under an obligation to place ninedivisions at the disposal of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation by1954. At present there was only equipment for six divisions, of whichrather more than one was in the Far East, one in the Middle Bast and four in this country with very inadequate reserves behind them. the aim was to build up a force of ten Regular Army divisions and thefirst two divisions of the Territorial Army. In order to provide the divisions promised to the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation it wouldbe necessary to draw the last two from first line Territorial divisions.The primary object of the R.A.F. programme was to correct thedangerously weak condition of Fighter Command. This involved amodernisation and extension of the Report and Control system, onwhich the defences depended, and the provision of up-to-date aircraft.Much of the equipment of the bomber force was obsolescent and someof the Auxiliary Squadrons of Fighter Command were still equipped with Spitfires.(e) The Service Departments were proposing a substantial invest -ment in new capacity in order to produce new weapons and to providefor a further expansion of the output of existing weapons after 1952.These proposals had not yet been worked out in detail and they werenot included in the estimate of total expenditure given in the mernor-andum by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (51) 20).The Chancellor of the Exchequer then gave the Cabinet an appreciation of the economic consequences of the proposed programme.Excluding the stockpiling proposals, the programme wouldinvolve additional expenditure on defence amounting to  500 million in the first year,  800 million in the second year and  1,000 million inthe third year. This estimate excluded the cost of the proposals for creating new productive capacity. In assessing the effect of this additional economic burden it must be borne in mind (i) that the termsof trade would be turning against us in 1951; (ii) that we must expectserious shortages of important raw materials; and (iii) that we couldnot expect any general financial aid from the United States, though we might obtain some assistance in kind. The main weight of theprogramme would fall on a few industries primarily engineering,building and textiles; and of these the engineering industry would bear the heaviest load. This meant that exports and investment would bothbe seriously affected, since the engineering and building industries wereimportant contributors to those programmes. How much of this burden could we afford to carry by accepting a worsening of our balance of payments position? In 1950 we had succeeded in building up a substantial surplus on our overseas account. With this defence programme, we could not hope to be able to continue to run a surplus.We should, however, set ourselves the aim of maintaining a netbalance in our overseas account excluding the oost of stockpiling,which could properly be regarded as a transfer of assets from one form to another. The impact of the programme on investment mustbe carefully controlled, so as to avoid impairing future productivity.The remainder of the resources required for the increased defence programme must be found by reducing consumption. Thus, exportsof consumer goods, especially textiles, would have to be increased, and
there would be less for the home market. The additional labour required for defence work would have to be drawn mainly from theindustries producing consumer goods. And, within the engineering industry, defence orders would have to be placed to the fullest possible extent with those sections of the industry which were producingdurable consumer goods for the home market. Supply departments could, however, help to relieve this burden on the consumer by pur-suing, to the fullest practicable extent, a policy of placing defenceorders in Europe. Tnis policy was contemplated in paragraph 54 of cp. (51) 16; and he hoped that the Supply Departments would pursueit with vigour.The programme thus involved a double diversion of industry first, from civilian to defence work; and second, from manufacturefor the home market to exports. To ensure that this diversion was achieved, the Government would have to use a number of economic controls. Fiscal and monetary policy would have to be used for thepurpose of restraining civilian demand, both for consumer goods andfor investment. The measures required for this purpose could notsuitably be discussed at the present stage. On the supply side, use would have to be made of the following controls:  (i) Allocation ofraw materials would be necessary in order to ensure that the essential needs of the defence programme and the export drive were met.(ii) Some direct controls over production for the home market wouldalso be necessary for the same purpose, e.g., Limitation of SuppliesOrders and various controls over end-uses, (iii) It was almost certainthat, in the later stages of the programme, labour controls would benecessary in order to ensure that labour was available for defence production and was drawn from the right sources, (iv) Some indi-vidual firms would have to be directed compulsorily to accept defenceorders, (v) The power to requisition factory space would have to beused, as required, (vi) Some special machinery would have to be devised for ensuring due priority for defence orders. There could beno question of any &quot; over-riding priority&quot; for defence work,(vii) Some civilian building, and investment work, would have to beset back because of the limits which must be placed on the size of thebuilding industry. In some areas the housing programme might beaffected, (viii) Some redeployment of administrative resources wouldbe necessary: Departments would have to discontinue or retard somepeace-time activities in order to free staff for defence work.What effect would this programme have on the standard ofliving? On the assumption of a 4 per cent, increase in productivity,there would be some reduction in real investment: supplies of manu-factured consumer goods would be reduced, possibly by as much as  per cent, at the end of the third year: there would be a serious shortage of textiles, including a fall of 10-15 per cent, in the amountof cloth available for the home market. In consequence there wouldprobably be some increase in the volume of personal savings. taken over the whole field of consumption, the reduction might not seemlarge. But people were accustomed to a rising standard of consump-tion, especially at a time when personal incomes were rising; and therewas little doubt that a net reduction in consumer standards wouldmake a sharp impact on public opinion. This impact would be feltmost keenly in the second year of the programme. Before that, therewould be stocks in the shops which had not been run down: and inthe third year the rate of increase in defence expenditure would decline. From this point of view the worst period would probablybe from the autumn of 1951 to the spring of 1953.In this connection the Chancellor said that it was important thatthe Service demands on the textile industries, e.g., for clothing, shouldbe reduced or at least re-phased. We should be relying largely onthese industries to meet the short-fall in exports due to the switch-over of the engineering industry to defence work; and, if too large a burden were placed on the textile industries in the first part of theperiod, it would be impossible to maintain even the minimum levelof supplies for the home market.
In conclusion the - Chancellor suggested that the Cabinet&apos;acceptance of this programme should be subject to four conditions.First, various assumptions were made in CP. (5.1) 16, e.g., about the availability of machine tools, on which further enquiries had still tobe made. Until those enquiries were complete, it could not beassumed that a programme of this magnitude could be carried throughwithin the period proposed. Secondly, if the programme were to beaccepted, the Cabinet must accept the economic implications set outin CP. (51) 20 and be ready to authorise the economic controls, andto secure the reduction in civil consumption, without which it couldnot be achieved. Thirdly, the Service and Supply Departments mustpractise the most rigid economy in their execution of the programme.They must not be allowed to proceed on the basis that they could now spend freely, or to be extravagant, e.g., in their use of techincal or administrative man-power. The Treasury must continue to applytheir normal scrutiny of all detailed proposals for expenditure.Fourthly, great care would be needed in presenting this programme to the country and securing its acceptance by public opinion.In discussion of the economic impact of the programme, thefollowing points were made:  (a) The Supply Departments were satisfied that it would bepossible to carry out the programme, if sufficient supplies of rawmaterials and machine tools could be obtained and made available but it was still open to some doubt whether this proviso could be met.The programme would, however, impose a very serious burden onthe national economy. Thus, whereas it had been contemplated thatthe  3,600 million programme would require a diversion of 200,000persons to defence production (a figure subsequently corrected to375,000), the present programme would eventually require a diversion of 650,000 persons to defence production. The increased programmealso required a further 4 per cent, of the available raw materials at atime when the supply of raw materials was becoming more difficult.Such enquiries as were practicable in the time available as to the feasibility of the programme had already been made; but, if theprogramme were approved, its requirements would have to bescrutinised phase by phase to ensure that shortages in some parts ofthe field did not delay the whole programme. Some of the scarcerraw materials, machine tools and forgings represented danger points.Unless these points were carefully watched and early rectificationseffected, there was a danger that the increased defence programmemight, in practice, yield less and not more production within the next two years.lb) It would be a matter of the greatest difficulty to maintainexports at the level predicted in the memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer. At a time when United States manufacturers werebeing required to turn from civilian to defence production, therewould be mounting resistance in the United States to an intensifieddollar export drive by this country. Many other parts of the worldwere seeking, not consumer goods, but capital equipment such asgenerating plant; and it would not, therefore, be easy to find profit-able markets for any proposed increase in the export of textiles,pottery and other consumer goods. It had yet to be shown whetherthe increase in exports which this defence programme required wasin fact attainable in terms of goods which other countries wereprepared to take.(c) The defence programme and the maintenance of the exportdrive would impose a heavy burden on the country&apos;s labour force.The number of women in industry was falling, as was the generallabour force of the country, since it would be many years before theincrease in the birth rate immediately after the war would show its effects. It was assumed that, in the early stages of the programme,the necessary movement of labour would be within firms and betweenfirms in the same locality, and that movement from one part of thecountry to another would not be required. On that assumption there
was not likely to be any need for the direction of labour in the first year. The Trade Union members of the Economic Planning board had advised against any immediate announcement foreshadowing theuse of labour controls, on the ground that opinion in industry wasnot yet prepared for such a step. The Government might, however,be compelled to state that they were prepared to re-introduce suchcontrols at a later stage if the requirements of the programme, as itdeveloped, made such action necessary.(d) Special measures would have to be taken to ensure that thisdefence programme interfered as little as possible with the housing programme. No serious reduction in house-building could beaccepted. But house construction for local authorities was the leastprofitable form of building work, and there was grave danger thatbuilding resources would be drawn away from it if other work, witha higher priority, was available. This risk could be met to someextent by the use of the licensing system, but it might also be neces-sary to reconsider the proposal that the total labour force of thebuilding industry should not be increased. The proposals of theService and Supply Departments for the construction of shadowfactories towards the end of the programme would also require close and critical scrutiny.(e) It was clear that a combination of the textile requirements ofthe Services and an endeavour to increase textile exports would havea serious effect on the amount of textiles available for domestic consumption. The Chancellor of the Exchequer had estimated that,after meeting domestic industrial requirements, there would be a fall of between 10 and 15 per cent, in the amount of textiles available forthe domestic consumer. Calculations made in the Board of Tradesuggested that the effect on the domestic consumer would be muchmore serious.(/) A broad indication of the scale of the new defence programme would have to be given to Parliament in the following week; and itwould be difficult to avoid giving some figure of total expenditure which would be comparable with the earlier figure of  3,600 million which had been announced in the autumn. In view, however, of the many uncertainties about this programme and, in particular, the lack of any assurance that the necessary supplies of raw materials and machine tools would be forthcoming it would be inexpedient forthe Government to commit themselves publicly to achieving theprogramme in full within a specified term of years. It would be preferable that any public statement should follow the line that theGovernment had adopted an increased defence programme of this magnitude and would do their utmost to carry it to completion inthe shortest possible time. It was most important, from the pointof view of public opinion in this country and in the United States,that the Government should not announce an ambitious programme and be found subsequently to be unable to carry it through. a formula on the mines suggested would give the necessary measure of flexibility.The Cabinet-Agreed to resume their discussion of the increased defence programme at a further meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,21th January, 1951.
