1. During the Committee Stage of the National Health service bill in the House of Commons five Government supporters had voted against the clause imposing charges for spectacles and dentures and about thirty-five had deliberately abstained from voting in the division.The Cabinet discussed whether similar difficulties were likely to arise on the Report Stage of the Bill and,, in particular, whether in thesecircumstances it would be expedient to proceed with an amendment of clause 1, tabled by the Minister of Health, which would involvere-committing the Bill.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary and the Chancellor of theExchequer to discuss with the Health Ministers, before theReport Stage of the Bill that afternoon, whether it wouldbe expedient to re-commit the National Health Service Billfor the purpose of amending Clause 1.The Cabinet were informed that a more serious parliamentary situation might arise later in the week, during the Committee Stage ofthe National Insurance Bill. There were strong feelings among government supporters, both in Parliament and in the country, on two points arising on this Bill. First, the view was strongly held thatthe increased rates of old age pension should be payable to menbetween the ages of 65 and 70 and women between the ages of 60 and65. Secondly, it was widely felt that the increased rates should be payable from an earlier date than 1st October.In discussion there was general agreement that much of the feel-ing on the first point would be met if it could be made clear that the supplementary allowances paid by the Assistance Board would beraised by an amount corresponding to the increase in the old age pension. This would provide relief for those old age pensioners whowere not old enough to draw the increased rate of pension but had noother substantial source of income. Hitherto the Minister of national insurance had been unable to make a firm statement on this pointsince, constitutionally, it was for the Assistance Board to take theinitiative in proposing this increase in their allowances. The cabinet agreed that the Assistance Board should be moved to consider thematter before the Committee Stage of the Bill, so that the Minister ofNational Insurance would be in a position to announce that it wasthe Board&apos;s intention to submit proposals for making this increase intheir allowances. If such an announcement were made, the Govern-ment should be able to avoid making any concession on this point.On the second point, the difficulties of the Parliamentary situation were enhanced by the fact that the Conservative Opposition had tabledan amendment proposing that the new rates should become payable on1st April. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, for his part,he was prepared to agree that the new rates should be brought intooperation somewhat earlier than 1st October; but he had been assured by the Minister of National Insurance that, in view of the administra-tive preparations which had to be made, the earliest practicable datewas 1st September. It was the general view of the Cabinet that theParliamentary difficulties were not likely to be removed by a promise to bring the new rates into operation one month earlier than theoriginal date proposed. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said thathe would be prepared to accept the additional cost involved by bring-ing the new rates into operation on 1st August, if the administrativepreparations could be completed within that time.The Cabinet-(2) Invited the Prime Minister to discuss, with the Chancellorof the Exchequer, the Home Secretary and the Ministerof National Insurance, whether it would be practicable to introduce the new rates of old age pension on1st August, 1951.-2 B 2
Strategic 2.   The Cabinet reviewed their policy for restricting the export of exports to strategic goods to China. In this connection they took into accountChina. the new Chinese offensive in Korea, the recent letter from the United(Previous        States Secretary of State on Far Eastern policy generally (which had reference:      been mentioned at the Cabinet&apos;s meeting on 3rd May CM. (51)CM. (50) 57th  33rd Conclusions, Minute 2 and was reproduced in Foreign OfficeConclusions,    telegram to Washington No. 2288, Saving, of 2nd May), and the recentMinute 4.) &apos;    criticisms expressed in the House of Commons regarding the volumeof the exports, particularly of rubber, which were still passing fromBritish territory into China. They agreed that in present circumstances there were grounds for adopting a more restrictive policy in thismatter.In discussion The President of the Board of Trade referred tothe very large increase in the volume of British exports, particularlyrubber, to China in the first quarter of 1951. This was largely due to increased consignments from Hong Kong and Singapore. The con-trols over exports from Hong Kong to China were admittedly less effective than those applied to exports from this country; and it was difficult to explain or to defend this large expansion in the volumeof exports from Hong Kong to China. Since 6th April, however,further controls had been imposed with a view to restricting China&apos;ssupplies of rubber to the amount estimated to be required to meet hernormal peace-time needs.The President said that he was to make a statement on this subject in the House of Commons that afternoon. Could he say that theGovernment were now proposing to stop altogether the export of rubber, and to restrict more closely the export of other strategic sup-plies to China, by a combination of controls administered both here and in Singapore and Hong Kong? Could he add that they intendedto substitute statutory control for the existing administrativemethods?Discussion showed that the Cabinet were not prepared toauthorise an immediate announcement in those terms. further thought must first be given to the economic and political consequences of such a policy. China would still be able to obtain rubber fromother sources; and, in order to make such an embargo completelyeffective, we might be led into prohibiting the export of rubber to any country in the Soviet orbit. Such a step would have grave economic consequences for the sterling area. Moreover, an embargo of that kind would be tantamount to the imposition of economic sanctionson China, and it was questionable whether the United KingdomGovernment should apply such sanctions unilaterally. The wisercourse would be to explore the possibility of collective sanctions under united Nations auspices.In this connection The Foreign Secretary said that he was beingstrongly pressed by the United States Government to support a moreforward policy in the Collective Measures Committee of the united nations. He had made it clear that he was opposed to the applicationof any political sanctions against China; but he believed that the time was now ripe for the Committee to put forward to the Assembly suit-able proposals for a selective embargo on the supply of war materials to China. The Committee was meeting that afternoon, and the UnitedStates representative was likely to put forward a draft resolution on those lines. He would be glad if the Cabinet would authorise him to instruct the United Kingdom representative that he need no longerseek to delay the submission of such a resolution to the Assembly.He would at the same time make it clear to the United States Secre-tary of State that the United Kingdom Government would continue to oppose any extension of this selective embargo into a general embargo,though they would not exclude the possibility of extending the list tofurther specific items of strategic importance.The Cabinet proceeded to discuss the terms of the statement which the President of the Board of Trade was to make in the House
3. The Foreign Secretary drew the Cabinefs attention to atelegram from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington (No. 1400of 6th May) reporting that &quot;General MacArthur, in his evidence beforethe Armed Services and Foreign Relations Committees of the UnitedStates Senate, had alleged that the United Kingdom Governmentsupported the policy of ceding Formosa to &quot; a potential Red enemy.&quot;The Ambassador considered that this statement, if not promptlycorrected, would be interpreted by public opinion in the United states as meaning that the United Kingdom Government were in favour of arranging that the control of Formosa should be handed overimmediately to the Peking Government. He therefore recommendedthat an immediate statement of Government policy regardingFormosa should be made in Parliament in the terms set out in his telegram. The Foreign Secretary said that he supported the ambassadors recommendation, though he would prefer a statementsomewhat differently worded from that suggested by the Ambassador.In discussion it was suggested that it might be inexpedient for theUnited Kingdom Government to make such a statement at a timewhen the Congressional hearings in Washington were still proceeding.Their views about Formosa were already sufficiently well known, bothin this country and in the United States. By re-stating them formallyat this time they might appear to be intervening in what was essentially a domestic dispute between the two political parties in theUnited States. The preponderant view in the Cabinet was, however,in favour of adopting the Ambassador^ suggestion that an early state-ment should be made in order to correct the misapprehensions whichChina.Formosa.(previous reference:CM. (50) 76thConclusions,Minute 6.)of Commons that afternoon. They decided that, with the agreementof the Secretary of State for the Colonies, this statement should bebroadened so as to cover exports from Hong Kong and Singapore aswell as from the United Kingdom. They further agreed that the state-ment should cover the Question addressed to the Prime Minister bysMr. Geoffrey Hutchinson, M.P., asking what representations had beenreceived from the United States Government urging further measuresto prevent the export of war-like materials from Hong Kong to China:the Prime Minister could then answer that Question by inviting theHouse to await the detailed statement to be made by the President ofthe Board of Trade. In his statement the President, after giving someof the main facts and figures regarding the export of strategic supplies to China, would go on to say that, as the Good Offices Committee ofthe United Nations had failed to make progress towards achieving apolitical settlement with the Peking Government, the United King-dom Government were now considering what further measures couldbe taken to restrict the supply of strategic goods to China, and thatthis was being actively considered in consultation with the colonial governments concerned and also in the United Nations.The Cabinet (1) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to make, in theHouse of Commons that afternoon, a statement aboutstrategic exports to China on the lines approved in thecourse of the Cabinet&apos;s discussion.(2) Invited the President of the Board of Trade and the Secretaryof State for the Colonies to submit to the Economic PolicyCommittee detailed proposals for imposing further restrictions on the export of strategic supplies to China.(3) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to instruct the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations that heneed no longer seek to delay the submission of a resolutionfrom the Additional Measures Committee to the Assemblyof the United Nations recommending the imposition of a selective embargo on the supply of war materials to china.
were iikely to be aroused by General MacArthur&apos;s evidence before the senate Committees. The following suggestions were made regardingthe form of the proposed statement: -(a) It should be brought out clearly that the United States wereone of the parties to the Cairo Declaration. This point tended to be overlooked.,(b) It was suggested that use might be made of the argument thatthe Cairo Declaration should be considered as a whole and that the peking Government, having repudiated that part of it whichconcerned Korea, could not properly use it to support their claim toFormosa. Some members of the Cabinet felt, however, that this wasa debating point which was inappropriate to a statement of this kind and might provoke controversy in the United States.(c) The Ambassadors draft included a sentence recognising thatit would be a matter for argument to which Chinese authorityFormosa should be ceded. This might imply a possibility that formosa would be handed over to Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Government.It would be inexpedient that any formal statement on behalf of theUnited Kingdom Government should appear to envisage such apossibility.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that an early statement should be made in parliament on the Government^ policy regarding Formosa, as suggested in Washington telegram No. 1400 of 6th May.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to settle the terms of that state-ment in consultation with the Foreign Secretary.Central Africa. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the closer Secretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State forAssociation of Commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 122) submitting the report of aSouthern conference of officials recently held in London to consider the closerRhodesia, association of Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland,Northern&apos; and recommending that the report should be published with aRhodesia, and Government  statement  commending  its  proposals  for   carefulNyasaland. consideration by the peoples concerned.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that itwas widely known that this conference of officials had been held andthat its report had been submitted to Governments.   The report;&apos; should therefore be published without delay. It was desirable that atthe same time the United Kingdom Government should issue a state-ment inviting careful consideration of the recommendations in thereport, because it was feared that many interests in the three terri-tories concerned would otherwise be inclined to reject out of hand the federal solution Which it proposed. Publication was speciallyurgent because the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia was anxiousto use this report as a reason for withholding his Governmenfs viewson another report on the question of Dominion status for SouthernRhodesia. Dr. Huggins could only avoid committing &quot;himself on that, issue if he could say that the report of the conference was shortly tobe published and that the status of Southern Rhodesia would have tobe considered in the light of the wider considerations raised in that report.In discussion several Ministers expressed doubt whether, in viewof the short time which they had had to study the report, the cabinet could give even the general commendation for its proposals contem-plated in the draft statement set out in Annex III of CP. (51) 122.The other interested Departments had not been consulted: inparticular, the Ministry of Defence had not had an opportunity toconsider the defence aspects of the recommendations made in thereport. On merits, it was not clear that the small European popula-tion in the.three territories could effectively man the rather compli-cated machinery of government which the report envisaged; and, if further consideration showed that the recommendations were botl
5. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Secretary of Statefor Scotland (CP. (51) 117) and by the Lord Chancellor (CP. (51) 120)on the question whether The King should be advised to agree to thetransfer of the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey to an appro-priate place in Scotland.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that the publicity givento the removal of the Stone from Wesminster Abbey had led to considerable feeling in Scotland that the Stone ought to be returnedto Scotland. He suggested that it should be placed in St. MargaretsChapel in Edinburgh Castle. It could be made clear that a decisionto return the Stone to Scotland in no way condoned the action ofthose who had removed the Stone from Westminster Abbey.The Lord Chancellor said, with reference to paragraph 1 (b) ofhis memorandum (CP. (51) 120), that if it were decided to remove theStone from Westminster Abbey His Majesty would act on the advice of his Ministers and not, as stated, in the memorandum, after consulting Parliament. He considered, however, that a decision onthis subject should be postponed.   The theft was too recent.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be wiser to postpone for at least a year the decision on the advice to be given toThe King about the location of the Stone. Any decision taken nowto agree to its return to Scotland would be widely regarded as a concession to the recent act of vandalism in Westminster Abbey. Themost that could be said now would be that the Government wouldbe prepared to consider in due course what advice they should give to His Majesty on this question.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to postpone for the time being consideration of thequestion whether the Stone of Scone should be returnedto Scotland.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consult thePrime Minister on the terms of any public statement to theeffect that Ministers did not propose in present circum-stances to consider what advice to give to The King onthis subject, but that they would examine the issues involved at some future date.Stone ofScone.(previous reference:CM. (51) 29thConclusions,Minute 4.)impracticable and unacceptable to the peoples concerned, the UnitedKingdom Government would be in an embarrassing position if theyhad seemed to give broad approval to them. Nor was it clear thatsuch a commendation by the United Kingdom Government wouldinfluence the peoples concerned if they felt that the proposals rancounter to their own best interests. On the other hand it was pointedout that, unless Southern Rhodesia could be given the opportunityof association with her northern neighbours, there was grave danger that she would be drawn into closer association with the Union ofSouth Africa.The Cabinet- &apos;(1) Agreed that the report of the conference on a closer associa-tion between Southern Rhodesia, Northern Rhodesia and nyasaland should be published in a month or six weeks&apos;time.(2) Agreed to resume their discussion of CP. (51) 122 and ofthe draft statement proposed in Annex III of that memo-randum, as soon as the Secretary of State for the Coloniesreturned from his forthcoming visit to East Africa.
