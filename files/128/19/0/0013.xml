Korea.(previous reference:CM. (51) 11thConclusions,Minute 7.)1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of State (CP. (51) 46) on the question whether the united nations Forces in Korea should proceed north of the 38th Parallel.The Minister of State said that, for the reasons indicated in his memorandum, he strongly recommended that the United nations forces should not seek to advance beyond the 38th Parallel. Thisview had already been expressed informally to the political andmilitary authorities in Washington, and reassuring replies had beenreceived. He now recommended, however, that the United StatesGovernment should be asked formally to confirm that the united nations Forces would not advance beyond the 38th Parallel withouta fresh political decision, and that this would be a matter, not forthe United States Government alone, but for the United Nations and,in particular, those member States who had contributed to the united nations Forces in Korea. Finally, he recommended that, if theUnited Nations Forces established a line south of the 38th Parallel,even minor penetrations and assaults beyond it should, if possible, be avoided.The Minister added that there had been Press reports that morning to the effect that some South Korean forces had alreadyproceeded beyond the 38th Parallel. This made it all the more urgentthat an approach should be made to the United States Governmenton the lines recommended.The First Sea Lord said that he had no official information about these reported movements by South Korean forces. The Chiefs ofStaff were in broad agreement with the recommendations put forward in CP. (51) 46. The restriction against proceeding north of the38th Parallel could not, however, be absolute. If the United nations forces established a line on the basis of the 38th Parallel, there wouldprobably be some points at which the line must go slightly beyond it by reason of the nature of the terrain. Equally, the United NationsCommander must have some discretion to press tactical counter-attacks beyond the 38th Parallel. And he must be free to launch air attacks on enemy troop concentrations and lines of communication to the north of the Parallel.In discussion there was general support for the recommendations made in CP. (51) 46, subject to the qualification suggested on behalfof the Chiefs of Staff. The Cabinet also thought it advisable that theirviews on this question should be made public without delay, and the\invited the Prime Minister to include a statement on this point in his speech in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons that afternoon.40154The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the view that the United Nations Forces in Koreashould not advance beyond a line which would followbroadly the 38th Parallel, subject to such local variationsas the tactical situation might require.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to make it known, in the courseof the foreign affairs debate in the House of commons that afternoon, that this was the view of the UnitedKingdom Government.(3) Agreed that the United States Government should be askedformally to confirm that the United Nations Forces wouldnot advance beyond the 38th Parallel without a freshpolitical decision taken, not by the United States Govern-ment alone, but by the United Nations.(4) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations to inform other commonwealth governments accordingly.b 2
Pacific Defence. 2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of1?previous State (CP. (51) 47) regarding a proposal for a Pacific Defence CouncilReference: which was being canvassed by Mr. John Foster Dulles in the courseCM. (51) 1st of the mission which he had undertaken on President Truman&apos;s behalfConclusions, in preparation for a Japanese Peace Treaty.Minute 4.)The Minister of State said that the Pacific Defence Councilproposed by Mr. Dulles would comprise the United States, Japan,the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand; but it would exclude the countries of South-East Asia, and the United Kingdom would be associated with it only on a consultative basis. This proposal wouldgive Australia and New Zealand the assurance which they soughtthat United States assistance would be forthcoming if any attack weremade on their territories; but it was open to strong objection fromthe United Kingdom point of view. World opinion would interpretit as a renunciation of our responsibilities in the Pacific; it would cause serious alarm in South-East Asia, particularly in Hong kong and Malaya; and it might have the effect of diverting Australian andNew Zealand forces from the Middle East in a major war. Latertelegrams from Washington indicated that the United States Govern-ment might now be inclined to favour, instead of this proposal, theconclusion of a tripartite pact by which the United States, Australiaand New Zealand would each undertake to go to the aid of the others in the event of hostilities affecting the interests of any one of them inthe Pacific. It was, however, recommended that the Governments ofthe United States, Australia and New Zealand should at once beinformed of the objections which the United Kingdom Governmentsaw to the proposal outlined by Mr. Dulles.In discussion there was general agreement with the views expressed by the Minister of State. Mr. Dulles&apos;s conception of thedefence of an island chain in the Pacific was unsound, both politically and militarily. If this emphasis were laid on the island chain, the americans might at a later stage insist that Formosa formed partof it; and Australia and New Zealand might find themselves expectedto support on that account a United States claim to Formosa. the exclusion of the mainland countries of South-East Asia would be a source of special embarrassment to the United Kingdom Government.The First Sea Lord said that in the global strategy which theChiefs of Staff had discussed with the United States Chiefs of Staff,the Far East was a United States commitment and the Middle East a commonwealth commitment. Australia and New Zealand had been reluctant to commit themselves fully to co-operation in the middle east until they had more definite information about United Statesintentions in the Pacific. But the best way of allaying their anxietieswould be for the United States to guarantee their security in a major war, possibly through a tripartite pact on the lines mentioned by theMinister of State.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the objections, outlined in CP. (5.1) 47, to a PacificDefence Council excluding the United Kingdom and the mainland countries of South-East Asia; and agreed that every effort should be made to find alternative means ofallaying the anxieties of Australia and New Zealand, e.g.,by a United States guarantee of their security in war.(2) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Com-commonwealth Relations to arrange for these view to be conveyed to the Australian and New zealand governments.(3) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for these views to be conveyed to the United States Government and toMr. Dulles.
Germany.Soviet Proposalfor a Meetingof the Councilof foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 11thConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State (CP. (51) 48) giving the text of the latest note from the SovietGovernment regarding their proposal for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers, and outlining alternative replies which might besent to that note.The Minister of State said that the first alternative, outlined inparagraph 7 of CP. (51) 48, was to insist that preliminary discussions could be held only if the Soviet Government clearly accepted our pro-posal for a wider agenda going beyond the demilitarisation ofGermany. He did not himself favour sending so firm a reply: therewas a grave risk that, if we took that line, the whole project of a four-Power meeting would break down at that stage. It was important that, if the attempt to hold such a meeting failed, respon-sibility for the failure should rest clearly with the Soviet Government.He therefore favoured the more conciliatory reply outlined in para-graphs 8 and 9 of CP. (51) 48. This, while rebutting the arguments in the Soviet note, would emphasise our own desire for a meeting on a wide agenda that would deal with the real causes of international tension; and it would end by proposing a definite time and place forthe preliminary meeting of officials which was to prepare the agenda for the Ministerial meeting.The Minister said that, since his memorandum was circulated,some information had become available regarding the attitude of theUnited States and French Governments. The Americans were inclined to suggest to the Soviet Government that officials should nowmeet to prepare an agenda which would include at least the following general subjects: &quot; causes of existing tension in Europe, includingthe level of existing armaments, the situation in South-eastern europe and other factors; completion and signature of the treaty forthe re-establishment of an independent and democratic Austria;problems affecting Germany; and elimination of barriers to friendlyofficial and unofficial contacts between Governments and peoples.&quot;The French were also in favour of giving at this stage a fairly preciseindication of the subjects which we should wish to see included in theagenda; for they feared that no progress would be made in the pre-liminary discussions between officials unless it had been made clear inadvance that we must insist upon a wider agenda than that envisaged by the Soviet Government.The Minister of State said that, despite these indications of american and French views, he would still prefer a broader reply onthe lines suggested in paragraphs 8 and 9 of his memorandum.The Cabinet agreed that the first alternative proposed in para-graph 7 of CP. (51) 48 should be rejected. They were at firstinclined to favour giving a list of subjects for discussion on the lines proposed by the Americans. They were, however, informed that theSoviet Government were almost certain to object to the first and thelast of the subjects in this list on the ground that they went beyondthe terms of reference assigned to the Council of Foreign Ministers inthe Protocol of the Potsdam Conference. A more general reply, onthe lines suggested in paragraph 9 of CP. (51) 48, would also have theadvantage of allowing rather more time for detailed consideration ofthe subjects to be included in the agenda.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the reply to the latest note from the SovietGovernment should follow the lines indicated in para-graphs 8 and 9 of CP. (51) 48.(2) Invited the Minister of State to seek to persuade the UnitedStates and French Governments to agree to the earlydespatch of a reply on those lines.
Call-up of 4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofAgricultural Labour (CP. (51) 49) proposing that the call-up of agricultural workers. workers for national service should be suspended during the period of(Previous the harvest in 1951, that deferment on grounds of hardship should be reference: restricted to small farms in remote areas and that an announcementCM. (51) 8th of the Cabinefs decision to discontinue the policy of deferring the call-Conclusions, up of agricultural workers should be made on 15th February at the minute 2.) end of the Defence debate.The Minister of Labour said that these proposals were designedto meet some of the difficulties which the Agriculture Ministers feltabout the calling up of agricultural workers for national service.While it was reasonable to leave on the farms as large a labour force as practicable for the corn and potato harvests, he did not think thatany arrangements for deferment could go beyond allowing theretention of workers on farms employing not more than two workers and situated in relatively remote areas where alternative labour wasnot available. Deferment would have to be confined to cases inwhich the call-up would cause a substantial loss of agricultural output.An early announcement was necessary, so that the Service authoritiesand the men concerned could have reasonable notice of what was pro-posed. He did not think that the call-up of 15,000 young men could have a very serious effect on the output of an industry with a total labour force of nearly one million. Account should also be taken ofthe resentment felt about the total deferment of agricultural workers,particularly among men engaged in work which brought them intoclose touch with the agricultural population.The Minister of Agriculture said that he hoped it would bepossible to review the whole policy of calling-up agricultural workers for national service. Over a period of years a considerable numberwould be drawn away from agriculture for national service. He didnot see what useful purpose would be served by giving militarytraining to men who, in war, would have to be excused military servicebecause of a paramount need to produce food. Moreover, the pro-posed calling-up of 15,000 men a year had to be considered in relationto the current wastage from agriculture to industry: about 20,000workers had left agriculture for other industries in a recent period of twelve months. The public were gravely concerned about the currentmeat shortage and would not understand the adoption at this junctureof a policy which would jeopardise agricultural output, includingthe production of livestock.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Most sections of the community would have to make severesacrifices in connection, with the defence programme. The calling-up for training of Z reservists, the retention of time-expired regularsand the calling-up of regular reservists for periods of from twelvemonths to eighteen months would impose considerable hardship onthe individuals concerned. In these circumstances agricultural workers could not expect to continue to enjoy complete immunity from call-up.(b) The fact that in war some agricultural workers would beexcused military service did not warrant the exemption from militarytraining of all the young men now employed in agriculture. In war there would be a number of other reserved occupations which atpresent did not enjoy this exemption from national service. The true position was that (save for coal-mining where present, not future,circumstances rendered deferment necessary) all sections of the com-munity would undergo military training, but the numbers andcategories which would be called up for service in the event of war would depend on the nature and size of the conflict.(c) If agricultural workers were not called up until after thisyear&apos;s harvest, it would nOt be practicable for the Services to absorb the annual intake of 15,000 between November 1951 and the spring
War Crimes.(previous reference:CM. (51) 12thConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Minister ofState (CP. (51) 38) and by the Attorney-General (CP. (51) 45) on theexercise of clemency towards Germans convicted of war crimes.The Minister of State said that, as the Control Council for germany was in abeyance, any modification of the sentences passed on major war criminals by the International Military Tribunal atNuremberg would be a matter for joint decision by the Governmentsof the United Kingdom, United States, France and Russia. The cases which fell within the jurisdiction of the United Kingdom High Com-missioner were those of persons sentenced by British military courts and now confined in the British Zone of Germany. Some of the state-ments made by the High Commissioner in answer to questions at theend of a press conference at the British Press Club in Berlin in theprevious month had, admittedly, been badly worded. The High Com-missioner had not intended to suggest that the Nuremberg Tribunalhad been moved by hatred and revenge in the sentences passed on major war criminals: he had meant only to indicate that the review which he proposed to make of the sentences passed by British military courts would be conducted in a judicial spirit. The High Commis-sioner was constantly receiving petitions from church leaders andothers in Germany on behalf of individual prisoners, and he felt obliged to review these cases in the light of the representations madeto him.The Lord Chancellor said that he had seen the High Commis-sioner, who admitted that some of the language which he had used atthe Press conference at the British Press Club had been unfortunate.In regard to the recent remissions of sentence by the United Statesof 1952. Nor could it be said that the loss of between 3,000 and 4,000workers who would be called up in May, June and July 1951, would represent a serious strain on agriculture. At the same time it was felt that, if the call-up were postponed until after the harvest, theGovernment would show the agricultural industry that they had sym-pathetically considered the difficulties in which it would be placed andthat they were giving time for any necessary readjustments to be made.id) On the assumption that the call-up of agricultural workerswas held over until after the harvest, there was no reason why anannouncement of the decision to discontinue the policy of deferringthe call-up of agricultural workers should not be made in the course ofthe forthcoming Defence debate. The Minister of Defence couldexplain that his figure of 179,000 men to be called up in the presentyear would be subject to adjustment as a result of discussions whichwould take place between the Ministry of Labour, the AgricultureDepartments, the farmers and the agricultural unions.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decision to discontinue the policy of deferring the call-up of agricultural workers for nationalservice, but agreed that agricultural workers should notbe called up until November 1951.(2) Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 49 for dealing with casesof hardship.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to announce the Govern-ment&apos;s decision in the course of the Defence debate.(4) Invited the Minister of Labour and the Agriculture ministers to discuss with the organisations representing farmers and agricultural workers the detailed arrangements for imple-menting the Cabinet&apos;s decision.
High Commissioner, Mr. McCloy&apos;s hand had in a sense been forcedby the findings of a Clemency Board, including a United States judge.The United Kingdom High Commissioner had not been consulted onthe merits of the proposal to release Alfried Krupp von Bohlen undHalbach and to return his property, but simply about the legal con-sequences in the British Zone which would follow from the decisionto revoke the order for the confiscation of property. The High Com-missioner felt that he had a personal responsibility to review sentencesby British military courts in the light of the petitions which he received, but there was no reason to believe that he had in mind any widespread remission of sentences, particularly in view of the pains-taking review of these cases which had been made by a War CrimesReview Board in 1949 under the Chairmanship of Major-GeneralWade.The Attorney-General said that the memorandum which he had submitted was not based on any doubts regarding the rearmament of western Germany; but it was certainly unfortunate that the releaseof Krupp and other war criminals in the United States Zone and the statements by the United Kingdom High Commissioner should have come at a time when so much public anxiety was being shown in thiscountry about the proposal to rearm Western Germany. He did not feel that the Cabinet had yet had an adequate explanation of the high commissioners reference to &quot; hatred and revenge as bad counsel-lors,&quot; which had been widely interpreted as a reflection on theNuremberg Tribunal and on the British military courts. Moreover, indealing with the heinous crimes which many of the German war criminals had committed, he found it difficult to understand in whatrespects &quot; circumstances had changed,&quot; a phrase which, according toPress accounts, the High Commissioner had used in his remarks. Sofar as it was necessary to secure some uniformity in the scale ofpunishments inflicted, this had been attempted when the sentenceswere scrutinised before confirmation, and less than eighteen months ago Major-General Wade had conducted a painstaking review of the sentences, which had resulted in fifty-eight being reduced. In addi-tion, twenty-seven sentences had been remitted since that review. Heoould see no justification for an endless series of general reviews ofthese sentences, though individual cases might have to be considered from time to time. Considerable resentment was already beingexpressed in this country at the suggestion that further remissions of sentence might now be contemplated.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Ministers were not satisfied that German opinion as a wholefavoured the exercise of clemency towards German war criminals.The Social Democrats would not desire the release of Nazis and ofmembers of the officer class who had supported them. In this country it was clear that there was widespread resentment at any suggestion of a policy of leniency towards war criminals. Having regard to thestate of public opinion in this country, it was unfortunate that theUnited Kingdom High Commissioner, when consulted about Krupp,had not thought it right to warn the Foreign Secretary of the actioncontemplated by the United States High Commissioner, so that repre-sentations might have been made to the United States Government.(b) When the military government of Germany had been theresponsibility of the Secretary of State for War, ultimate responsibilityfor any review of sentences on war criminals had rested with theSecretary of State, and any action proposed by the High Commis-sioner had been subject to ministerial, and ultimately to Cabinet,control. When responsibility was transferred to the Foreign Secre-tary, the Foreign Secretary had signed an instrument of delegation which placed responsibility on the High Commissioner to reviewcases and remit sentences when he thought it proper to do so. Itwas not clear whether the High Commissioner had received any
instructions or guidance on the manner in which he was to exercisethis delegated authority. *Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick Considered that hehad been given a personal responsibility, in the exercise of which he must be guided by his conscience. He had assumed that he shouldnot seek ministerial guidance on the exercise of this duty. He had indicated, however, that he would be glad to be relieved of the exclusive responsibility for reviewing these cases.-(c) The Home Secretary and the Secretary of State for Scotlanddid not consider that, save in very exceptional circumstances, it wasproper for them to seek the advice of their Cabinet colleagues on thedischarge of their responsibility to advise on the exercise of the pre-rogative of mercy in individual cases. The ultimate responsibility,which was of a personal character, rested with the Minister. TheUnited Kingdom High Commissioner in Germany might, on oneview, be regarded as an official responsible to the Foreign Secretarywhile, on another view, he might be regarded as more akin to theGovernor of a Colony who advised on the prerogative of mercywithout reference to the Colonial Secretary.(d) The Cabinet were inclined to the view that this duty ofreviewing the sentences of war criminals should not continue to be delegated to the High Commissioner, or that he should at any ratebe expected to seek the Foreign Secretary&apos;s guidance on the moreimportant cases. The release of prominent war criminals hadpolitical repercussions.(e) The United States Government should be asked to give theUnited Kingdom Government an opportunity to make representa-tions to them before any further decisions were taken to release war criminals in the United States Zone.There was general agreement that, in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Commons later that day, the Prime Minister shouldallay public anxiety by giving a general indication of the Govern-menfs policy in respect of German war criminals.The Prime Minister said that, in the light of the Cabinefs dis-cussion, he had it in mind to say that some of the remarks made bySir Ivone Kirkpatrick at the Press conference at the British Press Clubin Berlin had been unfortunate. He would explain that, under thepowers delegated to him the High Commissioner had initiated ageneral review of all cases before any question of German rearmament -ment arose, but it should not be assumed that this review would necessarily result in any general reduction of sentences. The powerto review these cases had been delegated absolutely to the High Com-missioner, but the Government were now considering, at the requestof Sir Ivone Kirkpatrick, what the future position should be. Asregards the release of Krupp, he Would explain that the UnitedKingdom High Commissioner had no responsibility for what hadbeen done in the United States Zone, and that he had not been con-suited on the merits of the proposal to release Krupp and to restorehis property but only on the legal effect in the British Zone of the revocation of the order for the confiscation of his property.The Cabinet (1) Approved the statement which the Prime Minister proposedto make in the House of Commons later that day on thequestion of clemency to German war criminals.(2) Invited the Minister of State to submit proposals on themanner in which responsibility for reviewing the sentences. of German war criminals should be exercised in future.(3) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to ask the State Departmentto ensure that the United Kingdom Government had anopportunity of making representations in regard to anyproposed remission of sentences on German war criminals held in the United States Zone of Germany.
6. The Cabinet considered amemorandum by the Minister ofLocal Government and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (51)44) on the question whether the Bill to deal with the restoration ofland devastated by ironstone workings should include general pro-visions on mineral working rights.The Minister of Local Government&quot;said no difficulty arose onthe clauses of the Bill relating to ironstone workings, and the text ofthose clauses had been approved by the Legislation Committee. Hehad suggested to the Lord Presidents Committee that, as this iegis-lation was being introduced, the opportunity should be taken to dealwith some difficulties which had arisen in regard to mineral-workingrights generally; and he had proposed that the Planning ministers should be empowered to make an Order giving a mineral undertakerthe right to work for minerals on land or to buy the land compul-compulsorily. The Lord Presidents Committee had seen objection to thisproposal and had proposed that the Planning Ministers should been abled to vest mineral rights in themselves and empowered either towork the minerals or to grant leases to others to work them. TheLegislation Committee had been impressed by the political con-troversy which the latter proposal might arouse and,, in view of theGovernments difficulty in getting legislation through the present parliament, the matter had been referred to the Cabinet. In all thecircumstances, the best course might be to revert to the proposalswhich the Secretary of State for Scotland and he had originally put before the Lord Presidents Committee.In discussion, attention was drawn to the objections to any extension of the practice of using compulsory powers to transfer aprivate right from one individual to another. At the same time, itwas recognised that the solution proposed by the Lord presidents committee would give rise to acute controversy and would probablyjeopardise the passage of the provisions of the Bill relating to iron-stone workings, although these provisions were urgently required.The general view of the Cabinet was that the Mineral Working Billshould be restricted to the restoration of land devastated by ironstoneworkings and that legislation on mineral working rights should bedealt with separately.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Mineral Workings Bill should deal only with ironstone workings.(2) Invited the Minister of Local Government and the Secretaryof State for Scotland to bring before the Lord presidents committee proposals for dealing in a separate measurewith the exploration and working of minerals.industrial 7.   The Minister of Labour said that he understood that the disputes. London dockers had now agreed to an immediate return to workDocks Strike, but had decided to strike again, with pickets, on Tuesday, 20th Feb-ruary, the day on which the men arrested for inciting an illegal strike would appear again at Bow Street Police Court. It was expectedthat, in view of the decision taken by the London dockers, the liverpool men would go back to work.In discussion, attention was drawn to the failure of the B.B.C.to publish the relevant parts of a speech made by the Attorney-General at Buckingham on 9th February, in which he had pointedout that the arrested men were not dockers on strike but agitators.The view was expressed that the B.B.C. in its news bulletins hadtended to exaggerate the extent of the dock strike and had failed todraw attention to the number of men who had remained at workand to the areas, such as the Clyde, which had remained entirelyunaffected.   It was suggested that this might in some measure beMineral&apos; -Workings Bill.(Previous&apos;&apos;&apos;Reference:CM. (49) 47thConclusions,Minute 4.)
due to bias shown by the Press agencies from which the B.B.C.drew their news, and that it might be necessary to try to build up adirect contact between, for example, the Dock Labour Board andthe B.B.C.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the statement by the Minister of Labour.(2) Invited the Lord President to examine the B.B.C.&apos;s handling of news relating to the dock strike, and to considerwhether any change should be suggested in the channelsthrough which the B.B.C. obtained news in matters ofthis kind.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,12th February, 1951.
