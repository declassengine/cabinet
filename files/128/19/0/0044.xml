leasehold reform.(previous reference:CM. (50) 83rdConclusions,Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Lord Chan-cellor (CP. (51) 163) on the attitude which the Government should adopt towards Lords&apos; amendments to the Leasehold Property(Temporary Provisions) Bill.        ^The Lord Chancellor said that it was desirable that the Billshould receive the Royal Assent in time for its provisions to come intooperation at the beginning of the new quarter on 24th June. Variousnon-controversial provisions in Part II of the Bill should operate ontenancies of shops which would otherwise terminate at the end of thepresent quarter. Since the Commons would -consider the Lords&apos;amendments on 20th June and the Lords would discuss the commons&apos; rejoinders on 21st June, there was little time for an inter-change of messages between the two Houses, if the Bill was to receivethe Royal Assent by 21st or 22nd June; and this gave a special importance to the Government^ attitude towards the more contro-versial amendments introduced by the House of Lords. One of these amendments would, in certain circumstances, involve the forfeitureof an extended tenancy where the tenant had allowed the property to fall into serious disrepair. In the House of Commons the Govern-ment had been prepared to allow the landlord various remedies afterthe conclusion of an extended tenancy, but had opposed any for-forfeiture of the tenancy for failure to observe repairing covenantsbecause this would seriously weaken the protection enjoyed by thetenant. There was, therefore, no alternative but to oppose the Lords&apos;amendment on this subject. Another Lords&apos; amendment was designed to deprive of protection a lessee who was really an investorbut had managed to get into residence just before the end of the lease.It might be possible to devise a compromise which required a quali-fying period of two months&apos; residence by the lessee or his familybetween the date of the introduction of the Bill and the expiry of the lease, but this would do little to meet the real point of the Lords&apos;amendment, though they might be prepared to accept it.The Attorney-General said that he did not think that the Govern-ment should offer any compromise on either of the amendments towhich the Lord Chancellor had referred. The possibility that aninvestor might manage to secure protection under the Bill by taking up residence just before the end of the lease had been mentioned inthe House of Commons, but the view had been taken that any pro-vision designed to cut out this rare type of case would cause hardshipin a variety of cases where protection should be afforded.There was general agreement that the Lord&apos;s amendments, towhich the Lord Chancellor had referred, should be resisted in theHouse of Commons. It seemed doubtful whether the House of lords would wish to put in jeopardy the immediate application of Part ii of the Bill relating to shop tenancies; but, if some days had to be spent in convincing the House of Lords that the Government didnot propose to give way, then an endeavour would have to be madeto introduce amendments which would give Part II of the Bill someretrospective effect.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should resist the Lords&apos;amendments to the Leasehold Property (Temporary Pro-visions) Bill, referred to in CP.

integration of French andGerman Goaland steel industries.(previous reference:CM. (51) 40thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 164) proposing that the Governments signing the schuman Plan Treaty should be informed that the United KingdomGovernment were agreeable that the existing controls over Germanheavy industry should be abolished When the appropriate machineryUnder the Schuman Plan Treaty came into Operation, on condition that the needs Of the British defence industry for scrap and semi-finished steel products were adequately met.The Parliamentary tinder-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that British defence needs could be met by a joint declaration bythe Governments concerned that the Allied controls over german industry would be abolished at the appropriate time, subject to adequate fulfilment by the Germans Of the guarantee of &quot; equitableapportionment,&quot; given by the Federal Chancellor in February 1951.Alternatively, when joining with the other Governments concerned inmaking a joint declaration about the abolition of the existing Alliedcontrols, the United Kingdom Government might make a unilateral declaration that they would only agree to the abolition of controls if their defence needs were being adequately met under the equitableapportionment guarantee.It was the general view of Ministers that a joint declaration by allthe Governments concerned was preferable to a unilateral declara-tion, provided that the joint declaration made if clear that, not onlyshould the German Government give assurances, but there should be reasonable grounds for believing that they would carry out thoseassurances in a satisfactory manner. In view of past experience, itwas essential that the Minister of Supply should be satisfied as to themethods to be adopted for fulfilling the guarantee about supplies of scrap and semi-finished steel products and the dates by which these supplies would be forthcoming.The Cabinet Approved the recommendation in paragraph 4 of CP. (51)164, and the joint declaration in paragraph 5 (i), subject tothe redrafting Of the joint declaration to make it clear thatthe abolition of the existing controls over German heavyindustry was conditional on a satisfactory performance&quot;of German assurances relating to supplies of scrap and semi-finished steel products for defence needs,French 3.   The Foreign Secretary gave the. Cabinet the&apos; latest for-Elections. mation about the progress of the French eletions. The results of the voting were nOw known for 500 out of the 629 seats. If the remainingresults followed the same pattern, the central Parties would have anincreased influence in the new Chamber. The Communists hadpolled fewer votes, and won fewer seats than on the last occasion.About 80 per cent.&apos; of the electorate had gone to the polls.Germany. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that agreement had been reachedSoviet Proposal between the three Western Powers upon the terms of a note to the for a Meeting Soviet Government which was broadly in accord with the viewsof Foreign expressed in the Cabinefs discussion on 14th June. The note hadMinisters. been delivered at the end of the preceding week, and its terms had(Previous been made public before the voting took place in the French elections.Reference: The French Government were gratified that this had been done, and cm. (51) 43rd - were grateful to the United Kingdom Government for their help in conclusions, securing United States agreement to this course.Minute 4,) The Foreign Secretary said that he had been considering how
any Soviet response to this note should be handled. The Soviet Gov-ernment might be willing that the four Foreign Ministers should meeton the basis suggested in the note. In that event he would favour ameeting in October: it would be difficult now to adhere to the date at the end of July which had originally been suggested. If, on theother hand, the Soviet Government declined to meet on the basissuggested, he proposed that his Deputy in Paris should state that inthese circumstances the Deputies could make no further progress forthe time being, that further consultations between -the four Govern-ments would have to be carried on through diplomatic channels, butthat the Deputies could if necessary resume their discussions at alater stage for the purpose of completing the arrangements for ameeting. If, however, the Soviet Government put forward somecounter-proposal of their own, the United Kingdom Deputy shouldpromise to refer this to his Government for consideration.In discussion several Ministers stressed the importance of avoid-ing the impression that the project for a Meeting of Foreign ministers had been abandoned because their Deputies had failed to reach agreement in their discussions in Paris. Many people believed that failure to arrange for a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers would bring the danger of war appreciably nearer; and it was arguable thatthe hope of reaching some settlement with the Russians should not be finally abandoned until the Foreign Ministers had themselves made anattempt to reach such a settlement. The Deputies might well be reluctant to prolong their discussions; but there were many people who felt that, so long as talks continued, there was less risk of an openrupture of relations between East and West.On the other hand, it was argued that, however serious the con-sequences of a failure by the Deputies to agree upon an agenda for ameeting of Ministers, the position might be even more serious if theForeign Ministers had themselves met and failed to reach any agree-ment. If the Soviet Government rejected the latest proposal of theWestern Powers, the United Kingdom representative in Paris might make an immediate response on the lines suggested by the foreign secretary; but this would have to be followed by a statement in theHouse of Commons, in which the Foreign Secretary could make itclear that he had not closed his mind to the possibility of a meetingof Foreign Ministers. The more likely development was, however,that the Soviet Government would return an argumentative reply towhich a reasoned answer would have to be given; and in that event the Cabinet would have an opportunity of considering the terms ofthe proposed answer.The Cabinet Approved the instructions which the Foreign Secretary was proposing to give to his Deputy in Paris regarding the imme-diate response which he should make to any Soviet reply tothe latest note from the three Western Powers.5. The Foreign Secretary said that, in the final discussions withMr. Dulles regarding the draft announcement on China&apos;s participation in the Japanese Peace Treaty, it had not proved possible to secure agreement to the formula about Formosa which the Cabinet had approved at their meeting on 1.1th June, viz., that the future of the island had still to be discussed &quot; in the light of the Charter of theUnited Nations.&quot; Mr. Dulles had been unwilling to accept theaddition of those concluding words. It was therefore proposed that each Government should be free to make its own statement inexplanation of the joint announcement. The United Kingdom Gov-ernment would state that, in their view, the future of Formosashould be discussed in the light of the Charter of the United
Nations. The United States Government, for their part, wished tohave the opportunity of explaining that Japan would be free, onceshe had regained her sovereignty, to conclude bilateral treaties withother Powers.In discussion some anxiety was expressed at the proposal that each Government should be free to add these interpretations of thejoint announcement. These were likely to give the impression thatthe differences between the two Governments were more serious thanthey actually were. If, by our statement, we gave the impression thatthe United States Government were unwilling that the United nations should discuss the future of Formosa, people in this country mightconclude that the Americans were determined to perpetuate Nation-alist Government rule in Formosa. It was also undesirable thatundue emphasis should be laid on Japan&apos;s future freedom to concludebilateral treaties with other Powers.It was the view of the Cabinet that in all the circumstances itwould be preferable that we should accept a joint announcement onFormosa stating merely that &quot; the future of the island had still to be discussed,&quot; and should renounce any right to add that in ourview this question should be determined in the light of the Charter ofthe United Nations. The United States Government should be asked,in return, to Tefrain from making any pronouncement about Japan&apos;sfreedom to conclude bilateral treaties with other Powers.The Cabinet -Invited the Foreign Secretary to suggest to the United StatesGovernment that the question of China&apos;s participation in theJapanese Peace Treaty should be left on the basis of thejoint announcement already agreed, without unilateralexplanations by either the United States Government orthe United Kingdom Government.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,18th June, 1951.
