Mr.J. B. l.   The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet would have learnedChifley. With regret of the sudden death of Mr. J. B. Chifley.  A message of sympathy had been sent on their behalf to the Australian Govern-ment. It would be contrary to practice that any formal reference toMr. Chifiey&apos;s death should be made in either House of Parliament.But he felt that it would be in accord with his colleagues&apos; wishes thatan expression of their regret should be recorded in the minutes of the cabinet&apos;s proceedings.Parliament. 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theBusiness in the House of Commons in the following week.House of The Cabinet considered the strength of the support which wasCommons. likely to be forthcoming for a new clause, which was to be moved bythe Conservative Opposition on the Committee Stage of the finance bill, proposing reduced rates of entertainment tax for speedwayracing-tracks. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in resistingthis clause, he would make a sympathetic reference to the financial difficulties of these undertakings, and would promise that there wouldbe a comprehensive review of the whole structure of the entertainmenttax before the next Budget. The Cabinet agreed that on this basis itshould be possible to secure the rejection of the new clause; andthe Chief Whip undertook to impress on Government supporters theimportance of voting against this Opposition proposal.Japanese Peace 3. The Minister of State said that, on the basis of the conclusionsTreaty. reached by the Cabinet on 11th June, further discussions had been(Previous        held with Mr. Dulles about the draft Peace Treaty for Japan.Reference: Mr. Dulles had now agreed that provision should be made in.

In addition, all the minor outstanding points of minute 1.) difference were now either settled or on the way to settlement, andwe had reserved our position on Japanese shipbuilding until the resultsof the United States discussions in Tokyo were known.Japanese Stocks The problem of the disposal of the Japanese gold was thus theof Gold. only issue still in dispute.   Further efforts had been made, first to induce Mr. Dulles to accept our proposal that the gold should be handed over to the Allies, and, secondly, when it became clear thathe could not accept this, to obtain his agreement to a compromiseby which the United States would first acquire the gold and thenreturn it to the Japanese. An arrangement on those lines would havebeen more acceptable to public opinion in this country than a proposalto leave the gold in Japanese hands. Mr. Dulles had, however, beenequally unable to accept this proposal. The United States Govern-ment considered that the Japanese must have this gold in order torestart their economy. . If they were left without it, the United StatesGovernment would find it necessary to provide them with funds forthe purpose; and this would involve difficulties . with Congress.Mr. Dulles had, however, offered to prepare a statement fullyexplaining the United States position on this point; and it would be helpful if this could be used by the United Kingdom Government in presenting to the public their reasons for accepting the United Statesview.The Foreign Secretary recalled that at their previous meeting theCabinet had agreed that this should not be made a breaking point inthe discussions, and he felt that in all the circumstances we should nowbe justified in conceding the point and informing Mr. Dulles that wecould accept the present draft of the Treaty.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that this was primarily apolitical, and not a financial, issue, and he would not oppose theForeign Secretary^ conclusion that we should now accept the UnitedStates view of it in order to secure agreement to a joint draft of theTreaty.40768-4 b 2
The Cabinet endorsed this view. In publicly presenting our case for the draft we could make it clear that we had sacrificed our view on the disposal of the gold for the sake of the greater benefit to besecured from full Anglo-American agreement on the terms of theTreaty.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government could join with the United States Government in publishing, as abasis for discussion with other Powers at war with Japan,a draft Peace Treaty in the terms which had been agreed in the discussions with Mr. Dulles.Draft The Cabinet next considered a draft communique on the communique,   discussions which was circulated at the meeting.In discussion it was suggested that objection might be taken on constitutional grounds to the statement in the communique that theForeign Secretary&apos;s agreement to the draft Treaty was subject to approval by the United Kingdom Government. It might be preferable to say that a provisional agreement had been reached whichwas subject to final approval. The references to the Soviet Govern-ment should also be amended to make it clear that they had alreadybeen consulted by the United States Government on a provisionaldraft, and to give greater emphasis to our desire that they should participate in the Treaty. It was also suggested that United Kingdomofficials should not be mentioned by name in the communique.The Cabinet-(2) Approved the draft communique, subject to further con-sideration of the points made in the discussion.Publication of JVze Foreign Secretary said that it was the intention of the UnitedDraft Treaty. States Government to publish a joint draft of the Treaty, together withan explanatory memorandum, within the next two or three weeks.The Cabinet would have an opportunity to consider both the jointdraft and the memorandum before they were published.Germany. 4.   The Foreign Secretary said that in view of the elections onSoviet Proposal nth June the French Government were anxious that some positivefor a Meeting,   proposal should be made to the Soviet Government before the end ofof Foreign       the week in order to show that a real effort was being made by theMinisters.       Western Powers to break the deadlock which had been reached by the(Previous        Deputies in Paris. The French had therefore suggested that the threeReference:      Powers should address to the Soviet Government a note suggestingCM. (51) 42nd that a meeting of the four Foreign Ministers should be held on theConclusions,    basis of the partial agreement already reached in Paris.   The noteMinute 2.)       would add that this partial agreement should suffice to enable theForeign Ministers to agree rapidly on the final agenda for their meeting and to get to work on the main discussions.  A draft of theproposed note was given in Paris telegram No. 152 of 12th June.The Foreign Secretary said that he appreciated the anxiety of theFrench Government about the forthcoming elections and felt that aproposal on these lines deserved our support. The preliminary UnitedStates reaction to the proposal had not, however, been favourable,and it might prove impossible to obtain their agreement. The draft note proposed by the French did not suggest that the foreign ministers should meet without an agenda: it proposed that, in so faras agreement on the agenda had not been reached by the Deputies,the first task of the Foreign Ministers would be to complete theagenda. He had made it clear that the United Kingdom Government
-   21183 CM. 43 (51)were still firm in their resolve that the North Atlantic Treaty shouldnot be included on the agenda. This did not mean that the Russianscould be prevented from developing their views on the Treaty in thecourse of the discussion of other items on the agenda, but it would imply that the Council of Foreign Ministers would not be competent to take decisions about the Treaty.In discussion of the French proposal the following suggestions were made:  (a) A final breakdown of the Deputies&apos; discussions, followed bya decision to abandon the project for a meeting of Foreign Ministers,would not be acceptable to public opinion in the West. Was there anysufficient reason why the Deputies&apos; failure to agree on a completeagenda should prevent the holding of a meeting of the foreign ministers? It was important to avoid a complete breakdown, andthere was much to commend the suggestion (made in Foreign office telegram to Paris No. 88 of 12th June) that a meeting of foreign ministers should be postponed until October.(b) To agree that the Foreign Ministers should meet without an agenda would be to surrender to the original Russian demand andwould be a reversal of the policy which we had followed hitherto.Not only would the Russians be able to say that we were agreeing,after many months&apos; unprofitable delay, to their original view that themeeting should be based on the Prague Communique, but we shouldbe unable to prevent substantive discussion of the North atlantic treaty.(c) It might be made clear, if an agreed note was sent to theSoviet Government on the lines of the French proposal, that themeeting should be held on the basis of one or other of the three agendawhich the Deputies had discussed, and that in addition other itemsshould be added where all four Governments agreed to their inclusion.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that therewas agreement that any note sent to the Soviet Government must make it clear that, in so far as agreement on the agenda had not beencompleted when the Foreign Ministers met, their first task must be tocomplete it. The note should also stress the partial success already reached by the Deputies in settling the agenda, and should make thepoint that throughout their discussions in Paris the Western Deputieshad pursued the aim of reaching agreement on the whole of the agenda for a meeting of Ministers. Subject to these amendments we should support a proposal on the lines of that now put forward by theFrench Government, and should endeavour to persuade the UnitedStates Government to agree to it.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to pursue discussions with theUnited States and French Governments on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.Equal Pay.Public Services.(previous reference:CM. (51) 40thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 151) raising the question whether any con-cession should be made to the demand for equal pay in the public services and, if so, what form the concession should take.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Government were committed to the principle of equal pay for men and women employedin the public services. Postponement of its introduction had hitherto been defended on the ground of severe wage restraint, and it wastherefore difficult for the Government to continue to do nothingtowards implementing the principle now that wage restraint in its more severe form was no longer in force.   The Civil Service National
Whitley Council had proposed the gradual introduction of equal pay,and officials had worked out a scheme under which it would bebrought into full force in eighteen years at a cost in the first year ofno more than  330,000. This scheme was open to the objection thatit would lead the trade unions to put forward equal pay claims in industry and might impose a substantial load on costs of production.He had therefore considered whether it would be possible, instead, tomake some gesture which would show that the Government had notabandoned their support for equal pay, but would avoid damagingreactions in industry. One such gesture would be to reduce the maxi-mum differentiation in the pay of men and women from 20 per cent,to 17i per cent. A less logical, but more practical, alternative wouldbe to grant one additional annual increment to all women who hadalready reached the maximum of their salary scales. The Minister ofLabour considered that these two proposals would not be of any real value, and he proposed that all women should forthwith receiveone increment on their present scales, subject to their not exceeding the men&apos;s rate. This would cost  5 million a year and, in view of theother claims costing comparable amounts which had had to be rejected on general financial grounds, he did not feel that this proposal could be accepted. In his view the only practical alternatives wereto refuse to do anything in respect of equal pay in present circum-stances, or to make the gesture of granting one additional annualincrement to all women in the Civil Service who had already reachedthe maximum of their salary scales. The first course could not be publicly justified by reference to the repercussions -on industry of granting equal pay in the public services. The second course would benefit the most deserving category, namely, women with the longestservice, while showing that the Government were anxious to do something in favour of equal pay as opportunity afforded.The Minister of Labour said that, if any concession was to bemade, it should not be derisory, but, on the other hand, it should notbe such as to involve serious repercussions in industry. The proposalto give to all women in the public service one increment on theirpresent salary scales would cost a substantial amount, but it wouldhave the effect that equal pay would be given to most women up tothe middle twenties, and in the lower grades of the Civil Service mostof them got married by that age. The grant of an additional incrementwould, therefore, remove all sense of grievance from the greatmajority of women in the Civil Service.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, while equal payremained a long-term objective, there were serious objections to ailthe proposals put forward for making some immediate concession.The grant of an additional annual increment to all women who hadalready reached the maximum of their salary scales was unlikely toreduce the agitation for equal pay. The grant of one increment onall existing scales would bring most benefit to those who least neededit, viz., the younger women in the lower grades who were most likelyto get married. The claim for equal pay was most strongly pressed on behalf of the older women who were making a career of the CivilService. Quite apart from questions of cost, the effect of any generalintroduction of equal pay would be to create a sense of grievanceamong married men and their wives, which would lead to a sustaineddemand for increased family allowances. In present circumstances the balance of advantage seemed, therefore, to lie in resisting any concession, while at the same time making clear the serious economicrepercussions of equal pay and the need for a thorough investigation of the means Of handling these problems in the long term.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that it was not practicable in present circumstances to take any immediate steps to introduce equal pay in thepublic services.
(2) Agreed that the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in announcingthis decision, should be free to indicate the generaldifficulties attendant on the introduction of equal pay andthe . need for a thorough examination of all itsrepercussions, including the effect on the scale of family allowances.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (51) 133) proposing acceptance of a Recommenda-tion (No. 88) concerning the vocational training of adults, includingdisabled persons, which was adopted by the International LabourConference at their Thirty-Third Session in June 1950.The Cabinet (1) Approved the acceptance of the Recommendation concerningthe vocational training of adults.(2) Authorised the Minister of Labour to present to parliamentary White Paper in the terms set out in Annex II of cp. (51) 133.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,Uth June, 1951.international labour conference,1950.vocational training ofAdults.(previous reference :CM. (51) 39thConclusions,Minute 6.)
