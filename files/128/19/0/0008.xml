Korea.(previous reference:CM. (51) 7thConclusions,Minute 2.)In discussion the following points were made:  (a) No steps seemed to have been taken yet to secure that theUnited Nations were formally notified of the latest communication from the People&apos;s Government, to which reference had been made atthe Cabinefs meeting earlier that day. It was doubtful whether theUnited States Government would at this stage agree to any formalsteps by the United Nations to secure further information aboutChinese intentions, since they regarded the Chinese communicationsas insincere and designed to disrupt the unity of the nations whichhad condemned North Korean aggression.(b) An effort might be made to induce the First Committee toconsider the resolution which had been tabled by seven Asiaticcountries. There appeared, however, to be little support for theresolution among other delegations.40067-2 b 21. The Minister of State said that it now seemed likely that before the end of the week the First Committee of the general assembly would have to vote on the United States resolution onChinese intervention in Korea, substantially in the form in which ithad been tabled on 20th January; and the United Kingdom repre-sentative should now be told how he should vote. It was almost certain that the resolution would be taken paragraph by paragraphbefore it was put to the vote as a whole. Three points arose on particular paragraphs of the resolution. The second paragraphrecorded that the Peking Government had rejected &quot; all united nations proposals &quot; for a peaceful settlement. As a statement of factthis was no longer true, and efforts were being made to secure amend-ments designed to bring the paragraph into closer relation with thefacts. If the paragraph was not amended in a satisfactory manner,Sir Gladwyn Jebb should presumably vote against it. The third paragraph recorded that the Peking Government had itself engagedin aggression in Korea. This paragraph would have accorded more closely with the interpretation of events in this country if it had followed the Prime Ministers statement in the House of commons on 23rd January and had condemned China for supporting an act of aggression; but the distinction did not seem sufficient to justify an adverse vote on the paragraph as it stood. The main difficulty arose in regard to the eighth paragraph, which requested a body composedof members of the Collective Measures Committee to consideradditional measures to meet the Chinese aggression. In the absenceof any clear indication of United States intentions about the form of pressure they would wish to exert on China, there would be con-siderable risk in voting for that paragraph.When it came to voting on the resolution as a whole, it seemed that Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and France though disliking several of its paragraphs would in the last resortvote in favour of it. The Cabinet might feel that, if the paragraphrecording that China had rejected all proposals for a peaceful settle-ment had not been amended, then the United Kingdom delegateshould not vote for the resolution. If acceptable amendments hadbeen made in that paragraph, but not in the paragraph proposing the convening of a committee on collective measures, it might be possiblefor the United Kingdom representative to vote for the resolution asa whole but to give a clear indication that this vote did not in anyway alter the Governments belief that discussions should continue and that the imposition of sanctions was not likely to serve any useful purpose. It would also be important to take all practicable measuresto ensure that, under the final paragraph of the resolution, machinery was created through which negotiations with China could be com-menced. The Foreign Secretary had indicated at an earlier stage thatin his opinion the United Kingdom Government ought in the last resort to vote for the United States resolution; but it had not beenpossible to take his view on the present situation.
(c) As regards the text of the United States resolution, there was general agreement that an effort should be made to secure an amend-ment of the second paragraph, which recorded that the People&apos;sGovernment had rejected &quot; all United Nations proposals &quot; for a peaceful settlement. One of the Commonwealth countries might tablean amendment to this end. If the paragraph was not sufficientlyamended to bring it into accord with the facts, Sir Gladwyn Jebbshould vote against it. He should not, however, vote against the para-graph which condemned Chinese aggression. He should vote againstthe paragraph which proposed the convening of a committee toconsider sanctions.The Cabinet then discussed the issues which arose in regard to the voting on the resolution as a whole. The Cabinet&apos;s discussion was based on the assumption that, whether or not the paragraph referring to the Chinese rejection of earlier proposals had been suitablyamended, the resolution as finally put to the vote would contain the paragraph proposing an investigation into sanctions.On this assumption it was argued, in favour of voting for theresolution as a whole, that we should not appear to be dissociatingourselves from the older members of the Commonwealth or fromthe United States and France. In the long term it would be disastrousif we became estranged from the United States. It was already felt in the United States that we had gone too far in endeavouring toplacate Indian opinion, and an adverse vote would give such offence to the United States Government and public in their present mood as might cause lasting damage to Anglo-American relations. Such aclash would be a major success for Soviet diplomacy, and Communiststhroughout the world would extract the maximum propaganda valuefrom a division between this country and the United States and fromany vote by this country which might appear to be condoning Chineseaggression. The reaction of such a vote on the morale of the Britishtroops in Korea might also be very serious. When the United StatesGovernment had secured the passage of a resolution branding Chinaas an aggressor, they might be more willing to modify then presentintransigent attitude; and the efforts of the United Kingdom Govern-ment could then be directed more effectively to keeping the door open for peaceful negotiations with China.On the other hand, it was strongly urged that the Governmentcould not, consistently with the policy which they had pursued, give an affirmative vote for the United States resolution. Their military advisers had drawn attention to the serious effects which any extensionof the conflict with China would have on Commonwealth interestsin the Far East and South-East Asia. Public opinion in this country would not support a war with China over Korea, which might easilybroaden out into a Third World War. The effect of the United Statesresolution would be widely interpreted as shutting the door against anyfurther attempts at a peaceful settlement with China, and publicopinion in this country was not yet satisfied that further discussionsmight not open the way to a settlement.On the basis that the United Kingdom representative could notbe authorised to vote in favour of the United States resolution in itspresent form, the question was then discussed whether he should vote against the resolution or abstain from voting. In favour of abstension,it was pointed out that a negative vote, although accompanied byexplanations, would be widely misrepresented as condoning Chineseaggression. Moreover, the Government agreed with certain paragraphs of the resolution and dissented from others; and it would be reason-able in those circumstances that they should decline to offer a positivevote on the resolution as a whole. The majority of the Cabinet con-siddred, however, that in the circumstances assumed the UnitedKingdom representative should vote against the resolution. Absten-sion was a weak course for a great Power to take on a major issue.The Government believed that the resolution as a whole represented a mistaken approach to the problem of Chinese interventionip Korea.
Defence.(previous reference:CM. (51) 7thConclusions,Minute 4.)ServiceMan-Power.Navy.Army.2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion on the acceleration ofdefence preparations in the period 1951-54. They again had beforethem the memoranda which had been under consideration at their meeting earlier in the day, viz., CP. (51) 16, 18-20, 22, 23, 25, 26,29 and 32.They first considered the proposals on Service man-power.They approved the proposals, in paragraph 9 of the Annex to cp. (51)16, relating to the Royal Navy.As regards the Army, the Prime Minister said that the DefenceCommittee endorsed the proposals for calling up selected Class Zreservists for fifteen days&apos; training with the Auxiliary Forces. they also favoured the proposal that the period of service of time-expiredregulars should be extended. They did not, however, support theproposal to call up Class Z reservists for three months&apos; training withthe active Forces.In discussion of the proposal to call up reservists for fifteen days&apos;training, the following points were made:  -[a) It was important that these reservists should return to civil life with the feeling that their time had been usefully occupied. this meant that, not only senior officers, but officers in the units must realise the importance of giving effective training and making the maximumuse of the short training period. It should also be made clear inadvance that one of the purposes of the plan was to discover defectsin the organisation for mobilisation: the men should not be allowedto return to civil life under the impression that any mistakes made wereevidence of muddle and would go uncorrected.(h) The War Office had prepared a list of 80,000 Class Z reservistswhom it was proposed to call up. They had been selected on thebasis of their usefulness to the Army, as men fitted by their qualifi-cations and experience (in rank, trade and arm) to fill the existinggaps in the Territorial Army. The basis of selection necessarilyinvolved some unfairness as between man and man. A number ofthe selected men would be in the 40-45 age group, particularly trained men required for the Royal Engineers or Royal Army Service Corps.It was pointed out that men of this age usually had heavy commit-ments; and it was suggested that the lists should be re-examined toensure that the number of older men was reduced to the minimum.In the contemplated legislation Class Z reservists up to the age of 45years would have to be made liable to recall; but in practice as fewas possible should be called up who were over 40 years of age.They had already made it plain to the world that this was their view;and if, notwithstanding this, they now voted in favour of the UnitedStates resolution, it would be equally plain that they had voted, against their convictions, for the sole purpose of supporting the United StatesGovernment. Thereby they would forfeit their independence and theirself-respect; and they would deprive themselves of any power to influence the United States Government on any future occasion. If,however, an adverse vote had to be given, no opportunity should be lost of explaining the basis of the Governments policy. If this were done effectively, there was no reason to believe that, after the waveof annoyance in the United States had spent itself, the enduringcommon interests of the two countries would not reassert themselves.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations to be instructed in the sense of their discussion.
(c) Careful publicity would be required. It would be necessaryto defend the arbitrary selection of a relatively small proportion ofthe reservists. The men who were called up and their dependantswould have to be given a clear assurance that they would return totheir civilian life after the fifteen days&apos; training. The documents sentto a man who was called up should not consist simply of a peremptoryinstruction, under penalties, to attend for training, but should explain the basis of selection. It would be useful if the Chief of the ImperialGeneral Staff could give a broadcast talk on this plan.(d) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was reluctant to agree that Class Z reservists, called up for fifteen days&apos; training,should receive the pay of regulars, as well as a bounty of  4. he feared that this might be treated as a precedent for demands that other National Servicemen should receive regular rates of pay; and inwar the cost of such a concession could be of the order of  300-400million a year.It was the view of the Cabinet that it would be unfair to denyregular rates of pay to this small minority of Class Z reservists whowere to be called up for training, and that this concession need not prejudice the position of the Treasury in relation to other national servicemen. National Servicemen who had served for eighteen months received regular rates of pay; and the Class Z reservists whowere now to be called up would all be trained men who had previouslyserved for at least that period. Moreover, they would be serving in territorial camps alongside Territorials who, for the period of the camp, received regular rates of pay.The Cabinet next discussed the question whether a number of class Z reservists should be posted to operational units of the army for three months&apos; training.The Vice-Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the army of the Rhine and the Strategic Reserve in the United Kingdom were seriously under strength and contained a large proportion of youngsoldiers. In 1939 the Regular Army Divisions had been made battle-worthy from the Regular Army Reserve, but most of the Reservewere now in Korea and reliance had, therefore, to be placed onClass Z reservists. The proposal had been that 62,000 Class Zreservists should serve for three months with the active Army. Thiswould have strengthened the effectiveness of the Army during the summer of 1951, which was regarded as a period of some risk. Itwould also have meant that thereafter these units could be broughtmore rapidly to a state of full effectiveness on general mobilisation.The Cabinet were informed that this proposal was not supportedby the Minister of Defence or the Service Ministers. It would causes considerable dislocation in civil life; and it differed from the otherproposal in that it was in effect a partial mobilisation. As such itmight be interpreted as meaning that the Government expected warin the summer of 1951,The Cabinet endorsed the view of the Defence Committee thatthis proposal should not be accepted. They agreed, however, that a proportion of the men who would have been called up for threemonths&apos; service under this proposal should be called up, with otherClass Z reservists, for fifteen days&apos; training.Attention was drawn to the special importance of the proposal that 5,000 men should be called up for three months&apos; training in A.A.Command.The Cabinet approved the proposal that time-expired ArmyRegulars should be retained for approximately twelve months. Theywere not prepared to agree that, in order to provide reinforcements for Korea, the minimum embarkation age should be reduced toeighteen years and nine months.
As regards the Royal Air Force, the proposals in paragraph 14of the Annex to CP. (51) 16 were approved. This included the pro-posal to embody the fighter squadrons of the Royal Auxiliary AirForce for about three months&apos; continuous training. Ministers con-sidered that the members of the R.A.A.F. were in rather a differentposition from Class Z reservists and that, in view of the vital need to improve the fighter defences of the country, they should be askedto attend for three months&apos; training. This was a special measure toensure that the lighter defences reached the necessary standard of efficiency, and it was believed that members of the R.A.A.F. would appreciate the need for it.The Cabinet then discussed the proposal in paragraphs 7-19 ofthe Annex to CP. (51) 16 that the deficiency in the call-up of national servicemen should be met by making greater use of Grades IV and Vmedical categories, by discontinuing the deferment of agricultural workers, and by restricting the deferment of apprentices and students.The Minister of Labour had also raised, in his memorandum CP. (51)22, the question whether the age of call-up should be lowered toeighteen years.There was general agreement that greater use should be made ofGrades III and IV medical categories; but the proposals regardingapprentices and students were not accepted, nor were the Cabinetprepared to agree that the age of call-up should be lowered to eighteen years.As regards the proposed discontinuance of the deferment ofagricultural workers, the Minister of Agriculture drew atten-tion to the fact that the agricultural labour force was falling. Home-grown supplies of food must be maintained; and the withdrawal of deferment would have a specially serious effect on farm work, becauseof the high proportion of farms which had only one or two workers.It was, however, the general view of the Cabinet that agricultural workers should no longer enjoy this special protection. The numbers involved (15,000 a year) were not large in relation to the labour forceof the industry as a whole. Special care should, however, be taken toensure that the hardship tribunals safeguarded the position of the small farmer with one or two workers. Farmers should also be given duenotice of the change, though it would probably not be practicable to postpone it until after the harvest of 1951. Consideration might with advantage be given to the question of reconstituting the Women&apos;s land Army, though not necessarily under Government auspices or with Exchequer assistance.The Cabinet then considered the production proposals inparagraphs 23-54 of the Annex to CP. (51) 16.As regards the aircraft production programme, the Chief of theAir Staff pointed out that the completion of the programme depended on the necessary machine tools being secured in time. The proposals would increase the preparedness of our air defences. To secure ameasure of protection in 1951 and 1952, it was necessary to proceedwith the production of aircraft which would be superseded by more modern types in 1953 and 1954.The Cabinet gave general approval to the production pro-gramme, subject to the qualifications which they had accepted attheir previous meeting in regard to the phasing of the defence programme generally.The Cabinet gave general approval to the proposals in para-graphs 55-59 of the Annex to CP. (51) 16, on the understanding that ministers were not committed at this stage to full acceptance of theproposals regarding the use of emergency powers outlined in para-graph 59. These proposals, some of which involved the breach ofpledges which had been given to local authorities and others, wouldhave to be examined in detail.Attention was drawn to the need to ensure that officials andserving officers exercising requisitioning and other emergency powerson behalf of Service and Supply Departments were Carefully selected
Civil wDefence.to ensure that these powers were not used in an arbitrary fashion orin a manner leading to unnecessary dislocation of civilian activities.The Cabinet had agreed at their previous meeting that the extentto which the building programme of the Services should prejudicecivilian capital investment would require further detailed examination.The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee hadendorsed the Home Secretary&apos;s proposal in CP. (51) 19 that the authorised programme of expenditure on civil defence in the next four years should be increased from  137 million to  180 million.They had not, however, been prepared to accept the proposals(paragraph 6 and Annex of CP. (51) 18) that the preparations for ablack-out should be accelerated, or that a stockpile of black-outmaterials should be accumulated. On the question whether civil defence preparations should be allowed to lag behind the strengthen-ing of the active defences, the Defence Committee considered that,quite apart from the enormous cost that would be involved, anygeneral acceleration of civil defence preparations would give theimpression that the Government regarded war as inevitable.The Home Secretary said that a decision not to accelerate theprogramme of civil defence, when increasing active defence prepara-tions, placed a heavy responsibility on the Government, which he felt bound, as the Minister primarily responsible for civil defence, tobring to the attention of his colleagues. Little would have been done to protect the civil population against any heavy attack by air whichmight be directed against them in the next few years. In particular,virtually no provision would have been made for air raid sheltersfor the general public. He considered that, in any defence statement in the House of Commons, it would be necessary to indicate explicitlythat the accelerated preparations now being made related primarily to active defence.The Cabinet approved the conclusions of the Defence Committeein regard to civil defence.Subject to the points noted above regarding preparations for ablack-out, the Cabinet approved the proposals in the report of theDefence (Transition) Committee (CP. (51) 18) for accelerating thedefence planning of civil Departments generally.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the recommendations of the Defence Committee, asset out in CP. (51) 32, regarding the man-power proposals put forward by the Chiefs of Staff in CP. (51) 16.(2) Agreed to accept in principle the remainder of the programmeput forward by the Chiefs of Staff in CP. (51) 16, subject- to Conclusion (4) below and on the understanding that, as there could be no assurance that the programme wouldnot be delayed by shortages of raw materials, machine tools and other supplies, no public commitment would begiven regarding the date by which it could be completed.(3) Accepted the general economic implications of the defence programme, as outlined in the memorandum by the Chan-cellor of the Exchequer (CP. (51) 20).(4) Agreed that the details of the defence programme shouldbe subject to examination under the normal procedures,including reference (where appropriate) to ministerial committees and Treasury scrutiny of the details of theproposed expenditure.(5) Approved the proposals of the Defence (Transition) Com-mittee in CP, (51) 18, with the exception of the proposalsfor accelerating reparations for a black-out and the accumulation of a stock-pile of black-out materials.(6) Approved the increase in the authorised programme ofexpenditure on civil defence proposed in CP.
