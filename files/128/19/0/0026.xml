The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the level of government expenditure on the social services.The Foreign Secretary said that during the afternoon he and theChief Whip had seen the Prime Minister in hospital and had given him a full account of the Cabinefs discussion at their meeting that morning. The Prime Minister had asked him to convey to the Cabinetthe following expression of. his views. First, he had pointed out thatin all Cabinet discussions of Budget proposals there must be a sub-stantial measure of give and take between Ministers. The Chancellorof the Exchequer had particular responsibility for the national finances; and no other Minister ought to claim that any particularestimate should be treated as sacrosanct. It would be a most unusualthing for a Minister to resign on a Budget issue: so far as he was aware, the only Minister who had ever taken this step was LordRandolph Churchill, whose political fortunes had never recoveredthereafter. Secondly, a Minister who found himself in disagreement with a particular part of the present Budget proposals should consider,not only his personal position, but the effect which his resignationwould have on the present and future fortunes of the Labour Party.Thirdly, the Prime Minister had said that it would, be folly for any minister to provoke a political crisis at the present time, for there could hardly be a worse moment for a General Election. As the summer went on, the conditions might become more favourable-the meat ration might be increased, the weather might improve andthere might be some change in the international situation. But aGeneral Election at the present time with a Labour Party torn bydivided counsels, would prejudice the fortunes of the Labour move-ment for years to come. Fourthly, if the Government were forcedto face the electors in these circumstances, they could hardly hope towin the Election; and, after such a debacle, the Conservatives mightremain in office for a long period. If the situation arose, the respon-sibility for bringing it about would rest with any Ministers whoresigned from the Government at the present juncture. For all these reasons the Prime Minister urged his Cabinet colleagues to give solidsupport to the Budget proposals put forward by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer; and, in particular, to adhere to the decisions whichthey had taken, as a Cabinet, on 22nd March regarding the futurelevel of expenditure on the National Health Service.The Minister of Labour said that he was not surprised to hearthat the Prime Minister took this view. He had, however, discussed the matter with the Prime Minister before 22nd March; and he had then made it clear that he would not be able to share collective responsibility for a decision to abandon the conception of a freeHealth Service. This was, for him, a question of principle. He had given five years to building up the Health Service; he had proclaimedit on many public platforms as one of the outstanding achievementsof the Labour Party in office: he had, in particular, upheld the concept-tion of a free Service as the embodiment of Socialist principles. Itwas too much to ask him now to go info the.division lobby in supportof a measure authorising the imposition of charges for dentures andspectacles provided under this Service. In saying that he must resignfrom the Government if the Cabinet persisted in this decision, he wasnot speaking lightly or without consideration of the possible conse-quences which the Prime Minister envisaged. But a Minister must be free to resign if he felt that he could not conscientiously share col-lective responsibility for decisions which his Cabinet colleagues wishedto take. This Cabinet had taken many decisions which he had not wholly approved; but, when it became clear that these represented a preponderant view in the Cabinet, he had been prepared to take his share of responsibility for them. But, latterly, he had come to feel that he could bring more influence to bear on Government policyfrom outside the Cabinet than he could ever hope to exercise within it; and, when a Minister reached that position, it was time for him to go.SocialServicesExpenditure(previous reference:CM. (51) 25 th conclusions,Minute 3.)
The President of the Board of Trade said that he wished at thisstage to make his own position clear. In the Cabinefs earlier dis-cussion that morning he had said that he supported the view of theMinister of Labour that it would not be possible to persuade all government supporters to vote in favour of legislation authorising theintroduction of charges under the Health Service. He now wished tomake it clear that, if the Cabinet maintained their decision to intro-duce these charges, he would feel unable to share collective responsibility for that decision and, like the Minister of Labour, would feel obliged to resign from the Government.In the course of a long discussion Ministers dwelt upon the grave consequences which would follow if resignations from theCabinet caused a serious division in the ranks of the Labour Party.This might well precipitate a General Election, at a moment mostunfavourable to the fortunes of the Party, and in circumstances inwhich the Party&apos;s chances of success must be rated very low. But,worse than that, it might undermine the authority of the Party&apos;sleaders and weaken the electoral prospects of the Party for manyyears to come. From a wider point of view it was also argued thatthe Labour Party had given an example to the world of stable and progressive Government in the difficult period of transition after theend of the war and in the dangerous period of international tensionwhich had followed it; and it would be a tragedy if at this juncturethe inspiration of its leadership in world affairs were cast away.The Minister of Labour said that he could not accept responsi-bility for these consequences, even if they turned out to be as serious as some of his colleagues had feared. It was not he who had taken the initiative in proposing charges under the Health Service. The, political crisis, if one developed, would have been provoked by thosewho had made this proposal. Other Ministers, on the other hand,held that any Ministers who resigned from the Government at thepresent time woud be responsible for the political consequences whichwere likely to follow; and, in their view, this was a very heavyresponsibility.Beside these grave consequences, the issue which now divided theCabinet seemed relatively small. Was there not some compromise on the basis of which agreement might still be reached? The Cabinetthen discussed various possibilities. Thus, would it be possible to post-pone for six months the introduction of charges under the national health Service? During the interval Ministers should be able to resolve their doubts on the question whether the money allocated tothe increased defence programme could in fact be profitably spent;and they would then be able to see more clearly whether the proposedeconomies on the Health Service were in fact essential. postponement would also have the advantage that the discussion could be resumed at greater leisure under the Chairmanship of the Prime Minister himself.Alternatively, would it suffice for the Chancellor in his Budget speech to say merely that expenditure on the Health Service would be keptfor the time being within an upper limit of  400 million, and that theGovernment were considering what steps would be necessary toensure that this limit was not exceeded? Would it not be possible tosecure economies in the administration of the Service without resort-ing to charges? Or could the necessary savings be secured by imposing a charge for prescriptions, and abandoning the proposedcharges for dentures and spectacles? This would have the advantage that no fresh legislation would be required. And in 1949 the presentMinister of Labour had accepted the view that a charge for prescription-tions would not involve a breach of the principle of a free Service.The Chancellor of the Exchequerpointed out that none of thesealternative courses would give him a sufficient assurance that thenecessary savings would in fact be secured. Other Ministers testifiedthat the Cabinet Committee on the National Health Service hadv exhaustively considered all practicable alternative methods of reducing expenditure on the Service, and had satisfied themselves that
this expenditure could not be kept within an upper limit of 400 million without recourse to charges. They were also satisfiedthat the charges now proposed, for dentures and spectacles, were themost practical and the least unpalatable of any which could be intro-duced. The Cabinet reluctantly came to the conclusion that no corn-promise solution could be found along these lines.In the course of further discussion The Minister of Labourindicated that, if he resigned from the Government, he would feel obliged to make it clear that his differences with his colleagues hadnot been restricted to this question of charges under the national health Service. He was also gravely concerned about the economic consequences of the increased defence programme. While he supported the policy of rebuilding the armed strength of the western democracies,he was concerned about the pace and volume of their rearmamentprogrammes. He believed that, by trying to do too much too quicklyin response to United States pressure, the western democracies werein grave danger of undermining their economic strength. The UnitedKingdom Government would in his view make a double mistake ifthey allowed the increased defence programme, not only to distortthe national economy, but to do this at the expense of the social services.Further appeals were then made by a number of Ministers thatthe solidarity of the Government and the Labour Party should notbe breached by resignations on this issue. The Minister of Education,in particular, made it clear that in his view Ministerial resignationswere too high a price to pay for an economy of  13 million on the health Service. He felt sure that it must be possible to resolve the differences within the Cabinet by some means which would not involve Ministerial resignations; and he hoped that the majority would not press their view to a point which would make these resigna-tions inevitable.After further discussion The Foreign Secretary said that he mustbring the issue to a decision. He read out the conclusions reached bythe Cabinet at their meeting on 22nd March, viz., that for the timebeing expenditure on the National Health Service should be subjectto an upper limit of  400 million; that charges should be imposed forthe supply of dentures and spectacles under the Health Service; andthat the Health Ministers should draft the necessary legislation and make such advance preparations as were required to bring the schemeof charges into operation on 12th April. He asked each member ofthe Cabinet to state whether he was still prepared to adhere to those decisions. The Minister of Labour, the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Education said that, for the reasons whichthey had indicated in the course of the Cabinefs discussion, they werenot in favour of re-affirming those conclusions. The remainingmembers of the Cabinet all indicated that they favoured re-affirmingthose conclusions.The Minister of Labour said that in these circumstances he wouldhave to resign from the Government. He would submit his resigna-tion to the Prime Minister in the course of the following day; andhe presumed that he would thereafter make a personal statement inthe House of Commons, possibly on 11th April.The Cabinet (1) Reaffirmed their decisions of 22nd March regarding the limita-tion of expenditure on the National Health Service andthe introduction of charges for dentures and spectaclessupplied under that Service.(2) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to announcethese decisions in the course of his Budget speech.(3) Invited the Minister of Labour to reconsider his position, and expressed the earnest hope that he would not find itnecessary to resign from the Government on this issue.Cabinet Office, SWA,9th April, 1951.
