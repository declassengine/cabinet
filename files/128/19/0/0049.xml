125CM. 49 (51)Parliament. 1.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in the House of Commons in the following week,the House ofCommons. -23The 280&quot;AutomaticRifle.2. The Opposition were anxious that the House of commons should have an opportunity to debate the decision to adopt a new type of rifle of -280-in. calibre as the standard small arms weaponof the British Army. It had been proposed that this debate shouldbe held on 11th July.The Cabinet were informed that, in pursuance of an agreementbetween the United Kingdom, the United States and Canada on theprinciple of standardisation of weapons, joint trials had been carriedout in the United States in 1950 to choose a new type of automaticrifle. The joint report on these trials had recommended the adoptionof an automatic rifle of British design of -280-in. calibre; but,although United States experts had subscribed to this report, theUnited States Department of Defence had not accepted the recom-mendation. There was no doubt that this was a better weapon thanthe existing British or American rifle, and the Defence Committeehad decided on 19th March that it should be adopted as the standardsmall arms weapon of the British Army and put into production. Thisdecision had been made known to the United States and canadian government&apos;s and to the delegates at the recent meeting of Common-wealth Defence Ministers, for whom a demonstration of the rifle hadbeen arranged. Since then, however, representations had beenreceived from the Canadian Minister of Defence and from general eisenhower, both of whom had urged that further consultations should be held with the United States and Canadian governments before orders were given for large-scale production of the newweapon. The Minister of Defence said that, on reflection, he was disposed to think that there would be advantage in holding further consultations, possibly between the Defence Ministers of the three countries, in the hope that the United States and Canada might even now be persuaded to adopt this new type of rifle.The Prime Minister said that, if further consultations were to beheld, it would be preferable that this should be announced before thematter was debated in the House of Commons. If the opposition were informed that such an announcement was to be made, theymight withdraw their request for a debate.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for the UnitedStates Government to be asked to join in further consulta-tions with the Governments of the United Kingdom and canada regarding the standard small arms weapon to beused by the Armed Forces of the three countries; and authorised him to announce that these further consulta-tions were to be suggested.(2) Invited the Chief Whip to inform the Opposition that sucha statement was to be made, so that they might considerwhether in those circumstances they still wished this ques-tion to be debated in the House of Commons on.11th July.ParliamentDelegatedLegislation.(previous reference :CM. (51) 22ndConclusions,Minute 10.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (51) 168) regarding a proposal by the Opposition thata Select Committee should be appointed to review the procedure for supervising delegated legislation.The Home Secretary said that the Opposition had abandoned the tactics which they had followed before Easter in raising frequentdebates on prayers for the annulment of statutory instruments, andthe supervision of delegated legislation was not giving rise to any
current difficulties in the House of Commons. A case could be made out for an enquiry by a Select Committee into the working of theStatutory Instruments Act, 1946, but he was not sure that in presentcircumstances the Opposition were likely to press strongly for this.There would in any event be no advantage in appointing a SelectCommittee before the end of the present session.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The appointment of a Select Committee would postpone theneed for decisions about any major alteration in the present proce-dure for controlling delegated legislation, but the Select committee might make proposals for example, that Parliament should havepower to amend statutory instruments which would cause theGovernment great embarrassment at a later stage.(b) Since the object would be to enquire into the means by which parliament supervised the exercise of powers of delegated legislation,rather than the principles on which legislative powers should be dele-gated to Ministers, enquiry by a Select Committee would be more appropriate than enquiry by a Departmental Committee.(c) The House of Lords might ask for a Joint Select Committee,but the balance of advantage seemed to lie in seeking to confine anyenquiry at this stage to the procedure of the House of Commons,and accordingly any Select Committee should be appointed solely by that House.It was the general view of the Cabinet that further considera-tion of this subject should, if possible, be deferred until the autumn.The Cabinet Invited the Home Secretary to inform the Leader of- theOpposition that the Government would prefer to postponeuntil the following session further consideration of thequestion whether a Select Committee should be appointedto enquire into the procedure for dealing with delegated legislation.Broadcasting.Report ofBroadcastingCommittee.RegionalDevolution.4. The Cabinet had before them the following memoranda onthe report of the Broadcasting Committee, 1949 (Cmd. 8116): -CP. (51) 183: by the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations and the Postmaster-General, covering the draftof a White Paper setting out the views of the Governmenton the report of the Broadcasting Committee;CP. (51) 187: by the Home Secretary, drawing attention to thedifficulties which were likely to follow from rejection ofthe proposal made by the Broadcasting Committee thatBroadcasting Commissions should be set up in Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland.CP. (51) 185: by the Chancellor of the Exchequer proposing that for the next three years the British broadcasting corporation (B.B.C.) should receive 80 per cent, of the netlicence revenue, instead of 100 per cent., as proposed in cp. (51) &quot;183.The Home Secretary said that Welsh opinion would not be content with the proposals for regional devolution which were putforward in the draft White Paper annexed to CP. (51) 183. All the welsh organisations which gave evidence before the broadcasting committee had pressed for an independent Broadcasting corporation for Wales; though he thought, after discussions with the Council for wales, that moderate opinion in Wales might accept a scheme on thelines of the proposal of the Broadcasting Committee. The objectionsagainst going as far as the Broadcasting Committee had suggestedappeared to be purely administrative in character and did not take
sufficient account of the political pressure which would be exerted forwider power being given to a Welsh organisation which controlledsome or all of the broadcasting in Wales.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that he did not think that a practicable scheme could be put forward whichwould satisfy Welsh opinion. The proposal by the broadcasting committee that there should be Commissions in Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland, each including a B.B.C. Governor, which controlledthe Home Service programme in these regions, was inconsistent withthe general thesis advanced by the Committee that the B.B.C.Governors should collectively be in charge of the Corporation andthat individual Governors should not give personal decisions. IfCommissions were set up for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland,there would be difficulties in effecting interchanges of staffs and in determining what could be decided by these Commissions and whatmust be reserved for the Governors. On the powers of the threeCommissions, the Committee had been vague, ambiguous and contra-dictory. The proposals in the draft White Paper represented aconsiderable concession to regional devolution. Since the Broad-casting Councils which were to be set up in Scotland, Wales andNorthern Ireland would be drawn wholly or largely from localauthority representatives, they would not exhibit extreme nationalisttendencies and would be better able to interpret moderate opinion in the countries concerned. Since the Councils would have to act inconjunction with the B.B.C. Controller for the region, this would leave open a channel through which major issues could be brought before the B.B.C. Governors for final decision.The Postmaster-General said that he had had many discussions with Welsh Members of Parliament and in particular with the WelshLabour Group. The proposal in the White Paper that the Broad-casting Councils for Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland should bedrawn from local authorities would be more acceptable to Welshopinion than the Committee&apos;s proposal for a small Commission ineach country appointed by the Government. If the Council consisted of elected representatives, it could not be argued against them thatthey were Government nominees, chosen in London. Elected repre-sentatives were more likely to give a cross section of public opinion in Wales, whereas it was frequently argued against the presentB.B.C. administration in Wales that it was recruited from Welsh-speaking Welshmen who might hold rather extreme Nationalist views.As regards the powers of the Broadcasting Councils, his under-standing was that each Council would be empowered to settle itsHome Service programme, and that it should exercise advisory func-tions in regard to the Light and Third Programmes and on technical,enginering and financial matters. The fact that the Councils wouldbe advisory over part of the field made it all the more necessary toemphasise that they would enjoy complete autonomy in regard to theHome Service programme. In practice, the money likely to be at thedisposal of any Council made it certain that they would have toaccept a good deal of the Home Service material sent out from london or from one of the English regions; but the Council wouldhave the right to decide on the nature of the regional material to be broadcast and the times at which that material should be broadcast.In further discussion attention was drawn to the risk that Broad-casting Councils set up to satisfy national aspirations in Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland might adopt policies which went further in the direction of giving a national flavour to Home Service pro-grammes than was desired by the general body of people living inthese areas. The Broadcasting Committee did not seem to havegiven the subject close consideration. Difficulties might arise inregard to the financing of Home Service programmes in Scotland,Wales and Northern Ireland; and there were some matters, notablypolitical broadcasts, in which any deviation from a policy agreed for
the United Kingdom by the main political Parties would cause serious difficulties. There was a risk that concessions to Nationalist feelingswould be accepted grudgingly and become the basis from which further and more extreme claims would be advanced.The general view of the Cabinet was that, in view of the extentto which the Broadcasting Committee had been prepared to devolveresponsibility on Commissions in Scotland, Wales and NorthernIreland, it would be difficult for the Government to restrict any con-cessions as narrowly as was proposed in the draft White Paper. Therewould clearly have to be restrictions, by way of a system of blockgrants or of approval of estimates, by which a financial limit wouldbe placed on the work which could be undertaken by one of theproposed Broadcasting Councils, and subjects such as political broad-casts would probably have to be reserved for consideration in respectof the United Kingdom as a whole. If these matters were safeguardedno adequate grounds could be advanced against the grant of substan-tial autonomy to the Broadcasting Councils in respect of their home service programmes. The Broadcasting Committee of 1935 had reported in favour of substantial decentralisation and its recommen-dations had not been fully carried out. At a time when there appearedto be a growth of national feeling in Scotland and Wales which couldnot readily be met in the field of Government, it was expedient to goas far as practicable in giving a measure of autonomy in culturalmatters. The draft White Paper should accordingly be amended tostate more positively the powers of the proposed broadcasting councils over Home Service programmes. The suggestion that these powers must be exercised in conjunction with the Controller shouldbe deleted.The Cabinet then discussed the constitution and powers of theAdvisory Councils for the English regions. The present machineryappeared to work reasonably well and the Broadcasting Committeehad not suggested any fundamental alterations. It might be argued that some parts of England had pronounced regional characteristicswhich should be recognised by some change in the constitution of theAdvisory Councils for example, by providing that these councils should be appointed by the Government. The balance of advantageappeared, however, to lie in leaving the appointment of members ofthe Councils with the B.B.C., in accordance with the existing arrange-ments.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Broadcasting Councils for Scotland, wales and Northern Ireland should be set up in. the manner proposed in CP. (51) 183, but that, subject to safeguardsin regard to certain matters, including finance and political broadcasts, the complete autonomy of these Councils inrespect of the policy and contents of their Home Serviceprogramme should be stated more categorically than was proposed in the draft White Paper attached to CP. (51)183.(2) Agreed that the members of the English Advisory councils should continue to be appointed, as at present, by theB.B.C.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the statistics set out in cp. (51) 185 showed the manner in which the income available to theB.B.C. for financing its Home and Television Services had risen inrecent years, until it now stood at four times the pre-war figure. TheB.B.C. had only recently been given 100 per cent, of the net licence revenue, and he was opposed to the suggestion that this arrangement should continue, since it was likely to lead to some extravagances inCurrent expenditure and to pressure for a greater share in the nationalinvestment programme. It would be difficult for the Opposition to oppose a reduction in the percentage of the net licence revenuereceived by the B.B.C., since in the course of the recent Budget debate
Captain Water house, M.P., speaking on behalf of the Opposition, had suggested as an economy measure that the B.B.C. grant should bereduced. After discussion, the Chancellor said that as a compromisehe would be prepared to agree that for the next two or three years the B.B.C. should receive 85 per cent, (instead of 80 per cent., as pro-posed in his memorandum) of the net licence revenue, and he would accept the proposals in the report of the Broadcasting committee regarding the borrowing powers of the Corporation.The Postmaster-General said that the extent of the resources available to the Corporation in relation to their commitments shouldnot be exaggerated. The present estimates were based on 1949 figures and costs had gone up considerably since that date. He was, however,prepared to accept the compromise of 85 per cent, proposed by theChancellor of the Exchequer.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that in the next few years the B.B.C. should receive85 per cent, of the net licence revenue and that the draft white Paper should be amended accordingly.The Ministry of Labour said that discussions were in progressbetween the B.B.C. and the (General Council of the Trades UnionCongress about trade union recognition. He thought that a furtherparagraph should be introduced after paragraph 48 of the draft white paper, to the effect that the Government appreciated the importance which the trade union movement attached to trade union recognitionand that consultations on the subject were still proceeding.The Cabinet (4) Agreed that a paragraph should be added to the draft white paper on the lines proposed by the Minister of Labour.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) Nothing should be said which would prevent sympathetic consideration of any suggestions which might be made in the courseof the forthcoming Parliamentary debates for improving the adminis-trative organisation of the Corporation. For example, suggestions were made from time to time that the present concentration of authority in the Director-General should be reduced and that the heads of some of the sections should have direct access to the governors.(b) In view of the decisions which had been taken about the salaries of part-time members of the Boards of nationalised industries,it would be undesirable to accept the proposal of the Beveridge Com-mittee that the salaries of B.B.C. Governors should be increased.. (c) It was contemplated that the Commons debate on the reportof the Broadcasting Committee should take place on 18th July. the government&apos;s White Paper should be available at least a week beforethe debate.&quot;   The Cabinet-(5) Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 183, subject to conclusions (1) to (4) above.(6) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations and the Postmaster-General to amend the draft white paper annexed to CP. (51) 183, in the light of theCabinet&apos;s discussion, and to arrange for its publication atan early date.labour relations.
Spain.  ;(previous reference:CM. (50) 73rdConclusions,Minute 1.)Closerassociationwith Spain.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) .184) on the effect upon our policy towards Spainof the more sympathetic attitude that had recently been adopted bythe United States.The Foreign Secretary said that in discussions in MarchGeneral Franco had proposed to the United States Ambassador in madrid a direct agreement between Spain, Portugal and the UnitedStates to facilitate the acquisition of military bases, and the develop-ment of Spain&apos;s military potential, by the United States. The UnitedStates Government were now awaiting our reactions to this proposal.From the military angle alone there would be advantages in securingcloser relations with Spain, for the reasons given by the Chiefs ofStaff in the report annexed to his paper. Politically, however, there-were strong objections to our associating ourselves in any way withthese proposals, and he had come to the conclusion that we must doail we could to induce the United States to abandon this policy, or atleast urge them to develop it slowly and make it clear that we werenot prepared to associate ourselves with it. It would probably bepossible to persuade the French Government to take the same line.Spanish association with the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation,whether as a full member or indirectly through a bilateral agreementwith the United States would seriously prejudice the reputation ofthat Organisation.The Minister of Defence said that he agreed with the foreign secretary, both on the purely military advantages, and on the over-riding political disadvantages, of closer association with Spain.Moreover, a decision to provide the Spanish forces with military equipment would mean that the equipment was not available for themore urgent needs of other Western European countries. As a matterof tactics, however, it might be preferable to invite the United StatesGovernment to put their proposals forward for consideration by theNorth Atlantic Council.The First Lord of the Admiralty said that he was himself infavour of associating Spain more closely with Western european defence. The military arguments were very strong, and the political objections could be over-estimated. In war we should need Spanishsupport, and this would be more effective if preparations had beenco-ordinated in advance.It was the general view of the Cabinet, however, that no time should be lost in making it clear to the United States Governmentthat we were strongly opposed to closer association with Spain, andin making every effort to induce them to abandon this policy. If weurged them merely to develop it slowly, they would tend to believethat our opposition would gradually lessen and they might be encouraged thereby to proceed with further discussions.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment of our strong opposition to the closer association of Spain in -the defence of Western europe and to urge them to abandon their policy of promoting theassociation of Spain with the Western democracies.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to request the French Govern-ment to make similar representations to the United States.(3) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to inform other Commonwealth Governmentsof our attitude towards this question.Visits by The Cabinet then considered a memorandum by the First LordH.M. Ships of the Admiralty (CP. (51) 188) suggesting that in view of the revoca-to Spanish tion of the United Nations resolution inviting Member. States toPorts. withdraw their diplomatic representatives from Madrid the Govern-ment should now remove the restriction which prevented His
Majesty&apos;s ships from paying courtesy visits to Spanish ports in thecourse of their periodical cruises.In favour of this proposal it was argued that United States and dutch naval vessels had paid courtesy visits to Spanish ports since the revocation of the United Nations resolution. Visits by His Majesty&apos;s ships might have some useful effect on public opinion in Spain: if wewere given an opportunity to send His Majesty&apos;s ships on courtesyvisits to ports in the Soviet Union, we should not be slow to takeadvantage of it. The Royal Navy would find it convenient, fortraining purposes, to have this occasional, use of Spanish ports andanchorages; and it might also be valuable in any future war that officers and men of the Royal Navy should have had practical experi-ence in these waters. Such visits could be regarded as a normalincident in Fleet movements. A start could be made by one or two small visits which should not attract much publicity; but it was hopedthat later on more and larger ships might visit these ports.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, despite these argu-ments, there were overriding political objections to allowing any ofHis Majesty&apos;s ships to pay courtesy visits to Spanish ports. Amonglarge sections of public opinion in this country such visits would beregarded as an unwarrantable compliment to the existing politicalregime in Spain.The Cabinet (4) Decided to maintain for the time being the restriction pre-venting His Majesty&apos;s ships from paying courtesy visits to spanish ports.Defence.CivilServiceMan-Power.(previous reference:CM. (51) 8thConclusions,Minute 2.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (CP. (51) 182) on the results of the Prime Minister^request (CP. (51) 36) that Ministers in charge of Departments should consider to what extent they could discontinue or retard the peace-time activities of their Departments in order that staff might be madeavailable for defence work.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the response to this request had been most unsatisfactory. Further efforts must clearly be made to ensure a substantial transfer of existing staff to defence work. The Departments concerned had already initiated a jointreview to ensure that the technical and professional staff engaged onworks services were employed to the best advantage. He recom-mended that a similar review of scientific staff should now be initiated.In his paper he had suggested that this should be undertaken bySir Henry Tizard; but he wished now to propose that the lord president and the Minister of Defence should arrange for this reviewto be initiated by the Scientific Advisory Council and the defence research Policy Committee. In stating that it should be the aim off this review to release scientific staff for the defence programme,he had not meant to imply that scientific staff should necessarily betransferred to the Defence Departments: it would be equally effective if defence work were undertaken by scientific staff in civil Depart-ments. On the curtailment of existing Departmental activities, theTreasury would pursue the proposals which had been put forward by departments; but, in addition, he suggested that independent investi-gators should undertake ad hoc enquiries into any branches of departmental work whose urgency and importance seemed open to question. He asked for the co-operation of his colleagues in making these enquiries effective.In discussion the following points were made: -id) The Minister of Local Government asked whether theChancellor of the Exchequer was satisfied that there was effective41034-2 c
machinery for transferring to defence work such staff as the Depart-ment had offered to make available for this purpose. He had himselfoffered to transfer about 15 per cent, of the staff of his Department;but, according to his information, none of those whom he had offered to make available had yet been transferred to defence work. TheChancellor of the Exchequer undertook to look further into thispoint.(b) The Minister of Defence said that in his opinion the pro-posals put forward by the Chancellor of the Exchequer were not likely to secure the results required. He was himself formulatingmore drastic proposals, including powers of compulsory transfer, andhe hoped shortly to be in a position to put these before his colleagues.(c) The Prime Minister said that Departments were naturallyreluctant to abandon any of their current activities. Ministers must therefore satisfy themselves personally that their officials had madea real effort to find ways and means of releasing staff for defence work. He asked all Ministers in charge of Departments to take a close personal interest in this matter, and to give their full support to the efforts which the Chancellor of the Exchequer was making toprovide the staff required for defence work without any substantial increase in the total of Civil Service manpower.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (5.1) 182 for accelerating thetransfer of Departmental staffs to defence work.Persia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 48thConclusions,Minute 1.)Evacuation ofA.I.O.C. staff from the oilfields.7. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in.the Persian situation. The United States Ambas-ambassador in Teheran had been unsuccessful in his attempt to persuade the Persian Government to modify their attitude about tankerreceipts. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Teheran had suggested thatlie should once more draw the attention of the Persian Governmentto the prospect that as a result of their actions the operations of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) in Persia would shortly bebrought to a complete standstill. The Foreign Secretary felt that onthe &quot;whole such a communication should not yet be made, but he pro-posed to instruct His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador to make a further strong protest against Persian interference with the Company&apos;s operations.This interference had increased: the house of the Company&apos;s Managerin Teheran had been searched and documents impounded; at Abadanthe Acting General Manager had been dismissed, the Company&apos;authority was not recognised, and there had been further interferencewith their property and the movement of their aircraft.In this deteriorating situation the Foreign Secretary said thatthere were three possible courses which might be taken with regardto the withdrawal of the Company&apos;s British staff from the oilfields:the decision to keep them at their posts could be maintained, thepolicy of a phased withdrawal could be resumed, or a general evacua-tion could be carried out. His view was that for the time being therewas no sufficient reason to depart from the decision reached by theCabinet on 2nd July, but that it might be necessary to reconsider this very shortly if Persian interference with the Company was notmodified, in view of its increasing influence on the &quot;morale of theBritish staff.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed to maintain for the time being the decision that theBritish staff of the A.I.O.C. should not be withdrawn fromthe oilfields.
Mediation by The Foreign Secretary said that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inthe United Washington had been informed in confidence by the United StatesStates Secretary of State that the United States Government were nowGovernment. considering the possibility that President Truman might appoint a personal representative to discuss a settlement of the dispute with both parties. There might be the basis for a settlement on the linesthat the Persian oil industry would be nationalised but operated by aBritish company as managing agent with remuneration related to thepast profits of the A.I.O.C. Mr. Acheson had asked for our views onthis, and had assured Sir Oliver Franks that if, with our agreement,an attempt was made to find a solution in this way the United states would not make the negotiations a starting point for further conces-sions to Persian demands if the Persian Government refused to accept their proposals.It was the view of the Cabinet that mediation on these lines wouldnot be acceptable. Like the earlier United States suggestion of an approach to the Persian Government through their Ambassador inTeheran, it suggested that the United States, in the role of a neutralthird party, hoped to find a compromise between the views held bythe two parties to the dispute, and not that they wished to support our case. The basis of settlement proposed appeared not to differsubstantially from that put forward in Teheran by the Company&apos;sdelegation, which had been rejected out of hand by the PersianGovernment. It was encouraging to see that the United StatesGovernment were now taking a very serious view of the situation,but further action by them could only be useful if they ranged them-selves clearly on our side and made it evident to the Persians thatthey were being asked to reconsider their refusal of our reasonableconditions for a settlement.statement by theForeignSecretary;The Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to reply on these lines to theUnited States Governments suggestion for further media-tion in the dispute.The Foreign Secretary read the draft of a statement on thepresent situation in Persia which he would make later in the day inthe House of Common if it proved necessary to do so.It was the general view of the Cabinet that a lengthy statement should not be made at this time. The decision of the international court would probably be announced that day, and a further state-ment taking this into account could be made early in the following week. If the Court rejected our interim application it would probablybe on the ground that they considered the dispute not to fall within their jurisdiction, and we must make it clear that such a decisions would not relate in any way to the merits of our case. It was agreedthat the statement should include a brief account of the furtherobstacles placed by the Persian Government in the way of theCompany&apos;s operations, as illustrations of their intransigent attitude,and that it should repeat the Governments determination to take all practicable measures to protect British lives. We should also say once more that we remained ready to enter into negotiations. certain minor amendments to the statement were also suggested.The Cabinet-(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to be guided by these viewsif he found it necessary to make a statement that day inthe House of Commons on the situation in Persia.Cabinet Office, S.WA,5th July, 1951.
