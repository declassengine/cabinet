Persia.(previous reference :CM. (51) 45thConclusions,Minute 4.)1. The Foreign Secretary said that there had been a new development in the situation in Persia, which might have a very serious effect on the position of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.).A Bill had been presented to the Majlis providing that persons chargedwith interfering with the running of the national oil industry shouldbe triable by a military court and should in certain circumstances be liable to the death penalty. The Bill related primarily to acts of sabotage, but the Company&apos;s manager at.Abadan. had been threatened with it in respect of his refusal to accept the form of receipt prescribed by the National Iranian Oil Company (N.I.O.C.) for oil delivered tothe A.I.O.C&apos;s tankers. His Majesty&apos;s Consul-General at Khorram-shahr, on instructions from His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Tehran, had now authorised the Manager to sign the form of receipt, if necessary,on condition that the charge of sabotage was withdrawn; and HisMajesty&apos;s Consul-General had at the same time been instructed tolodge a strong protest against this threat with the N.I.O.C&apos;s represen-tative at Abadan.The position of the A.I.O.C&apos;s tankers at Abadan was not clear.It was believed that the master of one tanker had got his ship awaywithout signing any form of receipt, and that three or four had sailedafter signing a receipt headed &quot; National Iranian Oil Company&quot;recording simply the details of the oil loaded on the tanker. TheA.I.O.C. had now instructed their general manager that no form of receipt should be given which acknowledged the receipt of oil fromthe N.I.O.C. unless a proviso was added stating that the N.I.O.C&apos;title to the oil was not admitted. It was, however, unlikely that thePersian Government would accept the inclusion of such a proviso.The group of Ministers dealing with Persia would be meetinglater in the day and would be discussing in detail the next steps to betaken in respect both of the new Bill against sabotage and of the tanker position, but the Cabinet might wish to express their generalviews on these issues.The Sabotage In discussion of the new Bill it was agreed that the PersianBill. Government must not be left in doubt of the serious view which HisMajesty&apos;s Government would take of its application to british members of the staff of the A.I.O.C. A strong protest should atonce be addressed to the Persian Government stating that we should hold them responsible for the consequences to British subjects of any action taken against them under the Bill. We should at the same timemake it clear that the staff of the Company were under instructions tomaintain the installations at the oilfields and the refinery as long asthey were able to carry out their duties without interference.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to give clear warning to thePersian Government that His Majesty&apos;s Governmentwould take a serious view of the application to Britishsubjects of this Bill against sabotage of Persia&apos;s oil supplies.Position of The Cabinet then considered the position of the tankers atTankers at       Abadan.Abadan. It was recalled that at a meeting of Ministers on 20th June it had&apos;-\ - been agreed that we should withdraw the tankers as soon as it became clear that Persian action would prevent oil from being shipped fromAbadan. Some Ministers felt that, in view of the risk that the persians might seize the tankers, the moment had now come to with-draw those at Abadan and to discontinue the present arrangement bywhich other tankers were moved in as those which had loaded left the port. It was also suggested that the Persians should now be warned that our naval vessels would intervene to protect the tankersif they were molested by the Persians on passage down the river. Onthe other hand, it was pointed out that the present position at Abadanwas obscure. Complete withdrawal of the tankers would lead inevit-ably to the cutting off of supplies of crude oil from the oilfields to therefineries and would prejudice the prospect of reaching a solution of40895 b 2
the dispute before the A.I.O.C&apos;s staff withdrew. Also if the company were bound to shut down in Persia it would be advantageous to obtainall the oil we could before this happened. To stop loading wouldprecipitate a complete breakdown, with a serious danger of riotingand loss of British lives.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that a decision to withdraw the Anglo-Iranian oil company&apos;s tankers from Abadan should be deferred until further information was available about the current situa-tion there.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that full preparationshad been made for the operation (&quot; MIDGET &quot;) for the evacuation ofthe British staff of the A.I.O.C. from Abadan. It was not possible to guarantee the safety of the staff dispersed at the oilfields, who wouldhave to make their way to Abadan for evacuation.. The thirty-sixhours needed to put this operation into effect could be shortened,perhaps by as much as twelve hours, if the forces were assembled inadvance, and could be shortened still more if they were flown toShaiba in Iraq. The Iraqi Government had reluctantly agreed thatShaiba could be used for this purpose, provided that the operation was limited to the protection of British lives.The Cabinet (3) Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for the imme-diate assembly in Egypt of the forces required for operation &quot; MIDGET.&quot;(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment of the decision noted in Conclusion (3) above and of the reasons which had led to it.(5) Agreed to defer for the time being a decision to move these forces into Shaiba.In further discussion the following points were also made:  (a) The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe Indian Government had now urged the Persian Government tomake every effort to reach a settlement of the dispute by negotiation.This was an encouraging development, in view of the unhelpfulattitude which the Indian Prime Minister had earlier adopted.(b) The Minister of Labour said that, while he was in Geneva,he had discussed the situation with a Persian trades union represen-tative. The latter had told him that the Persian workers were opposed to nationalisation, were pro-British, and were bitterlyopposed to communism. They had great faith in the Shah, and sus-pected the motives of the present Persian Government. His infor-mant had also expressed the view that we ought to adopt a strongerline in dealing with Dr. Mussadiq.Summing up the discussion, the Prime Minister said that theposition was changing so rapidly that the Cabinet would not wish totake further decisions at the moment. He suggested that the cabinet should authorise him, if time did not permit of reference to his other colleagues, to decide, in consultation with the Foreign Secretary andthe Minister of Defence, when the moment had come to give executiveorders for the evacuation of the British employees of the A.I.O.C.from Abadan.The Cabinet (6) Agreed that, if time did not permit of reference to theCabinet, the Prime Minister should decide, in consul-tation with the Foreign Secretary and the Minister ofDefence, when the moment had come to authorise theoperation (&quot; MIDGET&quot;) for the evacuation of Britishemployees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company fromAbadan.evacuation of A.I.O.C.Staff.
Korea. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that in a broadcast on 23rd June(Previous M. Malik, the Soviet representative at the United Nations, had saidReference: that the fighting in Korea could be brought to an end if the partiesCM. (51) 37th Were willing to enter on the path of a peaceful settlement, and he had conclusions, suggested that as a first step discussions should be started betweenMinute 4.) the belligerents for a cease-fire and an armistice providing for the mutual withdrawal of forces from the 38th Parallel. Although it hadbeen embodied in a speech containing a good deal of abuse of theWestern Powers, this statement might indicate a change of policy onthe part of the Soviet Government. There had been earlier rumoursthat they might now be willing to see the fighting in Korea brought toan end, in view of the increasing demands which the Chinese Corn-munists were making for munitions and equipment. The foreign secretary said that the first step must be to test the sincerity of theSoviet suggestion; and he had proposed in Washington that theUnited States and United Kingdom representatives at the united nations should at once establish contact with M. Malik for thispurpose. Meanwhile he would be expected to make an immediatestatement in the House of Commons, and he read to the Cabinet adraft of the statement which he was proposing to make in reply to aPrivate Notice Question that afternoon. The substance of that state-ment was that, while there were no grounds for unqualified optimism,we should lose no opportunity of following up the suggestion thrown out in M. Malik&apos;s broadcast.In discussion it was agreed that it should be made clear in thestatement that M. Malik&apos;s suggestion was not substantially different from proposals which had been under consideration for some time bythe Good Offices Committee of the United Nations. The statement should, in effect, welcome what we hoped might be an indication thatthe Soviet Government were now willing to support proposals for a truce in Korea which the Western Powers had been advocating forsome time past. $The Cabinet Approved, subject to amendment on the point noted above,the statement which the Foreign Secretary proposed to makein the House of Commons that afternoon about the Sovietsuggestion for discussion of a cease-fire and armistice in korea.supplementary pensions for miners.(previous reference:CM. (51) 42ndConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered memoranda by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (51) 171) and the Minister of National Insurance(CP. (51) 176) on the question whether the proposed supplementary pensions scheme for miners should be made compulsory by means ofan order under section 27 of the National Insurance Act, 1946.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers were both urging thatthe supplementary pensions scheme should be made compulsory bymeans of an order under the National Insurance Act, since they feared that, if the miners were left to decide whether they should join thescheme, the younger men would be liable to postpone joining it. the alternatives appeared to be an order under the Act of 1946 or special legislation.The Minister of National Insurance said that the policy hithertoadopted had been to treat the miners&apos; scheme as exceptional, to main-tain the objection in present circumstances to any extension ofsupplementary pensions schemes in other nationalised industries andto try to overcome the objection of the Trades Union Congress to an enquiry into supplementary pensions schemes generally. That policy could not be maintained if the Government sought by affirmative resolution to get the support of both Houses to all the details of the
miners&apos; scheme, which now covered surface-workers as well as under-ground-workers. How could similar schemes be then refused tomanual workers in other nationalised industries? The right course was to give existing miners an option whether to enter the scheme andto make membership of the scheme a condition of service for futureentrants to the industry. Arrangements along these lines had workedsatisfactorily in other industries. The Government Actuary had indicated that there was no actuarial difficulty in making the schemevoluntary for existing employees but compulsory for future entrants.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) While stress had previously been laid on the value of a supplementary pensions scheme in preventing wastage from themining industry, Ministers had also understood that the scheme would be popular among miners and would stimulate recruiting. Itwas on the basis of the popularity of the scheme that the Cabinet had felt obliged to agree (on 11th June, 1951) that it should cover allsurface-workers as well as underground-workers, notwithstanding the serious objections to the extension of the scheme to surface-workers. The approach which had now been made by the NationalUnion of Mineworkers suggested that the scheme would not be well received by its members. If, in fact, the Union had misinformed theGovernment in the past and there was widespread refusal to partici-pate, it would be necessary to consider whether the whole project should be dropped. The Minister of National Insurance, equally with the National Coal Board, would find difficulty in enforcing con-tribution to a scheme which large numbers of miners did not want.(b) Section 27 of the National Insurance Act, 1946, had beenprimarily intended for supplementary schemes which had to be dove-tailed into a national scheme and were to be administered by theMinistry of National Insurance. It would be an abuse of thestatutory provision to use it for the sole purpose of imposing this new scheme on existing and future miners. After approval by parliament the scheme would remain inflexible on all matters of principle unless a fresh order were made. The unions representing the workers inother nationalised industries would press for similar orders to be madein respect of their industries, and the debate on the order would giverise to claims on behalf of war pensioners.it) There was no sufficient reason why the Minister of Fuel and power should not approve the miners&apos; supplementary pensions scheme under section 37 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act,1946, and leave its implementation to the National Coal Board andthe National Union of Mineworkers. They had both asked for thisscheme on the ground that it was desired by the miners; and theNational Union of Mineworkers was sufficiently influential to secure its acceptance by the great majority of existing miners, while theNational Coal Board could make membership of the scheme a con-dition of service for future entrants. This would ensure that membership of the scheme remained, as was proper, a matter of con-tract between the Board and the individual miner. If the provisionsof the National Insurance Act were invoked to coerce miners intoacceptance of the scheme, the miners were likely to ask at a later datethat &quot;they should be given an increase in wages to compensate themfor their enforced contributions.The Cabinet Agreed that the miners&apos; supplementary pensions scheme should not be made compulsory by means of an order under&apos;section 27 of the National Insurance Act, 1946. and should,subject to the approval of the Minister of Fuel and power under section 37 of the Coal Industry Nationalisation Act,1946, be introduced by the National Coal Board as a matterof contract with the individual miner.
bechuanaland protectorate.TshekediKhairia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 45thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 173 and 177) on theline which the Government should take in the debate in the House ofCommons on the Opposition motion deploring the banishment of tshekedi Khama from the Bamangwato territory.The Prime Minister, said that he had seen the notes of the speech which the Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations was pro-posing to make in this debate and he was satisfied that a strong casecould be made in support of the Governments policy in this matter.If the Government now reversed that policy, under pressure in theHouse of Commons, their authority would be gravely weakened bothin this country and in Africa.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he was gravelyconcerned about the effect upon African opinion of a vote on this issue in which the Governmenfs policy would be endorsed by, at best,a very small majority. He had therefore been considering meansof avoiding a division on this motion. He suggested that, following the precedent established when Sarawak was about to be ceded to theCrown, the Government might offer to send two back-benchMembers Of the House of Commons to the Bamangwato Reserve sothat they could judge for themselves, and on their return report to theHouse, what was the state of local feeling on this question.In discussion it was pointed out that the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations had himself paid a recent visit to Bechu-analand for this very purpose, and the Governmenfs policy was based on the judgment which he had formed. It was hardly appro-priate that the Government should now invite two back-benchMembers to consider and report to the House whether the Secretaryof State had correctly interpreted the state of feeling among the bamangwato.The Cabinet were, however, informed that there was likely to be considerable difficulty in persuading Government supporters to vote against the motion unless some concession could be made to the strong feelings on this question which were held in some sections ofthe Labour Party. The Secretary of State for commonwealth relations said that the basis of the Governmenfs policy in respect of tshekedi was that the Bamangwato Tribe were themselves strongly opposed to his return to the Reserve. The Government could there-fore say, without inconsistency, that they were willing to base them-selves in this matter upon local law and custom and to put thequestion once more to a Kgotla of the Tribe whether Tshekedfsbanishment should be continued. The Government might thenarrange for back-bench Members of the House of Commons to be present at the Kgotla as observers, so that they might satisfy them-selves that the issue had been put fairly to the Tribe and that theproceedings had been properly conducted.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be expedient to offer such a concession in the debate in the House of Commons onthe following day. It might be advisable to send three observers tothe Kgotla-one from each of the main political Parties.The Prime Minister proposed that he himself should speak in the debate on this motion. He would also attend the meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party, at which the Governmenfs policy wasto be explained in advance of the debate in the House of Commons.And he would join with the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations in seeing privately some of the Government supporters whowere most reluctant to vote against this motion.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Prime Minister and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations should speak on the Govern-
merit&apos;s behalf in the debate on this motion in the Houseof Commons on the following day.(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to state in the debate that the Government wereprepared to arrange that the question of tshekedi khama&apos;s continued banishment should once again bereferred to a Kgotla of the Bamangwato Tribe, and thatback-bench Members of the House of Commons shouldbe present as observers at this Kgotla.Divorce Laws.(previous reference :CM. (51) 33rdConclusions,Minute 5.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the LordChancellor (CP. (51) 162) setting out the proposed terms of reference for the Royal Commission on Marriage and Divorce, which he had agreed with the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Scotlandand the English and Scottish Law Officers.In discussion it was suggested that too wide an interpretationmight be placed on the passage in the terms of reference whichcharged the Commission with the task of considering steps whichmight promote a healthy and happy married life and might safeguard the interests of children. This could take the Commission into fieldsoutside the law and its administration. The object had been to makeit clear to the Commission that they were to keep in mind the need to maintain married life and were not simply to consider whether tomake divorce easier. This object could, however, be secured if that part of the terms of reference which required them to considerwhether any changes should be made in the law or its administrationwere qualified by the words: &quot; having in mind the need to promote and maintain healthy and happy married life and to safeguard theinterests and well-being of children.&quot;In further discussion reference was made to the desirability of ensuring that working-class opinion was adequately represented onthe Commission. The Cabinet were informed that the LordChancellor had discussed the membership of the Commission with theother Ministers concerned and had submitted a list of names to thePrime Minister.The Cabinet-Approved, subject to the amendment noted above, the draftterms of reference of the Royal Commission on marriage and Divorce annexed to CP.
