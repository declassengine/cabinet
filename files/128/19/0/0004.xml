2. The Cabinet resumed the discussion, commenced at their meeting on 7th December, 1950, of the question whether civil servantsserving in the Armed Forces in time of war should retain the balanceof- their civil pay. They had before them memoranda on this question by the Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (50) 274 and CP. (51) 17),the Home Secretary (CP. (50) 325).and the Minister of Defence(CP. (51) 2).The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that continuance of thepractice of giving public servants the balance of their civil pay in timeof war would put them in a preferential position as compared withthe great majority of industrial workers. As it was not practicable to require all private employers to make a similar concession, theeffect was that taxpayers and ratepayers some of whom would beserving in the Forces without receiving balance of civil pay wouldhave to pay the cost of this preferential treatment for public servants.The fairer course would be to abandon the practice of giving thebalance of civil pay to public servants.The Minister of Defence said that it had been generally admitted that the arguments for and against the continuance of this practicewere fairly evenly balanced; and, that being so, it might be wiser toleave the status quo unchanged. The Service Ministers favoured thecontinuance of past practice, since they believed that the changesuggested by the Chancellor of the Exchequer would have a preju-dicial effect on recruitment and would make the &quot; Z &quot; Reservistsreluctant to attend for peacetime training. An extended NationalService Grants scheme, on the lines suggested, would involve a large amount of administrative work and serious delays in the meeting of claims.The Home Secretary said that a decision could not be indefinitelydelayed because police authorities and other public authorities wouldhave to be told, some time in advance of any threatened emergency,of any change in Government policy. If National Servicemen in timeof war received the rates of pay now given to regulars, the greatmajority of industrial workers would lose little or nothing in40027-4 b 2Press Council.^previous reference:CM. (49) 46thConclusions,Minute 4.)Armed Forces.Balance ofCivil Pay.(previous reference:CM. (50) 83rdConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (51) 15) on the proposals put forward by the news-paper proprietors for the establishment of a Press Council.The Lord President said that these proposals would give the newspaper proprietors an undue influence on the Council; and they also provided narrower terms of reference for the Council than theRoyal Commission had contemplated. It was already clear that theNational Union of Journalists would not be prepared to accept theproposals. The right attitude for the Government t6 take would beto point out that these proposals did not give effect to the Royal Corn-mission^ recommendations, but to leave it mainly to the journaliststo bring pressure to bear on the proprietors to bring forward a betterscheme.There was general agreement with the view expressed by the lord president. While it was not desirable that the establishment of thePress Council should be unduly delayed, some further delay wouldgive the opportunity for opposition to develop to the undesirablefeatures of the proprietors&apos; scheme.The Cabinet Authorised the Lord President to seek to secure, on the lines indicated in the discussion, suitable modification of theproposals of the newspaper proprietors for the creation ofa Press Council.
remuneration by joining the Armed Forces; and the problem ofunequal treatment, as between one class of worker and another, wouldbe much less acute than had been suggested.In further discussion the following points were made:  id) The field over which any Government decision would applywould be much larger than in previous wars, since persons employedin the National Health Service and in nationalised industries wouldclaim the same treatment as civil servants. Local authority servantswould also have to be treated on the same basis, though this wouldinvolve the enactment of legislation compelling the local authoritiesto give the balance of civil pay.ib) For the most pant, the private employers who gave the bal-ance of civil pay were those who enjoyed a monopoly of some kind:it was more difficult for employers in competitive industry to make this concession. Moreover, since the cost ranked as a workingexpense of the undertaking, a considerable proportion of the costwas borne by the Exchequer. It was undesirable that this concession should be made at the expense of the Exchequer, but at the discretion of the employer.id) The scheme of National Service Grants had worked well inthe last war, though it inevitably involved something in the nature ofa means test. Moreover, in a future war Parliament would presume-ably re-enact the provisions of the Courts (Emergency Powers) Act,which had given some relief to those in the Armed Forces by wayof a moratorium in respect of fixed charges of various kinds.id) No decision had yet been taken on the rates of pay to be givento National Servicemen in time of war and it was not, therefore, prac-ticable to form a final judgment on the extent of the potential hard-ship if balance of civil pay was not given.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for officials of the Departments concerned to consider in furtherdetail the issues raised by the question whether civil servants,called up for military service in time of war, should receivethe balance of civil pay; and agreed to resume their con-sideration of this question at a later date, when the reportof the officials was available.Council efEurope.Convention on human Rights.(previous reference:CM. (50) 68thConclusions,Minute 2 (4).)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Sec-retary (CP. (51) 10) on the form in which the Government might agree to draft Articles on the right to property, the right to education and the right to political liberty, which it was proposed to include ina Protocol to the Convention on Human Rights.The Foreign Secretary said that the Governments views on the texts of these three Articles should be submitted without delay to theCommittee of Experts which was to draw up revised texts for con-sidenation by the Committee of Ministers. There would be a lateropportunity for the Cabinet to consider the final draft text, althoughit was desirable that their views should be before the Committee of experts when they started their work.The Lord Chancellor said that he was not satisfied with the revision of the Assembly&apos;s texts which had been produced by an official working party. Obviously the Government must continue to disclaimthe jurisdiction of the proposed European Court of Human Rights,since this would seriously compromise the sovereignty of Parliament.But there would remain some risk that the Government, or some sub-sequent Government, might be forced to concede some right of appealto this Court; and it was therefore important to ensure that the protocol was not framed in dangerously ambiguous terms.There was general agreement that the Government should main-,tain its opposition to the grant of a right of appeal to a supra-national
Cocos Islands. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theSecretary of State for the Colonies and the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 4) proposing that, subject to theconditions stated in paragraph 20 of the memorandum, administrative responsibility for the Cocos Islands should be transferred to theAustralian Government, who were anxious to develop the air-stripthere and use it as a staging point for a civil air service betweenAustralia and South Africa.The Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for commonwealth relations said that the Chiefs of Staff now attached even greater importance, on strategic grounds, to the early development of thisair-strip. If, therefore, the Cabinet approved the proposal in thememorandum, he suggested that the Prime Minister of Australiashould be told of the Cabinefs decision, before he left London, and asked to ensure that the Australian authorities lost no time in carryingout the improvement of the air-strip.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that the SingaporeLegislative Council must be consulted before any public announce-ment was made;  and, if anything was to be said to the Primeauthority. If any subsequent Government should concede this claim,the position was safeguarded by the right which existed to contract out on giving six months&apos; notice.In discussion of the text of the three Articles in the Protocol,the following points were made:  (a) The Article relating to the right to property should be amended in a way which preserved the right of the Government toimpose taxation and to bring property under public ownership. Itmight be found that the text proposed by the Assembly could more readily be amended in this respect.(b) It would have been preferable that the Article dealing withthe right to education should make no reference to religious instruc-tion; but, in view of the recent experience of Central european countries and the present practice in Communist States, it was probably inevitable that European democratic countries should wish,in any convention dealing with education, to safeguard the rights ofparents to give religious and moral instruction to their children. Toavoid any suggestion that the State was under an obligation to ensurereligious instruction, the simplest amendment would be to add, at theend of the first sentence of the text proposed by the working party, thewords &quot; with due regard to the right of parents to educate their children in their own religion,&quot; and to delete the rest of the textproposed by the working party. It would be important to preserve the safeguard, proposed by the working party, that the right to education would be limited by the resources of the territory concerned.(c) The observance of the Article relating to the right to politicalliberty would not in itself prevent a lapse into totalitarianism, since it did not appear adequately to prohibit devices such as the single listof candidates in elections. It would also be necessary to make it clearthat the Article could not be applied to all Colonial territories.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the working party, referred to in CP. (51) 10, to consult the LordChancellor and the Attorney-General on the text which, inthe light of the Cabinefs discussion, should be submitted tothe Committee of Experts, on the basis that the Governmentwere not yet committed and would consider the positionfurther in the light of the final revised text prepared by theCommittee of Experts for submission to the Committee ofMinisters of the Council of Europe.
Minister of Australia at this stage, it should be made clear that thedecision was conditional upon such consultation and that no premature-ture disclosure should be made.The Secretary of State also drew attention to the proposal, inparagraph 13 of the memorandum, that the Australian Governmentshould be asked for assurances that full operating rights on this air-strip would be accorded to the British Overseas Airways corporation and Colonial Air Lines, if required, and that the United KingdomGovernment and the Government of Singapore would be consulted before any such rights were granted to foreign air-lines. He asked that this point should be added to the conditions enumerated inparagraph 20 of the memorandum.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that, to the four conditions stated in paragraph 20of CP. (51) 4, there should be added a further condition,viz., that the Australian Government should give assurances that full operating rights on the air-strip in theCocos Islands would be accorded without question to theBritish Overseas Airways Corporation and Colonial AirLines, if required, and that the Governments of the UnitedKingdom and Singapore would be consulted before anysuch rights were granted to foreign air-lines.(2) Agreed that, subject to the conditions set out in paragraph 20of CP. (51) &quot;4 and to the further condition mentioned inConclusion (1) above, administrative responsibility for theCocos Islands might be transferred to the australian government.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to communicate this decision tothe Prime Minister of Australia, before he left London, onthe understanding that no public announcement would bemade until the consultations with the Singapore LegislativeCouncil and the trustees of the Clunies-Ross estate hadbeen completed.o\ The Foreign Secretary said that the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment had that morning published their reply to the united nations. proposals for a settlement in Korea. Those proposals had been evolved after prolonged discussion at the Meeting of commonwealth Prime Ministers, who had striven to avert the threat of war and find means of securing a peaceful settlement of outstanding issues in the Far East. The Chinese reply would disappoint the hopeswhich the world had set on this fresh initiative by the commonwealth prime Ministers. It was difficult to avoid the conclusion that theChinese, by this reply, had rejected the United Nations proposals;for the conditions which they sought to lay down could not beaccepted. Nor was it easy to find in their reply any basis for any counter-proposals. What then was the next step which the united nations Assembly must take? The United States representative atthe United Nations had already been canvassing views on a draft resolution which would condemn Chinese aggression and would invitethe Collective Measures Committee to consider what additional measures could be taken to meet it. The Foreign Secretary said thathe himself had always been apprehensive about&apos;the consequences which would follow if China were formally branded by the united nations as an aggressor; and he feared that widespread sanctions against China would seriously increase the&apos; risk of general war in theFar East. This view had been endorsed by the Meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers; and the attitude taken during that meeting had hitherto restrained the United States Government from precipitate action. If, in view of the Chinese reply, a resolution had now to beput to the United Nations Assembly on the lines favoured by the
Minister of Australia at this stage, it should be made clear that thedecision was conditional upon such consultation and that no premature-ture disclosure should be made.The Secretary of State also drew attention to the proposal, inparagraph 13 of the memorandum, that the Australian Governmentshould be asked for assurances that full operating rights on this air-strip would be accorded to the British Overseas Airways corporation and Colonial Air Lines, if required, and that the United KingdomGovernment and the Government of Singapore would be consulted before any such rights were granted to foreign air-lines.

The Chinese reply would disappoint the hopeswhich the world had set on this fresh initiative by the commonwealth prime Ministers. It was difficult to avoid the conclusion that theChinese, by this reply, had rejected the United Nations proposals;for the conditions which they sought to lay down could not beaccepted. Nor was it easy to find in their reply any basis for any counter-proposals. What then was the next step which the united nations Assembly must take? The United States representative atthe United Nations had already been canvassing views on a draft resolution which would condemn Chinese aggression and would invitethe Collective Measures Committee to consider what additional measures could be taken to meet it. The Foreign Secretary said thathe himself had always been apprehensive about&apos; the consequences which would follow if China were formally branded by the united nations as an aggressor; and he feared that Widespread sanctions against China would seriously increase the&apos; risk of general war in theFar East. This view had been endorsed by the Meeting of Common-wealth Prime Ministers; and the attitude taken during that meeting had hitherto restrained the United States Government from precipitate action. If, in view of the Chinese reply, a resolution had now to beput to the United Nations: Assembly on the lines favoured by the
Americans, he felt that any condemnation of China should be con-fined to Chinese action in Korea. He also considered that any pro-posals for the application of sanctions against China should be putforward in a separate resolution. In general, he advocated a policyof caution and restraint. It would be necessary to consult other commonwealth Governments. Meanwhile, he was doing his best to restrain the United States Government from any hasty declaration.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) In telegrams from Peking there had been some indications that the Chinese might refrain from pressing their attacks in Korea,even though they rejected the United Nations proposals for a cease-fire. According to press reports, the opposing forces in Korea were nolonger in contact. Should it not be suggested to General MacArthur,through the United States Government, that in present circumstances it would be unwise for the United Nations forces to pursue the-Chinese, if they withdrew to the north?The Foreign Secretary said that he would be glad to consider this suggestion. The Chief of the Air Staff, who was now in washington, might take the matter up in military circles there. TheForeign Secretary added that, throughout the period of the hostilities in Korea, the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff had shown themselvesto be much more far-sighted than the United States military authori-ties in their appreciation of the situation, and he was glad to take this opportunity of acknowledging the very valuable information and advice which he had received throughout from the United KingdomChiefs of Staff.(b) It was suggested that any condemnation of China, in anyfurther resolution by the United Nations Assembly, might take theform of condemning, not the Chinese action in Korea, but the Chinesereply to the United Nations proposals. By this means it might bepossible to avoid the dangerous consequences which would follow ifChina had been formally branded an aggressor.(c) So far, there were no indications that the United StatesGovernment had any definite plans for bringing further pressure tobear on China. There was, in fact, little more that they could do byway of economic sanctions against China. They were therefore likelyto ask that we should bring some further economic pressure to bear.The Foreign Secretary said that, if such a request were made, he wouldbe disposed to handle it on the same principles as had been applied in relation to the problem of East-West trade in Europe.(d) We should be slow to accede to any suggestion that we should send military reinforcements to Korea.(e) Though every effort should be made to avoid any precipitate action in the United Nations, the weight of public opinion in theUnited States would probably compel the United States Governmentto make some early declaration condemning the actions of the chinese people&apos;s&apos;s Government. On the other hand, there would be great diffi-culty in enlisting the support of public opinion in this country for anyextreme action by the United States.The Cabinet (1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement, and endorsedhis general approach to the present situation in the Far East.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would arrange for other commonwealth Governments to be kept informed of furtherexchanges about Korea, both with the United States Govern-ment and in the United Nations Assembly.6. The Prime Minister said that the discussion recorded in thepreceding Minute confirmed his view that it would be inexpedient for him to make a speech during the coming week-end on the need forincreased defence preparations.
The Foreign Secretary agreed with this view. Before long hewould have to make a speech on the international situation; but hewas anxious to avoid doing this at a time, or in a way, whichmight provoke an unfriendly reaction in the United States. Publicopinion in the United States was in a critical mood and needed careful handling. It was vitally important that nothing should be said at this juncture which might jeopardise the prospects of retaining the fullmilitary support of the United States for the defence of western europe.The Cabinet took note of these statements.Cabinet Office, SWA,18th January, 1951.
