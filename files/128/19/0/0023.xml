Korea. 1.  The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet last(Previous       discussed the Korean situation on 22nd March, General MacArthurReference:      had again made a public statement&apos;going beyond the military aspectsCM. (51) 22nd of the situation and encroaching upon political matters which were conclusions.    the concern of Governments.   It seemed desirable that GeneralMinute 6.)       MacArthur should receive some fresh directive concerning his public utterances. The Foreign Secretary said that, subject to the views ofhis colleagues, he proposed to suggest to the United States Govern-ment that they should issue such a directive to General MacArthurand to indicate to them the general lines on which this might be framed.The Cabinet approved the course proposed by the foreign secretary.Overseas 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that two memoranda (CP. (51)Information 53 and 59) had been circulated to the Cabinet regarding the level of services. expenditure on overseas information services in 1951-52.   The(Previous        Chancellor of the Exchequer had proposed that the Estimates forCM. (48) 66th   these services should be reduced from  11-7 million to  10-15Reference:      million. His proposal had been endorsed by the Information ServicesConclusions,     Committee; but the Ministers directly responsible for these servicesMinute 4.)       had intended to urge the Cabinet to approve a cut of only  900,000which would have left the Estimates at  10 - 8 million.  Since assuming-ing office as Foreign Secretary, he had discussed this matter further with the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and commonwealth relations, and had persuaded them to accept the lower figure pro-posed by the Chancellor. He had undertaken to consider, in consul-tation with them, how this sum could best be distributed betweenthe various overseas services.  In considering reductions in expendi-ture on the overseas services of the British Broadcasting Corporation,account must be taken of the risk that, if the B.B.C. discontinuedaltogether their use of a particular wave-length, they might be unableto resume its use at a later date.The Foreign Secretary said that he had thought it right to mention this matter to the Cabinet, partly because it would no longer be necessary for them to consider the two memoranda which hadbeen circulated to them, and partly because of the press campaignwhich was being conducted against the proposed reduction in the overseas expenditure of the B.B.C. He was taking steps to trace theorigins of that campaign, and to ascertain whether there had been anyimproper disclosure of confidential information to the press.The Cabinet Agreed that provision should be made for an expenditureof  10-15 million on the overseas information services in1951-52; and took note that the Foreign Secretary would discuss with the Secretaries of State for the Colonies and commonwealth Relations the distribution of that total sumbetween the various services.Defence. 3.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that His Majesty&apos;sMutual Aid.     Ambassador in Washington had received preliminary warning that,(Previous        on their judgment of our prospective balance of payments in the reference:      coming year, the United States Government were likely to decideCM. (50) 87th   that they should not ask Congress to authorise any financial assistanceConclusions,    for this country under their Foreign Aid Bill. This meant that, whileMinute 1.)       they would be prepared to provide us with some finished military equipment, their legislation would not authorise any direct financialassistance towards our defence programme or the free provision ofmaterials  or  components  required for  that  programme.   TheChancellor said that he deprecated this attitude on the part of the
The Cabinet Took note of this statement by the Chancellor of theExchequer, and agreed that every effort should be made to dissuade the United States Government from presentingtheir Foreign Aid Bill to Congress in such a way as to pre-judge the outcome of the enquiries which were now beingmade into the equitable sharing, between the North AtlanticPowers, of the burden of strengthening the military defencesof Western Europe.Additional 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignMeasures ^ Secretary and the Secretary of State for the Colonies (CP. (51) 96)Against China, inviting a decision whether to detain in Hong Kong a tanker, owned(Previous by a Chinese shipping company, which had been undergoing extensiveReference: repairs there. The repairs had now been completed and the ownersCM. (51) 8th had applied for permission for the tanker to leave the port. TheConclusions, Governor of Hong Kong had asked for urgent instructions. AlthoughMinute 1.) the tanker could be detained, if a broad interpretation were placed onDetention of the Hong Kong emergency regulations, the Governor had emphasisedTanker in the danger of retaliatory action by the Chinese either against HongHong Kong. Kong or against our shipping in China.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that this tanker wasa merchant vessel, on Lloyds&apos; Register, and not a warship. There wasno dispute about its Chinese ownership, and the Governor was alreadystretching his powers by delaying permission for its departure from hong Kong. In his view there was a serious danger that the Chinesewould take reprisals against British shipping in Chinese waters if the vessel were detained, and he was not aware of any precedent fordetaining a merchant vessel in time of peace under similar circum-stances.The First Lord of the Admiralty agreed that it would be undesirable to detain the tanker. The Minister of Transport drew attention to our vulnerable position: a quarter of the foreign tonnage in Chinese ports was British, and the crews of most of these ships were Chinese, so that retaliatory action by the Chinese Governmentcould cripple our shipping in the Far East.United States Government. Though he had not expected to receive any substantial financial aid from the United States, he thought itwrong that they sh&amp;uld pre-judge in this way the results of theso-called &quot;Nitze exercise,&quot; which had been undertaken with theobject of determining how the burden of military preparations for thedefence of Western Europe could be equitably shared between theNorth Atlantic Treaty Powers. He had therefore arranged to sendTreasury officials to Washington in an attempt to persuade the UnitedStates Government not to pre-judge this decision and to leave open the possibility of providing us with some financial assistance in supportof our defence effort.The Minister of Labour said that he had understood it to be the firm intention of the Cabinet to refrain from asking the United states for financial assistance towards our defence programme. He had thought that the defence policies of the United Kingdom Governmentwere no longer to be dependent upon the whims of Congress.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Cabinet had decided that our new defence programme should not be contingent on the receipt of financial aid from the United States. The cabinet had not, however, decided nor should they, in his view, decide to forego any benefits which we might secure from the pooling of resources between the North Atlantic Powers as a result of the &quot; Nitzeexercise.&quot;
The Foreign Secretary said that, although the tanker wasregistered as a merchant ship, it would be of very great value to theChinese for their military purposes in Korea. The Chinese forces were short of oil and the tanker would most probably be used tosupply troops there which were fighting against United Nations forces.We had received representations from the United States Governmentwhich made it quite clear that the release of this ship would bereceived most unfavourably in the United States, and public opinionat home would also be provoked. The possibility of Chinese reprisalscould not. be ignored, but the Chinese already had a bad record intheir dealing with our ships and maritime installations in Chineseports and, if they wished to take action against our shipping or againstHong Kong, they would not feel the need for this pretext for doing so. We had already taken, without causing retaliatory action by theChinese, the more provocative step of refusing to supply oil to China.The release of the tanker would be particularly inappropriate at thepresent time, when a new Chinese offensive might be impending in korea, and it would be misrepresented in the press, both in Americaand in the United Kingdom, as a betrayal of the United Nations forcesin Korea.In discussion the following points were made in favour of refusing to release the tanker:  (a) Under the January resolution of the United Nations, to whichwe had subscribed, we were pledged to refrain from assisting theforces of aggression in Korea. This laid us under a moral obligationto deny possession of the tanker to the Chinese. There were noprecedents in international law covering the present situation, in whichwe were fighting Chinese troops in Korea and at the same time trading with China, but it was most probable that we were legally entitledto seize the vessel. It was also probable that we had a legal right to requisition it, and to pay compensation, and this might be the wisercourse to take.(b) Public opinion would find it inconsistent that we should refuse to supply oil to the Chinese and at the same time release a tanker which might enable them to obtain supplies of oil fromVladivostok or the Black Sea(c) The United States Chiefs of Staff had expressed grave concernat the possibility of our releasing the tanker, which they regarded as of great military value to the Chinese. We were vitally dependent,in the Far East as elsewhere, on United States support and co-opera-tion, and it would be foolish to jeopardise this in order to avoid thedanger of Chinese retaliation. There was no reason to suppose thatthe Chinese Government were influenced by any other motives thanthose of expediency, and they would not hesitate to take action against&apos;us in Hong Kong whenever it suited them to do so.The following points were made against detaining the tanker:  (d) The detention of this ship would be inconsistent with our policy objectives in China, and would prejudice our prospects ofmaintaining and improving our relations with the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment. It would be tantamount to the application of economic sanctions, which the Cabinet had already decided would be un-desirable and ineffective, since we had far more to lose from economic sanctions than the Chinese.(e) In order to prevent the tanker from reaching Canton it wasnot necessary for us to incur the odium of detaining her, since it wouldbe possible for the United States Navy or the National Governmentof China to intercept her as soon as she left Canton (whither she wasto be towed from Hong Kong).(/) It was pointed out in the paper (paragraph 4 (c)) that numbersof British ships were in or on their way to Chinese ports, and the detention of the tanker could be said to justify immediate retaliatory action by the Chinese against these ships.
The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was in favour of refusing to allow the tanker to leave Hong Kong, and it was agreed that instructions in this sense should be sent to the Governor. It was also agreed that the Ministers concerned should consider further themethod to be adopted for maintaining custody of the vessel, and thelegal position in relation to its detention, requisition or seizure. Itwas the view of the Cabinet that this decision, which applied to this one vessel alone, was not inconsistent with their earlier decision, whichthey maintained, that economic sanctions should not be imposedagainst China.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the tanker Yung Hao should not be allowed toleave Hong Kong, and invited the Secretary of State forthe Colonies to instruct the Governor of Hong Kongaccordingly.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Secretary of State forthe Colonies, in consultation with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the Law Officers, to give further considera-tion to the method by which the custody of this vesselshould be maintained.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 73) covering a draft of a multilateral Agreementgoverning the status of the armed forces of the North Atlantic treaty powers while on N.A.T.O. duty in each other&apos;s territory. This drafthad been prepared by a working party on which the United KingdomGovernment had been represented, and the North Atlantic Deputieshad now submitted it to Governments for approval.The Foreign Secretary said that the main issue for the cabinet was whether they approved the proposals put forward in this drafton the subject of criminal jurisdiction over the members of visitingN.A.T.O. forces in this country. The United States authorities atpresent exercised exclusive criminal jurisdiction over their forces inthis country, by virtue of the United States of America (visiting forces) Act, 1942; and, when the Cabinet had considered this position on 27th April, 1950, they had taken the view that in time of peacethe military authorities of an Allied country should be content witha criminal jurisdiction concurrent with that of the United Kingdomcourts. The present draft would confer exclusive jurisdiction onvisiting N.A.T.O. forces only in respect of offences relating to thesecurity of the sending State but not to that of the receiving State, andoffences which were contrary to the law of the sending State but notto that of the receiving State. For all other offences there would beconcurrent jurisdiction and, with certain exceptions, the civil courtswould have the primary right to exercise jurisdiction.The Lord Chancellor said that the proposals in the draft Agree-ment annexed to CP. (51) 73 would represent an improvement on theexisting position, and he supported them in principle. He had certain suggestions of detail which he would communicate to the foreign secretary&apos;s legal advisers; and he suggested that he and the LawOfficers should be kept in touch with the course of the future dis-cussions on the draft. He also thought it right to inform the Cabinetthat, in his view, this draft might be inconsistent with the convention on Human Rights which had been adopted by the Council of Europe.the Home Secretary said that he also approved in principle theproposals in the draft Agreement.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he would com-municate with the Foreign Secretary regarding the application of theproposed Agreement in Colonial territories.North atlantic treaty.Status of forces ofSignatoryPowers.(previous reference:CM.

Egypt- 6.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignAnglo-Egyptian Secretary (CP. (51) 95) explaining the basis on which he proposed treaty. to reopen the negotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian(Previous Treaty of 1936.   At the invitation of the Cabinet (CM. (50) 86tnReference: Conclusions, Minute 5) the Defence Committee had considered and cm. (51) 22nd approved proposals put forward by the Chiefs of Staff, and theConclusions, probable effect of these proposals upon our position in Egypt and the minute 7.) Middle East was examined in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.The Foreign Secretary said that his colleagues would wish toconsider these proposals in relation to general policy in the middle east and to the state of public opinion at home. One consideration which must be borne in mind was that, whatever individual Egyptianpoliticians might be willing to say in private about the removal offoreign forces from Egyptian territory, they would feel obliged to takea very different line in public. In paragraph 7 of his memorandumhe had summarised three possible courses of action: (i) to informthe Egyptian Government that we were not prepared to resume negotiations for the revision of the Treaty; (ii) to offer to negotiateand be willing to make further concessions in order to secure agree-ment; or (iii) to offer to negotiate on the basis of the proposals by theChiefs of Staff, but to make no substantial further concessions. he did not feel that the second course was practicable, since our require-ments as stated by the Chiefs of Staff could not be reduced withoutgravely endangering our military position in the Middle East. Toadopt the first course, and stand firm until the Treaty became due for revision in 1956, was attractive from the point of view of immediatesecurity, but it would make our position exceedingly difficult when thetime came for revision. Accordingly he recommended the thirdcourse, though he pointed out that many of our proposals wouldcertainly not be acceptable to the Egyptian Government. Moreover,the question of the future status of the Sudan would inevitably beraised by the Egyptians, and this might destroy the chances ofagreement.The Lord Privy Seal said that he agreed with the foreign secretary that an offer to negotiate on the basis of the proposals bythe Chiefs of Staff was the course best calculated to achieve our aims in the whole of the Middle East. Occupation of territory by foreigntroops was increasingly out of line with world opinion. If we were able to revise the Treaty in such a way that the Egyptians felt thatThe Foreign Secretary said that the United States government might seek to extend the application of this Agreement so that itwould apply to any of their forces on duty in the territory of anyother North Atlantic Treaty Power, irrespective of the nature of thatduty. It would probably be necessary to resist any attempt to extend the Agreement in this way.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the draft Agreement annexed to cp. (51) 73 regarding the status of the armed forces of north Atlantic Treaty Powers while on N.A.T.O. duty in^ each other&apos;s territory.(2) Took note that the Lord Chancellor would communicate cer-tain detailed suggestions to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s legal advisers; and that the Secretary of State for the colonies would communicate with the Foreign Secretary regardingthe application of the Agreement in Colonial territories.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the LordChancellor, the Attorney-General and the Lord Advocateto be kept informed of the course of further international discussions on this draft Agreement.
they were being treated as equal partners, it might form the first step towards similar arrangements elsewhere in the Middle Bast. We couldnot negotiate with Israel until we had come to terms with Egypt, buttreaties with both might open (the way to restoring satisfactory reia-tions between the two. Both the negotiations and (if they were successful) the implementation of the new arrangements would needimaginative handling, but if we could impress the Egyptians with oursincerity and our determination to carry out the arrangements for ourmutual benefit we might secure our essential military objectives in theMiddle East. The process of removing our troops would be gradual,and we should make every effort, by employing the best men for thepurpose, to carry out our obligation to train the Egyptian forces. Theproposals provided for our re-entry into Egypt in an emergency, andwe should best be able to exercise this right if we had been able tobuild up in the meantime relations of real cordiality between the armed forces of the two countries.In a short discussion several Ministers drew attention to the complexity and importance of the issues involved, and to the changein the situation which had been brought about by recent develop-ments in Persia. Although the Egyptian Government were pressingus to open negotiations without delay, the Cabinet felt that they must take time for a fuller consideration of these issues.The Cabinet Agreed to defer further consideration of CP. (51) 95 until their next meeting.Japanese 7.   The Foreign Secretary recalled that at their meeting onPeace Treaty.   22nd March the Cabinet had invited him to seek means of delaying(Previous        further proceedings for the discussion of a Japanese Peace Treaty.Reference:      Since then the United States Government had given public indicationsCM. (51) 22nd of their readiness to discuss the terms of a treaty, and their draft treatyConclusions,     had been made available to certain Governments.   Moreover, the minute 3.)       Japanese were showing signs of blaming this country for delaying thediscussion of a treaty.  It was obviously undesirable that we should lose all credit for the forward policy which we had followed in thismatter for several years past.  And, as the United States authorities were already consulting other Governments, it was important thatwe should take the earliest opportunity of making our views known.The fact that Mr. Dulles was disclosing some of the points which hadbeen made to him in confidence during his recent mission on thissubject was a further reason against delaying official discussions withthe United States authorities.In discussion there was general agreement that we should nolonger seek to delay an official exchange of views between the interested Governments on the terms of a Japanese Peace Treaty. Itwas, however, suggested that it might be politically inexpedient to volunteer a statement in the House of Commons that discussions onr this subject were about to be opened with the United States Govern-ment. The point Was also made that the Soviet Government should&apos; . &quot;[ &apos; at least be given an&quot; opportunity to be associated with discussions onthe terms of a Japanese Peace Treaty. ,;The Cabinet Agreed that in the circumstances described by the foreign secretary it would be inexpedient for the United KingdomGovernment to seek to delay discussion, between the inter-ested Governments, of the terms of a Japanese Peace Treaty.Cabinet Office, SWA,2nd April, 1951.
