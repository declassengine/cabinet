The Cabinet were therefore asked to considerwhether the Secretary of State for Scotland should make a statement in the House of Commons on the following day to dispel any suchimpression.It was the general view of the Cabinet that no further statement should be made on this subject at the present time.

The recent increase in the volume of exports from Hong Kong to China would undoubtedly be the subject of unfavourable comment in the debate;and doubt might with some justification be thrown upon the extentto which the United States Government could be said to have cbn-curred in the policy which we had followed hitherto regarding theexport of rubber to China.40660-3 b 2

Parliament.legislative programme for1951-52Session.The Cabinet agreed that the President of the Board of trade should speak in the debate immediately after the Leader of theOpposition, and that the Minister of State for Colonial Affairs shouldmake a short speech in reply to the debate.Later in the meeting, The Minister of State for Colonial affairs said that telegrams had now been received from the High Commis-sioner for Malaya and the Governor of Singapore forecasting stronglocal opposition to the proposed embargo on rubber exports to china. It was feared that some Asiatic members of the MalayanExecutive Council in Malaya might resign as a protest, and that the controversy over this decision would endanger the working of thenew federal constitution. The rubber producers in Malaya assumed that rubber would continue to be sent to China from Ceylon andIndonesia, and considered that a sacrifice was being imposed upon them which other exporters of rubber were, not being called uponto make.The Cabinet agreed that, despite these representations, they mustuphold the decision to impose an embargo on the export of rubber to china. It should be made clear to the producers in Malaya that theUnited Kingdom Government would buy rubber for which forwardcontracts with China had already been made, and that the CollectiveMeasures Committee would be asked to secure a general embargo on the export of rubber to China from other rubber-producing countries. The President of the Board of Trade should, however,take care to use, in his speech that afternoon, language which sug-gested that the embargo would be imposed in consultation with theColonial Governments concerned.5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secre-tary (CP. (51) 125) setting out a provisional programme of Bills forthe 1951-52 session, which had been prepared by the Committee on future Legislation.The Home Secretary said that the primary purpose of the paper was to ensure that there was an even flow of work to the Parliamen-tary CounseFs Office during the summer, and that enough Bills wouldbe ready to keep both Houses occupied in the opening weeks of thenew session. The provisional programme consisted of DepartmentalBills; and the political content of the King&apos;s Speech would have to beconsidered at a later stage. Departments had brought forward pro-posals for some further minor Bills since the programme was framed.The Minister of Labour said that some of the Bills included inthe programme raised points on which he would wish to hold consul-tations with the Ministers concerned.The Minister of Local Government said that he might at a later stage bring forward proposals, arising from the recommendations ofthe Local Government Man-Power Committee, for a Bill designed tosecure some simplification of the administrative procedure of localauthorities.The Cabinet-Approved  the legislative programme outlined in CP.(51) 125.Education ActDenominationalSchools.^previous reference:CM. (50)28th6. The Minister of Education said that he wished at an earlydate to enter into confidential discussions with the Church authoritiesabout some concessions which might be made in respect of denomination-tional schools. He understood that the Opposition were now pre-pared to support concessions of this kind. They should not impose jany serious financial burden on the Exchequer.
Persia- 7.   The Cabinet considered a note by the Foreign Secretary(Previous (CP. (51) 129) covering the revised draft of a reply to a message from reference: the Persian Prime Minister on the nationalisation of the oil industryCM. (51) 33rd in Persia, together with instructions to His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in conclusions. Teheran on an oral communication to be made when the reply was minute 1.)       delivered. -Reply to the The Foreign Secretary said that he had revised the reply in thePersian light of the views expressed at a meeting of Ministers on the preceding^rime Minister, day. He had arranged that the United States Government should be consulted on the terms of the reply but he had not yet received theirviews. The reply did not enlarge upon the serious consequences of aPersian refusal to negotiate, or of unilateral action by thePersian Government, but he proposed to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador to remind Dr. Mossadeq that dispossession of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) must lead to economic chaos in persia and to a situation from which only the Communists couldprofit.The Prime Minister said that it should be made quite clear in our reply to the Persian Government that the United Kingdom Govern-ment desired to reach a settlement of the problem by direct negotiation with the Persian Government. They would represent the interests ofthe A.I.O.C. in the negotiations, but they were not prepared to treat the issue as one between the Company and the Persian Government.In discussion it was agreed that paragraph 4 of the draft should be omitted, since it was not essential to our case and wouldbe particularly unacceptable to the Persian Government, and thatfor similar reasons the reference in paragraph 3 to the &quot; doublecharacter &quot; of the 1933 Agreement should be replaced by a referenceto the &quot; two main purposes &quot; of the Agreement. It was also agreedthat paragraph 7 should be amended to make it clear that the issue was one between the two Governments, and that the proposed Missionwould represent the United Kingdom Government, though it wouldalso speak for the A.I.O.C., since the interests of the Government andthe Company were identical.Further Action. In a general discussion of the situation in Persia the followingpoints were made:  (a) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Company&apos;swithholding of royalties under the supplementary agreement hadalready put the Persian Government in serious financial difficulties..It would, however, be unwise to increase this form of pressure, since it would create in Persia economic disorders which might precipitatea Communist revolution.(b) The economic effects of our losing control over the Persianoilfields could hardly be overestimated. It might in the end be neces-sary to take military action, but our best hope of retaining possessionof the oil and control over its distribution lay in a settlement by negotiation, and we should concentrate our efforts on reaching sucha settlement.(c) Military intervention for the protection of British lives wouldnot be difficult, militarily or politically. But intervention for the pro-tection of property would involve the deployment of much larger numbers of troops and might have serious political repercussions. Ifsuch intervention was challenged few countries were likely to support us. India would oppose it, and her lead would probably be followedby the other Asiatic countries. It was essential that we should securethe support of the United States Government for any decision to send the Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Education to discuss his proposals with the Chancellor of the Exchequer and thereafter to bringthe matter before the Cabinet.
military forces into Persia. Some Ministers felt, however, that circum-stanoes might arise in which, for the sake of preserving our prestige inthe Middle East, we might have to risk serious opposition in theSecurity Council. -(d) Our strategic position in the Middle East was dependent upon our ability to maintain our position in Persia. If we were forced bythe Persian Government to withdraw from the oilfields the attitudetowards us of Iraq and Israel, and particularly Egypt, would beradically changed.(e) The Persian Government seemed at present to be willing tonegotiate, on the basis of the nationalisation law, only With theA.I.O.C.; but, even if they maintained this attitude, the Mission sentto Persia could be effectively a Government Mission, and HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Teheran might be instructed to find outwhether a Mission led by a Junior Minister would be acceptable tothe Persian Government.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, before a reply was sent to the Persian Government on the lines of the draft annexed to cp. (51) 129, the Foreign Secretary should assure himself that theUnited States Government would give solid support to such an approach. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington should be instructed to discuss the whole situation with the United States Secre-tary of State and to ascertain his views. The older members of theCommonwealth should be informed of the views of the United King-dom Government. It would also be useful if the Pakistan Governmentcould be persuaded to bring their influence to bear on the PersianGovernment to assist us in reaching a settlement by negotiation: theForeign Minister of Pakistan should be consulted personally, if hewas still in London.The Cabinet-^-(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for immediate con-sultation with the United States Government about theterms of the proposed reply to the Persian Governmentand about the general situation in Persia.(2) Agreed that the reply should not be despatched to the PersianGovernment until the views of the United States Govern-ment had been obtained.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to ascertain whether the PersianGovernment would be willing to enter into negotiationswith a Mission led by a Junior Minister.(4) Ihvited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to inform the older members of the Commonwealth of theviews of the United Kingdom Government on the situa-tion in Persia.(5) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to invite the Government of Pakistan to bring their influence to bear on the Persian Government in order thata settlement by negotiation might be reached.8. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Foreign Secre-tary (CP. (51) 127) covering the draft of a reply to the message fromthe United States Secretary of State On Far Eastern policy.The Foreign Secretary said that in drawing up the reply he hadtaken into account the Cabinet&apos;s decision of 3rd May about theretaliatory bombing of bases in China and their subsequent discussions on strategic exports to China from British territories (CM. (51) 34thConclusions, Minute 2). -In discussion the Cabinet approved, in addition to certain draft-ing changes, the following amendments of substance in the draft reply:  (a) The reply should make it absolutely clear that we must beKorea.(previous reference:CM. (51) 33rdConclusions,Minute 2.)Reply toMr. Acheson&apos;message.
consulted before a decision was taken to authorise retaliatory bomb-ing, even though the bombing was to be carried out solely by UnitedStates forces.(b) The reply should state that we were now informing the older members of the Commonwealth of our decision on retaliatorybombing.(c) The reply should include a reference to the recent decisionto discontinue all exports of rubber to China.The Cabinet Authorised the Foreign Secretary to reply to the UnitedStates Secretary of State in the terms of the draft annexed to cp. (51) 127 subject to the amendments approved in their discussion.Retail food prices.(previous reference:CM. (51) 21stConclusions,Minute 3.)9. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food (CP. (51) 126)outlining the increases in retail food prices on which they had agreed,in the light of developments since the Cabinet discussed this question on 19th March.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (51) 126.Germany.soviet proposal fora Meeting of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 31stConclusions,Minute 3.)10. The Foreign Secretary said that, in the discussions in Pariswith a view to framing an agenda for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers, the Western Powers had now reached the limit ofthe concessions which they were prepared to make to the SovietGovernment. If therefore the Soviet representative continued to beintransigent, there would be no point in continuing the conversations;but, in order to avoid the impression that there had been a final break-down, it would be announced that the meetings of officials had been interrupted and that further consultations regarding the possibility ofa Ministerial meeting would be pursued through diplomatic channels.Cabinet Office, S.WA,10th May, 1951.
