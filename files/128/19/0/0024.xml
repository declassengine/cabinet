Parliament. 1.  The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theBusiness in House of Commons in the following week.the House of Further consultations had been held about the proposed debateCommons. on the North Atlantic command organisation. The Opposition wereNorth Atlantic anxious that this should take place on or about 19th April; but theyTreaty: had expressed the view that there would be no advantage in the command Governments presenting a White Paper for the purposes of the debateOrganisation, unless it could include particulars of all the main appointments to be(Previous made under this command organisation.   Hitherto, it had seemedReference: unlikely that the discussions about the Mediterranean commandCM.(51)20th could be completed before the end of the month; but in the newConclusions, circumstances the Minister of Defence was pressing the StandingMinute 1.) Group to expedite them, and he would do his best to secure that a comprehensive White Paper on the command organisation was avail-able in time for the debate in the House of Commons.Additional 2.   The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that after theMeasures        Cabinets meeting on 2nd April he had instructed the Governor ofAgainst China. Hong Kong that the tanker Yung Hao should not be allowed toDetentionof    leave Hong Kong for China.  The Governor had at once called ina Tanker in      question the expediency of this decision; and anxiety about its con-Hong Kong,     sequences  had  also  been  expressed  by   the  British   Defence(Previous        Co-ordination Committee, Far East.   Apart from the argumentsReference:      which the Cabinet had taken into account in reaching their decisionCM. (51) 23rd  of 2nd April, two fresh considerations were advanced by the Governor.Conclusions,    First, the unofficial members of his Executive Council believed that minute 4.)       the detention of the tanker would have the most serious consequences for the Colony and had with difficulty been dissuaded from tenderingtheir resignations.  Secondly, the Governor believed that the tankercould not be detained without the use of force and that such action would provoke internal disorder and industrial disturbances in hong Kong.The First Sea Lord said that the Chiefs of Staff had consideredthese telegrams and had come to the conclusion that, despite the risks involved, the balance of advantage lay on the side of preventing the tanker from passing into the control of the Chinese Communists.They recognised, however, that, so long as she remained in harbpurin Hong Kong, she would be a continuing irritant to local Chineseopinion. They therefore recommended that she should be requisi-tioned and sailed from Hong Kong at the earliest possible date.In discussion the Cabinet again reviewed the arguments on bothsides which had been put forward at their meeting on 2nd April.The preponderant view in the Cabinet was that, despite the risks towhich the Governor had drawn attention, it would be impossible tojustify to public opinion in this country or in the United States adecision to allow this tanker to pass into the control of the chinese communists. The further suggestion was, however, made that the governors difficulties might be eased to some extent if the UnitedKingdom Government took this opportunity of raising with the peking Government the general question of Chinese interference with british shipping and other British interests in the Far East.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies and the FirstLord of the Admiralty to arrange for the tanker Yung Haoto be requisitioned and sailed out of Hong Kong at theearliest possible moment,(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to initiate discussions with the peking Government on the general question of Chineseinterference with British property in the Far East.
United Nations        The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignAction. Secretary (CP. (51) 100) reviewing the work of the Committee of the(Previous United Nations which was considering additional measures to meetReference: the Chinese aggression in Korea.   They also took into account aCM. (51) 8th memorandum by the Minister of Defence (E.P.C. (51) 31), on theConclusions, export of strategic goods to China, which had received preliminaryMinute 1.) consideration by the Economic Policy Committee on 3rd April.The Foreign Secretary said that in his view the Governmentshould continue to lay their main emphasis on efforts to reach a negotiated settlement with the Peking Government. They should oppose the imposition of any political sanctions against China, andshould not support any economic sanctions other than a selectiveembargo on strategic materials. It should be their aim to ensurethat the Additional Measures Committee would make no report tothe Assembly until the efforts of the Good Offices Committee had failed and that, even then, the report should not go beyond recom-mending a selective embargo, together with any possible measuresdirectly related to the situation in Korea. The Foreign Secretaryadded that, as regards goods shipped from Hong Kong to China, itwould be preferable that the United Kingdom Government, ratherthan the Hong Kong Government, should assume responsibility for operating this embargo. In practice this could be largely secured by arranging that the United Kingdom should not send to Hong Kongany goods covered by the embargo which were destined for onwardshipment to China.The Minister of Defence said that with his memorandum E.P.C.(51) 31 he had submitted the report of a working party which had considered the need for extending the embargo on the export of strategic goods to China. There were indications that the militarysituation in Korea might become more serious. The Chinese seemedto be building up large forces to the north of the 38th Parallel; andthey might be about to launch a counter-offensive, in which theymight have the support of Russian aircraft. If the military situationagain deteriorated, the United Kingdom Government might be underpressure to take immediate action to extend the existing embargo on strategic exports to China; and in that event it might be expedient to adopt the extended list put forward in the report annexed to his memorandum. Meanwhile, however, he thought it would be suffi-, cient to follow the line advocated in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be premature at the present stage to extend the embargo on the lines contemplated in the report annexed to E.P.C. (51) 31. The measuresenvisaged in that report would amount to full-scale economic sanctions. It was by no means clear that a policy of economic sanctions would command the support of Western European Govern-ments or other Commonwealth Governments; and the United- Kingdom Government should certainly not be committed to actionon the lines contemplated in E.P.C. (51) 31 without further inter-governmental consultation. The proposals in the Foreign Secretary&apos;smemorandum (CP. (51) 100) were more limited. Of the items men-tioned in paragraph 7 (a) of that memorandum those listed in sub-paragraphs (i)-(iv) were already being withheld from China; andthe only new proposal was that exports useful for the production ofthose items should also be subject to the same embargo. It wouldbe for the Departments concerned, when the time came, to apply the criterion proposed in paragraph 7 (a) (v) of CP. (51) 100 to thegoods and materials listed in the report annexed to E.P.C. (51) 31.The Cabinet-(3) Approved   the   recommendations   in   paragraph   12   of cp. (51) 100.(4) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for the United. Kingdom representative at the United Nations to be instructed accordingly. -
(5) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the Governments ofthe United States and France of the line which the UnitedKingdom representative was to take in the additional measures Committee; and invited the Secretary of Statefor Commonwealth Relations to arrange for other Com-commonwealth Governments to be similarly informed.Egypt.Anglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:CM. (51) 23rdConclusions,Minute 6.)3. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the foreign secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (51) 95) on the re-opening of nego-tiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936.The Foreign Secretary recalled that in his memorandum he had suggested three possible courses of action, of which he favoured the resumption of negotiations with the Egyptian Government upon thebasis of the proposals of the Chiefs of Staff. He recognised that itwould probably prove impossible to reach an agreement acceptable tothe United Kingdom; but, so long as discussions were continuing, the egyptians would be less likely to take any drastic step which wouldworsen the present situation. It did not seem desirable to hastenconclusions on the withdrawal of British troops.The Minister of Defence said that the proposals of the Chiefsof Staff offered a basis on which discussions could begin. At a later stage fighting troops could be moved gradually out of Egypt, but itwould be essential to maintain the base in an efficient condition, andto preserve the vast stores which had been built up in Egypt. It wasalso very desirable that we should retain a substantial R.A.F.organisation in Egypt, so that we could be ready to meet our defence commitments in the Middle East: but he recognised that the Egyptianswere unlikely to agree that such large numbers of British troops should remain in Egypt. In his judgment it would be a mistake totake too stiff a line with the Egyptians in these negotiations. if negotiations went on for a year or so, the international position wouldhave either improved or worsened in the meantime; and the pro-traction of the talks might make it easier to determine at a later stagewhat final policy should be adopted.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that on 19th March theDefence Committee had instructed the Chiefs of Staff to examine, inconsultation with the Treasury and the Foreign Office, the financial implications of their proposals regarding Middle East defence. TheTreasury had not yet been approached on this subject. He hopedit would be possible to frame an agreed estimate of the cost of pro-viding a base outside Egypt before His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador became involved in negotiations with the Egyptian Government. He feared that the estimates of cost which had been put forward by the Chiefsof Staff might be found to be too low.In further discussion attention was drawn to the serious difficul-ties in the way of reaching a settlement with the Egyptian Govern-ment on defence matters, even if these could be treated in isolationfrom other outstanding difficulties between the two countries. the anti-British bias of all political parties in Egypt might be due to a desire not to be outdone in patriotic fervour by political opponentsrather than to any definite animus against this country; but the fact remained that it would be difficult for any single political party to sign an agreement which contemplated that British troops would remain for an indefinite period on Egyptian territory, and there was little prospect of our being able to negotiate an understanding withall the Egyptian parties. It was therefore suggested that the subjectof Middle East defence might be considered from a wider angle, withother friendly countries, including the United States, on the basis that the defence of the Middle East was at present very weak and thatthe western democracies could not afford to allow the oil resources
of the Middle East to fall into Soviet hands. On this basis any approach to Egypt could be on the broader basis of the defence arrangements which the democracies felt to be necessary in the middle east, and American and other forces might be associated with thedefence of Egypt. While it was recognised that Middle East defence would have to be considered sooner or later in this wider context, itwas the general view of the Cabinet that little progress could be madeon these lines in any discussions with the Egyptians in the immediatefuture. The Egyptian Ministers had made it clear that they wouldobject to the stationing of any international force on Egyptian terri-tory, and they might even regard this as a worse solution than thecontinued presence of British troops. Moreover, neither the Govern-ment nor the people of the United States were yet prepared to con-template substantial additional commitments in the Middle East.On the basis that the Egyptian problem would have to be tackledby the United Kingdom Government alone, most Ministers consideredthat a mere announcement of our intention to remain in Egypt untilthe Treaty expired in 1956 would not be sufficient. We could not take our stand on the terms of the Treaty, since we were not ourselvescomplying with its terms, e.g., as regards the number of British troopsstationed in Egypt. Moreover, the Egyptian Government wouldprobably counter any refusal to negotiate by denouncing the treaty and taking other direct action. The working of the base depended on Egyptian co-operation, and our military strength in Egypt wouldbe greatly weakened if we had to maintain ourselves there in the face of sustained Egyptian hostility. On military grounds, therefore, thebalance of the argument was in favour of reopening the negotiations.It would, however, be dangerous, in view of the present world situationand the state of public opinion in this country, to remove any sub-stantial number of fighting troops from Egypt before negotiations had begun, or at an.early stage in their course. Public opinion inthis country would not tolerate what would be regarded as a furtherweakness towards the Egyptians, before it had been seen whetherthe Egyptian Government were prepared to make concessions to theBritish point of view.The Cabinet were informed that the Egyptian Government wouldprobably be unwilling to reach a settlement unless some concessionswere made to their point of view regarding the Sudan. In thiscountry, on the other hand, any settlement with Egypt would be judged by the manner in which it dealt with the question of Egyptianinterference with the passage of tankers to Haifa through the suez canal.It was suggested that the United Kingdom Government, at the outset of any further negotiations with the Egyptian Government,should make it clear that it was their aim to enable the Sudanese to attain self-Government at the earliest practicable opportunity, andthat no understanding could be reached with Egypt which interfered with this objective. The Cabinet agreed that there could be no ques-tion of abandoning this policy towards the Sudan or of sacrificingthe interests of the Sudanese as the price for an agreement with Egypton defence. It would not, however, be practicable to refuse to discussthe Sudan with the Egyptian Government. The aim should thereforebe to secure that, if these discussions broke down, they should do sobecause of a refusal by the Egyptian Government to subscribe to areasonable statement of the principles which should govern the twocountries in their future policy towards the Sudan.There was general agreement that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador,independently of the negotiations on defence, should continue to impress on the Egyptian Government the need for an early removalof the ban on the passage of tankers to Haifa through the Suez Canal.They could properly be told that Parliament was unlikely to agree toany fresh proposals regarding Egypt without a satisfactory solutionof the&apos;tanker problem. The Egyptian Governmenfs interference withthe passage of tankers through the Canal raised the general questionof international control over such waterways.   It would always be
in the peace-time interests of this country that these narrow channels,used by international shipping, should remain open for the passageof all ships, arid careful thought should now be given to the questionwhether the international control of such channels should not be suggested as a general issue for discussion in some appropriate inter-national forum. If the Egyptians felt that they were under attack from this angle, they might be more ready to reach a settlement onthe other outstanding questions with this country.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo should re-open negotiations with the Egyptian Government forthe revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty of 1936, and invited the Foreign Secretary to frame, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, instructions for the guidance of HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in these negotiations.(2) Agreed that, concurrently with these negotiations, HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador in Cairo should bring continuouspressure to bear on the Egyptian Government to remove the ban on the passage of tankers through the Suez Canal.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider whether the general question of the control of the narrow channels used by international shipping should be raised in an appropriate international forum.Yugoslavia.economic assistance.(previous reference:CM. (50) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the President of the Board of Trade (CP. (51) 98)recommending further economic aid to Yugoslavia.After a short discussion the Cabinet (1) Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to make availableto Yugoslavia a further credit of  4 million, on the same terms as the earlier credit of  5 million, for the purchaseof raw materials.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, when informing the yugoslav government of this further credit, to warn them that theUnited Kingdom Government would not be able to con-tinue this economic assistance unless they were satisfiedthat the Yugoslav Government were determined to balancetheir foreign payments in the near future and were adopt-ing policies calculated to bring about that result.Armed Forces.Balance ofCivil Pay.(previous reference:CM. (51) 4thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 99) covering the report of an official com-mittee which had considered the issues raised by the practice of paying to civil servants called up for military service in time of warthe difference between their civil and military pay.In discussion it was suggested that the alternatives before theCabinet were to arrange that all men called up for military service inany future war received the balance of their civil pay, or to discontinuethis practice in the public service. In previous wars the practice had led to many anomalies, and outside the public service the position hadbroadly been that employers enjoying a monopoly had been able to afford to give this facility to their workers, and had in effect passed the cost to the Exchequer by including the payments which they madeamong their working expenses. In any future war the anomalieswould become even more striking, since any concessions granted to civil servants and local authority employees would presumably beextended to National Health Service workers and possibly to the employees of socialised industries. The cost of making the concession,
by taxation and increases in price, would fall on the remainder of thepopulation, who would not enjoy the same privilege because the firmsby which they were employed were engaged in competitive trade. it seemed impracticable to require all employers to give the balance ofcivil pay: the only practicable course, according to this view, was to discontinue the practice for the future.In favour of continuing the present practice, it was pointed outthat every discussion of the issues involved had shown that thearguments were evenly balanced and it therefore seemed better tocontinue a practice which had existed for many years, even thoughthe number of public servants covered by it would in future be muchgreater than in the past. It was also pointed out that, while theGovernment might give a lead to employers by refusing to give civilservants the balance of civil pay in future, it would be difficult toprevent employers from continuing what had previously been regardedas a reasonable practice.There was general agreement that, if the payment of balance ofcivil pay were to be continued, account should be taken of the savings in personal expenses mentioned in paragraph 7 of the report annexed to CP. (51) 99.The Cabinet Agreed to defer a decision on the question whether civilservants should receive the balance of civil pay in any future war.Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for theposition of Z-reservists to be further examined, as pro-posed in paragraph 13 of the report annexed to CP. (51)99.(1)(2)Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,5th April, 1951.
