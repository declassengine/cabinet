Parliament 1.   The Cabinet discussed the steps which should be taken inPlasterboard    consequence of the approval by the House of Commons on 5 th July,(Prices) Order. 1951, of an Opposition prayer that the Plasterboard (Prices) (No. 1)Order, 1951, should be annulled.The Minister of Works said that the Order followed one of the courses regarding the price control of building materials which hadbeen approved by the Government in 1946. The Order provided for different maximum prices for different companies, because PlasterProducts, Limited, would be Unable to operate if margins were fixed at a level which was proper for the British Plaster Board Company.The Government had encouraged Plaster Products, Limited, to build,at considerable cost, a factory which had subsequently had to be sold;and this financial loss, together with the higher prices which PlasterProducts had to pay for their raw materials, made it impossible forthe firm to operate as cheaply as the British Plaster Board Company.This did not mean that Plaster Products were inefficient. He hopedthat he would be authorised to arrange for the Order to be madeagain and presented afresh to Parliament.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although the Plasterboard (Prices) Order followed a line ofpolicy which had been approved and announced some years before, itwould have been preferable if the proposal to make the Order hadbeen discussed by the appropriate Cabinet Committee, so that atten-tion might have been drawn to its novel features and steps taken toensure that an adequate number of Government supporters werepresent when it was debated.(b) The Order dealt with a problem which had caused difficultythroughout the history of price control, namely, how to fix a maxi-mum price or margin which kept enough businesses in the field tomeet the current demand without at the same time giving the more efficient businesses an unnecessarily high rate of profit. The plaster-board prices previously fixed had given the British Plaster BoardCompany a considerable profit margin.(c) The Order would secure some reduction in housing costs andit was, therefore, desirable that it should be made again. The risk thatthe House of Lords might feel encouraged to exercise their concurrentjurisdiction over delegated legislation would have to be faced.The Cabinet-Agreed that a fresh Order should be made on the lines of thePlasterboard (Prices) (No. 1) Order, 1951.Persia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 49thConclusions,Minute 7.)InterimRecommenda-tion by theInternationalCourt.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 192) covering an appreciation by the legal advisers to the Foreign Office of the interim ruling on the Persian oildispute given by the International Court on 5 th July.The Foreign Secretary said that this paper had been consideredby the group of Ministers dealing with the situation in Persia, who had agreed in general with its conclusions. He had informed the PersianGovernment that we accepted the ruling of the Court, and that weshould very shortly appoint our members of the proposed Board of supervision. He was now considering suitable names, which he would put before the Ministerial group. It was still not clear whether thePersian Government would accept the ruling of the Court: no officialreply had yet been received from them, but the Persian Prime minister had spoken publicly in a way which indicated that they were likelyto refuse to acknowledge the Courfs jurisdiction. He was preparing a paper, for consideration by the Ministerial group, on the next stepsto be taken if the Persians did adopt this course. The questionof reference to the Security Council of the United Nations was oneof the points which would then arise.
The Attorney-General said that there would be serious risks in referring the dispute to the Security Council. It would not be con-sidered a procedural matter and would therefore be subject to vetoin the Council. Under the provisions of the Uniting for Peace Reso-lution it might then pass to the General Assembly, where opinion,even on the question of a Persian refusal to acknowledge the jurisdic-tion of the Court, might not be generally in our favour.It was agreed that this question should be considered further whenthe Persian Government had officially declared their attitude towardsthe ruling of the Court.The Cabinet-(1) Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.The Minister of Transport said that certain passenger ships would shortly be passing through the Suez Canal en, route for the UnitedKingdom, where they were to embark emigrants for Australia andNew Zealand. If shipping was likely to be required for military opera-tions in connection with the Persian situation, this opportunity to intercept these ships should not be lost. If, however, we intended touse these ships for such a purpose, the Australian and New zealand governments should be consulted.The Minister of Defence said that he understood that these ships would not be needed for evacuating the British staff of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.). If the staff had to be evacuated from persia, they were not to be brought to the United Kingdom but wereto remain for the time being in the Middle East. A decision to takethe ships up for carrying troops must depend on further considerationby the Cabinet of the whole question of military action in Persia.The Prime Minister said that it would be useful to have the viewsof the Chiefs of Staff on the value of these ships for evacuating theCompany&apos;s staff. It might also be wise to inform the Australian andNew Zealand Governments of the possibility that we might requirethese ships.In discussion of the possible need for military action in Persia itwas pointed out that a decision whether any large-scale operation should be carried out had been deferred until the International Courthad given their ruling on our interim application. The ruling had now been given, but until the Persian response was known it wouldbe inadvisable to take any fresh action, in respect either of preparing to support the operations of the A.I.O.C. or of accelerating the with-drawal of their staff from the oilfields or refineries. It might, how-ever, be necessary to decide at short notice whether military action should be extended beyond the scale of operation MIDGET, whosepurpose was to evacuate the Company&apos;s staff from Abadan, and whichenvisaged no Persian opposition. The political implications of adecision to protect the Company&apos;s operations by force would be veryserious, both at home (in as much as it would involve the recall ofTerritorials and Reservists and some dislocation of the economy) andabroad in relation to repercussions in the United Nations and theUnited States.The Prime Minister said that he had asked the Foreign Secretaryto prepare a paper setting out the advantages and disadvantages ofmilitary action in Persia on a scale larger than that already approved for evacuating the A.I.O.C. staff from Abadan. It was difficult toestimate whether such action would increase the obduracy of thePersian Government or awaken them to a realisation of the facts ofthe situation. The Cabinet had already had before them a paper bythe Chiefs of Staff (CP. (51) 172) giving the; purely military implications-tions of such an operation, and they would wish to look carefully atthe.political implications before reaching a decision, which mighthave to be taken at very short notice.
139CM. 50 (51)24fiThe Cabinet (2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to prepare a paper discussing the political implications of military action in Persiadesigned to enable the A.I.O.C to continue their opera-tions there.United The Foreign Secretary said that in accordance with the CabinefsStates decision on 5th July he had informed the United States GovernmentApproach to that we did not think it would be helpful for them to approach thethe Persian Persians in the role of mediators in the dispute, but that we hopedGovernment. that they would find means of impressing upon the Persians the justice of our case. The ruling of the Court has now provided a clear oppor-tunity for United States action on these lines, and the UnitedStates Government were considering the despatch of a special envoyto Tehran, hot as a mediator, but to persuade the Persian Govern-ment to accept the Courfs ruling and take action in line with itsrecommendation.The Cabinet agreed that an approach by the United States tothe Persian Government on these lines would be acceptable. If it weremade without delay it might avert a Persian refusal to accept the ruling of the Court.Economic The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that exports of steel railsAction. to Persia were being delayed at present by administrative action, butthe manufacturers had asked whether they should delay still furtherat the risk of breaking their contract. He proposed to defer giving them a definite reply until the situation became clearer, and in particu-lar until the Persians had responded to the ruling of the international court.There was also some danger that the Persian Government might attempt to convert into dollars part of the currency reserve whichthey held in sterling. The Majlis would have to pass enabling legisla-tion before this could be done. If, however, such legislation were passed, he Was inclined to think that we should be justified in suspend-ing our Memorandum of Understanding with the Persians, andremoving them from the Transferable Account, which would prevent them from converting any sterling into dollars without our specificauthorisation. A Persian refusal to accept the ruling of the Inter-national Court would provide us with adequate justification for suchaction.The Cabinet-(3) Endorsed the proposals made by the Chancellor of theExchequer on exports to Persia and the Persian currencyreserve.Germany.Terminationof State ofWar.(previous reference:CM. (50) 63rdConclusions,Minute 3.)3. The Foreign Secretary recalled that on 9th October, 1950,the Cabinet had approved a memorandum (CP. (50) 222) submittedby his predecessor on the results of the discussions with the UnitedStates and French Governments on future relations with Germany.One of the conclusions reached in those discussions was that, as soonas constitutional procedures allowed, the state of war between theAllies and Germany should be formally ended. The Foreign secretary said that, in accordance with that decision, he proposed to announce that afternoon in the House of Commons that the state of war between this country and Germany would be terminated forthwith. Similarannouncements were to be made simultaneously in a number of commonwealth countries and other countries which were our allies in the war with Germany.&apos; In discussion the Cabinet were assured that this formal step wouldnot of itself invalidate any of the war legislation enacted by the UnitedKingdom Parliament which had been expressed as remaining in force
until His Majesty declared by Order-in-Council that the emergencywhich had occasioned its introduction was at an end. It was, however,recognised that, in any further discussion about the duration of this legislation, the ending of the state of war with Germany would be advanced as a reason why such Orders-in-Council should now bemade.. The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s intention to declare thatthe state of war between this country and Germany had now been terminated.Germany. 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the ForeignOwnership      Secretary (CP. (51) 165) reporting the developments which had taken of Basic        place, since their discussion on 22nd March, in connection with theIndustries.      proposal to allow the transfer to private owners of shares in one of the(Previous        new German steel companies formed under the Allied High Commis-Reference:      sion Law No. 27.   When this matter came before the Allied HighCM.

When he failed to persuade his colleagues on the High Com-mission, representations were made to the United States and french governments in the terms of the note annexed to CP. (51) 165. both these Governments had, however, rejected the arguments in this note;and effect would now have to be given to the majority decision ofthe Allied High Commission. It was, however, recommended that weshould let it be known in Germany that we had been in favour ofmaintaining the system of trusteeship until the Federal Parliament hadtaken a decision on the general principle of public ownership of these. industries. .The Cabinet (1) Took note of the developments reported in CP. (51) 165.The Cabinet next considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (C.P. (51) 186) on the question whether certain German coalcompanies should be excluded from the reorganisation of the german coal industry under High Commission Law No. 27. These companies were unwilling to be included in the reorganisation; and the federal government of Germany, on being consulted, had taken the view thatthey should not be included in the reorganisation against their wishes.This view was supported by the United States and French authorities.As against it, it could be argued that the exclusion of these companies would seriously reduce the scope of the reorganisation; that thescheme of reorganisation, including these companies, had been drawnup by a body of German experts who had urged that their plan shouldbe accepted in its entirety; and that the German trade unions had always desired a comprehensive reorganisation of the industry. TheForeign Secretary discussed in his memorandum whether these argu-ments should be pressed against the opposition of the United Statesand French authorities. After reviewing the alternatives, he recom-mended that the United Kingdom Commissioner should put beforethe Allied High Commission&quot; the arguments in favour of includingthese companies in the reorganisation but should in the end accept amajority decision in the opposite sense provided (i) that he insisted that the views of the United Kingdom Government should be placedon record and (ii) that he reserved the right of the United KingdomGovernment to indicate their disagreement with this decision if itshould be criticised in Germany or elsewhere.
Coal.Man-power for the mines.(previous reference:CM. (51) 11thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (51) 189) proposing a number of measures designed to increase the labour force in the coal-mining industry, anda memorandum by the Minister of Defence (CP. (51) 194) objectingto certain of these proposals, which were designed to divert man-power from the Armed Forces into the mines.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, in view of the increas-ing consumption of coal, particularly by industry, special measuresmust be taken to secure a high output of coal from the mines next winter. He believed that the miners&apos; pension scheme would stimulatemorale in the industry, and the new appointments to the National coal board had been well received by the miners. Everything practicablewould be done to get further machinery for the pits. The decisivefactor would, however, be the size of the labour force. Steps wouldbe taken to increase recruitment from Ireland and from Italy. there remained the Armed Forces. The measures already taken to get menback from the Forces had resulted in 2,800 applications: of these2,600 had been approved, and 1,200 men were already back in the mines. He proposed that these measures should be continued for aconsiderable period, and that the scheme should be extended so as toapply to ex-miners who had volunteered for the Forces within the last three years (instead of two years) and to men who had worked forthree months (instead of six months) in the mines. He was alsoanxious to exclude from call-up for annual training miners who wereTerritorials or reservists.The Minister of Defence said that the measures already adoptedrepresented substantial concessions by the Service Departments. Hewas ready to agree that the existing scheme should continue in opera-tion for another two months; but he was not willing that it should beextended as the Minister of Fuel and Power proposed. A man whohad served in the mines for three months before joining the forces could not be said to be a trained miner. An ex-miner who had served in the Forces for three years would, in the ordinary way, have risen to non-commissioned rank and his removal would be a serious loss tothe Services. Recruitment to the Army and Royal Air Force had fallen substantially in the last few months, and the present defence commitments made it out of the question to consider any furtherweakening of the Forces. As regards miners who were members ofthe Territorial Army, it was clear that any attempt to deprive them ofthe annual camp would meet with much opposition, parfcularly in areas, such as Durham, where many of the Territorials were miners.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The exclusion, of these companies from the scheme of reorganisation would make it much less likely that the German coalindustry would be nationalised. The Cabinet accepted with regret a development which would at least postpone the application of theprinciple of public ownership to the German coal industry.(o) Some Ministers feared that this development might eventual-ally place excessive power in the hands of unscrupulous Germanindustrialists, who might use it to the disadvantage of the UnitedKingdom coal industry, as they had done during the industrial depres-sion before the last war. As against this it was argued that the exclusion of these companies would reduce, rather than increase, therisk that the whole of the German coal industry might pass under thecontrol of a private cartel.(c) The best safeguard against unfair competition by the german coal industry in the future lay in effective working arrangements withthe high authority under the Schuman Treaty.The Cabinet-(2) Approved the proposals in paragraph 9 of CP. (51) 186.
The Minister of Labour said that, as it was unlikely that Parlia-ment would agree to any increase in the sums available to the central office of Information for Government publicity, any Government con-tribution towards the cost of the  50,000 publicity campaign onrecruitment for the mines would have to be found by a curtailment ofother schemes. There was no difficulty about getting Italian labour:the difficulty lay in having them accepted by the miners&apos; lodges. he agreed with the Minister of Defence that it would be unreasonable toextend the qualifying conditions in the scheme for the release of ex-miners from the Forces. As regards miners who were members ofthe Territorial Army, it had to be borne in mind that the Governmenthad some time ago urged the Boards of nationalised industries toassist in recruiting, and it would be difficult at this stage to appearto go back on that. Steps were already taken to ensure that minerswho left the industry for other employment were called up for nationalservice within a very short period. He hoped that further measures would prove to be practicable for recruiting men for the mines fromthe Irish. Republic. He doubted whether enough was being done toup-grade miners to the coal-face. Substantial numbers of young menwere leaving the mining industry each year, and this was in part dueto disappointment at not receiving sufficiently soon the higher rates of pay earned at the coal-face.In discussion the following points were made: -(a) Some disappointment was expressed that the substantialcapital investment in the mining industry since nationalisation had notyielded a higher return. In reply, it was pointed out that the invest-ment had not yet been on a very large scale but that it had yielded amarked increase in output per man shift.(b) The National Coal Board were trying to increase the propor-tion of face-workers to other workers, but the provision of additionalface-room was a slow process and it was not easy to secure theremoval of various restrictive practices.(c) It was sometimes suggested that greater mechanisation, by increasing earning power, led to higher voluntary absenteeism.Voluntary absenteeism was, however, lower than it had previously been, taking the country as a whole, and did not amount on the aver-age to more than one day per month per man. At the same timeefforts were being made to reduce the extent of voluntary absenteeism,and special steps would be taken in areas, such as Yorkshire, where itwas relatively high.(d) If ex-miners in other industries, aged about 40 to 45, could be induced to return to the mining industry they would provide a valuableelement. It might be desirable to take special steps to draw the atten-tion of these men to the advantages which would accrue to them fromthe supplementary pensions scheme.(e) The Home Information Services Committee should considerwhether a Government contribution to a publicity campaign to stimu-late recruitment to the mining industry could be made at the expenseof other information services.The Cabinet-Gave general approval to the measures proposed in para-graph 23 of CP. (51) 189, subject to the qualification that theexisting arrangements for accelerating the return to the pitsof ex-miners in the Armed Forces should continue for twomonths but should not be extended in the manner proposedin sub-paragraphs (e) and (/) of paragraph 23.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,9th July, 1951.
