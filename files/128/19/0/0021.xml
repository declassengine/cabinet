ParMameat 1.   The Cabinet were informed that the Speaker was indisposedMr. Speaker. and was unlikely to be able to resume his Parliamentary duties until after the Easter Recess. The leader of the Conservative opposition had been informed, and an announcement would be made at theopening of business in the House of Commons that afternoon.Negative The Home Secretary said that the Leader of the ConservativeResolutions Opposition had now lent the weight of his authority to the tacticson Statutory recently followed by his back-bench supporters in raising frequentInstruments. debates on Prayers against subordinate legislation. It was clear thatthis was a Parliamentary manoeuvre designed to exhaust the Govern-ment and their supporters by forcing the House of Commons to sit late on three or four nights each week. The Parliamentary Labour Partyclearly expected the Government to take a firm stand against this.He therefore proposed that, as soon as the first Prayer that evening hadbeen moved and seconded, he should rise to move the adjournment of the debate and should take the opportunity of making a general statement exposing the tactics of the Conservative Opposition. Thiswould have the effect of terminating the discussion of that particularPrayer, It would also show that the Government were in a positionto defeat these tactics; for on any night, after 10 p.m., they couldbetween any two Orders of the Day move that the House be adjournedwithout further debate on Prayers. The Home Secretary said that,by showing determination to defeat the present manoeuvre, he hoped to bring the Opposition Leaders into consultation on means ofregularising the procedure for debating Prayers against subordinate legislation. He was himself inclined to favour the solution of settingaside one night a week for such debates.In discussion some Ministers doubted the expediency of adopting,without advance notice, the device which the Home secretary proposed to use to terminate debate on a particular Prayer. In thelegislation which they had introduced in the last Parliament theGovernment had made very extensive use of powers to legislate byOrders-in-Council; and in justifying this form of legislation they had stressed the rights of Parliament to challenge such Orders by negative resolution. The Government were therefore under a special obligationto avoid any appearance of limiting the rights of Parliament to challenge subordinate legislation. From this point of view it mightbe preferable that the Government should content themselves thatevenings with provoking a general discussion of the procedure fordebating these Prayers, and that any threat to curtail opportunities forsuch debate should be reserved until it was known whether theConservative Opposition were willing to enter into discussions with aview to reaching a general understanding on the question of pro-cedure.Other Ministers attached less importance to these considerations.They were impressed by the restiveness of Government supporters atthe frequent late sittings of the House of Commons; and they preferred that the Government should take the firmer stand which the HomeSecretary had proposed.The Cabinet finally agreed to leave it to the Home Secretary&apos;sdiscretion to decide, according to the temper of the House at the time,whether it would be expedient to allow the debate on the Prayer tobe resumed after the statement which he was proposing to make on thegeneral question of procedure.The President of the Board of Trade suggested that he might help to defeat the tactics of the Parliamentary Opposition by suspending allcurrent negotiations on maximum price orders. He had&apos; reason tobelieve that, if this were done, the trade associations concerned would urge the Conservative Central Office to modify their Parliamentarytactics. The Cabinet authorised the President of the Board of Tradeto take the course which he suggested.Business in The Home Secretary said that he was not yet in a position tothe House of inform the Cabinet of the business to be taken in the House ofCommons.       Commons in the week following the Easter Recess. This would have40450 b 2
Reserve andAuxiliaryForces(Training)Bill.(previous reference:CM. (51) 20thConclusions,Minute 1.)to be announced before the Cabinefs meeting on 22nd March; andhe therefore proposed to settle the terms of his announcement in eon-sultation with the Prime Minister and the Chief Whip.In the Committee Stage of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces(Training) Bill in the House of Lords the Conservative Opposition had indicated that they would not press the two amendments which theCabinet had discussed on 15th March, if the Government were pre-pared to add, during the Report Stage, a clause empowering them toextend to members of the Territorial and Auxiliary Forces, by Order-in-Council, the statutory protection against loss of employment orholidays which was conferred on Class Z reservists by the terms of theBill itself. This compromise had been suggested because there seemedto be some doubt whether the Territorial Associations were, or werenot, in favour of having this statutory protection applied to theTerritorial Army, and the passage of the Bill could not be delayed until this doubt had been cleared up. The Minister of Defence saidthat he was prepared to agree that power should be taken to extend this provision of the Bill by Order-in-Council to members of theTerritorial and Auxiliary Forces. The Cabinet agreed that the bill might be amended accordingly on the Report Stage in the House ofLords.Farm price review.(previous reference:CM. (50) 9thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Chancellorof the Exchequer (C.P. (51) 80) inviting them to decide whether theGovernments final offer to the farmers in the annual review underPart I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, should be  25 million or 30 million in respect of increased prices of food products.The Minister of Agriculture said that, in view of the increased costs with which the farmers were faced, there was no prospect of avoiding a break with them unless a final offer of  30 million couldbe made. The expansion programme would be jeopardised if therewas a serious dispute with the farmers in connection with the annual review. The farmers had already met  34 million of increased costs and, if the proposals put forward by the Secretary of State forScotland and himself were accepted, they would have to meet afurther  20 million. If the situation were examined commodity bycommodity, the farmers&apos; position was even more disadvantageous.The Minister of Food said that in his view the disadvantages of a break with the farmers on the annual review could be over-estimated.He considered that the Government should not go beyond  25 million.Any increase beyond that amount would have to be met by increases in retail prices. There was not at present sufficient discrimination inprofitability between different forms of farming, and too much wasbeing given for milk production at a time when a diversion to meat and pig production was desirable.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was agreed thatsome amount between  4^ million and  9f million should be concededto the farmers, by an increase in the price paid to them for wool; butthis, of course, only benefited certain farmers and was in a sense an advance payment of sums which would be paid from the special fundat a later date. The issue before the Cabinet was what final offer couldbe made on food prices. On merits he thought that the Minister ofFood was right, but if it came to a break he would prefer to be ableto justify the Governments case by reference to an offer of  30 millionrather than one of  25 million.In further discussion attention was drawn to the substantial increase in agricultural production which had been achieved in thelast few years. The view was expressed that it would be foolish to jeopardise further progress with the agricultural expansion programme by a serious dispute with the farmers.  Some Ministers felt, however,
Retail food prices.(previous reference:CM. (50) 15thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Food (CP. (51) 79)proposing various increases in the retail prices of subsidised food-stuffs.The Minister of Food said that, in the coming financial year,imported and home-produced food would cost substantially morethan at present. On the basis of a subsidy ceiling of  410 million in1951-52, it would be necessary to secure savings amounting to 107-6 million by means of increases in retail prices. There were many different ways in which these increases could be distributed among the various subsidised foodstuffs. He and the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer had arrived at the proposals in the Appendix to CP.(51) 79 after careful examination of the problem by their officials.The Chancellor wished the retail price of milk to be raised by a penny a quart during the eight-month period of the year when therewas no problem of surplus milk supplies, but he himself was doubtful about this proposal since an increase in milk prices might diminish the consumption of milk by those sections of the population whichwere most in need of it. The decision which the Cabinet had justtaken in connection with the farm price review would mean that increases in retail prices totalling  5 million would have to be madein addition to those contained in CP. (51) 79.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The proposals in CP. (51) 79 had been based on the viewthat moderate increases in the prices of a number of foodstuffs werepreferable to. a few large increases. Regard had also been paid tothe amount of the weekly ration of each commodity, and an endeavourhad been made to avoid any large increase in the amount expendedper head on each commodity.(b) The public would probably be prepared to accept a more substantial increase in the prices of meat, particularly home-killedmeat and chilled beef, if larger supplies became available as a resultof the current negotiations with the Argentine Government. Itwould, therefore, be preferable to make a greater increase in the priceof meat than was proposed in CP. (51) 79, and thereby to avoid thesecond increase in the price of tea proposed for September next. Alarge increase in the price of tea would bear very hardly on those inthe lower income groups and on old people.that the increase in agricultural production had not been commen-commensurate with the substantial rise in profits which farmers had secured,that farmers could afford to bear a higher proportion of the increased costs than was proposed by the Agriculture Ministers, and that it didnot follow that lower profits to the farmer meant smaller production,since farmers might engage in more intensive cultivation to maintain their total earnings.The Lord Privy Seal said that in his view the farmers had been paid too much in recent years. The increase in agriculture production had not been as great as the country might reasonably have expected and would not prevent a serious risk of widespread starvation in thiscountry in the opening months of any war. He would regret anyoffer going beyond what was proposed by the Minister of Food.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should be prepared to offerincreases in wool prices, totalling between million and 9f million, and in the last resort to offer  30 million (afterdeduction of  10 million in respect of capital provision) inrespect of food prices, if this were necessary to secure agree-ment with the farmers in the annual price review.
(c) Doubt was expressed whether some increase in the price of milk during eight months of the year would in fact lead to a seriousreduction in milk consumption. Milk accounted for one-quarter ofthe total food subsidies, and this high proportion should be reduced.(d) As proposed in CP. (51) 79, the increases should be announced at different dates, rather than in one comprehensive state-ment in connection with the Budget.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposal in CP.. (51) 79 to secure savingsamounting to  107 6 million by increases in the retail prices of subsidised foodstuffs, together with any further savings required to meet payments to farmers in excess of 25 million in connection with the current farm price review.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister ofFood, in the light of the Cabinefs discussion, to review the distribution of these price increases over the varioussubsidised foodstuffs and, in particular, to considerwhether there should not be a greater increase in the priceof meat instead of a second increase of Ad. in the priceof tea.(3) Agreed that the retail price of milk should be raised by a penny a quart during the eight months of the year when there was no surplus milk.Post Office 4.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Postmaster-Charges. General (CP. (51) 71) proposing increases in postal rates, poundagefor inland money orders, telephone rentals, call-office charges and telegraph rates.The Postmaster-General said that there were three courses opento the Cabinet. If charges were left at their present level, and the arbitration tribunal gave the expected award of increased wages topostal workers, back-dated to 1st April, 1951, it would be necessaryto submit a supplementary estimate for about  8 million. Alter-natively, it might be decided to go no further at this stage than toincrease telephone rentals and call-office charges. Finally, there werethe proposals put forward in his memorandum, all of which on presentshowing would be required within the next two years.In discussion, there was general agreement that, as proposed inparagraph 11 of his memorandum, the Postmaster-General should submit to the Lord Presidents Committee proposals for securing thattelephone rentals could in future be altered without revising individualagreements. As regards the increases in telephone and other charges which the Postmaster-General proposed, attention was drawn to thedifficulties which might arise if proposals were submitted to Parlia-ment which were not related to current trading but to expectedincreases in wages. At the same time the Chancellor of the Exchequer,in framing his Budget, had been expecting a yield of  10 million from these increases and must have a sure estimate of Post Officerevenue in the forthcoming financial year.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Postmaster-General to submit to the lord presidents Committee proposals for revising the procedurerelating to the fixing and altering of telephone rentals.(2) Invited the Postmaster-General to discuss further with theChancellor of the Exchequer the alterations in Post Officecharges which should be made at the present time and tosubmit revised proposals to the Cabinet.
Festivalof Britain. ;(previous reference:CM. (50) 72ndConclusions,Minute 1.)FestivalGardens.Receipts andExpenditureof the british transport commission.(previous reference:CM. (51) 20thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 84) reporting that the company entrusted withthe task of preparing and managing the Festival Gardens and Amuse-ment Park had exhausted their cash resources and required a furtherloan of  1 million to complete their work.The Foreign Secretary said that on 6th March, on the basis ofinformation furnished by the company, he had announced to Parlia-meht that the total expenditure on the Gardens was likely to be about 1,625,000. With an expected revenue of  1,053,000 on six months&apos;operation, this would result in a loss of  572,000. On 8th march the Chairman of the company had informed the Public accounts committee that the total expenditure would be substantially larger;and it now appeared that the total cost was likely to be  2,458,000.The loss might therefore be as much as  1^- million. The increased cost of these works was due mainly to exceptionally bad weather,recourse to uneconomic methods in order to overtake arrears, loss oftime from labour troubles, and additional costs incurred in the hopeof avoiding further labour troubles. Revenue would also fall belowthe original estimate by reason of Parliaments decision that theAmusement Park should not be opened on Sundays. The foreign secretary said that, despite these explanations, he was not satisfied with the situation; and he thought that the Board of the company should be strengthened by the addition of a new Director with special qualifications for dealing with the financial side of the company&apos;work. In the long run the only way of reducing the loss on theGardens would be to keep them open for a substantial period afterthe end of the Festival; and he himself hoped that the London CountyCouncil would succeed in due course in obtaining permission tokeep the Gardens open under their management for at least five yearsand perhaps permanently.The Cabinet shared the Foreign Secretary&apos;s disquiet at thesituation disclosed in CP. (51) 84. They invited the Minister ofWorks (to whom the Foreign Secretary was. about to transfer hisMinisterial responsibilities in connexion with the Festival of Britain)to review the organisation of the Festival Gardens company. TheMinister of Works said that, if further appointments were to be madeto the Board of the company, he would not himself be in favour of adding a financial expert: he would prefer to add someone withpractical knowledge of organising Amusement Parks.The Cabinet -(1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to make an early statement in the House of Commons about the estimated cost of the festival Gardens, and to announce the governments intention to introduce legislation providing for a furtherExchequer loan of  1 million to the Festival Gardenscompany.(2) Agreed that, pending the passage of that legislation, theChancellor of the Exchequer should make an advance to the company from the Civil Contingencies Fund.(3) Invited the Minister of Works to review the organisation ofthe Festival Gardens company.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Transport (CP. (51) 85) covering the draft of a statement whichhe wished to make in the House of Commons before the Easter Recessannouncing an immediate increase of 10 per cent, in railway freight charges and foreshadowing some increase in passenger fares.The Minister of Transport said that, since the Cabinefs discussion on 15th March, he had ascertained that the permanent members ofthe Transport Tribunal would probably be willing to advise him,without a public hearing, on his proposal to authorise a 10 per cent,increase in freight charges. They were, however, likely to suppor tsuch an increase only on the assumption that the British transport commission would be proceeding with their plan for submitting to the
Tribunal comprehensive schemes for both freight charges and passen-ger fares. As regards passenger traffic, he had consulted both theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Chairman of the transport commission; and he believed that, if the Commission were relieved of the cost of the special fare concessions to members of the Services,they would be able to drop three of their original proposals forincreased passenger fares in the London area which would have given rise to the greatest political difficulties, viz., the proposed increases in early morning fares, Green Line coach fares and suburban season tickets. He had, however, been unable to find any sufficient reasonfor seeking to prevent the Commission from -putting before theTribunal the remainder of their proposals for increasing passenger fares.The Chancellor of the Exchequer supported the views expressedby the Minister of Transport.In discussion the following points were&apos;made:  (a) The Minister of Defence asked that no decision should betaken on the fare concessions to members of the Services until thedetails had been discussed with the Service Departments. In replyit was pointed out that at this stage the Cabinet were only asked toagree in principle that the cost of any such concessions should betransferred from the Transport Commission to the Exchequer. Thedetails (and, in particular, any question of reducing the scale of theexisting concessions) were reserved for discussion between theTreasury, the Ministry of Transport and the Service Departments.(b) Some Ministers were reluctant to contemplate any increasein passenger fares, and suggested that decisions might be postponed until the Cabinet had been able to consider the report which theMinister of Transport was to make on the long-term financial prospects of the Transport Commission. On the other side, it was urged that the Transport Commission should not be required to goon accumulating, in the meantime, a deficit, on current operations and ought to be allowed to make some immediate increase in charges to compensate for increased costs, especially those arising from therecent wages award. And, as had been stated, the permanent mem-bers of the Transport Tribunal were not likely to report in favourof the 10 per cent, increase of freight charges unless they knew thatcomprehensive charges schemes were to be put before them by theTransport Commission.(c) The final paragraph of the draft annexed to CP. (51) 85 was likely to give the impression that further substantial increases wouldbe made in railway charges, both for freights and passengers.Politically, it was disadvantageous to give such an impression longin advance of the final findings of the Transport Tribunal. TheCabinet agreed that, for the last four sentences of the draft, thereshould be substituted a single sentence stating in general terms thatthe Transport Commission were preparing, for submission to theTransport Tribunal, draft schemes covering passenger fares and freight charges generally.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Minister of Transport to make a statement in the House of Commons before the Easter Recess on thegeneral lines of the draft annexed to CP. (51) 85; and invited him to settle, in consultation with the PrimeMinister and the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the termsof an amended final paragraph on the lines indicated inparagraph (c) above.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport to make a further reviewof the long-term financial prospects of the british transport Commission and to submit the results of thatreview for consideration by the Cabinet.Cabinet Office, S.WA,\9th March, 1951.
