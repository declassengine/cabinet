Mr. Ernest 1.   The Foreign Secretary said, that the members of the CabinetBevin. must have been shocked and distressed at the news of Mr. Bevin&apos;sdeath on 14th April. Mr. Bevin had played a great part in the workof the Labour Government; and his Cabinet colleagues would feelvery keenly the loss of his loyal support and his wise counsel. his death was a grievous loss to the Labour Party and the trade union movement and, indeed, to the country as a whole. He would be widely mourned by all sections of the community.The Cabinet asked that an expression of their sympathy shouldbe sent to Mrs. Bevin.Integration ofFrench andGerman coal and steel industries.(previous reference:CM. (51) 22ndConclusions,Minute 4.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 108) inviting them to agree in principle that theInternational Authority for the Ruhr, the Combined Coal and SteelGroups, and the existing limitations on German steel production and capacity should be discontinued as soon as practicable after the schuman Plan came into operation.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that the Departments directly concerned were not seeking theretention of the International Authority for the Ruhr, or of the coal and Steel Groups. The limitations on German steel capacity and production raised more difficult questions; but, as had been indicatedin an earlier memorandum (CP. (51) 89), the United States Govern-ment were anxious to take an early opportunity of revising theexisting agreements. An increase in German steel capacity and pro-duction would mean that less scrap would be available for export to the United Kingdom; but the British Iron and Steel corporation were already doubtful whether, quite apart from the Schuman Plan,the scrap which they required could be obtained from Germany, andthey were envisaging the need to import semi-finished steel fromGermany instead. The United Kingdom High Commissioner inGermany was in agreement with the recommendations which were now being put forward.In discussion it was pointed out that at one time it had been assumed that agreement on the Schuman Plan would not be reachedwithout great difficulty; but, now that the Treaty was on the point ofbeing signed, it would be undesirable for this country to leave theother two Occupying Powers with all the credit for willingness toallow the new arrangements to work. There was reason to believethat, as soon as the Schuman Treaty was signed, the French Govern-ment would inform the German Government, and possibly make apublic disclosure, of the lengths to which they were prepared to go inrelaxing Allied control over German heavy industry after the schuman Plan came into operation. The United Kingdom Govern-ment should indicate to the German Federal Government that theytoo were prepared to facilitate the operation of the Schuman Plan.Allied control of German heavy industry had been designed to safe-guard the military security of Western Europe, not the commercial interests of British industry. It was not proposed to abrogate allied high Commission Law 27, which would leave the High commission with power to supervise the reorganisation of the German coal andsteel industries.On the other side, doubts were expressed about the wisdom of removing Allied control over German heavy industry at a time whenthe German Federal Government were deriving unjustifiableadvantages from the operation of the European Payments Union andfailing to fulfil their promises to provide scrap steel. As regards theEuropean Payments Union, it was explained that the Organisation for european Economic Co-operation were insisting on close control ofGerman import licences and would be holding a further review of the40611-1 B 2
balance between German imports and exports at the end of thepresent month. As regards scrap steel, the Federal Governmentwere limiting by decree the amount of scrap which could be sent outof the country; but here also there might be means other thandelaying the execution of the Schuman Plan by which the UnitedKingdom steel industry could be assured of the supply of Germanscrap or semi-finished steel.Concern was also expressed at the risks involved in relaxingAllied control before it was known precisely how the Schuman treaty organisation would operate and what implications it would have forthe future of the United Kingdom coal and steel industries. the schuman Plan might give to German industrialists extensive controlover the coal and steel resources of Western Europe, and they mightuse their powers ruthlessly at the expense of this country, as they had done in the years before the war. It would be no contribution to thedefence of Western Europe if the vulnerable heavy industries in the ruhr were expanded at the expense of the iron and steel industry inthis country.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the United KingdomGovernment should indicate their willingness to enter sympatheticallyinto discussions between the three Occupying Powers and the benelux countries about the conflict of jurisdiction between the schuman treaty organisation and the Allied controls over Germany&apos;s heavyindustry. They should not, however, declare at this stage that theywere willing in principle that the existing Allied controls should be discontinued as soon as the Schuman Plan came into operation.There was no urgency in reaching such a decision since the schuman plan could not come into operation until the Treaty had been ratified by the Parliaments of the countries concerned. United kingdom policy in this matter could not be finally formulated until the full implications of the Schuman Plan on our own industries had been studied in detail.The Cabinet-(1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to announce that theUnited Kingdom Government would be willing to partici-pate in the international discussions proposed by theFrench Government regarding the conflict between the schuman Treaty and the Allied controls over Germany&apos;sheavy industry.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to do his utmost to persuade the French Government to limit any public statement, orany statement to the German Federal Government, to asimilar promise to enter into discussions on this question,and to refrain from indicating at this stage their readiness to abandon these Allied controls as soon as the schuman treaty came into operation.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to arrange for thecommittee of officials which had considered the schuman plan at an earlier stage to prepare, for the Cabinefsconsideration, a report on the implications of the Plan asfinally agreed on the future of the United Kingdom coal and steel industries.3. The Foreign Secretary said that the Cabinet would have seen from the Press that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had been com-pelled to close their refinery at Abadan, as the majority of their employees had been prevented, by picketing and intimidation, fromreporting for work. The latest reports suggested, however, that thelocal situation might be improving. Persian troops had been ableto break up hostile crowds and seemed to be making an effort tocontrol the situation.
Armed Forces. 4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theBalance of Chancellor of the Exchequer (CP. (51) 107) covering a report by civil Pay. officials on the question whether civil servants who were called up as(Previous reservists during the current summer should receive the differenceReference:between their civil and military pay.CM. (51) 24th The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, pending any general conclusions, decision to change the existing practice, it would be generally agreedMinute 5.) that those civil servants who were to be called up for three months or for eighteen months should receive the balance of their civil pay.The only question which was open to argument was the treatment tobe accorded to Z reservists in the Civil Service who were called upfor a period of only fifteen days. There would be great admini-strative inconvenience in paying balance of civil pay for so short aperiod; and the proposal in the memorandum annexed to CP. (51) 107was that these men should be given special leave with pay for a partof the period of their absence on military duty. They would receive,in addition, their military pay and the tax-free bounty of  4. Thiswould put the Z reservist in a position half-way between the NationalServiceman and the Territorial. This seemed to be a reasonable solution, and he commended it for the Cabinefs approval.The Minister of Defence said that he supported the proposals putforward in CP. (51) 107.The Cabinet agreed that similar arrangements would have to bemade for other public servants, such as persons employed in theNational Health Service. They were informed that for this purposefresh legislation would be needed.The Cabinet (1) Approved the proposals put forward in CP. (51) 107 regardingthe supplementing of the military pay of public servantscalled up as reservists.(2) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of thequestion whether public servants should receive thebalance of civil pay in any future war.Stone ofScone.(previous reference:CM. (51) 27thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet were informed that the police had now identifiedthe persons responsible for removing the Stone of Scone from West-minster Abbey, but the Attorney-General was disinclined to institutecriminal proceedings against them. He was due to answer that after-noon a Parliamentary Question asking whether proceedings wereto be taken.In a short discussion reference was made to various points of criticism which might be made if it became known that the authorities were aware of the identity of those responsible for this act but werenot proposing to take any proceedings against them. It was agreedthat these considerations should be made known to the Attorney-General before he reached his final decision in this matter. Mean-while the Attorney-General could return a temporising answer to theQuestion which was being put to him in the House of Commons that afternoon.The Cabinet-Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange a meeting at whichthe Ministers directly concerned could indicate to the attorney-General the considerations which they would wishhim to have in mind in deciding whether or not to institutecriminal proceedings against those responsible for removing the Stone of Scone from Westminster Abbey.
6. The Minister of Defence said that it was now clear that itwould be impossible to resolve before 19th April the difficulties whichhad arisen with the United States military authorities over theMediterranean Command. Moreover, the Americans were nowshowing reluctance to authorise the official announcement of AdmiralFechteler&apos;s appointment as Supreme Commander, Atlantic, until after19th April. In these circumstances it would not be possible to presenta satisfactory White Paper for the purposes of the proposed debate on that date; and it would not be easy to make an effective reply tothe debate without increasing our difficulties with the United states military authorities. The Minister therefore proposed that a further attempt should now be made to secure the postponement of the debate.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary, together with the HomeSecretary and the Minister of Defence, to explain to theleaders of the Conservative Opposition the situation whichhad been reached in the discussions with the United states military authorities and to urge them to agree to the post-ponement of the proposed debate on the North atlantic treaty command structure.Cabinet Office, S.WA,16th April, 1951.North atlantic treaty.command organisation.(previous reference:CM.
