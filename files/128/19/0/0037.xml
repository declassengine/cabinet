Parliament. 1.   The Prime Minister said that it had been suggested to himHouse of Lords that the House of Commons might be given some opportunity ofChamber.Memorial toField-marshal smuts.expressing their satisfaction that the House of Lords were now ableto resume their occupation of their old Chamber in the Palace of westminster. He himself thought it unnecessary that the commons should pass any formal resolution on this subject, and that it would suffice if Mr. Speaker made an appropriate statement from the Chairwhen Parliament reassembled on the following day.The Cabinet endorsed the Prime Ministers view and invited himto communicate with Mr. Speaker accordingly.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the PrimeMinister (CP, (51) 142) suggesting that a statue of Field-marshal smuts should be erected at Government expense on some suitablesite in Westminster.The Prime Minister said that Field-Marshal Smuts had been an outstanding figure among Commonwealth statesmen, and had beena member of the Imperial War Cabinet in the first world war. Hehad held a unique position in the Commonwealth; and there was no real danger that, if a statue were erected in his memory in London,other Commonwealth countries would feel that the same should bedone for some of their former Prime Ministers. The Secretary ofState for Commonwealth Relations said that he shared this view. Hewould, however, like to be able to inform the Prime Minister of SouthAfrica before any public announcement was made.On points of detail the Prime Minister said that, since circulatinghis memorandum, he had held further conversations with the Ministerof Works and did not wish to ask the Cabinet to decide at this stage that the statue should be erected in Parliament Square. There werealternative sites which should be considered. On the choice of thesculptor, and possibly also on the choice of a site, representatives ofthe other political parties should be brought into consultation.The Cabinet (1) Agreed in principle that a statue, of Field-Marshal Smutsshould be erected at Government expense on a suitablesite in Westminster..(2) Authorised the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations to arrange for the Prime Minister of SouthAfrica to be informed of this decision.(3) Took note that the Prime Minister would take an early opportunity of announcing this decision in the House ofCommons; and invited him to arrange for representativesof the other political parties to be brought into consulta-tion regarding the choice of the sculptor and other details.Persia..   v 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador(Previous.       at Teheran had delivered on 19th May the note to the Persian Govern-Reference:      ment which the Cabinet had considered on 10th May.  No reply had. (5.1) 35th  yet been received from the Persian Government.    Meanwhile,Conclusions,    however, the group of Ministers which had been watching develop-Minute 7.) &apos;     ments in the Persian situation on the Cabinets behalf had approvedhis proposal that an appplication be made to the International court for a ruling that the Persian Government were under an obligation tosubmit the dispute to arbitration. The application had been lodged,with the Court, and the Persian Government had been informed.Before it was known that the United. Kingdom Government were making an application to the International Court, His Majesty&apos;ambassador at Teheran had held a private conversation with thePersian Prime Minister.    In the course of this  conversation40675-2 * b 2
Dr. Mussadia had indicated that any dispute between the company and the Persian Government should be settled by some tribunal, buthe had declined to specify what tribunal he had in mind. He had gone on to say that he did not wish the United Kingdom Governmentto intervene in the matter, because this might lead ultimately to a reference to the United Nations, which might prejudice Anglo-Persianrelations-.The Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had agreed that their seniorrepresentative in Persia should attend a meeting of the Persian OilCommission which was to discuss the execution of the nationalisationlaw; but they had made it clear that he would not be in a position tonegotiate, and would merely listen to what w/as said and report itssubstance to the Company.The United States Government were pressing the UnitedKingdom Government to declare publicly their willingness to accept in principle the nationalisation of Persia&apos;s oil supplies. They were alsourging us to send representatives who could negotiate with the persian oil Commission. They were doubtful about the expediency of ourapproaching the Shah with a view to securing a change of Govern-ment in Persia: they hoped that we would do this only in the last resort, since it would involve asking the Shah to set himself against his prime Minister, the Majlis and public opinion in Persia.The Foreign Secretary said that the situation.in Teheran was extremely fluid and it was impossible to forecast how it would develop.He was therefore in favour of waiting for two or three days to seethe effect in Teheran of the reference to the International Court andthe Company&apos;s offer to send their representative to meet the persian oil Commission. Meanwhile, however, His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador inTeheran might be instructed to let it be known that the Company&apos;representative would in fact be prepared to negotiate if any common ground emerged from the Commission^ statements. It would also benecessary for him to make some statement in the House of commons during the next day or so; and it might be advisable that he shouldtake that opportunity of stating publicly that the United KingdomGovernment were prepared to negotiate a settlement which, provided it were satisfactory in other respects (a qualification to which they attached importance), involved some form of nationalisation.The following were the main points raised in the cabinets discussion of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement:  (a) Was it sufficient that the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company shouldbe represented, in the discussions with the Persian Oil Commission,by their local representative? Would it not be better that theCompany should send out a more senior representative from London?It was pointed out that, in the first instance, at any rate, the Com-pany&apos;s representative was to do no more than listen to what was said and report to London. This was a function which the localrepresentative could properly discharge. If at a later stage it turned out that there was some possibility of conducting negotiations withthe Commission, the position could be reviewed. In that eventMinisters would wish to consider whether the negotiations should beentrusted to one of the directors of the Company or whether, as theyhad contemplated earlier, some independent person of standingshould be brought in to undertake the negotiations on the Company&apos;behalf.(b) Was it desirable that, in the statement which he would be making in the House of Commons during the next few days, theForeign Secretary should announce the Governmenfs readiness toaccept in principle the nationalisation of Persia&apos;s oil supplies?The Minister of Defence thought it would be unwise at this stage to make any such reference to the question of nationalisation. Hesuggested that, in any public statement, the Government should forthe present stand on the position that they could not accept anyunilateral repudiation of the agreement between the Company and
the Persian Government and that any dispute under that agreement should be referred to arbitration. Any admission of the principleof nationalisation would be quickly exploited elsewhere in the middle east: the Egyptian Government, in particular, would be glad to seize this pretext for actions prejudicial to British interests. other ministers considered, however, that it would be difficult for theGovernment to postpone stating publicly what had already been saidprivately to the Prime Minister of Persia on the nationalisation ques-tion. Even if he volunteered no statement on this point, the foreign secretary was bound to be asked about it in the House of Commons.It was preferable that the Government should themselves announce their attitude on this point rather than have it disclosed by the PersianPrime Minister. The Cabinet therefore agreed that, in his forth-coming statement in the House of Commons, the Foreign secretary should refer to the question of nationalisation in the terms which hehad suggested.(c) The Governments of India and Pakistan had shown a wel-come understanding of our attitude on this question. The Govern-ment of Pakistan had sent a message to the Persian Governmenturging them to seek a settlement by negotiation. And the indian government would probably have been willing to send a similarmessage, but for the disclosure that the United Kingdom Govern-ment had asked them to do so.(d) Would it be wise to enlist the good offices of the united nations in promoting a settlement? The Cabinet were informed thatthis possibility had been fully considered by the Ministers who, on the cabinet&apos;s behalf, were watching developments in the Persian situa-tion. They were satisfied that, while an application to the Inter-national Court might be of some value, nothing would be gained by reference to the United Nations at this stage. If it became necessaryto send troops into Persia for the protection of British lives, ministers would then have to consider whether the United Kingdom Govern -ment should take the initiative in bringing the situation to the noticeof the Security Council. There were arguments both for and against that course which Ministers would have to consider, but itwould be premature to reach a decision at the present stage.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to say, in the statement on the Persian situation which he would be making in theHouse of Commons on 29th May, that the UnitedKingdom Government were prepared to negotiate withthe Persian Government a settlement which, provided itwere satisfactory in other respects (a qualification towhich they attached importance), involved some form of nationalisation.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor to arrange for a similar state-ment to be made simultaneously in the House of Lords.4. The Foreign Secretary said that the Chinese military offen-sive in Korea had now been effectively broken and this seemed to bean opportune moment to take some fresh initiative in seeking apolitical settlement. He therefore proposed to revive the suggestion which he had made to the United States Government, following theCabinet&apos;s decision on 22nd March (CM. (51) 22nd Conclusions,Minute 6), that the United Kingdom and United States governments should jointly make some fresh approach to the Peking Governmentwith a view to securing a political settlement of the Koreansituation.The Cabinet took note, with approval, of the Foreign Secretary&apos;proposal.
Germany.Soviet Proposalfor a Meetingof foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 35thConclusions,Minute 10.)5. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet had lastreviewed on 10th May the progress of the discussions in Paris, further efforts had been made to secure agreement on an agenda for ameeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. These, however, had met with no success; and the Western Powers now proposed to takethe course (in which the Cabinet had concurred on 10th May) ofadjourning the official discussions in Paris and undertaking further consultations with the Soviet Government through diplomatic channels. It was proposed that the three Governments shouldembody their proposals in identical notes which would be deliveredsimultaneously through their representatives in Moscow.In discussion there was general agreement with the course ofaction proposed. It was, however, suggested that the foreign secretary should take special steps to make clear to public opinion in this country the reasons why the Western Powers were unwilling to agree that the North Atlantic Treaty should be placed on theagenda for a meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the official discussions in Paris regarding thepossibility of arranging for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers were now to be adjourned, and that further consultations with the Soviet Government on thissubject would be undertaken through diplomatic channels.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take special steps to make clear to public opinion in this country the reasons foradjourning the Paris discussions and, in particular, fordeclining to agree that the Council of Foreign ministers should discuss the North Atlantic Treaty.Colonial 6.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDevelopment    State for Colonial Affairs (CP. (51) 141) regarding forthcomingCorporation.    debates in Parliament on the Annual Report of tne Colonial Develop-previous        rrient Corporation.   The present Chairman of the Corporation (LordReference:      Reith) was anxious that in these debates statements should be madeCM. (51) 19th   on behalf of the Government to the effect that his predecessor (LordConclusions,     Trefgarne) had (i) assumed direct charge of the Gambia PoultryMinute 2.)       Scheme, and (ii) withheld from the Board adverse reports on thescheme and over-ridden technical advice about it without informing the Board.   It was recommended in the memorandum that no suchstatements should be made on the Government^ behalf; but that, ifnecessary, it should be announced that a formal enquiry would be instituted into the matters under dispute.In discussion there was general agreement that it would be undesirable for the Government to institute a general enquiry into thereasons for the failure of the Gambia Poultry Scheme. The Corpora-tion, in their annual report for 1950, had explained the miscalculationswhich had been made when the scheme was launched, and nothing was to be gained by holding a general enquiry into the scheme. Ifany enquiry was to be held, it should be limited to the questionwhether Lord Trefgarne had withheld from other members of theCorporation information indicating that the scheme was not working. well. While this might be thought to be a matter affecting only theinternal administration of the Corporation, questions of publicaccountability arose and Parliament was entitled to satisfy itself thatproper safeguards had been observed in the expenditure of public money on the scheme. -The Opposition would probably press forsome form of enquiry, and, if no other steps were taken, Lord Reith
Japanese peace treaty.(previous reference:CM. (51) 30thConclusions,Minute 4.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 137) reporting the result of preliminary discussions with the United States Government about a japanese peace Treaty, and inviting the Cabinet to approve a number of proposals arising out of these discussions.The Foreign Secretary said that the initial question for theCabinet to consider was whether they should seek to impose a harshtreaty upon Japan or whether it would be wiser to seek a peace settle-ment which the Japanese would regard as reasonable. It was important to avoid driving the Japanese into the arms of Russia, andon this account he favoured the relatively mild proposals which had emerged from the discussions with the United States Government.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Governments of Australia and New Zealand were nowlikely to accept the proposals in CP. (51) 137, since their fears hadbeen allayed by the promise of a Pacific Defence Pact. australia would, however, press the claim to Japanese gold as reparations.India would favour even milder terms, and was likely to press for thedraft treaty to be shown to the Peking Government. It was desirablethat India, Pakistan and Ceylon should be given an opportunity toexpress their views on the draft treaty.(b) Proposals on the lines indicated in CP. (51) 137 would be unpopular with some sections of public opinion in this country. Theywould be specially unwelcome to ex-Service men who had foughtagainst the Japanese, and to some business interests which feared thatthe United States would assist the entry of Japanese goods into british overseas markets. Public opinion in those Colonies whichhad suffered from Japanese occupation would also require careful handling. From these angles there was much to be said for further delay before any peace treaty was concluded.(c) Attention was drawn to the fact that Article 6 of the draft treaty annexed to CP. (51) 137 would place no restrictions on japanese rearmament. Was it right that a defeated nation shouldescape so quickly from all restrictions on the size of its armed forces?It was doubtful whether the militarist and imperialist tendencies ofthe Japanese had been cured by six years of American occupation,and many Asiatic countries might feel uneasy about the danger of aresurgence of Japanese military power. Moreover, Germany wouldcite the Japanese precedent in support of a claim to similar freedomwhen the German Peace Treaty came to be discussed. On the otherhand, it was argued that Japan should play some part in counteringthe Soviet threat in the Far East; and that, if she was to do so, therisk must be taken of allowing her some means of self-defence.   the would wish to make a personal statement in the House of Lords inreply to the personal statement made by Lord Trefgarne on 11thApril.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Secretary of State for the Colonies should appoint a person with legal experience to investigate andreport upon the matters in dispute between Lord Trefgarneand the present members of the Colonial development corporation concerning the administration of the GambiaPoultry Scheme.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for the Colonies to announce the Governmenfs intention of instituting this enquiry inthe debate on the Colonial Development corporation in the House of Commons on 29th May.
Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,2Sth May, 1951.United States Government contemplated that the level of japanese rearmament would be settled in defensive pacts framed outside the formal peace treaty.The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume at a later meeting their discussion of theForeign Secretary&apos;s memorandum (CP. (51) 137).(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit a supplementarymemorandum on the question of restrictions on japanese rearmament.
