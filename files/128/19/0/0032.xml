Parliament. 1.   The Home Secretary said that the debate on raw materials,Business in the which was to be held in the House of Commons on 1st May, was nowHouse of likely to take a rather different course, in view of the terms of the commons. motion tabled by the Conservative Opposition (viz., &quot; That this Houselearns with anxiety that the rearmament programme which it approved in February was based on estimates of defence production which werenot accepted by Ministers principally concerned&quot;). The cabinet agreed that, in view of this motion, the Government spokesmen inthis debate should be the Minister of Supply and the Minister ofDefence. The Lord Privy Seal should also be prepared to intervene in the debate, if required, to explain his new responsibilities for rawmaterials questions.The Cabinet proceeded to discuss the tactics to be followed in handling the debate. The Conservative motion would be, in form,an amendment to the motion requesting the Speaker to leave the chair. The Government.would therefore find it awkward to propose an amendment to that motion. Nor would it be easy to frame a reasoned amendment in terms acceptable to Government supportersgenerally. After discussion the Cabinet agreed that it would be preferable to meet this Conservative challenge by inviting government supporters to vote in favour of the formal motion requesting the speaker to leave the Chair.The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week. Parliament would be adjourned for the Whitsun Recess on 11 th May and would reassembleon 29th May.2. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in pursuance ofthe Cabinefs decision on 26th April, he had discussed with the health ministers whether the Government should accept the proposal thatthe charges specified in the Schedule to the National Health service bill should not be increased without further legislation. They had agreed to recommend to the Cabinet that an amendment to this effect,moved by a Government supporter, should be accepted. The cabinet must also determine their attitude towards amendments which hadbeen tabled with a view to limiting the period of operation of the Bill.Some people favoured limiting its operation to one year; othersthought it should remain in operation for three years. He and the health Ministers favoured a provision by which the Bill would remainin force for two years, and could thereafter be kept in force from year to year by affirmative resolution.In discussion there was general support for these proposals. TheCabinet recognised, however, that the exact form of the second amend-government would have to be discussed with some of the government supporters concerned in the working of the National Health Service.The Cabinet-Authorised the Health Ministers to accept amendments tothe National Health Service Bill providing (i) that the chargesspecified in the Schedule to the Bill could not be increasedwithout fresh legislation and (ii) that the initial duration ofthe Bill would be limited to two years, with power of annualrenewal by affirmative resolution.national health service bill.(previous reference:CM. (51) 31stConclusions,Minute 2.)Festival of 3.   The Lord Privy Seal raised two questions regarding theBritain. Festival Gardens.   The first of these related to the Parliamentary(Previous proceedings on the Festival of Britain Bill. It had been suggested that reference: this Bill should be taken in the House of Commons on 10th May.CM. (51) 21st It would not, however, be possible to publish by then the report of theConclusions, accountants&apos; enquiries into the expenditure incurred by the FestivalMinute 5.) Gardens company. He had been advised that it would be inexpedient
to publish the first of the reports by accountants until the final report was available; and it was unlikely that this final report could becompleted before the Whitsun,Recess.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that it would be undesirable to postpone the Festivalof Britain Bill until after the publication of theaccountants&apos; reports on their investigations into theexpenditure of the Festival Gardens company.The Lord Privy Seal said that his second question related tothe date of opening of the Festival Gardens. While the amusementcentre at Battersea Park would probably open on 10th May, therewas no assurance that the Festival Gardens as a whole would be ready for some time after that. The workmen employed by the maincontractor had been promised a bonus payment, if the Gardens were98 per cent, completed by 7th May. He thought it unlikely that this state of completion would be reached by then; and, if it were not,he suggested that he should require the company to terminate the contract and refuse to pay the bonus, and that he should bring inRoyal Engineers to finish the preparation of the Gardens. Unless he were free to take drastic action of this kind, he could give no date by which the Gardens would be completed.The general view of Ministers was that there would be serious objection to the use of troops to complete the work on the FestivalGardens.The Cabinet (2) Agreed that it would not be desirable to employ troops tocomplete the preparation of the Festival Gardens inBattersea Park.4. The Foreign Secretary said that, since the Cabinet had discussed on 23rd April his proposals for negotiating a new oil agree-ment with the Persian Government, the then Prime Minister of Persiahad resigned and a new Government was being formed under the leadership of Dr. Musaddeq, who had played a leading part in the agitation for the nationalisation of Persia&apos;s oil resources. The Majlishad passed a measure authorising the nationalisation of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company&apos;s undertaking in Persia and the appointmentof a commission to evict the Company; and it was expected that this measure would that day be endorsed by the Persian Senate. this action of the Persian Parliament, which was tantamount to a unilateraldenunciation of the existing agreement, had been taken before anyserious thought could be given to our offer to negotiate a fresh agree-ment. We must make a firm protest against such high-handed action.The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Anthony Eden, M.P., was proposing to ask him that afternoon, by Private Notice Question,whether he had any statement to make on the latest developments in the situation. He read to the Cabinet a draft of the statement which he was proposing to make in reply to that Question.The following points were made in the Cabinefs discussion ofthis draft statement:  (a) The Foreign Secretary would be well advised to make a somewhat shorter statement, and to avoid phrases which would giveoffence to the Persian Parliament and people.(b) It would be inadvisable to state publicly that the formerPrime Minister of Persia had resigned because he disagreed with theresolution passed by the Majlis. Nor would it be wise to stigmatisethe new Prime Minister as an extremist.
(c) It should be made more clear that we were not opposed inprinciple to Persia&apos;s nationalisation of her oil resources: we were infact prepared to meet the legitimate nationalist aspirations of thePersian people and were ready to enter into negotiations for a newoil agreement in a reasonable and accommodating spirit. We must,however, protest against the breach of contract involved in anyunilateral repudiation of the existing agreement.(d) It would be wise to make it clear that, for our part, we were ready to submit to. arbitration any outstanding differences between ourselves and the Persian Government which could not be resolved by negotiation. Such an offer would strengthen our position in rela-tion to public opinion in the United States and elsewhere.In the course of the Cabinefs discussion the following points were raised about the current position in Persia:  (e) The Minister of Fuel and Power said that these latest developments confirmed his view, which he had put forward in the cabinet&apos;s discussion on 23rd April, that it would not be possible tosecure a new agreement on the basis of the proposal outlined inparagraph 4 (i) of CP. (5.1) 114, and that we should be forced to envisage a settlement on the lines indicated in paragraph 4 (iv) ofthat memorandum. He suggested that we should lose no time inascertaining what view the United States Government now took ofthe position, in the light of the latest developments.(/) The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the departments directly concerned should give immediate consideration to theproblems which were likely to arise in the course of the next fewweeks. Thus, if the Persians seized the refinery at Abadan, shouldthe Company&apos;s employees be withdrawn or should they continueto work the installation? What sanctions were available to theUnited Kingdom Government, and would it be expedient to applyany of them? Under present arrangements, for example, thePersian Government had a wide discretion to convert their sterling balances (totalling about  25 million) into dollars: it might be desir-able that we should withdraw this concession or delay action under it. Officials of the Departments concerned should be instructed tosubmit recommendations to Ministers on these and similar points.(g) The Cabinet should decide what military action they wereprepared to authorise for the protection of British lives and property in Persia.The Foreign Secretary said that, in view of the points raised inthe Cabinefs discussions, he would seek to defer his statement in theHouse of Commons until the following day. Meanwhile, he would consult further with the Prime Minister about the terms of thestatement.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to revise, in the light of their discussion, the statement which he was proposing tomake in the House of Commons regarding the latest developments in Persia; and to settle the final terms ofthat statement in consultation with the Prime Minister.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit to them at an earlydate his proposals for safeguarding the interests of theAnglo-Iranian Oil Company in Persia.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,30th April, 1951.
