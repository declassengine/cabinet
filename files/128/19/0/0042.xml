japanese peace Treaty.(previous reference:CM. (51) 41stConclusions,Minute 1.)ChineseParticipation.1. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 158) reporting the further progress of his dis-cussions with Mr. Dulles on the provisions of the draft Peace treaty for Japan.The Foreign Secretary said that, despite the strong pressure whichhe and the Prime Minister had brought to bear on him, Mr. Dulleswas quite unwilling to agree that the problem of China&apos;s participation in the Treaty should be solved along the lines preferred by the Cabinetin their discussion on 7th June. For Mr. Dulles it was a point ofprinciple that, if by the Treaty Japan was to regain full sovereignty,she should not be placed in a position in which her relations with china would thereafter be governed by a majority of the treaty powers. But and this perhaps was more important he was alsosatisfied that a provision on the lines preferred by the Cabinet wouldbe so unpopular with the Republican Party in the United States thata Treaty containing it would have no chance of ratification by the senate. A most difficult and embarrassing situation would arise ifthe Treaty went forward on this basis and ratification by the UnitedStates Senate were withheld at the final stage.The Foreign Secretary again emphasised the grave risks involvedin failure to secure Anglo-American agreement on the basis of theJapanese Peace Treaty. He recommended that in all the circum-stances the United Kingdom Government should now agree to go forward with the Treaty on the basis that no Chinese Governmentwould be invited to sign it, that there would be no accession clause,and that Japan would be left with the responsibility of solving theproblem of her future relations with China once she had regainedher full sovereignty and independence on the entry into force of theTreaty. The details of this proposal were set out in paragraph 13 of cp. (51) 158.The Foreign Secretary added that, if he were authorised to reach agreement with Mr. Dulles on this basis, he had no doubt that theUnited States Government would support our claim for the with-drawal of Japanese trading rights in the Congo Basin. This last point was of even more immediate practical and political importanceto us; and he was glad to say that, as a result of his conversations with the President of the Board of Trade, Mr. Dulles now seemedready to meet our views on it if agreement could be reached on theother question.In discussion some Ministers again expressed their concern atthe proposal that Japan should be left free, as soon as the Peace treaty was concluded, to decide which Chinese Government she would recognise. The United States were to maintain military forces in japan for some time to come, and in many respects Japan would bein the position of an American satellite. It therefore seemed quitelikely that she would be induced to recognise the Nationalist Govern-ment of China. United Kingdom Ministers would find it difficultto defend a peace settlement which allowed this to happen. On theother hand, it was argued that it was much better that Japan should remain under American tutelage than that she should pass underSoviet influence. Moreover, she would be very largely dependenton other countries for supplies of raw materials; and this conditionof economic dependence would put several of the signatory powers in a position to influence her political affiliations. Finally, it neednot be assumed that she would necessarily recognise the nationalist government of China. It would be in her interests to cultivatefriendly relations with the Government in control of the, Chinesemainland. And it was conceivable that she might eventually recogniseone Government as having authority over Formosa and another asbeing in control of the mainland.As regards Formosa, various suggestions were made for theamendment of paragraph 4 of the draft announcement annexed to cp. (51) 158. Ministers considered that the first sentence of thisparagraph should be omitted.   They also thought it would be inexperienced-40768-3b 2
expedient to suggest that the final settlement of this question would be influenced by the views and interests of the people of Formosa itself.So long as the island was under the control of Chiang Kai-shek, theinhabitants would not be in a position to give free expression to theirviews. Doubts were also expressed about the wisdom of. committing- ourselves to the view that the future of Formosa should be settled by the United Nations. On the other hand, it might be unwise tosuggest that this question would be settled at a later stage by thePowers which were signatories to the Japanese Peace Treaty, since it was not yet known which Powers would sign that Treaty. In allthe circumstances it might be preferable to say merely that the futureof the island had still to be discussed &quot; in the light of the Charter ofthe United Nations.&quot; It was the general view of the Cabinet thatthis paragraph of the draft might be recast on the following lines:&quot; Article 2 of the Treaty provides for Japan to renounce hersovereignty over Formosa. The Treaty does not try to prejudge thefuture of the island, which is still to be discussed in the light of the charter of the United Nations.&quot;Japanese Stocks The Cabinet next considered whether, in view of the concession of Gold. which was to be made on the problem of China&apos;s participation in theTreaty, a further attempt should be made to persuade Mr. Dullesto agree that Japan should not be allowed to retain her gold reserves.Ministers were informed that, if we refrained from pressing this pointfurther, we might be able to secure some other financial concessions.On the other hand, it was pointed out that our reasons for pressingour point about the Japanese gold were political rather than financial.It would be difficult to justify to public opinion a policy of concludinga generous peace settlement with Japan; and the task would be madeeven more difficult if it was proposed that these gold reserves shouldbe left in Japanese hands. It would be preferable that the UnitedStates should take the gold and hold it in trust for the time being.It was the view of the Cabinet that a further effort should be madeto persuade Mr. Dulles to accept our views regarding the Japanesegold reserves; but that this should not in the last resort be madea condition of our agreement to the publication of a joint Anglo-American draft of the Treaty.Shipbuilding The- question was also raised whether, in return for the con-Capacity, cession to be made on the problem of China&apos;s participation, we should press for the inclusion in the Treaty of a provision limiting Japaneseshipbuilding. The Cabinet agreed, however, that this question shouldbe left on the basis discussed at their meeting on 7th June, viz., thatfinal decisions about the manner of controlling Japanese shipbuildingwould be deferred until further information was received about thecourse of the current discussions on this subject in Tokyo.The Cabinet (1) Authorised the Foreign Secretary to agree that the problemof China&apos;s participation in the Japanese Peace treaty should be handled on the basis described in paragraph 13of CP. (51) 158, subject (i) to his making a further effort to persuade Mr. Dulles that Japan should not be allowedto retain her gold reserves, and (ii) to his securing a firmpromise of United States support for the withdrawal of japanese trading rights in the Congo Basin.(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to arrange for paragraph 4 ofthe draft announcement appended to CP. (51) 158 to be amended on the lines indicated in the discussion; and authorised him to seek the agreement of the United StatesGovernment that an announcement in the terms of thedraft as thus amended should be made when the treaty was signed.
Germany.Soviet Proposalfor a Meetingof foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 41stConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Foreign Secretary said that it had not been found possible to reach agreement with the United States and french governments on the terms of any written reply to the latest note fromthe Soviet Government regarding the proposed meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers. In these circumstances the three governments had agreed that the best course would be to resume the discussions between the Deputies of the four Foreign Ministers in Paris. Thesetalks had now been resumed.The Cabinet took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Disappearance        3.   The Cabinet were informed of the reply which the Foreignof Foreign       Secretary was proposing to give to questions which were being askedOffice Officials, in the House of Commons that afternoon about the disappearance of two Foreign Office officials.It was suggested in discussion that it might become necessaryto hold a formal enquiry into the circumstances in which these twoofficers had left the country. Such an enquiry might provide an oppor-tunity for restating the principles which should govern the standards of personal conduct of officers in the Foreign Service.supplementary pensions for miners.(previous reference :CM. (51) 3rdConclusions,Minute 5.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister of fuel and Power (CP. (51) 154) raising the question whether theGovernment should maintain their objection to the inclusion of allsurface workers in the scheme of supplementary pensions which theNational Coal Board were negotiating with the National Union of mineworkers.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that, when the cabinet had agreed on 8th January that the supplementary pensions scheme should be restricted to underground workers, he had made it clearthat this restriction of the scheme would present serious practicaldifficulties. About 24 per cent, of those employed in the industryworked on the surface, and about half of them had previously workedunderground and would therefore be included in any scheme forunderground workers. The question at issue was, therefore, whetherthe remaining 12 per cent, could, in practice, be excluded from thescheme. The Executive of the National Union of Mineworkers had explained at the Delegate Conference at York in January that thescheme which the Board had in mind was confined to underground workers, but in the subsequent discussions throughout the country the general body of miners had shown themselves unwilling.to accept this restriction of the scope of the scheme. It was now clear that,unless the scheme covered surface workers as well as underground workers, there was little prospect of securing agreement with theUnion. He proposed to ask the National Coal Board to resist afurther request by the Union relating to ill-health and widows&apos;pension under the new scheme. He thought he ought, however, to accept theproposal that the scheme should be compulsory and that there shouldbe no question of individual miners being able to exclude themselves from it. He had arranged to meet the Executive of the NationalUnion of Mineworkers on the following day, but he would simplylisten to what they had to say and would indicate that the negotiations should be conducted with the National Coal Board.The Minister of National Insurance said that it was because ofthe urgent need to recruit underground miners that the Cabinet had
agreed to sanction a scheme of supplementary pensions for under-ground workers, at a time when it was felt that a general enquiry should be made into the scope and nature of supplementary pensions schemes. The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, the Ministerof Labour and herself were shortly to meet representatives of theGeneral Council of the Trade Union Congress, in order to persuade them to agree to an enquiry into supplementary pensions schemes.That enquiry would be gravely prejudiced if, in the meantime, theminers&apos; scheme had been enlarged to include all surface workers, Theworkers in other nationalised industries would claim, with somejustice, that if surface mineworkers were given a supplementarypension scheme they, too, should have one, and concessions to theworkers in nationalised industries would in turn lead to pressure for similar schemes throughout industry.in subsequent discussion it was pointed out that one of the mainobjects of establishing a supplementary pensions scheme for under-ground miners had been to encourage recruitment for undergroundworking. This advantage would be lost if the scheme covered allmanual workers in the coal-mining industry. Moreover, difficult problems of demarcation would arise if the scheme were extended tocover surface workers, since these included workers on railway sidings,coke ovens and other ancillary operations. It was, however, thegeneral view of Ministers that it would not be practicable to resist the extension of the scheme to surface workers, since all the indica-tions were that the miners were not prepared to accept a distinctionin treatment between underground workers and surface workers. Thecost of extending the scheme to the remaining surface workers would work out at about Id. per ton of coal. It would, however, be reasonable to insist that surface workers who were brought within thescheme should give an undertaking to work underground if they were called upon to do so and were physically fit.There was general agreement that ill-health and widows&apos; pension under the new scheme could not be paid in addition to pensionsalready payable under the National Insurance (Industrial Injuries)Act, and the Colliery Workers&apos; Supplementary Injuries Scheme. Thenew.scheme should, however, be mandatory on all workers coming within its scope.It was also agreed that the Minister of Fuel and Power shouldnot be accompanied by other Ministers when he received the Execu-tive of the National Union of Mineworkers on the following day. Heshould merely listen, promise consideration of what the executive had to say, and indicate that the Union should continue to negotiate with the National Coal Board about the terms of the scheme.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that objection should not be taken to the extensionof the supplementary pensions scheme for miners to coverall surface workers, subject to examination of the sugges-tion that surface workers who came within the scheme should undertake to serve underground if called upon todo so and if physically fit.(2) Agreed that the scheme should be mandatory upon all workers coming within its scope, and that the further concessions sought by the National Union of Mineworkersin regard to ill-health and widows&apos; pensions should be resisted.[3) Took note that the Minister of Fuel and Power, when hemet the Executive of the National Union of Mineworkerson the following day, would promise consideration of the representations which they made, but would indicate that further negotiations must be conducted with the national coal Board.
InternationalWheatAgreement.Accession of japan.(FreviousReference:CM. (49) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary and the Minister of Food (CP. (51) 156) recommending thatthe Government should agree to support a Japanese application forunconditional accession to the International Wheat Agreement.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, while the balanceof payments with dollar countries was likely to present difficulties,there were strong reasons for supporting the Japanese application forunconditional accession. He hoped, however, that the Ministry ofFood would make every effort to secure a satisfactory arrangement for the Australian Wheat Board to assure our supplies of wheat from australia over the next two years, and that full advantage would betaken of the Government&apos;s change of policy in any discussions aboutJapanese rice requirements and in the negotiations for the new sterlingpayments agreement with Japan.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 156.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,\\th June, 1951.
