DurhamCountyCouncil.Conditions ofEmployment(previous reference:CM. (51) 18thConclusions,Minute 3.)1. The Cabinet were informed that in the debate on 13th march the Conservative Opposition would propose a motion inviting theHouse of Commons to express regret at the decision of the DurhamCounty Council &quot; in insisting on membership of an appropriate pro-fessional association or trade union as a condition of employment bythat Council&quot;. It would be embarrassing for the Government toaccept an Opposition motion in these terms : some government supporters, particularly those representing Durham constituencies,would be reluctant to support it. In these circumstances it wassuggested that the Government should table an amendment to theeffect that the House, while endorsing the attitude adopted by theGovernment in this matter, hoped that the discussions which hadalready been initiated with the County Council would lead to a satis-factory conclusion. All Government supporters could be expectedto vote in favour of an amendment on those lines.In discussion the point was made that public opinion was strongly opposed to this action by the Durham County Council ; and that, incommending to the House an amendment in the terms suggested,Ministers should make it clear that the Government were not propos-ing to modify the attitude they had adopted in this matter.The Cabinet Agreed that the Government should table an amendment tothis Opposition motion, on the lines indicated in the discus-sion ; and invited the Home Secretary to settle the terms ofthat amendment in consultation with the Ministers of LocalGovernment, Labour and Education and the Chief Whip.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed that in the debate in the HouseGambia of Commons on 13th March the Conservative Opposition wouldPoultry propose a motion regretting the financial losses caused by the collapseScheme. of the Gambia poultry scheme.   Should the Government table an amendment to this motion?In discussion it was pointed out that the Government wereawaiting a further report from the Colonial Development Corporation,before deciding to what extent the existing scheme should be modified,and in these circumstances it would be difficult to frame a suitableamendment to the motion.The Cabinet agreed that no amendment should be moved by theGovernment and that the House should be invited to reject theOpposition motion.Deportation The Cabinet were informed that Mr. Fenner Brockway, M.P.,Powers of was proposing to introduce on 14th March, under the Ten-MinuteColonial Rule, a Bill dealing with the deportation powers of colonial governors. Governors. The House of Commons had already discussed thisquestion as recently as the 8th March, in a debate on the Adjourn-ment ; and the Secretary of State for the Colonies would not be in aposition to add anything to what had already been said on theGovernments behalf on that occasion.The Cabinet invited the Chief Whip to try to dissuade Mr.Fenner Brockway from introducing this Bill.Reserve and The Home Secretary said that it had been brought to his noticeAuxiliary that, under this Bill as now drafted, proceedings against a, man whoForces had failed to report in pursuance of a calling-up notice would have(Training) Bill, to be taken at the place where he should have reported.   This would(Previous involve considerable administrative inconvenience ; and he thereforeReference: proposed that an amendment should be moved in the House of LordsCM.

The Cabinet invited the Minister of Defence to arrange for theBill to be amended accordingly during its passage through the Houseof Lords.North Atlantic The Prime Minister said that, after consultation with the Opposi-Treaty: tion, it had been agreed that the appointment of Admiral FechtelerCommand as Supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, would not be discussed byOrganisation, the House of Commons in the debate on the Navy Estimates that day.(Previous Some other opportunity for the discussion of this question would haveReference : to be found before the Easter Recess. Meanwhile, the Prime MinisterCM. (51) 18th said that he would circulate, for the information of his cabinet conclusions, colleagues who were not members of the Defence Committee, a state-Minute 2.)      ment of the case for this appointment.Germany. 3.   The Cabinet were informed that, in the discussions now pro-Soviet ceeding in Paris regarding the agenda for the proposed Meeting of proposal for the Council of Foreign Ministers, the Soviet representative was pres-a Meeting of sing the view that the agenda should include some explicit reference the Council of to the problem of German rearmament. Our view had been that noForeign exception need be taken to the inclusion of such a reference, so longMinisters. , as the agenda was not limited to German problems only and was(Previous sufficiently wide to permit discussion of the general level of armaments.Reference: The United States representative had not, however, been willing soCM. (51) 16th far to accept the inclusion of any reference to the rearmament of conclusions,     Germany.Minute 5.) jn discussion the Cabinet agreed that the United kingdom representative should not oppose the inclusion of some specific reference to German rearmament, in a context which made it clearthat discussion would not be confined to this particular aspect of thelevel of armaments. The difficulties raised by the United states representative might perhaps be overcome if this problem were presented, in the agenda, as one of determining what level of arma-ments Germany should be allowed to have for purposes of her own defence.Receipts andExpenditure ofthe british transport commission.(previous reference:CM. (50) 25th &apos;Conclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofTransport (CP. (51) 70) recommending increases in transport fares and charges to meet rises in operating costs, including the cost of the wage increases recently granted to railway workers.The Minister of Transport said that the Transport Commission^existing deficit stood at  40 million. The Commission were faced withrunning costs for their railway undertaking which were  25 million ayear in excess of those contemplated when their current level of charges was fixed. The Commission wished railway freight charges to be increased by 10 per cent, (yielding about  20 million a year),London passenger fares by amounts which would yield between  10and  11 million a year, and monthly return fares on the railways by10 per cent, (yielding  3i million a year). These proposals would meet the increases in costs, would make some contribution towardswriting off the existing deficit and would give a small margin for thefurther increases in cost which had to be expected. Since the british transport Commission would not be in a position to put a comprehensive-sive freight charges scheme before the Transport Tribunal until theautumn, the proposed increases in railway freight charges would haveto be authorised by the Minister under section 82 of the transport act, 1947, after consultation with the permanent members of theTransport Tribunal. The Commission could increase monthly returnfares without reference to the Tribunal, since they represented a con-cessional rate. It would fall to the Commission to ask the tribunal to authorise the proposed increase in London passenger fares and theCommission were on the point of putting before the Tribunal theirpassenger fares scheme for areas outside London.
The Minister said that there was some pressure from government supporters for the grant of a subsidy to the British Transport Corn-mission. The Federation of British Industries had also suggested a subsidy in respect of railway workings which were maintainedprimarily for defence reasons. He himself had no doubt that arevenue subsidy would have a bad effect on the Commission and its staff : it could not fail to reduce the incentive to pursue economies and increased efficiency. At the same time he felt that the Govern-ments post-war settlement with the railways had not been entirelyequitable. The Governments refusal to allow the railways to carryout much of the capital investment which they thought to be necessaryhad resulted in an accumulation of capital works which would haveto be financed at a time of higher costs, so that the reserve funds whichhad been accumulated had in effect been depreciated. He therefore thought there was a case for some Exchequer contribution in respectof the deficit which the Commission had accumulated, but he did not wish to press this case at the present time. The prime need now wasto enable the Commission to make ends meet and to exert thenecessary pressure to secure economies and greater efficiency inoperation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that in the circumstances described by the Minister of Transport there would clearly have to be some increase in transport charges. The proposed increase in railway freight charges was reasonable, though it would have adverse effects on industrial costs. He felt more doubtful about the proposed increases in London passenger fares : it seemed that London was being askedto bear an undue proportion of the burden. The Commission hadpresumably considered the position which would arise from the pro-posed increase in monthly fares on the railways : one consequencewould surely be an increased use of road passenger services, particu-larly for short distances. He was opposed to the grant of a subsidy in respect of current operations but also to any once-for-all subsidydesigned to enable the Commission to write off their deficit. Otherindustries, including socialised industries, had put aside funds for maintenance and renewal and were finding that less could be done with the amounts available than in the past: this situation was not peculiar to the railways. Moreover, however the matter was dis-guised, any such subsidy would be represented as an exchequer contribution in respect of the recent increase in railway wages. there might, however, be some charges, at present falling on the railways,of which they ought to be relieved. One example was the cost of allowing members of the Services to travel at reduced fares : this could resonably be represented as a charge which should fall on theExchequer.Further discussion showed that the Cabinet were not prepared,on the basis of the information available to them about current trends in transport, to endorse all the proposals put forward by the british transport Commission. No immediate financial difficulty would arise, because the Commission were able to meet their deficit out of reserves which had been accumulated, primarily for maintenance workand renewal. At the request of the Cabinet the financial position ofthe Commission had been reviewed in 1950, and the conclusion had then been reached that some increase in charges was necessary. since then, however, there had been a number of developments. Thetendency of traders to use their own vehicles under &quot; C &quot; licences had grown. The Cabinet would find it useful, in considering the present proposals, to know in detail what effect the increases in freight changes made in 1950 had had on the volume and types of freight carried bythe railways. Further information was required on the possible effecton the rail receipts of the proposed increase in monthly return fares,and on the manner in which any additional burden on the travellingpublic should in equity be distributed between London and the restof the country. Further examination might well disclose a numberof burdens at present borne by the British Transport Commission
which might reasonably be transferred to the Exchequer. Thus,without going so far as to propose that the maintenance of the railwaypermanent way should attract an Exchequer contribution, some ministers felt that the British Transport Commission might be relieved of the cost of maintaining road bridges across the railways and otherburdens which dated from the days when the railways had enjoyed a transport monopoly. While the financial position of the Commis-sion might not be substantially improved by economies in operation,Ministers would wish to know what could be achieved in this field and how speedily the negotiations now in progress between the railway executive and the unions could be completed. There seemed also tobe room for considerable improvement in efficiency, notably in theoperations of the Road Transport Executive.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Minister of Transport should consult thepermanent members of the Transport Tribunal in regardto an overall increase of 10 per cent, in railway freight charges.(2) Invited the Minister of Transport, in the light of the cabinets discussion, to consult with the Chancellor of theExchequer and the British Transport Commission on themeasures which might be taken to close the remaining gap between revenue and expenditure, and to submit further proposals to the Cabinet.5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 72) on proposals for the revision of the Statute ofthe Council of Europe, which were to come before a meeting of theCommittee of Ministers to be held in Paris on 16th and 17th March.In discussion there was general agreement that the Council should remain consultative in character and should not be empowered todiscuss questions of defence. It was also important to oppose any suggestion that representatives of international organisations, includ-ing those concerned with economic affairs, should participate in the deliberations of the Council. The United Kingdom should, ifpossible, remain a member of the Council of Europe, but this associa-tion could not continue if the character of the Council were altered inthe way which some Governments desired. This should be made clear to the Foreign Ministers of France and Italy and other like-mindedGovernments.The Cabinet-(1) Approved the proposals in paragraphs 14 to 17 of CP. (51)72.(2) Took note that the Secretary of State for commonwealth relations would keep other Commonwealth Governmentsinformed of the policy of the United Kingdom Govern-ment towards the Council of Europe.6. The A attorney-General said that, in the second reading debate on the Matrimonial Causes Bill on 9th March, he had indicated thatthe Government were proposing to arrange for the appointment of a royal Commission on the law relating to divorce and had suggestedthat on this account the Bill should not be given a second reading. Inthe event, however, the Bill had received a second reading, and theCabinet would therefore wish to consider whether they should proceedwith the proposal for a Royal Commission.It was the general view of the Ministers that a Royal commission should be appointed. Further consideration would have to be givento the question whether there should be one Commission for GreatCouncil ofEurope.(previous reference:CM. (50) 68thConclusions,Minute 2.)Divorce Laws.(previous reference&apos;:   -CM. (51) 18thConclusions,Minute 1.)
industrial disputes.Town Clerks.(previous reference:CM. (51) 1stConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum, by the Minister ofLabour (CP. (51) 75) indicating that he had no alternative but torefer to the National Arbitration Tribunal the disputes between certaintown clerks and their local authorities about their remuneration.The Minister of Labour said that the legal advice which he hadreceived gave him no alternative but to refer the disputes to arbitration.It would, however, be open to particular local authorities to argue thatthey were not bound by the terms of the recommendation made by theJoint Negotiating Committee, and that it was within their discretionwhether or not to accept the proposed scales.The Cabinet considered whether the Minister of Labour shoulddelay referring these cases to arbitration until he was required to do sounder-a writ of mandamus issued by the High Court. The general view was, however, that past legai decisions and the established practice of the Ministry of Labour left the Minister with no adequategrounds on which he could oppose reference to the Tribunal.The Cabinet Approved the proposal in paragraph 7 of CP. (51) 75.PacificDefence.(previous reference:CM. (51) 16thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a further memorandum by theSecretary of State for Commonwealth Relations (CP. (51) 76) on theProposed tripartite treaty between the United States, Australia andJew Zealand.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe Prime Minister had discussed this question further with some ofthe Ministers who had expressed doubts about it in the Cabinetsearlier discussion on 1st March, and he had been asked to prepare aletter to the Prime Minister of Australia explaining the anxieties which ministers felt about this proposal. A draft letter on the lines suggested was reproduced in Annex A of CP. (51) 76 ; but theSecretary of State said that, for the reasons given in his memorandum,it was his view that the despatch of a letter in those terms would seriously damage the relations between this country and Australia.He strongly recommended that no attempt should be made at thisstage to dissuade the Governments of Australia and New Zealandfrom concluding this tripartite treaty with the United States. he believed that, if such an attempt were made, it would fail : theGovernment of Australia would go forward with the treaty.&apos; despiteour protestations, and would persuade the Government of New Zea-land to take the same course. He therefore recommended that a communication should be sent to the Prime Minister of Australia inthe terms of the draft in Annex B to CP. (51) 76. This, while offeringno opposition to the treaty itself, made two important points ofprinciple. First it raised strong objection to the inclusion of the philippines in the treaty.   And, secondly, it stressed the importanceBritain or whether a separate Commission should be appointed forScotland. No facilities should be afforded for further stages of theMatrimonial Causes Bill.The Cabinet-(1) Re-affirmed their decision that a Royal Commission shouldbe appointed to review the law relating to divorce.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to consider, andreport to the Prime Minister, whether there should be aseparate Royal Commission for Scotland.(3) Invited the Prime Minister to take a convenient opportunityto inform the House of Commons of the government&apos;s decision.
of dispelling any misapprehension that as a result of this treaty, theUnited Kingdom Government were repudiating their interest in the pacific area.In discussion the following points were made :  (a) The view was strongly expressed that, if such a treaty were concluded, it must be made abundantly clear that the United Kingdomstill retained a vital interest in the Pacific area. Some Ministers feltthat this should be made clear in the preamble to the treaty itself.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations urged, however,that insistence at this stage on such an amendment of the preamblewould certainly delay the conclusion of the treaty and might welljeopardise the prospects of its being concluded at all. He therefore recommended that this reference to the United Kingdom&apos;s continuinginterest in the Pacific should be made, not in the treaty itself, but in public statements to be made at the appropriate moment in the Parlia-ments of the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand. other ministers, while agreeing to this course with reluctance, insisted thatfirm assurances should be obtained, from the Governments of Australiaand New Zealand that satisfactory statements would be made on thispoint at the appropriate stage.(b) In favour of the treaty it had been -argued that, if their security were guaranteed by the United States, Australia and NewZealand would be more willing in war to make their defence contribu-tion in the Middle East. In fact, however, the Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand had not entered into any definite commit-ments to contribute towards the defence of the Middle East in war.And some Ministers felt that the Australian Government, at any rate,were seeking to limit their defence liabilities to the Pacific area.In this connection it was pointed out that, if the safeguards pro-vided by the United Nations Charter proved in the event to be ineffective, and if the United Kingdom were not associated in any way with this treaty, we should be left without any contractual right to assistance in safeguarding our own interests in the Pacific area in timeof war.(c) This treaty was likely to be a cause of anxiety in India, Pakis-tan and Ceylon. The Governments of those countries should certainly be informed of what was proposed. The Governments ofAustralia and New Zealand should be urged, if they had not done soalready, to keep all other Commonwealth Governments informed oftheir negotiations with the United States.(d) Particular objection was raised to the proposed inclusion ofthe Philippines in the treaty. Determined efforts should be made tosecure that the Philippines were excluded from it, and, if these failed,the Cabinet should be given an opportunity of considering the matter again.The general conclusion of the Cabinet was that, subject to thepoints noted in paragraphs (a) and (d) above, it was not practicable for the United Kingdom Government to offer opposition to the con-clusion of this treaty or to claim to be associated with it. The Ministerof Defence and The Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster said, how-ever, that they felt grave anxiety about the treaty and, in particular,about the interpretation which might be placed upon it by publicopinion in this country. There seemed every likelihood that it wouldbe represented as implying that the United Kingdom Government hadrepudiated their interests in the Pacific area.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that, if the proposed treaty were to be concluded,statements should be made at the appropriate moment inthe Parliaments of the United Kingdom, Australia andNew Zealand making it clear that the treaty would not affect the existing relations between the independent

(51) 76.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to send a personal message to the Prime Minister ofAustralia on the lines of the draft in Annex B to CP.(51) 76, suitably amended in the light of the cabinets discussion.(3) Took note that, if the United States Government were unwilling to agree that the Philippines should be excluded from the scope of the treaty, the Cabinet wouldbe given a further opportunity to review the whole posi-tion afresh.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to ensure that the Governments of Australia and NewZealand would take appropriate steps to inform other commonwealth Governments (including the Governmentsof India, Pakistan and Ceylon) of the proposal to concludethis treaty.
