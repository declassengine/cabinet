Parliament.;Offices of - .Profit.(previous reference:CM. (49) 43rdConclusions,Minute 5.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (51) 62) covering the draft of a House of commons disqualification Bill which had been prepared by a Committee ofMinisters on the basis of a report from a committee of officials underthe chairmanship of the Solicitor-General.The Home Secretary said that in 1941 a Select Committee, underthe chairmanship of Sir Dennis Herbert, had reported on offices of profit under the Crown. There had been frequent requests inParliament for a clarification of the law, particularly on the occasion of the passing of the Bills which had been required to indemnifyMembers who had inadvertently transgressed the law. The Solicitor-Generafs Committee had considered the matter exhaustively on thebasis of the report of the Herbert Committee, and their conclusionshad been reviewed, and in some major respects modified, by the Com-mittee of Ministers over which he had himself presided. Subject tothe Cabinefs agreement on the general principles involved, the way would now be clear for the preparation of a Bill in final form. Thisshould then be discussed with the Opposition ; for the subject was essentially a House of Commons, rather than a Party, question. TheBill might perhaps be introduced towards the end of the current session, with a view to its passage in the following session.The Cabinet first discussed whether they should proceed withsuch a Bill at all in present circumstances. Its publication might bemade the occasion for a political campaign against the Government itiregard to appointments. On the other hand it was pointed out thatthe final revision of the draft Bill and the discussion of its terms withthe Opposition were likely to take some time, so that there was no prospect of its being discussed in Parliament in the current session.The Government had made it known that they were examining thesubject ; and, if for any reason further Indemnification Bills were necessary, they would be criticised for their failure to bring clarifyinglegislation before Parliament. It was the general view of the Cabinetthat the Bill should be completed and discussed with the Opposition,as proposed in CP. (51) 62. The question whether is should be pub-lished at the end of the current session should be decided later.The Cabinet then discussed the main questions of principlearising on the Bill and the following points were made :(a) The majority.of the members of the Solicitor-Generafs Com-mittee had favoured a provision under which Members of the Houseof Commons would be able to hold paid offices under the Crown,without incurring disqualification, if they renounced the remuneration of the office. The Home Secretary&apos;s Committee had taken the viewthat such a provision would be undesirable : it would be regarded with suspicion, and would favour wealthy Members who could afford to accept appointment on these terms. The Cabinet agreed that members should not be enabled to escape disqualification by renounc-ing the remuneration of an office.(b) Under Clause 2(3) of the draft Bill disqualifying remunera-tion was defined in a way which would enable a Member who wasserving on an advisory committee to receive travelling expenses and asubsistence allowance. The Cabinet agreed that, if practicable, thisexemption should be so enlarged as to enable&apos; a Member to accept an appointment which carried with it a right to compensation for loss o?remunerative time, so long as the Member did not in fact claim any payment on that account.(c) The Solicitor-GeneraFs Committee had considered that dis-qualifying remuneration should be defined by reference to moneypayments only and should not include emoluments in kind. TheHome Secretary&apos;s Committee, on the other hand, had taken the viewthat, if an office holder could receive food, a motor car or living accommodation without disqualification, this would leave a seriousgap in the proposed legislation, particularly since emoluments in kindwere specially attractive in times of high taxation.   The Cabinet took
the view that disqualifying remuneration should include emolumentsin kind, if it were possible to frame a definition less restrictive thanthat in Clause 2(2) of the draft Bill. The aim should be to cover any significant or material benefit in kind, but not benefits of a very triflingcharacter.(d) There was general agreement that the Bill should re-enactthe existing law relating to Government contractors, subject to anumber of minor amendments, including one dealing with one-mancompanies. The existing law presented many anomalies but it hadnot led to serious abuses, arid any radical reconsideration of thesubject would involve a great deal of work and might not prove veryfruitful of result.(e) The Solicitor-General&apos;s Committee had recommended thatthe clerks and deputy-clerks of local authorities (other than parish councils) should be prohibited from sitting for any constituencywithin the area of their employing authority. The Home Secretary&apos;sCommittee took the view that the disqualification should apply to allconstituencies. The Cabinet considered, but rejected, a proposal thatthe existing statutory provisions on this subject should be repealedand the matter left to the discretion of local authorities as employers.It was their view that disqualification of the clerk to a local authoritycould be justified, and was necessary, by reason of the facts that henormally acted as returning officer for Parliamentary elections andthat he had to give advice to his authority on intricate questions oflaw in the interpretation of which political bias might enter. similar considerations applied to deputy clerks ; and the disqualification ofclerks and deputy-clerks should apply to any constituency. It was true that other local government officers had to advise their authority on questions into which political bias might enter, but the case fortheir disqualification was not so strong ; and, if legislation wentbeyond the clerk and deputy-clerk, it was difficult to see where theline could be drawn.(/) The Bill contained a general provision disqualifying the direc-tors of Government-controlled companies from membership of theHouse of Commons ; but this general disqualification did not extend to the directors of subsidiary companies of Government-controlled companies. The general view of the Cabinet was that an exceptionfrom this rule should be made in the case of directorships in thevarious companies acquired by the Iron and Steel Corporation.Appointment to these directorships by the Crown should in futuredisqualify from membership of the House of Commons. The closelink between the Government and the Iron and Steel corporation would lead many to consider that, if Members of the House ofCommons were eligible for part-time directorships in publicly-ownediron and steel companies, the mischiefs might arise at which the law relating to offices of profit was directed. A large number of theseposts were part-time directorships ; and this distinguished them fromfull-time employment in socialised industries which could not inpractice be combined with membership of the House of Commons.Rather different considerations applied to the existing members who were directors of iron and steel companies which had now passed into public ownership, since they did not oWe their appointments tothe Crown. It would therefore be a matter for consideration when and how the holders of these existing appointments should be dis-qualified from sitting in the House of Commons if they retained theirdirectorships. A possible course would be to provide that theyshould be exempt from the disqualification until the end of the parliament in which the House of Commons Disqualification Bill waspassed.(g) Attention was drawn to two minor points. The Bill as drafted would probably disqualify a Member who was called up for service as a member of the Class Z or other reserve. The provision that a Lord Lieutenant could not serve as a Member for the county of which he was Lord Lieutenant would operate against a formerleader of the Parliamentary Liberal Party if he should again bereturned for the constituency for which he had previously sat.
Korea.(previous reference:CM. (51) 13thConclusions,Minute 1.)2. On 12th February the Cabinet had agreed that the UnitedStates Government should be asked formally to confirm that united nations Forces in Korea would not advance beyond the 38th Parallelwithout a fresh political decision taken, not by the United StatesGovernment alone, but by the United Nations.The Foreign Secretary said that on 28th February His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington had been informed that a detailed state-ment of United States views on this question had been prepared in theState Department, that this was now being examined by the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff, and that it would be communicated to himwithin the next few days.The Foreign Secretary also said that the Peking Government hadnot vouchsafed any response to the message from the President of theGeneral Assembly assuring them that the United Nations were ready for a settlement of the Korean problem. Meanwhile, the Cabinet were informed, there were signs that the Chinese were preparing to mount aspring offensive in Korea:In discussion attention was drawn to the statement made inparagraph 3 of a memorandum (CP. (51) 65) on Korea which had been circulated by the Minister of State for the Cabinefs information. Fromthis it appeared that an official of the State Department had given an informal assurance that, if a major crossing of the 38th Parallel became a more immediate problem, the United States Government would atthe appropriate time consult with other members of the United Nationsparticipating in military operations in Korea. There was generalagreement in the Cabinet that His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washing-ton should, as contemplated by the Cabinet at their meeting on 12thFebruary, ask that a more formal assurance should be given on behalfof the United States Government. The statements made to theCabinet regarding the attitude of the Chinese only served tounderline the importance of having it clearly understood that theUnited Nations should retain effective control over the policy pursued by the United Nations Commander in Korea.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to take all practicable steps toensure that he received, without delay, a formal reply to theenquiry which he had addressed to the State Department inpursuance of the Cabinefs decision of 12th February.The CabinetU) Approved the draft of the House of Commons Disqualifica-tion Bill annexed to CP. (51) 62, subject to further con-sideration of the points noted in paragraphs (a) to (g)above, and invited the Home Secretary to arrange for theBill to be revised and brought before the legislation committee for final scrutiny.(2) Agreed that the Lord President should initiate discussions with the Opposition about the provisions of the draft Bill,in the form in which it was finally approved by the Legis-lation Committee.
Japanese 3.   On 2nd January the Cabinet had invited the Foreign SecretaryPeace to prepare, in consultation with the other Ministers concerned, a draft treaty. of a public statement embodying their decision to refrain from individual pressing for the inclusion in the Japanese Peace Treaty of anClaims. obligation on Japan to pay individual claims for compensation for(Previous personal injury or ill-treatment or for damage to property outsideReference: Japan.  The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the cm. (51) 1st Minister of State (C.P.(51) 63) covering a draft statement which conclusions, had been prepared in pursuance of the Cabinet&apos;s decision.Minute 4.) jn discussion of this draft the following points were raised:  (a) It was not clear from paragraph 8 of the draft whatwould be done with the Japanese assets in the United Kingdom.If any public announcement was to be made about these claims, itshould leave no room for misunderstanding on this point.(b) Before any such statement was made, other commonwealth governments and Colonial Governments should be given an oppor-tunity to comment on the terms of the draft.(c) The draft statement annexed to CP. (51) 63 was rather too long to be made orally in Parliament. The announcement might per-haps be made in a written Answer.- Alternatively, if that course were considered inexpedient, in view of the public interest shown in thismatter, the draft should be shortened.In further discussion some Ministers asked whether it wasnecessary that the Government should announce their attitude onthis particular point before negotiations for the conclusion of theTreaty had begun. It was surely unusual for a Government to definein advance their attitude towards one particular point in the negotia-tions for a Treaty ; and an announcement on the lines suggested in cp. (51) 63 would give rise to some political difficulties in thiscountry.The cabinet invited the Foreign Secretary, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer and the President of theBoard of Trade, to consider further whether it was necessarythat any public statement should be made on this question at the present stage.University 4.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Secre-education in tary of State for Scotland (CP. (51) 58) proposing the appointment ofDundee. a Royal Commission to enquire into the problem of University educa-tion in Dundee and its relationship with the University of St.Andrews.It was proposed in the memorandum that Sir Geoffrey Hey-worth should be invited to preside over this Royal Commission.   in discussion some doubt was cast on the expediency of inviting a. prominent English industrialist to concern himself with the intricaciesof this local problem.The Cabinet(1) Took note with approval of the proposal to appoint thisRoyal Commission.(2) Invited the Secretary of State for Scotland to discuss withthe Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Lord president the choice of a Chairman for the Commission.Cabinet Office, SWA,5th March, 1951.
