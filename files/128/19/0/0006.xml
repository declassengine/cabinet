1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofFood (CP. (51) 24) outlining the recent course of the negotiations withthe Argentine Government about meat supplies. The Ministerrecommended that on 4th February the meat ration should be reducedto Sd. carcase meat and 2d. canned corned meat; and that the Govern-ment should consider later, in the light of the Argentine reaction tothis announcement, on what basis and at what time negotiations could be re-opened.The Minister of Food said that, in view of the complete break-down of the negotiations with Argentina, an immediate reduction inthe meat ration was unavoidable, whether or not negotiations with argentina were subsequently re-opened. If we now accepted theaverage price of  120 a ton proposed by the Argentine Government and they might try to extract an even higher price, if they thoughtthat we were obliged to reach an early settlement we should haveto increase the food subsidies or authorise a substantial rise in retailmeat prices. This would be additional to the increase of  60 million in 1951-52 in the procurement cost of subsidised foods which he wasbringing before the Economic Policy Committee in E.P.C. (51) 4.In discussion of the history of the negotiations, the followingpoints were made:  (a) The Argentine Government had recently suggested thatchilled beef, for which a higher price could properly be paid, should beincluded in shipments to this country. The Treasury had been pre-pared to agree to pay an average price of  117 per ton, if 75 per cent,of the shipments consisted of chilled beef. The Argentines had, how-ever, admitted that chilled beef would not be available for four or five months and then only in small quantities, and they had been unableto give any assurance about the proportion of chilled beef to beincluded in shipments to this country in the long term. Moreover,they had refused to go below a minimum average price of  120 perton.(b) The Cabinet had understood when the negotiations opened,nine months previously, that the Argentine Government would find themselves in a weak bargaining position when their cold storesbecame full of meat. In the result, this hope had not been fulfilled,due in part to United States purchases of canned meat from the Argen-tine for stockpiling. The United States were said to be again in themarket for Argentine meat, and the United States Government werebeing asked to do what they could to avoid strengthening the bargain-ing position of Argentina in this way. It was suggested that theMinister of Food should try to obtain more information about the quantities of Argentine meat which the United States had bought andthe prices which they had paid, and were prepared to pay, for it.(c) The negotiations had been made more difficult by the switch-ing of the discussions from time to time from Buenos Aires to London.It was also difficult for Government negotiators to resort to the prac-tices which commercial houses could sometimes use in securingcommercial agreements.It was the general view of the Cabinet that negotiations on thepresent basis were not likely to yield results. While there would be a seasonal improvement in meat supplies in this country due to homekillings, the long-term trends were not in our favour and the country might be faced with a weekly meat ration of 8d.-worth of fresh meat for an indefinite period, subject to annual improvements in the summer. There was already considerable public disquiet at theexiguity of the meat ration, which bore very hardly on men engaged inmanual labour who could not take any meals in restaurants or can-teens. The lack of meat had to be balanced by eating more fish andrabbits, which were dearer; and an increase in the meat ration at a somewhat higher cost per lb. would reduce the real cost of living formany people in this country, although it would produce an increasein the cost-of-living index.  The public were likely to have to acceptFood.Meat Supplies.QTreviousReference:CM. (50) 84thConclusions,Minute 8.)
Korea. 2.   The Minister of State said that the Chinese Peopled Govern-(Previous . ment had now answered the enquiries, made by the Indian Ambas-Reference: ambassador in Peking on behalf of the Governments of Canada and India,CM. (51) 5th and by His Majesty&apos;s Charge d&apos;Affaires on behalf of the united conclusions, Kingdom Government, for elucidation of the ambiguities in their minute 3.) original reply to the United Nations proposals for a cease-fire in korea. They had stated that, if the principle that all foreign troops should be withdrawn from Korea was accepted and was being put intopractice, they would advise Chinese volunteers in Korea to return to china. Regarding the conclusion of the war in Korea and the peace-ful settlement of the Korean problem, they thought it possible toproceed by two stages. First, there could be a cease-fire for a limited time, to be settled at the first meeting of the Seven-Power Conferenceand to be put into effect at once so that negotiations might proceed further. Secondly, in order that the war in Korea might be concludedand peace in East Asia ensured, agreement must be reached upon thefollowing political problems measures for the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea; measures enabling the internal affairs of korea to be settled by the Korean people themselves; withdrawal ofUnited States forces from Formosa and the Straits in acordance withthe Cairo and Potsdam declarations, and other problems concerningthe Far East. Finally, the Peking Government had declared that their right to represent China in the United Nations must be ensured....... The Indian representative had read this, reply to the First Com-mittee of the United Nations Assembly, when they resumed theirdebate the previous afternoon, and had proposed that further discussion should be adjourned for forty-eight hours. The UnitedKingdom representative, Sir Gladwyn Jebb, had supported thisproposal: the United States representative had spoken against it inintemperate terms. After debate, the proposal had been carried bytwenty-seven votes to twenty-three. Those voting against it had- included the representatives of the United States, the Latin american countries, Greece, Turkey and the Philippines. Six representatives hadabstained from voting, and these had included the representatives of* Australia and New Zealand. .      , &apos;.&apos; &quot;.&apos;Sir Gladwyn Jebb had now asked for early instructions on theline which he should, take when the debate was resumed on the, v following day. In particular, he was anxious to know whether in thelast resort he was to vote for the United States resolution, or to considerable hardships in the near future because of the defence pro-gramme and rising world costs, and in these circumstances a low levelof meat ration for an indefinite period could not lightly be undertaken.Since the Chancellor of the Exchequer could not see his way to agreeto any increase in the food subsidies, any increase in the price of argentine meat would have to be passed on to the Consumer and therewould be consequential increases in the prices paid to Australian andNew, Zealand producers. On the basis that agreement was reached on an average price of  120 per ton, that 50 per cent, of the meat waschilled and that Australia and New Zealand producers had to be given 7 per ton more, the estimated average increase in the retail price of meat in this country worked out at \\d. a lb; In addition, chilledbeef would be 2d. a lb. dearer than frozen beef. The public mightwell be ready to accept such increases in price if more adequate sup-plies could thereby be made available.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the Carcase meat ration should be reduced on 4thFebruary to 8d.-worth of carcase meat and 2*sf.-worth of canned corned meat.(2) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to consider, with theMinister of Food and the Minister of State, the manner inwhich negotiations for a long-term agreement with theArgentine Government might best be re-opened.
abstain. Other delegations were anxious to know what line he was proposing to take, and he would lose the opportunity of influencingthem unless he could give an early reply to their enquiries.The Minister of State said that our first objective must presume-ably be to gain further time in which to explore to the full thepossibilities opened by this further reply from the Peking Government.It would, however, be helpful to Sir Gladwyn Jebb if the Cabinet could also give him an early indication of the line which he would haveto take if discussion were eventually resumed on the basis of theUnited States resolution.In discussion the following points were raised :-(a) This further reply from the Peking Government, thoughmore conciliatory on the question of negotiations for a cease-fire,was uncompromising in its insistence on the satisfaction of Chineseclaims on Formosa and on admission to the United Nations. It would clearly be difficult to persuade the United States Government to makeany concession on those points. What then were the prospects ofsecuring a long-term settlement? Might there not be some grounds for the suspicion that, in sending this further reply, the Peking Govern-ment had been influenced by their desire to bring about a division,within the United Nations, between the Asiatic Powers and theWestern Powers?In reply it was argued that it was at least some advance to have secured from the Peking Government an offer of a time-table for nego-tiations on a cease-fire which came very near to that proposed in theprinciples put forward by the Cease-Fire Group. On the long-termissues it was conceivable that the Chinese might accept a settlement ifthey could get some measure of satisfaction on the questions of formosa and admission to the United Nations.(b) So far there had been no direct consultation with the state department about the significance of this further reply from the peking Government. His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington hadjhowever, been instructed to see the United States Secretary of Statethat day, and to urge the advantages of exhausting the possibilities ofsecuring a settlement by negotiation. He would also ask that spokes-men of the United States Government should refrain from furtherprovocative statements such; as those made on the two previous daysby members of the United States Delegation at the United Nations.It was suggested that he might also refer to the latest statement byGeneral MacArthur, in which the Chinese action in Korea had beencompared with the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour. Such state-ments could only exacerbate the situation: and they wereinconsistent with the statement of United States policy whichPresident Truman had made to the Prime Minister during his visit to Washington.(c) It would be helpful if the Prime Minister could make a brief statement on the Korean situation when Parliament reassembled that afternoon. This could be little more than a chronicle of events; butit could be so arranged as to show that the United Kingdom Govern-ment had followed a consistent policy of seeking a peaceful settlementof the Far Eastern situation.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that in thediscussions at the United Nations our policy must be to avoidprecipitate action and to support any reasonable proposal designed tobring the Peking Government into conference. The latest reply fromthe Peking Government suggested that the door to negotiations hadnot been finally closed; arid we must do our utmost to keep it open.Sir Gladwyn Jebb should ascertain whether the Indian delegation were thinking Of putting forward any positive proposal which would offer an alternative basis for discussion, so as to delay further debate on the United States resolution. As regards that resolution weshould continue to argue, as we had from the outset, that con-3 condemnation of China should be discussed separately from any proposals
for the application of sanctions. We should wish to express our views separately upon different paragraphs of the resolution. Wecould not assent to the paragraph stating that the Peking Governmenthad rejected the United Nations proposals. Nor could we supportthe proposal that the Collective Measures Committee should beinvited to consider the application of sanctions against China. Onthe other hand, we should be prepared to support some condemnationof Chinese action in Korea. For the moment Sir Gladwyn Jebbshould avoid committing himself to support any formula whichformally branded China as an &quot; aggressor &quot;; though it must be recog-nised that in the last resort we might find ourselves unable to avoid the use of that phrase. It followed that Sir Gladwyn Jebb could notindicate at this stage how he would eventually vote on the UnitedStates resolution. The wording of the resolution was likely to be amended in various respects; and it was impossible for him to say whether he would support it until it became clear in what form itemerged from the debate.The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations to be instructed on the lines indicated by the Prime Minister.(2) Took note that the Prime Minister would make a factualstatement on the Korean situation in the House ofCommons that afternoon.(3) Invited the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations to keep other commonwealth governments informed of the attitude of the UnitedKingdom Government towards the current discussions inthe United Nations.Cabinet Office, SWA,23rd January, 1951.
