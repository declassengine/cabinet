1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be takenin the House of Commons in the following week.The Leader of the Conservative Opposition had suggested thata further debate on foreign affairs might be held during the second week of March.When the Defence debate was resumed that afternoon in theHouse of Lords the Government would be invited to define theirattitude towards the French plan for the creation of a european army. The Cabinet agreed that little could be said on this subject at the present time, while it was under discussion at the international conference convened by the French Government. For the presentour attitude must be similar to that which we had adopted in theearly stages of the discussion of the Schuman plan for the integration of the coal and steel industries of Western Europe.2. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 54) covering a report on the economicsituation.The main points raised in a general discussion of this report were as follows:  In recent months unemployment had been about 10 per cent,lower than in the corresponding periods in the two preceding years.Nearly two-fifths of the current unemployment was in development areas; but unemployment in those areas had recently been fallingmore quickly than in the rest of the country. On Merseyside, whichhad perhaps suffered most from local unemployment, plans for providing alternative employment were now maturing rapidly andthere was good reason to hope that there would be no surplus labour in this area by the end of 1952. Special efforts were being made toensure that further work would come to these areas as a resultof the increased defence&apos; programme.Output of deep-mined coal had increased, despite heavy-absenteeism due to influenza. Output from opencast working had,however, dropped on account of bad weather. Imports were notreaching the figures expected, but it was hoped that the rate of importwould increase in the next two months. If imports improved, andthe current rate of output was maintained, a satisfactory stock position should be reached by the end of the coal year. Unless,therefore, the weather should prove exceptionally severe in March,it now seemed likely that industry would get through the winterwithout suffering serious shortages of fuel. On the other hand, stocks were now so low that a railway strike would produce a widespreadfuel crisis in a very short time.It was suggested that, in the light of this year&apos;s experience, itwould be inexpedient for the Government to publish a target figure for coal output in the year 1951-1952. The Chancellor of theExchequer undertook to consider this suggestion in connection withthe preparation of the Economic Survey.The suggestion was also made that in the next coal year inlandstocks should be regarded as having as good a claim as exports onany output in excess of current requirements. A high level of stockswas an essential insurance, not only against winter weather, butalso against interruptions in production throughout the year.Communist influences were at work in some of the coal-fields; andthe Government could not afford to operate in future on such an arrow margin of stocks.If further coal was to be imported during the summer ships should be chartered early. The Minister of Fuel and Power saidthat the National Coal Board were anxious to import more coalduring the summer; but, in view of the political objections, he was notyet satisfied that it would be right for them to do so.b 2
The Minister of Fuel and Power undertook to submit to theCabinet a report on the progress achieved in securing greatereconomy in the consumption of coal.Steel. Steel production was falling;  and the industry&apos;s output forthe year might fall short of that of 1950 by a quarter of a million tons or more. This would be due mainly to a falling-off in thesupply of scrap, particularly from Germany. It had already become necessary to make a cut of 15 to 20 per cent, in allocations of sheetsteel, because of decreased supplies from abroad; and this reduction would have to continue until the new plant at Margam came intooperation towards the end of the year. It was also likely thatallocations of general steel would have to be reduced by about per cent.It was pointed out that this shortage of steel might falsify theassumption of a 4 per cent, increase in productivity, on which theincreased defence programme had been based. The point was also made that the Government would be exposed to damaging political criticism if steel output fell noticeably in the first year of nationalisa-tion. The Cabinet agreed that the Production Committee should give special attention to the question of steel production.Textiles. Some signs of dislocation were beginning to appear in the textile industries by reason of shortages of raw materials. In thecotton industry this was due mainly to shortages of particular types of cotton. In the wool industry the difficulty arose from the high price of raw wool, which had made the merchants reluctant to carrymore than the minimum stocks.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there seemed to be some disposition on the part of buyers of raw materials generally to hold off the market in the hope that prices would drop. Thiswas a grave mistake if, as he believed, world prices were in fact likelyto rise still further. He would pursue this point in the forthcoming discussion in the Production Committee on the raw materials situationgenerally.Building. Productivity  in  the  building  industry was  threatened  byshortages of bricks and timber. The Cabinet were informed that special steps, including the importation of Italian labour, had alreadybeen taken to secure a substantial increase in the output of bricks;and the stock position should begin to improve from May onwards.Timber imports had suffered from the special diversion of shipping to import coal: this had meant a month&apos;s delay in stock building, and stocks would continue to be low for the next two or three months.Satisfactory purchases had, however, been made, and by July timberstocks should be higher than they had been for some time past.The Cabinet were informed that, because of this interruption inshipments, timber allocations to the building industry had been cut by20,000 standards; and it was strongly represented that this shortfallshould be made good before the onset of the favourable season for building in the spring and early summer. It would be most fortunate if all the efforts which had been made to secure greater productivity in the building industry were now frustrated by shortages of materials. The President of the Board of Trade said that he was most anxious to make good this shortfall, and would certainly take this course if the prospective stock position justified it. He hoped tobe in a position to reach a decision in two or three weeks&apos; time, whenhis information on recent timber purchases was complete. Arrange-ments had already been made for the shipment of all the timberbought on the Pacific coast of America; and hitherto he had been reluctant to suggest chartering further ships to accelerate the arrival of these supplies lest this should have the effect of increasing freight rates. The Cabinet agreed that the Production Committee should consider this question further.Wages. Subject to the outstanding claim by the railwaymen, the currentcycle of wage increases was,now almost complete. The increasesawarded had on the whole been moderate.
The Chancellor of the Exchequer and the Minister of Labour had discussed wages policy -with representatives of the Trades UnionCongress, who, although they had not welcomed the particularsuggestions put to them by Ministers, had shown a responsible attitudetowards this problem.Imports in January had reached a record figure, reflectingincreased buying as well as higher prices. Despite this, our balanceof payments showed a surplus in January, including $23 million earnedthrough the European Payments Union. It was clear that theGermans were exploiting their opportunities under the Union; andfurther attempts should be made to find means of limiting the creditswhich we were making to Germany.The Cabinet (1) Took note of CP. (51) 54 and of the points raised in thediscussion.(2) Took note that the Minister of Fuel and Power would submit a report on the progress made in securing economy in theconsumption of coal.(3) Invited the Production Committee to consider what steps could be taken to prevent a fall in steel output in 1951.(4) Took note that the Production Committee were to undertake a special review of the raw materials situation.(5) Invited the Production Committee to give special attention tothe proposal that further supplies of timber should be madeavailable to the building industry before the favourableseason for building in the spring and early summer.3. The Minister of Labour said that his predecessor had referredto a court of enquiry the dispute between the Railway Executive andthe railway unions about the wage claim put forward by the railway unions. The court had recommended a 5 per cent, increase in wages,on condition that the Railway Executive and the unions would discussmeans of securing greater efficiency of working by the reduction ofstaff redundancy and other measures. The Railway Executive had accepted these recommendations and the unions had rejected them,and, unfortunately, both sides had made their position clear by public statements. In the discussions he had held with a view to persuading the two sides to reopen negotiations, he had told the representativesof the Railway Executive that, in his view, it was a mistake to couplemeasures for securing greater efficiency with a wages offer: the unions were more likely to co-operate in agreeing upon measures for more efficient working if an increase of wages had already been granted.He had also seen representatives of the unions; and he understoodthat during subsequent negotiations the Railway Executive had accepted a formula to the effect that, when the wages issue was out ofthe way, the Executive and the unions would meet and considerquestions of more efficient working. Unfortunately, however, therehad been a failure to reach agreement on the wages increase and theRailway Executive had issued late on the previous evening a public statement to the effect that the negotiations on wages had broken down. The Executive had offered a 5 per cent, increase: the unions,although they had been claiming a much larger amount, would have accepted a 1\ per cent, increase, which was the amount of the increaserecently granted to the dockers. The cost of a 1\ per cent: increase would have been  2f million. He appreciated the difficulty in whichthe Railway Executive were placed by reason of the machinery whichdetermined the level of their fares and charges; but he thought it most fortunate that they should have made the renewal of negotiationsmore difficult by publicly stating that negotiations had broken down.He was in touch with both sides and hoped to bring them togetheragain. A general railway strike would dislocate the whole economy of
the country; and the Executive should keep this in mind when con-sidering the problem of adding  2  million to a wages bill of 220 million. An increase of 1\ per cent, in wages would only bringthe lower-paid workers up to  5 a week.The.Minister of Transport said that the court of enquiry, whichhad included two prominent trade unionists, had unanimously agreedthat in the economic circumstances of the railways the Executive couldnot be expected to offer more than a 5 per cent, increase in wages, andthat the increase should be linked with an undertaking by the unions to co-operate in measures designed to increase efficiency and so to effect savings in railway operating costs. He considered that theRailway Executive were entitled to say that the railway unions, whichwere adding to the deficit on railway operation by pressing their wagesclaim, should co-operate with the Executive in agreeing upon measuresto mitigate the extent of the financial loss. He did not think that theprocedure suggested by the Minister of Labour namely, that thewages claim should be granted and&apos;that thereafter the two sides should sit down to consider how to secure more efficient working sufficientlysafeguarded the position of the Railway Executive. The executive had already been discussing restrictive practices and labourredundancy with the unions for many months and there was a danger that, once the wages claim was granted, the unions would showinsufficient interest in effecting the drastic savings which most peopleconsidered to be practicable. The unions had publicly repudiated the findings of the court without regard to the difficulties which this would create in subsequent negotiations, and the General Secretary of theNational Union of Railwaymen had made no serious effort to restrain the railwaymen while the present negotiations were in progress. Thiswas the first occasion on which, while negotiations were going on, a railway union had allowed token strikes and go-slow tactics to bepractised. Such conduct made a proper relationship between the two sides of the industry very difficult, and gravely impaired the authorityof the Railway Executive. The increases at present under discussionconcerned only the conciliation and salaried grades, but comparableincreases would have to be given to the work-shop grades. On this basis it was calculated that a 5 per cent, increase in wages would cost the Railway Executive  14 million and a 1\ per cent, increase at least-  17 million. These increases would have undoubted repercussions on wages in other branches of transport and possibly in other industries,including agriculture. The effects might therefore be serious. TheTransport Commission had recently had an increase of  3 million ontheir coal bill and a  6 million increases in costs because of the petroltax. A 5 per cent, increase in railway wages was the limit to whichthey felt they could go, and even on that figure they might have toraise freight rates or passenger fares. They would certainly have todo so if an increase of 1\ per cent, were awarded.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The claim of the railwaymen seemed to be taking the samecourse as a recent claim by the miners. There had been an award to coal miners which had proved insufficient to meet the general dissatis-faction throughout the industry at the rates of pay for the lower-paidmen, and further increases in wages had had &quot;to be granted. while some of their leaders might not show a sufficient sense of responsibility,the railwaymen as a whole had shown considerable patience andrestraint; but they were undoubtedly suffering from the&quot; feeling that,with a rising cost of living, they had not secured the minimumincreases which had been granted to workers in other industries.(b) There was considerable redundancy of staff on the railwaysand it was reasonable for the Railway Executive to expect the unions to co-operate in working out measures to effect substantial economies in railway operation. The hope was expressed that any final settle-ment would go as far as was practicable to ensure that the unionsco-operated in this respect.(c) A nation-wide strike at this juncture would have crippling
economic effects, far outweighing in consequence the amounts which now appeared to be at issue between the Railway Executive and theunions. The lowness of coal stocks in electricity generating stations and elsewhere meant that a railway stoppage would result in imme-diate industrial paralysis. The Emergencies Committee had reviewed the position and had reached the conclusion that, apart from special arrangements for delivering urgent letters and for transporting milk and yeast, there was little that the Government could do to mitigate the effects of a general railway stoppage unless resort were had to the proclamation of a civil emergency and a general recruitment of volunteers.The Cabinet (1) Took note that the Minister of Labour would continue his efforts to bring the Railway Executive and the unionstogether, with a view to a resumption of the negotiations.(2) Took note that the Minister of Transport would convey to theBritish Transport Commission the serious view which theGovernment took of the likely consequences of a generalrailway stoppage.coloured people fromBritish colonial territories.(previous reference:CM. (50) 37thConclusions,Minute 2.)4. On 19th June, 1950, the Cabinet had invited the PrimeMinister to arrange for a review to be made of the further meanswhich might be adopted to check the immigration into this country of coloured people from British colonial territories. The Cabinet had now before them a note by the Home Secretary (CP. (51) 51), covering the report of a Committee of Ministers which had considered thisquestion and had reached the conclusion that the introduction oflegislation to control immigration from the Colonies would not atpresent be justified. The Committee recommended, however, that departments should take all practicable administrative measures tocontrol immigration by stowaways and &quot; one-trip seamen &quot; from colonial territories.The Cabinet Approved the recommendations in the report annexed to cp. (51) 51.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.22nd February, 1951.
