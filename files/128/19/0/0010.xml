Befencc.    -statement in House ofCommons.(previous reference:CM. (51) 8thConclusions;Minute 2.)1. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Prime Minister(CP. (51) 34) covering the draft of a statement on defence which he proposed to make that day in the House of Commons.In discussion various amendments to the statement were suggested and approved.The Cabinet Approved the draft statement on defence annexed to cp. (51) 34, subject to the amendments adopted in their discussion.Supplementary 2. The Lord President said that he had been informed in confi-Pensions in dence by the General Secretary of the Trades Union Congress that industry. the General Council had been unable to reach agreement about the(Previous        attitude Which the Congress should adopt towards the proposed reference:      committee of enquiry into supplementary pensions schemes.   the cm. (51) 3rd   matter had been sent back to the Economic Committee of the general conclusions,     Council in order that they might have a further opportunity of minute 7.)       examining it; and the General Secretary had expressed the hope thatthe terms under which the General Council could co-operate with thecommittee of enquiry would be agreed at the next meeting of theGeneral Council, to be held in about a month&apos;s time.The Lord President said that, while he greatly regretted thefurther delay now suggested, he thought that, in view of the impor-tance of securing trade union co-operation on this question, theCabinet should accept it.The Cabinet-Agreed to await the outcome of further discussions in theEconomic Committee and General Council of the TradesUnion Congress before proceeding with the general enquiry into supplementary pensions schemes.Korea. 3.   The Minister of State said that there had been further(Previous developments in Washington and New York since the Cabinet atReference: their previous meeting had decided that support should be given toCM. (50) 9th the United States resolution provided that paragraphs 2 and 8 were conclusions.) satisfactorily amended. The position on paragraph 2 was not yetentirely clear, but it seemed likely that the United States Governmentwould be willing to accept an amendment satisfactory to ourselves.There had been further discussions about paragraph 8 and, while theidea of amending it on the lines proposed by the Israeli delgation had been abandoned, the United States Government had offered toagree to an amendment stating that the Collective Measures Com-mittee would be authorised to defer their report on further measuresto be adopted against China if the Committee of Three, to beappointed under the final paragraph of the resolution, reported satis-factory progress in its efforts. He had felt that this represented asubstantial concession to our point Of view and that we should accept it if we could be assured that there was a genuine disposition on thepart of the United States Government to allow an attempt to be madeto bring negotiations about. Instructions had therefore been sent toSir Gladwyn Jebb on the previous day, with the Prime Minister^ con-currence, authorising him to agree to this compromise, provided thatthe United States Government would give art assurance that theywould not oppose proposals, on the lines of those put forward by theCanadian representative, for the consideration of a specific pro-gramme to achieve a negotiated settlement. The United StatesGovernment had subsequently expressed to His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington their general agreement with the principles of theCanadian proposals. They had also indicated that they were willingto discuss them with the Canadians and ourselves in order to put there40090-2 b 2
forward in a mutually agreeable form, but they could not pledge then-support in advance to any resolution which might be brought forward on the basis of the Canadian suggestions.The Prime Minister said that, if a compromise on these lines wasagreed with the United States Government, we should have substan-tially achieved our two principal objectives, to keep the door open for negotiations with the Peking Government and to ensure that any decision on the imposition of sanctions was reached only after further negotiations had taken place. The Indian Government remainedopposed to any mention of sanctions in the resolution, and hadreiterated their view that such a mention Would bar the way to anyfurther negotiations with the Chinese; but the acceptance of the corn-promise would re-establish a common policy between the UnitedStates and the older members of the Commonwealth, and would alsoemphasise our acceptance of our obligations as a member of theUnited Nations. The United States Government had moreover agreedto our making public reference to the American desire to reach a peaceful settlement of the Korean conflict, and he felt that a state-ment to that effect would do much to reassure public opinion in thiscountry about American intentions.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The patience and firmness which we had displayed in regardto the United States resolution had led during the last few days to aconsiderable modification of the American attitude, evinced particu-larly in the assurance they had now given about the Canadian pro-posals. If, as now seemed likely, the United States government agreed to the proposed amendments of paragraphs 2 and 8, we shouldbe able to support the resolution without reservation.(b) It was suggested that we should continue to emphasise to theUnited States Government our agreement with the Canadian pro-posals, and if possible we should secure that action was taken on themin advance of a vote on the United States resolution. In reply, it waspointed out that this might be procedurally impossible, but that in the debate on the resolution our representative could continue to stresstheir importance. It might also be possible to persuade the UnitedStates Government to instruct their representative to refer favourablyto the proposals in the debate. After a vote had been taken on theresolution it might be desirable for the Prime Minister to refer publiclyto our strong support of the Canadian proposals.(c) The United States amendment of paragraph 8 of the resolu-tion was less satisfactory than that suggested by the Israeli Delegation,so far as concerned the deferring of the consideration of sanctionsuntil after further negotiations had taken place, but it was in anotherrespect closer to our views, in that it opened the way to United Statesacceptance of the principles of the Canadian proposals.The Cabinet then discussed a statement, reported to have beenmade in Korea on 27th January by General MacArthur, referring tothe United Nations action in Korea as a campaign for freeing Asia.This was the latest of a series of unauthorised statements by the united nations Commander-in-Chief, which gravely embarrassed theGovernments which had contributed to the United Nations forces in korea. Moreover, a statement of this kind was bound to exert amost unfavourable influence on the public reception of the Govern-menfs policy toward the United States resolution. Could we notpublicly dissociate ourselves from this view and take steps both to repudiate it and to prevent further statements of this kind?After discussion the Cabinet agreed that, if the report of general macarthur&apos;s statement was confirmed, our representative at theUnited Nations should be instructed, at his discretion and subject tohis appreciation of the state of United States public opinion, to referpublicly to it in the United Nations, making it clear that it had beenmade without the knowledge or approval of the United KingdomGovernment.
Germany.soviet proposal for meeting ofthe Councilof foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 1stConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof State (CP. (51) 33) regarding the preliminary discussions to be heldin Washington between representatives of the French, United Statesand United Kingdom Governments in preparation for the proposed meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. This sought the cabinet&apos;s approval for statements, to be used by His Majesty^Ambassador in Washington as his brief in these discussions, outlining the policy of the United Kingdom Government on the matters to bediscussed.The Minister of State said that the Russian reply to the latestnotes on this subject from the Western Powers might be received inthe next week or ten days, and it was important that talks should now take place between representatives of the three Governments so thatthere would be no avoidable delay in dealing with any Soviet proposalswhich were received. It had therefore been arranged that HisMajesty&apos;s Ambassador at Washington should, on the following day,open exploratory discussions with representatives of the French and united States Governments. The broad effect of the instructions tothe Ambassador, which were annexed to CP. (51) 33, was that thethree Western Powers should not agree to a conference with the SovietGovernment solely on the subject of the demilitarisation of Germany,which should only be discussed in the wider context of general disarment. A proposed agenda of five items was set out inparagraph 12 of Annex B to CP. (51) 33, but in the last resort theimportant items which should appear on the agenda were disarma-ment (including the demilitarisation of Germany), the unification ofGermany and the conclusion of an Austrian peace treaty. It was notin his view equally necessary to insist on the inclusion of the other two items, namely, the elimination of subversive propaganda and theconclusion of a non-aggression pact. The Foreign Secretary had always been anxious that Four-Power talks should be held; and theFrench Government, who were also strongly in favour of talks being held, might be willing to fall in with the Soviet desire for a Four-Power conference to deal with Germany and Austria alone. TheUnited States Secretary of State was rather pessimistic about theprospects of the talks, and believed that the project would breakdown at the stage of the preliminary conference about the agenda.In a short discussion of the issues involved, there was generalagreement that the demilitarisation of Germany must be considered inthe general context of disarmament. At the same time the western powers must be careful not to lay themselves open to the misrepresented-sentation that they attached more importance to German rearmamentthan to general disarmament. Public opinion in this country was notThe Cabinet (1) Took note with approval of the further steps which had beentaken to reach a compromise with the United StatesGovernment on the terms of the United States resolution on Korea now before the United Nations.(2) Invited the Minister of State to instruct the United kingdom representative at the United Nations to vote for the resolu-tion, on the basis of the assurance which had been receivedfrom the United States Government regarding theirattitude towards the Canadian proposals, and providedthat Articles 2 and 8 of the resolution were amended inthe sense proposed.(3) Invited the Minister of State to instruct the United kingdom representative at the United Nations at his discretion totake a suitable opportunity to refer publicly to the dis-approval of the United Kingdom Government of general macarthur&apos;s reported statement of 27th January.
yet fully persuaded of the need for German rearmament, and any policy which appeared to place undue emphasis on it would strengthenCommunist influences in France and Russians control over hersatellites in Eastern Europe.The Cabinet Agreed to resume the discussion of CP. (51) 33 at their next meeting.Malta. 5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of constitution State for the Colonies (CP. (51) 30) proposing that war plans should in War. be framed on the basis that in war the present Constitution of Malta would have to be suspended and replaced by a temporary Constitutionvesting all legislative and executive power in the Governor.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that in war Malta would be an operational base and might have to be defended againstheavy attack. Defence considerations would, therefore, becomeparamount and there appeared to be no alternative but to vest power in the Governor, assisted by an executive council appointed by him.There would be no public reference to these arrangements until anemergency arose; and, while the necessary legislation would be drafted now, there would be no question of introducing a Bill into parliament until war was imminent.The Cabinet Agreed that war plans should be based on the assumptionthat in war the Constitution of Malta would be suspendedand replaced by the arrangements outlined in CP.
