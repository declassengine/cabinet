industrial disputes.ManchesterDock Strike.North atlantic treaty.Admissionof Turkey and greece. .1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Home Secre-tary (CP. (51) 124) inviting them.to decide whether steps should betaken to secure that a ship (the Charles Lykes) containing a cargo of raw materials, which could not be unloaded at Manchester Docksbecause of an unofficial strike of dockers, was sent to some otherport in the United Kingdom where the cargo could be unloaded.The Cabinet were informed that over 2,000 dockers at Man-chester had been on unofficial strike for four weeks because of the discontinuance, by agreement with the Transport and general works&apos; Union, of a restrictive practice under which overtime wasworked on the unloading of a ship only if the intention to work over-time had been announced when unloading began and &quot; disappoint-ment money &quot; was paid on any day thereafter when overtime wasnot worked. The immediate cause of the stoppage had been the suspension of two men who had refused to work overtime on a ship which had not been declared to be an &quot; overtime ship.&quot; Some faultappeared to lie with the local officers of the Transport and general works&apos; Union who had failed to make the new agreement widely known among the rank and file of the dockers. It now seemed likely that the strike would end in a few days&apos; time. It had been understoodthat the owners of the Charles Lykes might send the ship back tothe United States to be unloaded, and the Ministry of Transport had therefore asked them not to move the ship until the Government hadbeen able to express their views regarding the disposal of the cargo.The raw materials included in this cargo were not in immediatedemand by the industries which would use them; and the problem was, therefore, primarily, one of avoiding the political consequences which might follow in the United States if it appeared that cargoes of important raw materials could not be unloaded in this country ata time when the Government were urging that increased supplies ofsuch materials should be sent here from the United States.There was general agreement that nothing should be done whichmight lead to an extension of this unofficial strike to other portsor might prolong the Manchester stoppage. The balance of advan-tage appeared to be against unloading the cargo at the military port of Cairnryan, since the dockers in other ports might take exception to this and the cargo was not required so urgently as to justify theuse of military labour in unloading it. There seemed to be no serious risk that the Owners would take the ship back to the United Stateswithout unloading the cargo. The best course would be to indicate to the owners that they should take such steps as they considered rightto secure the unloading of the cargo, while indicating a preference for unloading in Belfast rather than in Antwerp.The Cabinet Invited the Minister of Transport to,inform the owners ofthe Charles Lykes that the Government did not wish tostipulate where its cargo should be unloaded but, while leaving responsibility with the owners, would prefer thatit should be unloaded in Belfast rather than in Antwerp.2. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 130) arid the Minister of Defence (CP. (51) 132)on the question whether Greece and Turkey should.be admitted to membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (N.A.T.O.).The Minister of State said that the United States government now favoured the admission of Greece and Turkey to N.A.T.O. Inhis memorandum the Foreign Secretary had recommended acceptanceof this American proposal, but&apos;subsequently he had been impressed by the doubts which were being expressed by all the &quot;other signatories to the Treaty. The French, in particular, feared that Russia might regard this as a provocative act of encirclement. They also feared that the danger of a third world war would be greatly increased ifthe military provisions of the Treaty had to be brought automatically40675-1 b 2
into operation as a result of a threat to Greece or Turkey. An under-taking had been given to the French Chamber that any enlargement of N.A.T.O. would be brought before them for approval, and noFrench Government could commit itself on this issue before the forth-coming elections. The United States proposal would probably haveto be accepted, since that country alone was in a position to guarantee the security of Greece or Turkey, and their admission to N.A.T.O.might well be the only way in which the United States Governmentcould persuade Congress to accept this further commitment inEurope. The Foreign Secretary hoped, however, that he would begiven some latitude in handling this question in discussions with theUnited States Government. He might indicate that the government accepted in principle the admission of Greece and Turkey, but feltthat the military implications of this step required further study bythe Standing Group before the North Atlantic Council considered thematter.The Minister of Defence said that it was true that the military implications of the inclusion of Greece and Turkey in N.A.T.O. hadnot been fully studied, but it was not unusual for the United StatesGovernment to press for the acceptance of such commitments withoutfull exploration of their military and political consequences. TheTurkish Government were pressing strongly for admission toN.A.T.O., and they would be affronted if they thought that this wasbeing obstructed by the United Kingdom Government. Their good-will was essential for the effective defence of the Middle East. Ifany guarantee to Turkey were given unilaterally by the United States,Turkey would be drawn into the sphere of responsibility of theSupreme Commander, Europe. If, on the other hand, she were brought into N.A.T.O., we should be in a better position to press for a Supreme Allied Command, Middle East, with a British supreme commander, in which Turkey would play a vital part.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that, from themilitary point of view, the balance of advantage lay on the side of admitting Greece and Turkey to membership of N.A.T.O. Thiswould not have the effect of drawing Turkish military forces into thedefence of the West, since in a general war the Turkish forces wouldbe urgently required to meet any Soviet threat against the middle east. The arrangements for the defence of the Middle East wereunsatisfactory and could not be made fully effective without Turkishco-operation.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) The question whether Greece and Turkey should be admitted to N.A.T.O. raised the wider question of the world defence arrange-ments which should be adopted by those States which were resolved to resist Soviet aggression. The existing members of N.A.T.O. were all members of an Atlantic community which favoured a democraticsystem of government; and the Treaty in its present form wasdefensive in character and could not be regarded as aimed at theencirclement of the Soviet Union. The enlargement of the Treaty toinclude Greece and Turkey might lead to demands that countries likeSpain and Yugoslavia should also be included; and the impressionmight be created that, instead of a defensive alliance, the Treaty was becoming a framework for the military alignment of forces againstthe Soviet Union in a third world war. On the other side it was pointedout that the Soviet Union wpuld be much more likely to pursue with success a policy of aggression if they had reasonable grounds for believing that aggression in certain parts of the world would not befollowed by general war. Although not explicitly aimed at Russia,N.A.T.O. was in fact a union of States which feared Russian policy,and it was reasonable that they should seek to,associate with the mother like-minded States which would stand by them in the eventof: aggression. It might be that NA.T.O. would be gradually expanded to include, for example, some of the other Commonwealth countries. I
A Middle East regional pact by itself would have no attraction for turkey, since it would afford her no effective increase in security:what she wanted was a guarantee of her territorial integrity by theUnited States.(b) The United States Government had not given sufficientthought to the problems of Middle East defence, with which thepresent issue was closely linked. It might, for example, be argued thata policy of armed neutrality on the part of Turkey would serve theinterests of the Western Powers better than Turkey&apos;s active participa-tion in any hostilities against the Soviet Union. The effect on otherMiddle East countries of a North Atlantic Treaty guarantee to turkey would also have to be considered. It was arguable that in this eventthey would be inclined to leave the defence of the Middle East to theUnited States, the United Kingdom and Turkey. It was unlikely thatthe United States would be prepared at this stage to give any promise to send troops to the Middle East in war, though General Eisenhowermight make available such naval forces as he could spare. It was,however, desirable that the United States should show a greaterwillingness to facilitate the building up of Middle East defences under british auspices. For example, they could adopt a more helpfulattitude towards our current difficulties with Egypt, and they should give a clearer indication of the manner in which they expected Turkish forces to be employed in war. We should try to clear up these pointsbefore we declared our final view on the admission of Greece and turkey to N.A.T.O.The Prime Minister said that the United States Government were anxious that we should declare our full support for the admission of greece and Turkey to N.A.T.O. so that we might help to sway othermembers of the Organisation in favour of this course. He consideredthat at this stage we should not go further than indicate to the UnitedStates Government that we did not disagree in principle to the admis-sion of Greece and Turkey, and were prepared to give full considera-tion to the issues involved before the matter came up for decision atthe next meeting of the North Atlantic Council. Meanwhile, weshould ask that the Standing Group should work out the military implications of the admission of these two countries, and we should seek from the United States authorities a clearer statement of theirviews on Middle East defence and the organisation of a supreme allied Command, Middle East, and their assistance in the working outof effective defence arrangements with Middle East countries. Theopportunity should be taken to make it clear that the admission of greece and Turkey to N.A.T.O. could not be regarded in this country as paving the way for the admission of Spain. The further examina-tion of the proposed admission of Greece and Turkey, on the lines which he had indicated, would occupy the next few weeks, and would cover the period during which the French elections were being held.The way should then be clear for a final decision to be taken by theCabinet before the next meeting of the North Atlantic Council.The Cabinet-Invited the Foreign Secretary to handle the question of the admission of Greece and Turkey to the North Atlantic treaty organisation in the manner outlined by the Prime Minister.3. The Minister of Defence said that discussions were still proceeding with the United States military authorities on the north atlantic command organisation. The Americans were not preparedto accept the proposal for a Supreme Commander, Mediterranean,who would be a British Admiral: rather than accept this, they wereprepared to go back on the earlier decision to appoint an AmericanAdmiral as Supreme Commander, Atlantic. They were most insistentthat the naval forces supporting the southern flank of the supreme commander, Europe, should be under the command of an AmericanAdmiral with the title Commander-in-Chief, Allied Forces, SouthernNorth atlantic treaty.command organisation.(previous reference:CM. (51) 29thConclusions,Minute 1.)
Europe. This, arrangement would balance that already adopted inthe north, where the naval forces protecting General Eisenhowersnorthern flank had already been placed under the command of aBritish Admiral. They had also suggested &quot;that a new Supreme allied command should be established for the Middle East, and that theSupreme Commander in that theatre should be British. This sugges-tion was acceptable to us. These arrangements did not, however,provide for any single control over sea communications through theMediterranean; and the problem of naval command in the Mediter-ranean still remained unresolved.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that these questions were to be further discussed by the Standing Group on 24th May, andthe Chiefs of Staff wished.to seek the Cabinefs approval for theinstructions which they were proposing to send to their representative on the Standing Group. They were ready to agree that the naval forces supporting General eisenhower&apos;s southern flank should beplaced under the command of an American Admiral, though they wished it to be made clear that neither Greece nor Turkey should bebrought within General Eisenhower&apos;s command. They also continuedto support the appointment of an American Admiral as supreme commander, Atlantic. In order to end the present deadlock, they suggested that these two appointments, on which agreement could now be reached, should be announced and brought into operation atonce. Further discussions could then be held on the two outstanding questions, viz., naval command in the Mediterranean and the creationof a new Supreme Allied Command, Middle East.The Prime Minister said that there, would be grave political disadvantages in announcing these two appointments before the othercommand arrangements had been settled. These two appointmentswere both to be held by American Admirals; and their announcement,in advance of the other appointments, would give rise to even greaterpolitical criticism in this country than that evoked by the premature disclosure of Admiral Fechteler&apos;s appointment. The command structure-ture which had been outlined to the Cabinet would only be acceptable to public opinion in this country if it could be announced as a whole and if the organisation for a Supreme Allied Command, Middle East,included provision bringing sea communications throughout theMediterranean under the control of a British naval commander.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the naval forces supporting the southern flank ofthe Supreme Commander, Europe, might be placed underthe command of an American Admiral if the organisation for a Supreme Allied Command, Middle East, included pro-. vision bringing sea communications throughout theMediterranean under the control of a British naval&quot;commander.(2) Agreed that no further appointments under the north atlantic command structure should be announced until itwas possible to make a comprehensive announcementcovering the question of naval command in the Mediter-ranean as a whole.(3) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to instruct their representative onthe Standing Group in the sense of Conclusions (1) and- (2) above.Middle East. 4.   The Cabinet were informed that it was proposed to strengthenDespatch of     the British forces in the Middle East by the despatch of the i 6thReinforcements. Independent; Parachute Brigade Group to Tripoli.   If it became necessary to send troOps into Persia, this unit would be required forthat purpose; and it was desirable that it should now take up a position from which it could move into Persia without delay.
The Cabinet Authorised the despatch of the 16th Independent ParachuteBrigade Group to the Middle East; but asked the Ministerof Defence to take all practicable steps to secure that noundue publicity was given to this move.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,22nd May, 1951.
