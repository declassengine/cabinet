Food. 1.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the mission underMeat Supplies,  the leadership ofthe Economic Secretary, Treasury, which was at(Previous        present seeking to negotiate a new meat agreement with the ArgentineReference:      Government, was now within sight of securing supplies of 200,000 tonsCM. (51) 12th   of Argentine meat over the next twelve months at an average price of conclusions,      132-8 per ton.   About 35,000 tons of the meat would be chilled beef,Minute 2.)       and the average price for frozen meat would be somewhere between 125 and  130 a ton.   Moreover, it was possible that about  7-6 ofthe average price of  132-8 might be paid under some other head ofthe general commercial agreement; and, if this could be arranged, the meat price would look more reasonable.   It was true that this average price would be compared with the price of  120 a ton which the argentines had been thought to be offering in December; but they nowclaimed that they had never intended that offer to cover anything butthe lower grade of frozen beef.  The Chancellor said that he was satisfied that we should not get meat from the Argentine at a lowerprice than that now proposed; and, in his view, the political difficultiesof paying this price were less than those of allowing the meat rationto remain at the low level to which it had fallen.   He therefore recom-mended that the mission should be authorised to accept a price of 132-8 per ton for all Argentine meat, including chilled beef.The Minister of Food supported this recommendation. Suppliesof imported meat had fallen, not only because of the continuing dead-lock in the negotiations with the Argentine Government, but also because of strikes in New Zealand; and, although the supplies ofhome-killed meat would afford some immediate relief in the summer and autumn, the position in the following winter would be extremely serious unless we could count on substantial shipments from theArgentine. Even if a new agreement were reached with the argentine government on the basis now proposed, it might be some weeks before shipments could be resumed, as shipping had been divertedelsewhere and would have to be moved back into position to take upthese supplies.The Cabinet were informed that the terms proposed wouldinvolve some increase in retail meat prices, though this would probably not exceed the figure mentioned when the Cabinet had discussed on19th March (CM. (51) 21st Conclusions, Minute 3) the general question of increases in retail food prices. It had, however, been contemplated that any such increase in the retail price of meat wouldbe accompanied by an increase in the size of the weekly ration. TheCabinet agreed to consider at a later meeting the timing of theannouncement of increased meat prices.The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that the Economic Secretary, Treasury, should beauthorised to accept an agreement with the argentine government involving the payment of an average price of 132-8 per ton for Argentine meat (including chilled beef).(2) Invited the Minister of Food to consult the Cabinet again before announcing any increase in the retail price of meat.The Budget. 2.   The Chancellor of the Exchequer communicated to the(Previous       Cabinet particulars of the proposals in the forthcoming Budget.Reference: In accordance with precedent, details are not recorded in the cm.

Social Services        3.   After the Chancellor of the Exchequer had explained hisExpenditure.    Budget proposals the Cabinet reverted to the question, which they had(Previous        discussed at their meeting on 22nd March, of the level of government reference:      expenditure on the social services.   One of the assumptions on whichCM. (51) 22nd the Chancellor had constructed his Budget was that, in pursuance of conclusions,    the Cabinefs decision of 22nd March, expenditure on the NationalMinute l.)       Health Service would be subject for the time being to an upper limit of  400 million.   Before that decision was taken expenditure on the health Service in the financial year 1951-52 had been estimated at 423 million; and, in order to keep it within the upper limit approvedby the Cabinet, the Health Ministers had agreed to effect economies in hospital administration totalling  10 million and to introduce charges for dentures and spectacles which, in the coming year, would produce 13   million.   In   a   full  year   these   charges   would   produce a much larger revenue; but the saving on the hospitals&apos; service wasnon-recurrent and the revenue from charges would be needed in future years, if the total expenditure was to be kept below the upper limit of 400 million, in order to offset increasing costs in all parts of theService.The Minister of Labour said that he had always been opposed tothe introduction of charges for dentures and spectacles. In his view it would be undesirable in principle, and politically dangerous, for theLabour Party thus to abandon the conception of a free Health Service.Now that he was aware of the details of the budgetary position he was able to add the further argument that this step was not financiallynecessary. In a Budget of over  4,000 million it should not be difficultto find so small a sum as  13 million in some other way which wouldnot breach the principle of a free Health Service. He was speciallydisturbed at the prospect that this inroad on the Health Service wouldbe justified by the argument that the money to be saved was needed for the increased defence programme. He himself believed thatshortages of raw materials and machine tools would make it impossible in practice to spend effectively all the money which was to be allocatedunder this Budget to the defence programme; and in this view he hadthe support of the President of the Board of Trade and the Ministerof Supply. The Defence Estimates for the coming financial yeartotalled  1,250 million; and of this the estimated cost of defence production amounted to  510 million. These were large figures andmust be subject to a substantial margin of error. He believed that,within that margin, the Chancellor could have found the savings whichhe proposed to secure by introducing charges under the Health Service.The Minister reminded the Cabinet that such charges could not be imposed without fresh legislation. Believing, as he did, that such charges would involve a serious breach of Socialist principles, andhaving on numerous occasions proclaimed in public speeches his oppo-sition to such a course, he did not see how he could be expected to vote in favour of such a Bill. If the Cabinet reaffirmed their decision thatthese charges should be imposed, he would be obliged to resign from&apos; the Government.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that it was his special duty,in framing the Budget, to determine how the necessary revenuesshould be raised to meet essential Government expenditure and also,in present circumstances, to form a judgment on the figure of theBudget surplus at which the Government should aim in order to keepinflationary tendencies in check. The Budget which he had outlinedto the Cabinet was a carefully constructed and integrated plan for regulating the national finances over the coming year; and it wouldbe difficult for him to modify at the last moment any essential feature of that plan. The Cabinet should, in particular, be content to leave it to his judgment to determine the size of the Budget surplus at whichhe should aim. He believed that the estimates of defence expenditure were as reliable as any such estimates could be: he could not acceptthe suggestion that he should frame his budget on the assumptionthat the out-turn of this expenditure would be something less thanthe estimate. He had taken the view from the outset that some part
205 CM. 25.(51)of the rising cost of the defence programme must be met by reductions in other Government expenditure; many of his efforts to securesuch reductions had been frustrated; and he had now reached a point at which he could not make any further concessions. The cabinet had agreed, on 22nd March, that expenditure on the Health service should be subject for the time being to an upper limit of  400 million;he was satisfied, from his consultations with the Health Ministers,that the cost of the Service could not be kept within that limit with-out the imposition of charges; he believed that, of the various charges which might be made, these would be the least unpalatable politically;and in all the circumstances he felt obliged to ask the Cabinet tomaintain their earlier decision.A long discussion ensued. The following is a summary of themain points made in it:  (a) The Minister of Labour and the President of the Board ofTrade thought that the Government would find great difficulty in persuading their supporters in the House of Commons to accept thisdeparture from the principle of a free Health Service. They con-sidered that some Government supporters would abstain from voting in favour of the legislation authorising the imposition of these charges;and they pointed out that, if only a few Government supportersabstained, the Conservative Opposition, by voting against the Bill,could bring about a major Government defeat. In that event theGovernment would face a General Election in circumstances whichwould enable the Conservative Party to pose as the champions of a free Health Service. The Home Secretary also feared that there mightbe considerable Parliamentary difficulty in securing the passage ofthis legislation.On the other side it was pointed out that, so far as concernedlegislation, the principle of a free Health Service had already beenbreached by the National Health Service (Amendment) Act, 1949,which authorised the imposition of a shilling charge for prescriptions.This legislation, which the present Minister of Labour had himselfintroduced, had encountered no substantial opposition from Govern-ment supporters. It was not until it had been.passed into law thatthe Government had decided not to proceed with their plan for making a charge for prescriptions.The preponderant view in the Cabinet was that the Government,if they remained united on this issue, would have no substantial diffi-culty in persuading, the Parliamentary Labour Party to support legis-lation authorising charges for dentures and spectacles supplied underthe National Health Service.(b) The Minister of Labour said that, in a Budget totalling over 4,000 million, there must be tolerances which would allow theChancellor, if he wished, to forego his insistence on a saving of only 13 million on the Health Service. By the exercise of ingenuity, means could surely be found to avoid having to impose these charges. Thus,for the coming financial year, the relatively small amount requiredmight be obtained by increasing the contribution made to the health service by the National Insurance Fund. Alternatively, the Chan-cellor might reduce by  13 million the Budget surplus at which hewas aiming.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was not preparedto adopt either of the courses suggested by the Minister of Labour.They would both be inflationary in effect. Moreover, if he had sucha sum at his disposal, he would certainly wish to consider to whatpurpose it could most usefully be applied. He was by no meanssatisfied that, even within the social services, the Health Service hadthe first claims on any additional money that might be available.(c) Several Ministers expressed the view that, if the Minister ofLabour resigned from the Government on this issue, an acute politicalcrisis would develop. With their present Parliamentary majority theGovernment could not afford any diminution in their voting strength in the House of Commons.  And, if the Government fell, as a result
of divided counsels within the Cabinet, the Labour Party&apos;s prospectsat the following General Election would be very gravely prejudiced.After a prolonged discussion the Foreign Secretary said that it seemed clear that the Cabinet would not be able to reach an agreedconclusion at that meeting. He therefore proposed that the dis-cussion should be resumed at a further meeting later in the day.In the interval he would see the Prime Minister (who was in hospital)and would report to him the course which the discussion had sofar taken.The Cabinet Agreed to resume their discussion at a meeting later in the day.Cabinet Office, SWA,9th April, 1951.
