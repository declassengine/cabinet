Parliament. 1.   The Home Secretary said that it was important that theGovernment of House of Commons should not carry the Private Member&apos;s Motion,Ireland Act. which was to be moved by Mr. George Thomas, M.P., on 1st June,(Previous proposing fundamental alterations in the constitution of NorthernReference - Ireland.   Ministers should take special care to be in attendance forCM (51)35th any division on this Motion.Conclusions, It was suggested in discussion that, in view of Their Majesties&apos;Minute 2.) impending visit to Northern Ireland, Mr. Thomas might be persuaded to withdraw this Motion.   The Home Secretary undertook to see whether this could be arranged.-House of Lords The Home Secretary said that, in pursuance of the CabinefsChamber. decision of 28th May, he had suggested to Mr. Speaker that, when(Previous Parliament reassembled, he might make an appropriate reference to reference: the fact that the House of Lords were now able to resume theirCM (51)37th occupation of their old Chamber.   Mr. Speaker had, however, been conclusions, advised that there would be some procedural difficulty in adoptingMinute 1.) &apos; this suggestion and had decided not to make such a statement.Japanese Peace 2. The Cabinet resumed their discussion of the proposals for aTreaty. Japanese Peace Treaty.   In addition to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s(Previous        memorandum (CP. (51) 137), which they had considered at their reference:     - meeting on the previous day, they also had before them a furtherCM. (51) 37th   memorandum by the Foreign Secretary (CP. (51) 148) on the questionConclusions,    of restricting Japanese rearmament.Minute 7.)Security The Foreign Secretary said that, as shown in CP. (51) 148, theArrangements. Cabinet had already agreed on 2nd January (CM. (51) 1st Con-clusions, Minute 4) that safeguards against Japan&apos;s resurgence as amilitary power should be sought, not by including in the Peace treaty provisions directly restricting Japanese rearmament, but by meansof a separate Defence Pact between the United States and Japan,which would be concluded concurrently with the Peace Treaty. Itwas contemplated that, as a result of this Defence Pact, Japan wouldrely upon the Western Powers to provide her with submarines,bombers and naval craft larger than frigates; and the restrictiveinfluence of this arrangement would be increased by the continuedpresence of Allied forces in Japan and by the exploitation of Japan&apos;economic dependence on the Western Powers. This approach to theproblem of restricting Japanese rearmament had been approved by theother Commonwealth Governments and, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s earlier decision, it had been made the basis of the discussions alreadyheld with the United States Government regarding the form of thePeace Treaty.The Foreign Secretary said that, despite this, he recognised theforce of the political objections, which had been mentioned in the cabinet&apos;s discussion on the previous day, to the inclusion in thePeace Treaty of a provision explicitly recognising (as did Article 6 (b)of the draft annexed to CP. (51) 137) the sovereign right of Japan torearm for self-defence and to enter into collective security arrange-ments with other Powers. He was therefore ready to suggest to theUnited States representative, Mr. Foster Dulles, that this paragraph should be deleted from the draft Treaty, in view of the politicalcriticisms which it was likely to evoke. This would not involveabandoning the plan, already approved by the Cabinet, of handling the security safeguards outside the Treaty, by means of a separateDefence Pact.The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that it was the viewof the Chiefs of Staff that Japan should be enabled to play a part inthe task of countering Communist encroachment in the Far East, andthat for this purpose some degree of Japanese rearmament should be
permitted. Japan should, however, accept some limitations on herright to rearm: in particular, she should undertake not to buildbomber aircraft, submarines or any of the larger types of naval vessel.The Chiefs of Staff expressed no view on the question whether these limitations on Japanese rearmament should be secured by restrictiveclauses in the Treaty or by a separate Defence Pact.Discussion showed that the preponderant view in the cabinet was that, despite their earlier decision of 2nd January, a further effort should now be made to persuade the United States Government thatthe Peace Treaty should include some reference to the limitationswhich were to be placed upon Japanese rearmament. In support ofthat view it was argued that a Treaty which contained no securitysafeguards would be repugnant to large sections of public opinion,both in the United Kingdom and in Other countries which had been at war with Japan. The omission would be the more remarkable,since all Peace Treaties in modern times had contained provisionsrestricting the right of the vanquished nation to rearm. Limitationsincluded in, or authorised by, the Peace Treaty itself would have greater authority than restrictions voluntarily accepted by Japan in a bilateral Defence Pact with the United States. Opinion in some ofthe other Commonwealth countries seemed to be veering in favourof imposing rather more severe terms upon Japan. Thus, since the cabinet&apos;s discussion on the previous day, a telegram had been receivedfrom the Prime Minister of Australia urging us to press for theinclusion in the Treaty of adequate safeguards against the resurgenceof Japan&apos;s military power and recommending that we should at leastinsist upon provisions preventing Japan from building up a powerfulnavy.On the other hand, it was pointed out that the Asiatic membersof the Commonwealth might take a different view on this point andthat, if there was to be a division of opinion within the Common-wealth, it was most undesirable that all the Asiatic members should join in opposing the others particularly on a question which so/ closely affected Asia. The point was also made that, in the shortterm, the main risk was that Japan might fall a victim to Sovietaggression; and that, unless the Western Powers were to shoulderthe whole burden of defending all their defeated enemies, Japan mustbe put in a position in which she could play her part in resistingCommunist encroachment.The Cabinet reaffirmed their view that Japan should beallowed a measure of rearmament subject to the limitationsdiscussed at their meeting on 2nd January. They considered,however, that the Foreign Secretary, in his forthcoming discus-sions with Mr. Dulles, should make every effort to secure agreement that these limitations on Japan&apos;s right to rearm should. be specified in the Peace Treaty. If this effort failed, and reliancehad to be placed on a separate bilateral Defence Pact betweenthe United States and Japan, Mr. Dulles should at least be urged to agree that the Peace Treaty should not include any provision on the lines of Article 6 (b) of the draft annexed to CP. (51) 137,recognising Japan&apos;s sovereign right to rearm.The Cabinet next considered the outstanding questions raised in cp. (51) 137.Shipbuilding. The Foreign Secretary said that in the recent talks in Washingtonthe United States Government had generally agreed with our viewthat Japan should be induced to limit her shipbuilding capacityvoluntarily. They were now considering how this could best be done,and he expected to hear more on this point in his forthcoming talks with Mr. Dulles.In discussion some Ministers expressed the view that it wouldbe preferable to include a provision in the Treaty limiting the scale shipbuilding by the Japanese. Unlimited Japanese shipbuilding wouldhave serious effects on our own industry and, while a voluntary
limitation would go some way to meet our needs, a definite provision in the Treaty would be more acceptable. Provisions of this kind hadbeen included in the Treaty with Italy, and shipbuilding in germany had also been restricted.The balance of opinion in the Cabinet was, however, in favour of following the course proposed in paragraph 5 of CP. (51) 137. It was recognised that restrictions imposed by the Peace Treaty could not been forced effectively after a time, and that the Japanese were more likely to abide by restrictions which they had accepted voluntarily.We had been unable, owing to United States pressure, to maintain the limitations originally imposed on German shipbuilding, and theUnited States Government were not likely to agree to harsher treat-ment for the Japanese. Moreover, physical difficulties would prevent any great expansion of the Japanese shipbuilding industry for someyears to come, and in the long run treaty restrictions, even if they wereenforceable, would lead only to intensified Japanese competition inother directions. It would be unwise to attempt to include in theTreaty provisions which would be ineffective and would provokestrong Japanese resentment.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the foreign secretary should ascertain, in his forthcoming discussions withMr. Dulles, how the United States Government proposed toarrange for a voluntary acceptance by the Japanese of restrictionson the use of their shipbuilding capacity, and that he should submit a further report to the Cabinet before the details of suchan arrangement were finally settled &quot;with the United StatesGovernment.Ryukyu Islands. The Foreign Secretary said that the recommendations madein paragraph 10 (a) of CP. (51) 137 resulted from the desire of theUnited States Government to postpone a decision until they could besure whether their trusteeship of the Ryukyus and the other islands would be to their advantage strategically. Our earlier view had beenthat, in conformity with the Cairo Declaration, the Treaty should provide for Japan&apos;s renunciation of her sovereignty over the islands,but he was not disposed to press that view since the problem was almost entirely one for the United States.It was the view of the Cabinet that the Foreign secretary should attempt to ensure that the Treaty provided for a renunciation-tion of Japanese sovereignty over these islands. In his forthcoming discussions with Mr. Dulles, he should press for theinclusion in the Treaty of a provision on the lines of Article 5of the former United Kingdom draft (paragraph 1 of Annex Bto CP. (51) 137).Japanese Stocks The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he could not acceptof Gold. the proposal made in paragraph 10 (b) of CP. (51) 137.  although we might eventually have to give way on this point, he did not feelthat we had so far exerted sufficiently strong pressure on the UnitedStates Government. Western Germany, in addition to making far greater payments as reparations, had surrendered all her stocks ofgold. If Japan gave up her gold, the United States were likely to claim that they alone were entitled to receive it, but this claim wasnot sound on the German analogy (since occupation costs were thereto be repaid from the proceeds of future exports). We had given anundertaking in the House of Commons that we would try to obtainpayments by Japan, and it would be undesirable to concede the prin-ciple at this stage with respect to the Japanese gold.The Foreign Secretary said that he would gladly arrange for theChancellor of the Exchequer to put this point of view to Mr. Dulles.It was agreed that, in the forthcoming discussions with theUnited States Government, Ministers should continue to press that stocks of Japanese gold should be made available as reparations.
Japanese assets in neutral countries.ClaimsDisputes.The Cabinet agreed that, as recommended in para-graph 10 (c) of CP. (51) 137, we should not consent to theretention by Japan of her assets in neutral countries unless she were obliged to pay the Allies a sum of about $20 million to covertheir value.The recommendations in paragraph 19 (d) of CP. (51) 137were approved.Congo Basin The President of the Board of Trade said that, although heTreaties and understood that these matters would be submitted subsequently to allied the Cabinet for separate decision, he wished to emphasise the im-Property in portance of the points raised regarding the Congo Basin Treaties and japan. Allied property in Japan. Unless the Treaty provided for the termina-tion of the most-favoured-nation rights accorded to her under the congo Basin Treaties, Japan would be able to flood the markets inthe Treaty area with low-priced textiles and to inflict serious damage on our own textile industry. Article 16 of the draft Treaty providedthat the payment of compensation to Allied owners of property in japan would be made in accordance with Japanese legislation, butit would be important to examine that legislation before surrenderingour rights.Circulation The Cabinet agreed that, as recommended in paragraph 12of Joint of CP. (51) 137, the discussions with the United States Govern-United ment should proceed on the assumption that a joint UnitedKingdom/ Kingdom-United States draft of the Treaty would in due courseUnited States be circulated to the other Governments concerned. The Foreigndraft Treaty. Secretary would, however, submit a further report to the cabinet before a final decision was taken to circulate a joint draft.Timetable.Information to commonwealth,French andNetherlandsGovernments.ChineseParticipationin the Treaty.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that paragraph 13 (c) of CP. (51) 137 did not make it clear whether other commonwealth countries would take part in the discussions on the drafting of the final text of the Treaty. In order to avoid difficultieswhen the draft was referred to them for final approval, Common-wealth Governments should be brought into consultation on the textat a sufficiently early stage.It was agreed that Commonwealth Governments should be consulted on this point in order that satisfactory arrangements could be made.The Cabinet endorsed the recommendations in paragraphs16 and 17 of CP. (51) 137 regarding the information to be givento other Commonwealth Governments and to the Governmentsof France and the Netherlands.The Foreign Secretary said that the proposals explained inparagraphs 19 and 20 of his paper, which involved the participation of neither of the Chinese Governments, were based in a suggestion made by the Canadian Government. This seemed to him a promisingone and he proposed to follow it up with the United StatesGovernment.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthere was reason to think that the Indian Government might proposethat the draft Treaty should be communicated to the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment. He would discuss further with the Foreign secretary the implications of this proposal. United States approval would ofcourse have to be obtained before any communication was made tothe People&apos;s Government.It was agreed that the proposals regarding the participation of China in the Treaty should be explored as recommended inparagraphs 19 and 20 of CP. (51) 137.
Formosa. The Foreign Secretary said that the problem of dealing in theTreaty with the future of Formosa was closely related to the problemof Chinese participation. If the latter were solved on the basis whichhe had suggested he proposed that the question of Formosa should be handled on the lines indicated in paragraph 21 of his paper. Ifneither Government of China participated, the Treaty could providefor the cessation of Formosa to &quot; China,&quot; with a suspensory provision which reserved the position of the signatories on the interpretation of this clause.It was agreed that the question of Formosa should, ifpossible, be handled in the manner proposed in paragraph 21of CP. (51)137.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary, in his forthcoming conversa-tions with Mr. Dulles on the terms of a Peace Treaty for japan, to be guided by the views expressed in their discus-sion; and asked him to keep the Cabinet informed of theprogress of those conversations.Industrial 3.   The Minister of Labour said that the Road HaulageDisputes. Executive of the British Transport Commission had recently decidedRoad Haulage to extend a system of maintaining patrols for the assistance andStrike. supervision of their drivers on the road.  Five such patrols had beenoperated by the companies before nationalisation, and the Executiveproposed to bring a further eleven into operation. They had informed the Transport and General Workers&apos; Union of this decision, andhad posted explanatory notices in all their depots. * Although theUnion had raised no objection to the scheme, the men suspected thatit would be used for the detection of minor offences and, on this account, an unofficial strike had started at midnight on 27th May.The strike now affected more than a quarter of the drivers employedby the Executive and 90 per cent, of those employed in London andthe home counties; and this would cripple the Executive^ servicesinto London, since all lorries coming into London were taken overby London drivers at the outskirts of the city. If the strike continued,supplies of perishable goods would accumulate in the London docks;and, if military labour were used to clear these, there was a serious risk that the dockers would strike in sympathy.The Minister said that, in his view, the Transport and general works&apos; Union should now take the initiative in asking the road haulage Executive to postpone this extension of the patrol system for a period, during which its details could be fully discussed withrepresentatives of the men. Subject to the Cabinefs views, he pro-posed to press the General Secretary of the Union to follow thiscourse.The Cabinet endorsed the proposal made by the Minister ofLabour.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1.,29th May, 1951.
