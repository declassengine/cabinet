(51)9th conclusions cabinet 9 (51)CONCLUSIONS of a Meeting of the Cabinet held at 10 Downing Street, S.W. 1,on Friday, 26th January, 1951, at 12 noon
The Prime Minister said that there had been certain new develop-ments which might affect the decision reached by the Cabinet on theprevious evening regarding the voting on the United States resolutionnow before the First Committee of the United Nations Assembly.These concerned the two paragraphs paragraph 2 and paragraph 8 of the resolution which the United Kingdom representative had been instructed to oppose. On paragraph 2, which had described the peking Government as having rejected &quot; all United Nationsproposals &quot; for a peaceful settlement, the United States Governmentwere now understood to be ready to accept an amended wordingreferring merely to the disappointing response of the Peking Govern-ment to the proposals. If this paragraph could be amendedaccordingly, it would be sufficiently close to our own view to enable us to vote in favour of it. As regards paragraph 8, which requested the Collective Measures Committee to consider additional measuresto be taken to meet this aggression by China, an amended version had now been suggested by the Israeli delegation which reversed the orderof paragraphs 8 and 9 of the United States resolution and had theeffect of proposing, first, that the Peace Observation commission should consider ways and means of achieving a peaceful settlement and, secondly, that if those efforts failed the Collective MeasuresCommittee should then consider additional measures. This amend-ment also would go far towards meeting our point of view.Acceptance in the last resort of the principle of imposing sanctionsupon an aggressor was inherent in our membership of the united nations, and this proposal deferred the consideration of sanctionsuntil after a further effort had been made to reach a peaceful settle-ment. Sir Gladwyn Jebb had added that, although the Israeli proposalcontemplated that the Peace Observation Commission should make this further effort, the task might equally well be entrusted to theCommittee of Three proposed in the final paragraph of the UnitedStates resolution.The Cabinet agreed that, if paragraph 2 of the resolution were amended in the sense proposed, our representative could be instructedto support it. Discussion turned on the significance of the Israelisuggestion for amending paragraph 8, and on the question whether weshould support this if it proved acceptable to the United StatesGovernment.The following points were made in favour of accepting the amended version of paragraph 8, and so enabling our support to begiven to the whole resolution as thus amended:  (a) The amendment, if accepted by the United States Govern-ment, would be a considerable concession to our view on theimposition of sanctions. If on this account we could support it, and vote in favour of the resolution as a whole, this v/ould contributeimmeasurably to the maintenance of good relations with the UnitedStates, upon which the carrying out of our policy in Europe and else-where was so greatly dependent.(b) Although it had not been possible to consult him during thepast few days, the Foreign Secretary had made it clear that in his view we should not in the last resort refuse to support the UnitedStates resolution, though we should make every effort to delay adecision by the Assembly in order to secure that the resolution was more in line with our own views.(c) The majority of the older members of the Commonwealthhad made it known that they would in the last resort support theUnited States resolution. The intentions of India and Pakistan werenot certainly known; but there was no reason to suppose that our support of such an amended resolution would lead to great difficulties with India, even if she decided to vote against it or to abstain from voting. India would probably be ready to distinguish between theoriginal form of the resolution and the form it would take if this amendment were accepted.Korea.(previous reference :CM. (51) 8thConclusions,Minute 1.)
(d) Acceptance of the amendment did not commit us to theimposition of sanctions against China. We should be obliged toconsider their imposition, when all else had failed, in fulfilment of our obligations as a member of the United Nations.(e) The Minister of State said that, if the Cabinet approved theacceptance of the amendment, our first task must be to urge the UnitedStates Government to accept it. The Committee of Three was amuch more suitable body than the Peace Observation Commissionto make the final endeavour to reach a peaceful settlement, since thelatter included China. The question of Chinese representation on theCommission would become an immediate stumbling block, for theUnited States could not fail to demand that China should be repre-sented by the National Government. He wished to make it clearthat, while he personally did not feel that the difference betweenabstaining and voting against the resolution would be of any greatimportance in relation to United States public opinion, his adviserswere of the opposite opinion.The following points were made in support of the view that itwould be undesirable to agree to the amended version of paragraph 8of the resolution:  (/) The amendment of the resolution in this sense did not affectthe fundamental point that, in agreeing to it, we should be yieldingto United States pressure in opposition to our own better judgment.It was unreal to suppose that the Peking Government, who had been deprived of their rightful representation in the United Nations, wouldrespond favourably to this further attempt at mediation by a united nations Committee; and, when the attempt had failed, we should be committed to considering the imposition of sanctions, which we knewwould be either futile or dangerous. Economic sanctions againstChina would harm her less than her adversaries, and military sanctionswere liable to lead to the estrangement of the Asiatic members of theCommonwealth, if not to major war in the Far East.(g) We could not afford, for the sake of placating a publicopinion in the United States which we knew to be unreasonable, to cause a breach with the Asiatic members of the Commonwealth, whowould certainly not go so far as to consider the imposition of sanctionson China. We should continue to oppose the resolution as long asit contained any reference to sanctions.(h) Public opinion in this country was highly sensitive to anysubjection of our policy to that of the United States, and the receptiongiven to the forthcoming announcement of the increased defence programme would be strongly influenced by the Governments atti-tude towards the current discussions in the United Nations.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that thebalance of opinion in the Cabinet seemed to be in favour of supporting the proposed amendments to paragraphs 2 and 8 of the resolutionif it proved possible to secure their acceptance by the United States.If the amendments were proposed we should vote for them; and, ifthey were carried, we should vote for the resolution as a whole. Hiscolleagues would realise, however, that the situation was fluid, andthat he might find it necessary to decide at short notice howSir Gladwyn Jebb should be instructed to vote on the resolution asa whole if amendments had been made in rather different terms fromthose now under discussion. In those circumstances he must be guided by the views expressed in the Cabinefs discussions at thepresent meeting and on the previous day. The Cabinefs earlier decision to vote against the resolution in its original form need not,he thought, preclude the possibility of abstaining from voting if theresolution eventually emerged in a form different both from theoriginal version and from the amended version which the cabinet were now prepared to support.
I-70The Cabinet-(1) Invited the Minister of State to instruct the United kingdom representative at the United Nations that, if paragraph 2of the United States resolution were amended as nowproposed and if paragraph 8 were amended on the lines suggested by the Israeli delegation, he should vote infavour of both these paragraphs as so amended, and alsoin favour of the resolution as a whole.(2) Invited the Prime Minister to determine, in the light of their discussion, any further instructions which it might benecessary to send at short notice to the United kingdom representative.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,26th January, 1951.
