CABINET 48 (51)ContentsSubjectPersia   .........      ......Views of Mr. Drake.Evacuation of British Staff from the Oilfields.Military Aspects.
The Foreign Secretary said that there had been further develop-ments in the Persian situation over the week-end. The representativesof the Persian Government at Abadan were continuing and increasing their interference with the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company; the PersianGovernment had refused to allow anyone to land from the cruiserMauritius, which was remaining off the island; and the United states ambassador in Tehran was making a further effort to persuade thePersian Government to modify their intransigent attitude over theform of receipt demanded for oil loaded on tankers.Mr. Drake, the Company&apos;s General Manager in Persia, had cometo London and, if the Cabinet so desired, could give them his impres-sions of the situation in Persia. The Cabinet agreed that it would be useful to have Mr. Drake&apos;s impressions, and the Prime Minister invitedMr. Drake to join the meeting.In a general statement on the position, and in reply to questionsaddressed to him by Ministers, Mr. Drake made the followingpoints:  (a) He was convinced that it would be mistaken to follow a policyof gradually withdrawing the Company&apos;s British staff from the oilfieldsinto Abadan. This would inevitably lower the morale of the staff,which had been very high, and would lead to final surrender of theCompany&apos;s position in Persia. The British staff had been greatlyencouraged by the Foreign Secretary&apos;s message, and by what he had said in the House of Commons, and they would be willing to remain attheir posts for some time, if they could be assured that in an emergencythey would receive protection. In his opinion, they would not be ingreat danger for the time being: the Company&apos;s Persian staff wereloyal and friendly, and the Persian Government were anxious toprotect the British staff. There was, of course, some risk of an unfor-unfortunate incident; but, if their work in the oilfields was closed down by stages and the Persian employees realised that this gradual withdrawalwas jeopardising their livelihood, those of the British staff who werenot withdrawn in the early stages would be in much greater danger.(b) The wisest course, in his view, would be to abandon the policyof gradual withdrawal from the oilfields and to retain all the british staff there for the time being. In order to encourage the staff toremain, he hoped that the United Kingdom Government would allowhim to inform the British staff that they were in favour of this course.He would like to add that the Government would afford all possibleprotection to the staff as long as they remained in the oilfields., (c) It should be possible in this way to restore the morale of thestaff at the oilfields, which had been weakened by the policy of gradualevacuation. He could emphasise the Persian Government&apos;s deter-mination to protect them while they remained at their posts, but his statement would be greatly strengthened if he could add that theUnited Kingdom Government were taking steps to ensure their safetyif a general evacuation from the oilfields later became necessary,perhaps after three or four weeks.(d) He did not think it likely that there would be disturbances atthe oilfields after production had stopped (as a result of discontinuingthe flow of crude oil to the refinery at Abadan) provided that theBritish staff remained and paid the employees&apos; wages: only a small proportion of the Persian staff at the oilfields were engaged in theactual production of oil.(e) The prospect of reaching a compromise on the provision of receipts for loading oil on tankers had been lessened by the PersianGovernments decision that from 1st July onwards payment for oilloaded must be made in cash.(/) The Foreign Secretary referred to the view of the ActingConsul at Ahwaz (contained in Khorramshahr telegram to TehranNo. 199) that the morale of the British staff at the oilfields was far fromhigh, and that if they left they would refuse to return. Mr Drake saidthat he believed that morale was high and that, if he were able to persia.(previous reference:CM. (51) 47thConclusions,Minute 3.)Views ofMr. Drake.
make a statement on the lines he had suggested, it could be main-tained. He agreed with the Acting Consul about the probable resultsof gradual evacuation. When the Persian Government realised thatthe British staff were leaving, they might well place obstacles in theway of their departure.(g) If it was decided to retain the British staff at the oilfieldsfor another three or four weeks, in order to play for time, they could then leave en masse if the situation had not improved in the mean-time. If the United Kingdom Government were able to support them by military action, the Company might then continue operations in Abadan.(h) If military action to protect the oilfields was impracticable,the staff might be concentrated in two or three places in the oilfieldarea if this made their protection possible. In reply, the Chiefs ofStaff expressed the view that protection could not be effectively pro-vided in this way.(i) Mr. Drake said that he was unable to forecast how thesituation might develop during the three or four weeks&apos; respite that could be obtained by retaining the staff at the oilfields. world opinion might become stronger in our support and the international court might have given an interim decision in our favour. In his view, we should lose nothing by holding on, and we might avoid anotherwise inevitable surrender of our whole position in Persia, andsubsequently throughout the Middle East.(/&apos;) The strength of Communist influence on the Company&apos;sPersian employees must not be under-rated, and the Tudeh party would not fail to take advantage of the discontent which would result from the policy of gradual evacuation from the oilfields.(k) The Company had plans for evacuating the oilfields&apos; staffthrough the port of Bandar Mahsur. Would military support beavailable for assisting this operation? In reply, the Chiefs -of staff said that this possibility would be examined.The Prime Minister said that the Cabinet were indebted toMr. Drake for putting before them his views on the situation.Mr. Drake said that he had not been able to consult the Directors ofthe Anglo-Iranian Oil Company (A.I.O.C.) and that what he had saidrepresented his personal opinion.Mr. Drake then left the meeting.In discussing the views expressed by Mr. Drake it was agreed thatthe point for immediate decision was whether to continue the policyof withdrawing the Company&apos;s British staff from the oilfields intoAbadan as operations at the oilfields were discontinued. It was recognised that, although protection at Abadan had been plannedunder Operation &quot; Midget,&quot; we could give them no protection in the oilfields; but they might, as Mr. Drake had suggested, be exposedthrough gradual evacuation to greater dangers than through remain-ing at the oilfields for the time being and subsequently withdrawing,if this proved necessary, either to Abadan or through Bandar Mahsur.The Chiefs of Staff expressed the view that, on balance, and inview of the undoubted advantages of retaining the staff at the oilfields,the best course would be to reverse the decision on gradual evacua-tion. The Persian Government had relatively large military forcesin the area, and it was quite possible that they would be able toprotect the Company&apos;s staff. Even if it was decided to proceed witha military operation on a larger scale than &quot; Midget,&quot; we should notbe able to protect the staff at the oilfields effectively.In further discussion, the following points were made:  (/) There were now signs of some weakening in the attitude ofthe Persian Government, and a decision to leave the staff at the oilfields might again increase their unwillingness to make necessaryconcessions.   Moreover, the National Iranian Oil Company hadEvacuation ofBritish staff from the oilfields.
informed the British staff that they would not be permitted to leave for a month, and our decision might appear to have been made in response to this threat.(m) If the interim judgment of the International Court, whichmight be delivered during the present week, was in our favour, itwould probably provide for non-interference with the Company&apos;operations, and the retention of the British staff at the oilfields wouldbe in line with this policy.in) In his message to the Persian Prime Minister the foreign secretary had said that the British staff in the oilfields would be with-drawn into Abadan &quot; as and when their presence in the fields is nolonger required.&quot; Their remaining for the time being in the oilfieldswould not necessarily be inconsistent with this statement, since it was for the Company to judge how long their staff were needed in the oilfields.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the policy of graduallywithdrawing the British staff from the oilfields should be discontinuedfor the time being: the Company should be free to decide whetherstaff already withdrawn should return to the fields. If the Companydecided to make a statement through Mr. Drake to their British staffthey could say that His Majesty&apos;s Government approved the decisionto hold on for the time being, and would continue to do all theycould to protect British lives, but no statement should be made onbehalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government on this change of policy.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to advise the Anglo-Iranian oil company to discontinue the policy of gradual evacuation of the Company&apos;s British staff from the oilfields.(2) Invited the Chiefs of Staff to consider what protection couldbe afforded for the evacuation of British staff from the oilfields through Bandar Mahsur.The Cabinet considered a memorandum (CP. (51) 172) whichhad been prepared by the Chiefs of Staff, by the direction of Ministers,to show what would be involved if it were decided to mount a large-scale military operation in connection with the current dispute with Persia. The memorandum had been prepared on the assumptionthat a decision might be taken to seize Abadan Island and to hold it for an indefinite period.The First Sea Lord said that the memorandum showed the natureof the action which would have to be taken immediately if a sizeableforce had to be despatched to Persia within a period of six weeks. Ifpreparatory action were authorised forthwith, the leading elements of the force could reach Abadan about 19th August. If the force were likely to be needed by that date, the preparatory action wouldhave to be put in hand at once. Much of the planning work had beendone, and most of the remaining preparations would involve overtaction, such as the commissioning of a number of amphibious warfarecraft and the passage of legislation authorising the selective retentionof national servicemen. The call-up of Z reservists would come later.A number of other difficulties had still to be resolved, including the choice of an assembly area for the ships, having regard to the political difficulties which might arise, e.g., under the provisions of the suez canal Convention.In discussion it was pointed out that, while preparations hadbeen made for a minor military operation for the purpose of evacuating British employees of the Anglo-Iranian Oil company from Abadan, the Cabinet had not so far contemplated that anylarger operation would be mounted unless there were active Persianopposition to a rescue operation or a serious risk that the whole of persia would fall into Communist hands. . In particular, the cabinet had not hitherto contemplated the possibility that Abadan Islandmight be held indefinitely, by military force, against the present
Persian Government or some other non-Communist Government of persia. The view was expressed that such an operation might haveto be contemplated if all other hope of an acceptable outcome hadbeen abandoned and if it were felt that the ejection of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company and its British staff from Persia, possibly in circumstances gravely prejudicial to British prestige, would undermineBritish interests throughout the Middle East and in the world at large.If Abadan Island were held, the refinery could be used to refine oil from Kuwait; and possession of the refinery might place the UnitedKingdom Government in a position to negotiate a settlement with,a Persian Government which found itself in possession of the oilwells without any means of refining and transporting the oil. Suchan operation would, however, involve very grave political risks; for it might well be difficult to enlist support for it from other Common-wealth Governments or from the United States Government; and,if it were challenged in the United Nations, we might find ourselves in serious difficulties. Moreover, steps such as the embodiment of class Z reservists would be regarded in this country as implyingpreparations for a major war.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would be inexpe-dient to undertake at this stage any overt preparations for such an operation which were likely to attract publicity. The international court of Justice was expected, in the course of the present week, togive its decision on the United Kingdom application for a standstillorder pending a hearing of the main issues; and it would be unwise,in advance of this decision, to take any steps which might suggest tothe Court that the United Kingdom Government had it in mind totake the law into its own hands.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Defence to arrange for theDepartments concerned to continue the preparatory plan-ning for the military operation outlined in CP. (51) 172 onthe understanding that no preparatory action likely tobecome publicly known would be taken until after theInternational Court had given its interim decision and theCabinet had had a further opportunity to consider thepolitical implications of such an operation.Cabinet Office, SWA,2nd July, 1951.
