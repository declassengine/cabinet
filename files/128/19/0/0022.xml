175 CM. 22 (51)-   -Social Services 1. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, in framingExpenditure. his Budget, he had hoped to be able to secure economies in civil(Previous expenditure to offset the higher expenditure on defence; but, after a reference: rigorous pruning of the estimates submitted, the Vote on AccountCM. (50) 19th still showed an increase in civil expenditure. Some of the increaseConclusions, was attributable to expenditure related to the defence programmeMinute 1.)      and some to special circumstances; but there were substantial increases in a number of services, including an increase of  38 million on theSocial Services.The Chancellor said that there was a strong case for increasing therates of old-age pensions, and he had worked out a scheme of increases in consultation with the Minister of National Insurance.This would provide an increase of four shillings a week in the basic rate for men over seventy and women over sixty-five, so that singlepensioners would receive thirty shillings and a married couple fiftyshillings a week. It was also proposed that the increments payable to persons remaining at work beyond the normal retiring age shouldbe Is. 6d. (instead of Is. Od.) for every six months worked after theretiring age. A married man who remained at work until the age ofseventy would thus be entitled to a pension of  3 15s. a week. Thosewho retired at sixty-five would also be allowed to earn  2 (insteadof  1) a week without abatement of their pension. The allowance for a widowed mother with one child would be increased from33^. 6d. to 40s. Oaf. a week and there would be 2s. 6d. for eachadditional child; and 2s. 6d. a week more would be allowed for thechildren of persons receiving sickness or unemployment benefit. Itwas not proposed to increase the basic rate of war pensions, but con-cessions would be made in certain cases of hardship which would cost  500,000.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had hoped to meetthe cost of these pensions proposals by savings on other social services.After an exhaustive enquiry into possible alternatives, he had reachedthe conclusion that the only practicable source of savings was theNational Health Service. Estimated expenditure on the national health Service in the present financial year had been  393 million andactual expenditure would reach approximately that figure. For thenew financial year the Health Ministers had put forward estimatestotalling  423 million. After discussion with them, he had reluctantlycome to the conclusion that it would not be possible to reduce expenditure in the coming year below this year&apos;s figure, and theNational Health Service Committee had agreed that a figure of 393 million should be included in the Vote on Account. TheNational Health Service Committee had later considered whether1951-52 expenditure on the National Health Service could in fact beheld at  393 million and had agreed to this on the basis that savings would be found by (i) a reduction of  10 million in hospital expendi-ture, (ii) charges for dentures and for spectacles and (iii) the revival of the proposal for a shilling charge on prescription forms. Discus-sioris with other Ministers had, however, shown the difficulty of reaching full agreement on these proposals; and the Lord Privy Sealhad suggested a compromise on the basis of fixing a ceiling of 400 million for Exchequer expenditure on the National health service. On that basis it would not be necessary to proceed withthe shilling charge for prescriptions but it would be necessary to retain the proposed charges for dentures and spectacles and to secure theproposed savings in hospital expenditure. Even with these savings,hospital expenditure would be  16 million above the expenditure inthe current financial year.The Lord Privy Seal said that he did not feel that in presentcircumstances the country could afford an expenditure of more than 400 million on the National Health Service. He believed that this figure was sufficiently generous to leave scope to the Health ministers for the exercise of ingenuity in the adjustments which had to be made.He believed that public Opinion would accept charges for dentures and
spectacles, since there was a widespread impression that some abuseshad occurred in this part of the Health Service.The Minister of Health said that the reduction of  10 million on hospital expenditure would involve postponement of necessaryworks which would have to be carried out in future years. Ifthe ceiling of  400 million was to be applied to 1952-53 and future years, the revenue to be secured from a system of charges would berequired in order to prevent a falling off in the standard of hospital service. He did not feel that charges for dentures and spectacleswould be regarded as a serious infringement of the principle of a free service. Those who required them were normally at work andin a good state of general health. It was a different matter to imposecharges on people who were sick; and he would have been muchmore concerned about a charge for prescriptions. In 1949-50, asmuch as 61 per cent, of the expenditure on the dental service had been for dentures and a charge for dentures should shift the demandtowards conservation work. The Standing Dental Advisory Com-mittee had asked him to place a limit on the issue of dentures and,when asked what they had in mind, had explained that they favoured a system of charges. He could not advance any similar professionalsupport for a charge for spectacles; but, if economies had to besecured, he considered that charges for dentures and spectacles repre-sented the least harmful of the many proposals which had beenconsidered. If the Health Departments were to give effect to theproposed charges in April, they would require an immediate decisionso that the necessary preparations could be put in hand. legislation would have to be introduced as soon as possible after Budget Day,viz., on 12th April, since it would have to provide that charges should become payable on all orders placed after the Bill had been intro-duced. The printed forms and circulars would have to be prepared at once and would have to indicate 12th April as the operative date.The Secretary of State for Scotland said that, while he regretted the proposed charges, it was his view that they represented the least objectionable way of securing the economies which the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer required.The Foreign Secretary said that the Prime Minister recommended the Cabinet to accept the revised proposals now put forward by theChancellor of the Exchequer. Something must be done to relieve the hardships imposed on old age pensioners by the rising cost of living,and he believed that the Chancellor^ proposals under this head wouldbe widely supported. In view of the rising expenditure on other services, notably defence, he felt obliged to accept the Chancellorsreasoning that any concessions made to pensioners would have to bemet by economies elsewhere. He did not regard a scheme of charges for dentures and spectacles as a serious infringement of the principles for which the Government stood. Schemes of charges had been a feature of Socialist policy before the National Health Service came into existence. There should be no great difficulty in persuadingGovernment supporters in the House of Commons to endorse theseproposals. Public opinion would accept the need for them; for it was widely known that the free supply of dentures and spectacles had given rise to some abuses.The Minister of Labour said that the National Health Service hadbeen launched at a time of rising prices which had made it difficult to frame reliable estimates. Nevertheless, for the year 1950-51 it hadbeen practicable to frame an estimate which had proved to be an accurate forecast of the expenditure actually incurred. The estimatehad not been exceeded, notwithstanding the abandonment of theproposal to make a charge for prescriptions and in spite of variousWhitley awards which had increased expenditure on wages. In viewof the degree of accuracy now reached in estimating the cost of theService, he regretted the suggestion that a financial ceiling should be imposed since in a time of rising prices this was bound to have the
effect of reducing the standard of service. Moreover, he thought itdeplorable that, tor the sake of  23 million in a very large Budget, theprinciple of a free service should be abandoned and economies on thehospital service should be enforced. If a saving of  100 million hadbeen necessary, it might have been excusable to abandon the principleof a free service, though even then he would not himself have beenready to adopt such a course; but the Government were now proposing to depart from Labour Party principles for the sake of a paltry increasein revenue. He found it difficult to believe that the reasons for theproposals were entirely financial in character, since suggestions for ascheme of charges had been put forward persistently during the last three years. It would be wrong to represent the proposed scheme of charges as required to finance the scheme of increased old age pensions. The real cause was the cost of the increased defence pro-gramme; and, if the Chancellor of the Exchequer was not prepared toaccept a tolerance of a few millions in his budgeting, he should meethis difficulties by reducing defence expenditure. Shortages of rawmaterials would in any event make it impossible to spend wisely theamount now allocated for defence. Hitherto, the Government hadadhered to the view that the defence programme would not compelreductions in the social services though it would retard some desirableexpansions of those services. In Parliament a system of charges would not receive adequate support from the Governments sup-porters and the Government would be compelled to rely on Oppo-sition votes to carry these proposals. In the country at large, LabourParty propaganda would have to be revised, if the conception of a free National Health Service were no longer to be one of the principal features of their programme.The Minister of Local Government said that he did not proposeto question the Chancellors general proposition that the improvementin old age pensions must be set against the proposed charges fordentures and spectacles. On that basis he had no doubt that thebalance of national advantage lay in meeting some of the difficultieswhich faced pensioners at the present time.The Lord President and the Chancellor of the Duchy of lancaster said that they agreed with that view, and on that accountsupported the Chancellors proposals.The Secretary of State for the Colonies said that he acceptedwith reluctance the need for charges for dentures and spectacles. Thiswould involve some encroachment on the principle of a free and comprehensive Health Service, and on that account would give riseto some political difficulties. He accepted the need to limit expen-diture on the Health Service to  400 million in 1951-52; but he was concerned at the suggestion that such a limit might be maintained for some years to come. If it were rigidly enforced in a time of rising costs, further charges would have to be imposed before long. while he agreed that something should be done for old age pensioners, he hoped the Cabinet would bear it in mind that, by increasing these benefits in isolation from other benefits under the National Insurancescheme, they were depriving themselves of the argument, which had proved useful in the past, that rates of benefit could not be con-sidered separately and that anything done for old people would haveto be matched by similar concessions to the sick and the unemployed.There was a risk that further pressure would be brought to bear onthe Government for special concessions to old age pensioners, without regard to the position of other beneficiaries under the national insurance scheme.The Minister of National Insurance said that she had alwaysopposed the suggested charge for prescriptions and she was glad thatit had now been abandoned. She saw much less objection to charges for dentures and spectacles.   At the same time, one could
not ignore the fact that there was gross over-prescribing of medicinesthroughout the country and the Health Ministers would have to tackle this problem by prohibiting the prescribing of proprietarydrugs and by other means. On the question of principle, she found it difficult to reconcile the objection which was now being raised to charges for dentures and spectacles with the fact that a shilling charge for prescriptions had been authorised by the National health service (Amendment) Act, 1949. As regards old age pensioners, the3,250,000 pensioners who were not in receipt of national assistance would receive substantial benefit from the Chancellors proposals.As regards the 900,000 pensioners who received national assistance,it would admittedly be necessary to weigh the risk that any increasein pensions would be offset by a decrease in assistance and toconsider what should be done about the level of assistance in thesecases.The President of the Board of Trade said that he found itdifficult to take a final view of the Chancellor&apos;s proposals without having full information about the Budget. He agreed with theMinister of Labour that a question of principle was involved and thata free National Health Service was a symbol of the Welfare State.If the proposal for charges was accepted, it would be widely said in theUnited States and elsewhere that this country had abandoned one ofthe main principles of the Welfare State. He thought there would be difficulty in spending the amounts allocated for defence in the next financial year because of raw materials shortages and other shortages;and he would therefore have preferred to see a cut in defence expen-diture rather than a scheme of charges under the National health service.The Minister of Defence said that he could not accept the viewthat the defence estimates were inflated. Nor did he consider that expenditure on the National Health Service, whatever the level ofdefence expenditure, could be allowed to rise indefinitely without regard to what the country could afford. He believed that, even ifdefence expenditure had remained at the level of  780 million a year,it would have been necessary to consider economies in the national health Service. It had never been a free and comprehensive service in practice, since the physical resources were not available to secure this; and it had always been necessary for those who needed urgenttreatment to consider whether to take advantage of the paid facilities which were available. It was unthinkable that at the present juncturein international affairs the United Kingdom Government should endeavour to meet the serious financial difficulties with which theChancellor of the Exchequer was faced by cutting a defence pro-gramme to which the Government had pledged themselves in pur-suance of their obligations to Allied Governments.The Minister of Pensions said that, in view of the general positionof the nation&apos;s finances, he was prepared to accept the Chancellorsview that no increase could be made in the basic rates of war pensions,though some relief would be given in cases of special hardship.Other Ministers said that they could not dispute the Chancellorof the Exchequer^ general contention that he must find some savings on the social services to meet the expenditure involved in the increasedpayments to old age pensioners. While they regretted the need toimpose charges for dentures anl spectacles, they considered that these charges would be widely accepted as necessary and that the publicgood would be better served by the benefits to be given to old age pensioners.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that for the time being expenditure on the national health Service should be subject to an upper limit of 400millon.
Post Office 2.   On 19th March the Cabinet had asked the Postmaster-Charges. General to discuss further with the Chancellor of the Exchequer what(Previous        alterations should be made in Post Office charges at the present timeReference:      and to submit revised proposals to the Cabinet.   The Cabinet had. (51) 21st   now before them a further memorandum by the Postmaster-general conclusions,     (CP. (51) 90) proposing that various increases in charges amountingMinute 4.)       to  6,320,000 in the financial year 1951-52 should be announced inadvance of the Chancellor^ Budget statement, and that an announce-ment of increases in telephone rentals should be deferred pendingexamination by the Lord Presidents Committee of legislation to alter the nature of the agreement between the Postmaster-General and individual telephone users.The Postmaster-General said that, in view of rising costs and the probability that Post Office workers would receive some increase in wages under an arbitration award, he felt obliged to ask that anumber of increases in Post Office charges should be announced forth-&apos; with. He realised that, since the Commercial Accounts (as distinct from cash accounts) would show a substantial surplus, these increasesmight lead to further wage demands from the Post Office Unions.&apos; He considered, however, that by announcing the increases in two stages and holding back an announcement of the proposed increasein telephone rentals until a later date, he could base what he proposedto do on rising costs of materials rather than on an increased wagesbill.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he was in agreementwith the revised proposals put forward by the Postmaster-General.He was not seeking any further revenue from the Post Office but he wished to safeguard the revenue which he was already receiving.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that he hoped that in the increases proposed in the overseas parcels rates theexisting difference in charge between gift parcels and other parcelswould be retained.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 90 on the understandingthat every endeavour would be made to avoid relating the increases in charges which were to be announced immedi-ately to any expectation that increased wages would result from the forthcoming arbitration award.Japanese peace treaty.O^previous reference:CM. (51) 1stConclusions,Minute 4.)3. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 78) on two questions affecting the discussion of a peace Treaty for Japan (i) the problem of China&apos;s participation inthe negotiations and (ii) the disposal of Formosa.The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Governmentwere anxious to make progress towards the conclusion of a peace treaty for Japan and it was necessary to make clear to them our posi-tion on these two points- China should be a party to the negotiationsfor the Peace Treaty, and should be represented by the Central(2) Agreed that charges should be imposed for the supply ofdentures and spectacles under the National Health Service^and authorised the Health Ministers to draft the necessary legislation and to make such advance preparations as were required to bring the scheme of charges into operation on12th April.(3) Approved the proposed increases in old age pensions, allow-ances for widowed mothers and allowances in respect ofthe children of persons receiving other benefits, and theproposed concessions to certain categories of war pensioners.
People&apos;s Government and not by Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Government. Itwas possible that the Central People&apos;s Government would decline totake part in the negotiations but it could not be assumed that theywould do so. As regards Formosa he thought that the UnitedKingdom Government should suggest to the United States Govern-ment unofficially that Japan should renounce her sovereignty and cedeFormosa to &quot; China,&quot; with a reservation that this should not prejudice the attitude of the parties on the question what Chinese authority was entitled to exercise sovereignty over Formosa.In discussion emphasis was laid on the advantages of delayingfurther negotiations on the Japanese Peace Treaty., if that were prac-ticable. The United States Government might insist on chiang kai-shek -shek&apos;s Government being regarded as the de jure Government ofChina. This would undoubtedly cause great offence to some of theother members of the Commonwealth and to the Chinese populationsin Malaya and other British possessions in the East. Moreover, therewas some unreality in discussing such a treaty while the Korean con-conflict continued. Final agreement had not been reached amongCommonwealth countries about the line to be adopted in regardto a Japanese Peace Treaty and these divergencies of policy would come to light if negotiations went on. It was doubtful whether such divergencies of policy could be concealed by legal devices such as providing for Chinese participation in an accession clause of the treaty or elaborate provisions as to the time when Formosa should be cededto China.As regards procedure, it was suggested that an approach shouldbe made at the appropriate time to other Commonwealth Govern-ments, notably the Government of India, who would be in a goodposition to indicate the probable reactions of the Central People&apos;sGovernment. It might also be possible to secure a greater measure ofagreement between the Commonwealth countries if His Majesty&apos;ambassador, Washington, before approaching the State department on this subject, had consultations with other Commonwealth repre-sentatives in Washington.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that the United Kingdom Government should makeit clear to the United States Government that in their view the Central People&apos;s Government of China should beinvited to participate in any negotiations for the conclusionof a Peace Treaty for Japan.(2) Agreed that in any such Peace Treaty Japan should renounceher sovereignty over Formosa and cede it to China.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to seek means of delayingfurther proceedings for the discussion of a Japanese peace treaty; and suggested, in particular, that he should for thetime being refrain from pursuing with the United StatesGovernment the hypothetical questions raised in para-graphs 6 and 11 of CP. (51) 78.(4) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to arrange that other Commonwealth Governments were kept fully informed of any approaches made to theUnited States Government on these questions.integration of French andGerman coal and steel industries.(previous reference:CM. (50) 42ndConclusions,Minute 2.)4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 83) on certain decisions which would have to betaken by the Council of the Allied High Commission in Germany on questions arising from the outcome of the Paris negotiations on the schuman Plan.The Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign affairs said that, as a result of the Paris negotiations, the French and UnitedStates Governments, with some support from the Federal Governmentof Germany, were proposing to allow German steel concerns to own
Germany:Ownership of basic Industries.(previous reference:CM. (50) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)5. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 81) on the attitude which the United kingdom high Commissioner should adopt towards a proposal to allow thetransfer to private owners of shares in one of the new steel companies formed under the Allied High Commission Law No. 27for the reorganisation of the German coal, iron and steel industries.The Foreign Secretary said that it had been the policy of theUnited Kingdom Government that the form of ownership of basic industries in Germany was a matter for the German Government and parliament. When the matter came before the Council of the allied high Commission, the United Kingdom High Commissioner would accordingly take the line that, by Law 27 and by their own constitu-tion, the Federal Government were obliged to arrange for the bundestag to take a general decision on the ownership of these industries before any shares in the new companies passed from thehands of trustees and were sold in the Open market. If the HighCommissioner Was unable to carry the point, he would be instructedto ask for an appeal to the three Allied Governments. The UnitedKingdom Government should then re-affirm their view that the whole matter was one for decision by the German Government and parliament.The Cabinet - -Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 81.coal mines to an extent which might amount to about one-fifth of a quarter of the Ruhr coal industry. He proposed to insist that the combined ownership should take the form of holding companies, with separate subsidiaries, as proposed by the German trade unions, ratherthan completely integrated coal and steel companies as desired bythe Americans. It was also contemplated that the German CentralCoal Sales Agency should be replaced by a wider marketing organisa-tion under the Schutrtatt Plan; and it was understood that the german trade unions (who were in favour of retaining the sales agency) had reluctantly agreed to accept its abolition by stages spread over two orthree years. All these proposals represented some infringement ofLaw 27; but, if the United Kingdom Government continued to resistthem, they would be represented as impeding the introduction of theSch Urn an Plan.In discussion the Cabinet were informed that, from the point ofview of the iron and steel and coal industries of the United Kingdom,there was no serious objection to the Foreign Secretary&apos;s proposals in cp. (51) 83, The Central Sales Agency, like the marketing organisa-tion of the National Coal Board, was a means by which relativelyuneconomic mines were kept in production, and its abolition withoutreplacement might mean a reduction in European coal output.Presumably, however, the marketing arrangements contemplate under the Schuman Plan would ensure that there was no serious fallin output. Pre-war experience of German iron and steel cartels was bound to cause a certain amount of uneasiness about the ultimateeffects of the arrangements now proposed, but it was difficult to pressobjections to them if the plans ultimately adopted were acceptable to the German trade unions. It was also important that this country should not appear to be obstructing the progress of the SohumanPlan.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 83.
Korea. 6.   The Foreign Secretary said that he had been reviewing the(Previous        current situation in Korea. The United Nations forces had nowReference:      advanced to positions within a few miles of the 38th Parallel and had. (51) 18th  not met with any strong resistance.   He was inclined to think that conclusions,    the time was now ripe for some fresh initiative in seeking a politicalMinute5.)       settlement; and a heavy responsibility would rest on the UnitedKingdom Government if they let this favourable opportunity pass.One possible course might be to issue a fresh declaration of united nations aims in Korea, and to seek to open direct negotiations for asettlement between, on the one hand, the United Kingdom and theUnited States in association, perhaps, with France and India and, onthe other, the Peking Government and possibly the Soviet Govern-ment. Unless some fresh political initiative were taken, there seemedto be some risk that the United Nations Commander in Korea mightagain advance north of the 38th Parallel and seek to justify that courseon military grounds.The Minister of Defence said that the Chiefs of Staff had been consistently opposed, on strategic grounds, to any advance beyondthe 38th Parallel; and they still adhered to that view. They believedthat the sound strategic course was for the United Nations forces toestablish a stabilised line along the waist to the south of the 38thParallel, covering Seoul and Inchon.In discussion the Cabinet reaffirmed their view that, on both military and political grounds, it would be most inexpedient for theUnited Nations forces to advance north of the 38th Parallel. they also agreed that the United States Government should be left in nodoubt of the strength of the views held by the United KingdomGovernment on this point.On the question of a fresh initiative to promote a political settle-ment, there was some division of opinion in the Cabinet. some ministers thought it best that the United Nations forces should holda stabilised line to the south of the 38th Parallel and, by making no attempt to preserve contact with the Chinese and North Koreanforces, should allow the hostilities to die away. Meanwhile the search for a- political settlement could be left to the Good OfficesCommittee appointed by the United Nations. On the other hand,it was pointed out that the Good Offices Committee showed no signsof making any progress with their task; and the Peking Governmenthad made it clear that they were not prepared to have any dealings with the Committee. It seemed unsatisfactory to leave this situation to continue much longer; and there was a substantial body of opinion in the Cabinet in favour of attempting some fresh initiative. doubts were, however, expressed about the expediency of taking any course which might appear to remove from the United Nations the responsi-bility for promoting a political settlement. Account should also betaken of the influence which India might be able to exercise over the peking Government; and we should be well-advised to take the indian government fully into our confidence at every stage.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to take whatever steps were necessary to ensure that the United States Governmentwere not left in any doubt about the strength of the viewsheld by the United Kingdom Government against allow-ing United Nations forces in Korea to advance north ofthe 38th Parallel.  .(2) Took note that the Foreign Secretary would consider, in thelight of the Cabinets discussion, whether some freshinitiative to promote a political settlement in Korea could now be taken, in consultation with the United StatesGovernment and other Governments specially interestedin this problem.
EgyptAnglo-egyptian treaty.(previous reference:CM- (50) 86thConclusions,Minute 5.)7. The Foreign Secretary said that in pursuance of the cabinets decision of 14th December, 1950, the Chiefs of Staff had prepareddetailed proposals for maintaining a base and an air defence organisa-tion in Egypt and withdrawing all other troops. These proposals hadbeen considered on 19th March by the Defence Committee, who had approved them as a basis for resuming the negotiations for the revisionof the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty. He asked whether the Cabinet would wish to have an opportunity of discussing this plan before he resumedthe negotiations.After a short discussion the Cabinet agreed to consider thisquestion immediately after the Easter Recess. They also agreed thatit would be convenient if they could have before them at the sametime a general memorandum on the political problems of the middle east as a whole.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to submit, for their considera-tion immediately after the Easter Recess, a memorandum explaining the basis on which he proposed to reopen thenegotiations for the revision of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty,and a general memorandum on the political problems in theMiddle East.EconomicSurveyfor 1951.previous reference:CM. (50) 11thConclusions,Minute 6.)8. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor ofthe Exchequer (CP. (51) 77) covering a draft of the Economic survey for 1951. This draft had already been discussed in detail by the Pro-duction Committee, and various amendments would be incorporated in the text as a result of that discussion.The Cabinet Approved the draft of the Economic Survey for 1951annexed to CP. (51) 77; and invited the Chancellor of theExchequer to incorporate in the text the amendmentsapproved by the Production Committee and thereafter topresent the Survey to Parliament.Farm Price 9.   The Minister of Agriculture said that every effort had beenReview. made to reach an agreement with the representatives of the National(Previous        Farmers&apos; Union within the financial limit authorised by the cabinet reference:      on 19th March; but it was now clear that, unless there could be aCM.

The President of the National Farmers&apos; Union had given a personal undertaking that, if a further  2 million could be added in food prices, he would do his utmost to persuade the farmers to acceptthe settlement.  This additional sum would be added to the price of milk: it represented an increase of \d. a gallon.  The Minister saidthat, without such an increase, there was a serious risk of a shortageof milk in the coming winter; for, owing to rising costs, some farmers were already beginning to cull their dairy herds.  He strongly urgedthat he should be authorised to offer this additional  2 million.The Minister of Food said that he was opposed to this further increase in farm prices.The Cabinet -Authorised the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle ontheir behalf, in consultation with the Agriculture ministers and the Minister of Food, whether the Governmenfs finaloffer to the farmers for food prices in the Annual Reviewunder Part I of the Agriculture Act, 1947, could be increased from  30 million to  32 million.
Cabinet Office, SWA,22nd March, 1951.Parliament. 10.   The Home Secretary said that the Parliamentary LabourNegative        Party had been greatly encouraged by the stand which the Govern-Resoiutions.    ment had taken against the tactics of the Conservative Opposition(Previous       in tabling negative resolutions on delegated legislation as a Parlia-Reference:      mentary manoeuvre to exhaust the Government and their supporters.CM.
