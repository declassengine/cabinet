He would see what could be done to prevent Mr. SyngmanPvhee from making unhelpful statements.

It would be necessary toensure that this line remained in South Korea.In discussion it was suggested that the Foreign Secretary should consider how the services of the Indian Government might best be utilised in the present situation.The Cabinet-Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement.Persia. 3.   The Foreign Secretary said that the United States Govern-Proposed United ment had now proposed that, subject to the views of the UnitedStates Approach Kingdom Government, they should make an approach to the Persianto Persian       Government on the oil dispute through their Ambassador in Tehran.Government.    This approach would emphasise the grave anxiety of the United States(Previous        Government about the deadlock which had been reached and the reference:      harm to the Western nations and to the Persians themselves whichCM. (51) 46th   would result from a stoppage in the flow of oil from Persia.   TheConclusions,     United States Government still hoped that a way would be found to minute 1.)       continue the production and export of oil, and would suggest that,without prejudice to the rights of either party, a moratorium in thedispute should be declared for a period of sixty days.   During thisperiod production and export would be continued.   British tech-nicians would remain at their posts, the industry would be maintainedunder expert direction and special interim financial arrangements would be made.In his opinion this proposal was on the whole a promising one.If his colleagues agreed that in principle we should not oppose an approach by the United States on these lines, he would consider thedetails further and would endeavour to obtain certain modifications in it. The suggestion that British technicians should remain and thatthe industry should be carried on under expert control needed clarifi-cation: in fact, both the direction and the technical operations must remain under the control of the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. Itwould also be essential to include in the moratorium the applicationof the proposed law against satbotage, and it must be made clear that40886 b 2
the United States Ambassador in Tehran would not be empoweredto negotiate in the dispute on behalf of His Majesty&apos;s Government orthe Company.In discussion, fear was expressed lest the United States approachmight be presented to the Persian Government in a way which sug-gested that the ultimate objective was an orderly transition to Persianoperation and control. There was also the risk that agreement to a united States approach on these lines might prejudice our case inthe International Court, who were beginning the hearing of the interim application on the following day. Very great care would berequired in the handling of the approach, which must not be such asto lead the Persian Government to believe that the United States weremediating between the parties to the dispute, with the object of reaching a compromise between two opposing views. The UnitedKingdom Government had gone as far as was practicable in its recentproposals. .What the United States were now proposing was essen-tially what the Company had previously offered, namely, interimfinancial assistance pending a negotiated settlement, and it was because this reasonable offer had been rejected out of hand that the persians were now bringing upon themselves the economic effects which automatically resulted from the rejection of our offer. More-over, the so-called moratorium could only work if the Persians, inaddition to abandoning their anti-sabotage law, rescinded their demand for receipts for oil loaded at Abadan, which had led to thewithdrawal of the tankers, and ceased interfering with the working ofthe Company&apos;s oilfields and refineries. Unless the United Statesapproach took adequate account of these considerations it mightmerely strengthen the Persian Government in their intransigence.Against this it was pointed out that we had consistently soughtUnited States assistance in dealing with this difficult situation; and now that the United States Government had begun to appreciate theirdirect concern in the dispute it would be unwise to reject their initiative. We should need their help if the position deteriorated,and their intervention at this stage would greatly increase the prospectof our obtaining this help later on. If, as was not unlikely in theirpresent mood, the Persian Government refused to consider the pro-posal made to them, the attitude of the United States government towards the justice of our case would certainly become less indefinite.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the United Statesinitiative should not be discouraged. In further discussion with theUnited States Ambassador, the Foreign Secretary should, how-ever, endeavour to ensure that the United States proposals were modified so as to make it clear to the Persian Govern-ment that during the moratorium period the oil industry couldonly be carried on by the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company, and that aPersian reversal of the obstructive measures they had taken would bea pre-requisite of any interim arrangement for continuing the flow of oil. These measures included the application to the Anglo-iranian oil Company staff of the proposed law against sabotage, the demandfor an unacceptable form of receipt for oil delivered to tankers andinterference with the running of the oilfields and refineries.The Cabinet Invited the Foreign Secretary to reply to the United StatesGovernment on the lines agreed upon in the cabinets discussion.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (51) 31stConclusions,Minute 4.)4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (51) 174) covering a report on the economic situationduring March and April 1951.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that the Economic PolicyCommittee were now considering papers which he had circulated onthe present economic situation and on measures for meeting the new
difficulties with which we were faced. He might wish later to bring these questions before the Cabinet, but at present he suggested that discussion might be confined to points arising on the present paper,which he had circulated in the regular series of statistical reports.In a general discussion of the report, the following points weremade:  The fall in unemployment had continued, and on 21st May it hadbeen at the lowest level reached since September 1945. There wasalso much less under-employment and short-time working than hadbeen feared at one time, and the number of workers on short-time had fallen recently, though there were a few cases in certain industries inwhich shortages of raw materials had produced under-employment.The level of unemployment in Scotland was higher than in Englandand Wales, but was less than 2 per cent.Since Saturday working had been discontinued at the end ofMay, the output of coal had been lower than in the correspondingperiod last year, but this was due in part to the closing of Easingtoncolliery and to avoidable disputes. Efforts were being made toreduce the latter. The steady increase in consumption was the most difficult element in the situation. Consideration was being given to measures to increase man-power in the mines and to the possible need to import further coal.Steel output was limited by supplies of iron ore and scrap, and special arrangements had been made to accelerate shipments of ore,which had improved recently. Total production of steel this yearmight be nearer 16 million than 15Jr million tons, but it was unlikely to exceed the former figure.Textile output had been fairly good: the production of cottonyarn had increased slightly and exports were satisfactory. The out-put of rayon had increased in April and May owing to improvedsupplies of sulphuric acid.Building had been delayed by bad weather, and the estimated5 per cent, increase in production was not likely to be reached.Strategic stockpiles were not included in the figures given inparagraph 17 of the report, but the levels were very low. Stocks offood and feeding-stuffs gave particular cause for anxiety.The rise in import prices, retail prices and wages continued, andthe situation, while not alarming, was disquieting. Prices had nowoutrun wages and a further round of wage increases could hardly be avoided. Domestic consumption continued to expand, and personalsavings were being drawn upon increasingly.Our external balance of payments would be much less favourable than had been hoped some months ago, for the reasons given inparagraph 39 of the report. At best there would be no more than avery small surplus in the gold and dollar account of the whole sterling area, and there was a danger of dollar payments to countries outsidethe sterling area which accumulated a surplus of sterling. We mightbe roughly in balance in the European Payments Union: theGerman position in the Union had considerably improved, and she might repay shortly the special credit she had received earlier in theyear.The Cabinet-Took note of CP. (51) 174.ssaSe      5.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Secretary of with State for Commonwealth Relations (CP, (51) 178) indicating the lines on which he proposed to discuss with the Acting High Commissionerfor Australia the proposal not to renew the Assisted Passage Agree-ment with Australia.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said thatthe existing Agreement had expired on 30th March, 1951, but that, in
accordance with the views which the Cabinet had expressed on 18thDecember, 1950, it had been extended for six months, so as to give time for discussions with the Australian Government. Havingregard to the burden of defence, the case for ending the exchequer contribution to passages to Australia was now stronger than before.Financial assistance was not given for emigration to other Common-wealth countries, and the arrangement was, therefore, anomalous.The Canadian High Commissioner had recently indicated that hisGovernment wished to discuss the question of encouraging emigra-tion from the United Kingdom to Canada.The general view of the Cabinet was that, while it was desirableto encourage the emigration of suitable persons from this country toAustralia, reliance should be placed on other means than assistedpassages, though admittedly these other means would not give soclose a control over emigration.The Cabinet Approved the manner in which the Secretary of State for commonwealth Relations proposed to explain the refusal to extend the Assisted Passage Agreement to the ActingHigh Commissioner for Australia, as summarised in para-graph 5 of CP. (51) 178.Equal Pay.Discussion atInternationalLabourConference,1951.(previous reference :CM. (51) 40thConclusions,Minute 6.)6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Labour (CP. (51) 181) on the attitude which the UnitedKingdom Government delegate should adopt at various stages in thediscussion of the draft Convention on Equal Pay at the InternationalLabour Conference.The Minister of Labour said that the course of events at theConference had shown that it would almost certainly be impossibleto prevent the draft Convention from coming before the plenary session for final vote. The main question for consideration was,therefore, whether the Government delegate should vote against thedraft Convention, or, as he recommended, should abstain.The general view of the Cabinet was that a vote given against thedraft Convention at the final stage would be open to the miscon-struction that the United Kingdom Government were opposed to theprinciple of equal pay. While abstaining, the United KingdomGovernment delegate should make it clear that the Government^policy was as stated by the Chancellor of the Exchequer in the Houseof Commons on 20th June, 1951.The Cabinet  :Agreed that in the final vote on the draft Convention on equal Pay, in the Plenary Session of the InternationalLabour Conference, the United Kingdom government delegates should abstain from voting.Japanese peace treaty.(previous reference :CM. (51) 45thConclusions,Minute 9.)7. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 175) seeking approval for the draft of the covering memorandum to be used in communicating the draft Japanese peace treaty to the Governments of the Powers principally concerned, andoutlining the procedure which it was proposed to adopt.The Foreign Secretary said that he had confirmed with the state department that the reference to &quot; the Far Eastern CommissionPowers &quot; was not intended to include Nationalist China.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 175.
Cabinet Office, SWA,2Sth June, 1951.United Nations.       8.   The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignPanel of Field   Secretary (CP. (51) 159) referring to a decision of the Fourth SessionObservers.       of the General Assembly of the United Nations to set up a panel offield observers and proposing that the Government should agree tocontribute United Kingdom observers to the panel, provided thatcertain conditions were fulfilled.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that there were certain points about the remuneration of observers which the treasury would wish to discuss further with the Service Departments.Attention was drawn to the desirability of insisting on the con-dition set out in paragraph 6 (c) of the memorandum that the Govern-ment could not guarantee that any particular observer would be freewhen the secretary general asked for him. This condition mightbe important in any dispute concerning a Commonwealth country.The Cabinet Approved the proposals in CP. (51) 159, subject to thesettlement of outstanding financial questions between theChancellor of the Exchequer and the Service Ministers.
