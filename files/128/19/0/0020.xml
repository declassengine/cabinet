The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.On 20th March the House was to discuss the method of selection of Standing Committees. It was agreed that the Home Secretary-should speak on the Governmenfs behalf in this debate.On 21st March there would be a debate on the Report of theCouncil of Wales. It was understood that this would be concernedmainly with agricultural questions; and it was agreed that the Ministerof Agriculture should reply to the debate on the Governmenfsbehalf.On 21st March the House would also debate a motion by Mr. S.Silverman, M.P., proposing that the Committee of Privileges should consider the conduct of Mr. J. Rodgers, M.P., in forwarding to the bishop of the diocese a letter which he had received from a vicar inhis constituency. There was room for differences of opinion on thequestion whether Mr. Rodgers&apos;s action constituted a breach of privilege; but the division on 21st March would relate solely to thequestion whether the matter merited investigation by the Committeeof Privileges. Among Government supporters there was a strongbody of opinion in favour of such an investigation. It was true thatthe Speaker had ruled that there was no prima facie case for investiga-tion; but this ruling did not preclude the House from referring thematter to the Committee. Moveover, the tradition that members ofthe Government should normally uphold a ruling by the Speaker didnot apply to matters of this kind, and there was no reason why mem-bers of the Government should not feel free to vote in favour of Mr.Silverman&apos;s motion.The Cabinet were informed that in the Committee stage of theReserve and Auxiliary Forces (Training) Bill in the House of Lordstwo amendments tabled by the Conservative Opposition were likelyto be pressed to a division.The first of these would extend to volunteer members of theTerritorial and Auxiliary Forces the same statutory protection againstloss of employment or holidays as was to be given to the Class Zreservists. In discussion it was pointed out that the concessionsvoluntarily made by employers to members of the Auxiliary forces were more flexible, and often more generous, than those required under the Bill. It was the view of the Territorial Army advisers atthe War Office that the extension of this statutory protection to mem-bers of the Auxiliary Forces was likely to do more harm than good;and this view was shared by the representatives of workers and employers on the National Joint Advisory Council.The second amendment would delete the provision enabling thenew Act to be applied, by Order in Council, in any of the three yearsfollowing 1951. In discussion it was agreed that it was not possibleto foresee at this stage whether training of selected reservists would berequired in the remaining years of the rearmament programme, andthat in these circumstance it was reasonable to take power to apply the Act in any of those years.The Cabinet agreed that no concession should be made to theConservative Opposition in the House of Lords on either of these twoamendments to the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Training) Bill.The Cabinet were informed that it would not now be possibleto present, before the Easter Recess, a White Paper announcing thefurther appointments to be made in the North &quot;Atlantic command organisation. The Conservative Opposition were content that dis-cussion of this question in the House of Commons should be post-poned until after the Recess. In these circumstances it was agreedthat, if the matter were raised in supplementary questions on theStatement on Business that day, the Home Secretary should contenthimself with saving that the appointments were not yet completed and that it would be premature&quot; for the House to hold any further discussion of any of them until they could be considered as a whole.
Receipts and 3.   The Minister of Transport said that, in the light of theExpenditure of Cabinefs decisions of 12th March, he had discussed the finances ofthe British       the British Transport Commission with the Chairman of the Commis-Transport       sion and subsequently with the Chancellor of the Exchequer.   TheCommission.    Chairman of the Commission had agreed that railway monthly return(Previous        fares should not be increased at this juncture, but he had stressed the reference:      need for proceeding with the application to the Transport TribunalCM. (51) 19th   for charges schemes under Part V of the Transport Act for main-lineConclusions,    railway fares and London fares.   In their proposals to the TribunalMinute 4/*       the Commission would be bound to ask for a level of fares whichwould enable them to meet current losses on their operations as aWhole and go some way to clear off the accumulated deficit of  40million.   It could not be assumed that the Tribunal would acceptthe Commission^ proposals in full: the scheme of London fares in1950 had been substantially modified by the Tribunal.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that, under the transport act, 1947, the responsibility for putting charges schemes to the Trans-port Tribunal rested with the commission. The Minister might press the Commission to modify proposals which they were proposing toput to the Tribunal, but the Act did not contemplate that the minister would come between the Commission and the Tribunal. Since theCabinet&apos;s last meeting he had ascertained that any transfer to theExchequer of costs which could more fairly be placed on the State thanon the Commission was not likely to amount to more than  2 or  3 million a year. The Commission were therefore faced with a sub-stantial deficit on current operation, together with an accumulated deficit amounting to  40 million, and it seemed wrong to attempt to dissuade them from endeavouring to rectify their financial position byan approach to the Tribunal. Though the matter was exceedinglytechnical and complicated, he still thought that the Commission were proposing to raise too high a proportion of the extra revenue from london passenger traffic. But in this matter, and in their charges scheme for main-line railway fares, the Commission doubtless felt thatthe Tribunal were unlikely to meet their full demand and they were accordingly not seeking to minimise their demands at this stage.Council of 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that the Committee of MinistersEurope. of the Council of Europe, at their meeting in Paris later in the week,(Previous        would be considering an application from the Federal Republic ofReference:      Germany for admission to full membership of the Council.   He wasCM. (51) 19th   inclined to think that the time had now come when the Germans mightConclusions,     become full members of the Council, which they already attended asMinute5.)       observers; and it was possible that the French might now be willingAdmission of    *0 a8ree to their admission.   On the other hand, the Soviet Govern-Germany        ment might well take exception to this step, especially as it wouldmean that members of the West German Government would in formbe admitted as representatives of &quot; Germany &quot;; and, as a matter of timing, it might be inexpedient to make this move before the pre-liminary arrangements for the holding of a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers had been successfully concluded.   Though theapplication of the German Government should be sympatheticallyreceived, it might be preferable that decision on it should be post-poned until the next meeting of the Council of Europe in May.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Foreign Secretary should urge the Committeeof Ministers of the Council of Europe, at their forthcoming meeting, to postpone until the next meeting of the Councilconsideration of the application of the Federal Republic ofGermany for admission to full membership of the Council.
In discussion the following points were made :  (a) Several Ministers considered that further increases in railwayfares and charges would have the effect of driving traffic on to theroads, where passenger traffic would be handled by coach-companies and goods traffic by &quot; C &quot; licence holders who were operating in competition with the British Transport Commission. Were the Corn-mission taking a sufficiently far-sighted view of the effects of their proposals, or were they simply taking short-term measures to meetcurrent financial difficulties? The Cabinet ought to have a carefullyprepared appreciation of the transfer of traffic from the railways to theroads over the past few years in order that decisions might be takenin the light of long-term trends. It might be necessary to treat therailways as a public service, financed in part from the Exchequer, oiat least to make a substantial Exchequer contribution towards thecost of upkeep of the permanent way. In reply, it was stated that,while the Commission saw no prospect of the railways paying their way until substantial capital works, including main-line electrification,had been undertaken, they had hoped to reach a balance on the opera-tion of their undertaking as a whole, as a result of the increased charges authorised in 1950. These hopes had been falsified by theincrease in railwaymen&apos;s wages granted by the Railway Executive,under pressure from the Government and in excess of what theExecutive would have been prepared to give on strictly commercial considerations, and by the rising costs of all materials, including coal,steel and timber. Railway fares and charges had not risen as muchas other prices; and some Ministers thought it mistaken to assume that moderate increases in fares and charges would drive to the roadsa substantial proportion of the traffic which at present went by rail.This was borne out by experience of the increases in railway freight charges authorised in 1950, since the reduction in traffic had not been as great as the Railway Executive had expected. Railway traffic was substantially greater than before the war. Moreover, as had been pointed out when the Cabinet discussed the matter on 25th April,1950, there was reason to suppose that, even when integration was completed, the road services would not be sufficiently remunerative tomeet the deficit on railway operation. At present the British Trans-port Commission were making no profit on road haulage, and theirprofits from the whole of their undertaking other than railways onlyamounted to  3 million a year. Whatever might have been the posi-tion before the war, road transport was not now being subsidised bythe State, since on balance road transport made a substantial contribu-tion to the Exchequer over and above the sums required for road maintenance.(b) The Cabinet, at their meeting on 12th March, had authorised the Minister of Transport to increase railway freight charges by 10 per cent, and it was calculated that this would yield  20million a year. If, in addition, there was a transfer of some financialresponsibilities from the Commission to the Exchequer in respect of matters, such as cheap travel for members of the Services, where theburden should fall on the State, and the Commission received between 2 and  3 million from this source, these two measures would go along way to meet the deficit of  25 million on the current operation ofthe railways. The balance should be met by economies in operation;and, in view of the large size of the Commission^ reserve funds, the accumulated deficit of  40 million could be borne by the Commissionuntil such time as permanent arrangements could be made in respectof it. On the other hand, it was pointed out that the commission could not shut their eyes to the substantial rise in costs which was taking place and was bound in the course of the coming year toincrease still further their deficit on current operation. TheCommis-sion were drawing heavily on their reserves and expected to be borrow-ing money in the market in the autumn. Moreover, the oresent didnot seem to be an appropriate time for any Government contribution towards liquidating the accumulated deficit, since any such assistance,
no matter how disguised, would be represented as a subsidy in respectof the recent increase in railwaymen&apos;s wages. The British transport commission should be able to compete with other transport operators,and the commercial considerations which should guide the conduct oftheir operations would be lost sight of if, at this juncture, anything inthe way of a Government subsidy were paid to the Commission.(c) The courses open to the Government and to the commission were largely determined by the provisions of the Transport Act, which provided that charges schemes should be approved by the transport tribunal and left little scope for direct Government intervention. Thisstatutory machinery had been devised in the light of the precedent ofthe Railway Rates Tribunal. There was an element of arbitrarinessin the distribution of the burden of costs between different categories of transport users, and it had seemed best for the final decision onfares and charges to rest with a semi-judicial body, before whom thedifferent classes of consumers could state their case. It would, how-ever, be unfortunate if the Commission got into the habit of puttingexcessive claims before the Transptort Tribunal, in the belief that thenecessary increases in charges would be given as a compromise between the interests of the Commission and of their customers. Apublic authority ought not to over-state its case in this way. More-over, the public at large could not be expected to distinguish betweenthe Government and the Commission; and, while the Tribunal were taking evidence in public from interested parties, the odium of thedemands for large increases in fares would fall on the Government.In these circumstances the Commission should be pressed to makeminimum demands in the schemes which they placed before theTribunal.(d) When the Transport Act had been passed, it had been widely recognised that the railways were unlikely to be able to pay their way,but it had been hoped that the Commission would be able to balancetheir accounts from the profits derived from their road undertakings.This hope had been falsified, at any rate for the time being, since inthe present Parliamentary situation it was impossible to carry throughany area road-transport schemes. Local authorities, restive as theresult of the loss of their other trading concerns, were strongly opposedto the transfer of road passenger undertakings to the Commission andthere was little prospect of securing the passage of schemes throughboth Houses. If this situation were to last indefinitely, a case could bemade out for Government assistance in respect of the railways inorder to make it possible for the British Transport Commission to pay their way.(e) It was wrong that the British Transport Commission should endeavour to offset higher costs almost entirely by increasing fares and charges. A substantial proportion of these higher costs should bemet by economies. So long as there was a substantial deficit on railway operation, the workers could not be expected to co-operate ineffecting economies which seemed unlikely to bridge the gap; but, ifthe Commission were left with a small deficit rather than a small sur-plus, as a result of increased fares and charges, there would be a greaterincentive for the Railway Executive and the unions to effect economies.At the same time the financial savings which could be secured by thesemeans, and the rate at which they could be secured, should not be over-estimated. A good many economies had already been made; forexample, there had been a reduction of staff amounting to 50,000. Asto the future, unless the railway undertaking was now extremelyinefficient, economies could not be expected to yield an annual saving of more than about 2\ per cent, on current costs; and experience inthe early operation of the London Passenger Transport Board sug-gested that it would take several years to carry through any schemeof reorganisation with a view to securing cheaper and more efficientoperation.The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he believed that theviews which had been expressed in the Cabinefs discussion would
best be met if the British Transport Commission were authorised, inthe case of London fares, to put before the Tribunal proposals whichwould yield between  4 and  5 million a year, instead of the 11 million which they had contemplated. There would have to be asimilar scaling-down of their demands in respect of main-line railwayfares. This would enable the Commission to make some small pro-vision for rising operating costs, while at the same time leaving themwith a substantial sum which would have to be met by economies inoperation.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of Transport, in consultation with theChancellor of the Exchequer, to bring before the Cabinet attheir next meeting revised proposals regarding the chargesschemes which the British Transport Commission should put before the Transport Tribunal for main-line railway fares and london fares.Cabinet Office, S.W.1,\5th March, 1951.
