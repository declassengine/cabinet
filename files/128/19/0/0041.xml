Japanese peace treaty.(previous reference :CM. (51) 38thConclusions,Minute 2.)japanese rearmament.ChineseParticipation.1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 155) reporting the progress of the discussions withMr. Foster Dulles on the provisions of the draft Peace Treaty for japan.The Foreign Secretary said that the Minister of State washandling the detailed discussions, but Mr. Dulles had also seen thePrime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer and himself. Onthe whole he felt that Mr. Dulles was adopting a reasonable attitude,and it was greatly to be hoped that agreement could be reached onall the outstanding points before he left London at the end of theweek. We must keep in mind the possibility that, if we could not reach agreement with them, the United States Government might go forward without us. This would have most damaging effects on our future relations with Japan and on our prestige in the Far East.The Cabinet proceeded to consider the outstanding points raised in the Foreign Secretary&apos;s paper.The United States Government were unwilling to agree to theinclusion in the Treaty of provisions limiting the Japanese right torearm. Mr. Dulles had, however, given full particulars (described in annex A to the paper) of the safeguards which the United Statesproposed to provide through their bilateral security pact with japan and otherwise. He had also given a full explanation of the difficultieswhich stood in the way of omitting from the treaty the recognition(in Article 6 (b)) of Japan&apos;s right of self-defence and her right to enterinto collective security arrangements; but he had proposed that,subject to the agreement of his Government, this article should be slightly amended to meet our view, in the way shown in Annex C tothe paper.It was the general view of the Cabinet that, if the United StatesGovernment were to make a statement on the lines proposed inparagraph 4 (c) of the memorandum, we should acquiesce in the omission from the treaty of provisions limiting Japan&apos;s rearmament.The Cabinet  ,(1) Endorsed the recommendations on Japanese rearmamentmade in paragraph 4 of CP. (51) 155.Mr. Dulles had made three alternative proposals, given inparagraph 6 (a), (b) and (c) of the memorandum, to meet the diffi-culties over Chinese participation in the Treaty. The foreign secretary said that he had felt bound to reject the proposal that bothChinese Governments should be invited to sign the Treaty, and theproposal that the Treaty should take the form of a series of bilateralpacts. He thought, however, that Mr. Dulles&apos;s third proposal mightbe accepted in the last resort if we were unable to persuade the UnitedStates Government to accept our own proposal. It did not providefor signature by either Chinese Government, nor did it include a clause enabling the Chinese to accede to the treaty later. Instead, it provided for an agreed announcement that neither Chinese Govern-ment had participated in the treaty, and it would leave Japan free to solve the problem of her relations with China in whatever mannershe preferred as soon as she had resumed her full sovereignty.There was general agreement that neither of Mr. Dulles&apos;s first two proposals would be acceptable. As. regards the third, it waspointed out that if Japan were left nominally free to make her own arrangements with China, she would be more likely, while under united States tutelage, to enter into relations with the ChineseNationalist Government. We should in that event have reached aposition in which, by agreeing to the Treaty, we should have facilitatedJapan&apos;s recognition of the Nationalist Government of China and ineffect yielded to the United States demand that that Governmentshould participate in the Treaty. In reply, it was pointed out thatany treaty subsequently concluded by Japan with either ChineseGovernment would be entirely separate from the multilateral Peace40768-2B 2
Treaty, and that in any event Japan would be free, once she hadregained her sovereignty, to conclude treaties as she wished.It was the general view of the Cabinet that a compromise on thelines described in paragraph 6 (c) of the paper would be unsatisfactory,and that further pressure should be brought to bear on the UnitedStates Government to accept our own proposal. We must ensurethat the question of Chinese participation in the Treaty was kepteffectively in abeyance for the time being; and it should be possible,in order to achieve this, to insert in the Treaty a provision limitingJapan&apos;s right to conclude with China,any treaty in the nature of a peace settlement until some more general agreement about Chineseparticipation had been secured among the signatories of the multi-lateral treaty.The Cabinet -(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary, in further discussions withMr. Dulles, to press for a solution of the problem of chinese participation in the Treaty on the lines of theproposals in paragraphs 18 toi20 of CP. (51) 137.Formosa. The Foreign Secretary said that Mr. Dulles had been unwilling to accept our proposal that the Treaty should provide for the cession of Formosa to &quot; China,&quot; with a suspensory provision reserving theposition of the signatories on the interpretation of the clause.Mr. Dulles wished to provide simply for Japan&apos;s renunciation of hersovereignty over the island. This was not entirely satisfactory, but itwould involve no sacrifice, of principle, and, if we were able to obtainUnited States agreement to our proposal on Chinese participation inthe Treaty, and an agreed announcement was made about bothmatters, our objective would have -been substantially achieved, in thatthe disposal of Formosa would have been left open for settlement ata later date, when more general agreement should be obtainable.In discussion attention was drawn to the provision of the CairoDeclaration that Formosa should be restored to China. This received no recognition in the formula now put forward by the United States.Moreover, the Indian Government had stated that they would be unable to sign a Treaty which did not provide for the cession of formosa to China. It was the general view of the Cabinet, however,that if the United States proved willing to accept our proposal forChinese participation, we should meet them over Formosa, providedthat a joint announcement made it clear that a decision on theultimate disposal of the island would be postponed until more generalagreement could be obtained.The Cabinet (3) Agreed that the United States proposals on the disposal of formosa should be approved, provided that United Statesagreement was obtained to our proposals about the participation of China in the Treaty.Kurile Islands The Minister of State said that the United States administration and South now saw difficulty in the proposal that the Kuriles and South SakhalinSakhalin. should be ceded to Russia, since another clause of the Treaty providedthat a State which did not sign the Treaty could not receive anybenefits under it. The effect might be to leave the territories underJapanese sovereignty. They were occupied by Russia, and Russiaconsidered that she already had a full title to them. It was, therefore,proposed that the Treaty should not go further than to provide that japan renounced her sovereignty over these territories.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the draft Treaty should provide that Japanrenounced her sovereignty over the &quot;Kuriles and SouthSakhalin.
Ryukyu Islands. The Cabinet had agreed on 19th May that an effort should bemade to ensure that the Treaty provided for a renunciation of japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands.The Minister of State said that the islands were at present occupied by the United States, who intended to maintain militaryforces in them. The United States Government considered, however,that it would be difficult to secure a United Nations trusteeship overthem, and in any event did not wish to be committed to permanentresponsibility for them. They therefore desired to leave the islandsunder Japanese sovereignty and to make separate arrangements with japan for continued American military occupation.The Cabinet were informed that the Government of India would oppose any suggestion that there should be a United Nations trustee-ship and would, therefore, support the United States proposal, though they could not be expected to view with favour continued american military occupation.The Cabinet-(5) Agreed that no objection need be taken to the maintenanceof Japanese sovereignty over the Ryukyu Islands.Shipbuilding The question whether the United Kingdom Government shouldcapacity. press for the inclusion in the Treaty of a provision limiting Japaneseshipbuilding, or should rely on understandings on this point outsidethe Treaty, should remain open until further information was available about the discussions on this subject which were now inprogress in Tokyo.The Cabinet (6) Agreed to defer a decision about the manner in whichJapanese shipbuilding would be controlled until furtherinformation was received about the course of the current discussions in Tokyo.Japanese Stocks The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had discussed withof Gold. Mr. Dulles the disposal of the Japanese gold reserve which was nowin American hands. Mr. Dulles took the view that the United StatesSenate would not be prepared to agree to the gold being dividedamong the Allies at a time when the United States were continuing togive financial assistance to Japan. In any event, in Mr. Dulles&apos;s view,the gold would be required for Japanese commercial operations andto prevent a deterioration in Japanese living conditions which might lead to a growth in Communism. He (the Chancellor of theExchequer) had drawn attention to the inconsistency between thepolicy thus proposed for Japan and that followed in respect ofGermany. He had explained that it would be difficult to secure acceptance in this country of a treaty which was in other respectsgenerous to Japan if gold, which might have been applied to alleviate the effects of damage done by Japan, were returned to that country.If the gold were divided between the Allied Powers, this country would not receive a large share. Rather than see it returned to Japan,the United Kingdom Government should urge the United StatesGovernment to continue to hold it, possibly as a temporary measure,pending a future settlement. This was not, however, a point on whichthe Government should break with the United States Government,particularly if they were prepared to meet the United Kingdom pointof view about Chinese participation in the Treaty.In discussion it was suggested that, so long as the Treatycontained some general recognition of Japanese liability to givereparation for the injury she had done and Japanese assets in othercountries were applied to alleviate distress, then the return of the gold to Japan might have to be accepted.
The Cabinet-(7) Decided that the United States Government should continueto be pressed to agree that Japan should not be allowed toretain her gold reserves; but agreed that in the last resortthis point should be conceded if other concessions weremade to the United Kingdom point of view.Japanese rights The President of the Board of Trade said that, under a treaty in Congo of 1885 and the Peace Treaties of 1919, Japan had a privilegedBasin. position in regard to trade in the Congo Basin.   This would be restored to her if a Peace Treaty were concluded in the form favoured by the United States Government. Japan could then flood the CongoBasin with cheap textiles to the serious detriment of the lancashire cotton industry. He accordingly proposed that Japan should not beallowed to recover her rights under the 1919 Treaty and should not even have the most-favoured-nation rights which she had enjoyed,with other nations, under the earlier Treaty.The Cabinet were informed that the Canadian and australian government were likely to urge that Japan should not enjoy most-favoured-nation treatment after the conclusion of the Peace Treaty,and they were therefore likely to support a stand against the restora-tion of Japanese rights in the Congo Basin.The Cabinet (8) Agreed that in further discussions with Mr. Dulles theobjections to the restoration of Japanese rights in the congo Basin should be strongly pressed.Germany. 2.   The Cabinet had before them two drafts of a reply to theSoviet Proposal latest note from the Soviet Government regarding the proposed for a Meeting meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers. The first of these, which of Foreign was embodied in Foreign Office telegram to Paris No. 85 of 6th June,Ministers. was an outline of a draft reply prepared under the Foreign Secretary&apos;s(Previous instructions in London. The second, which was embodied in ParisReference: telegram No. 143 of 6th June, was a draft prepared in Paris by the cm. (51) 40th Deputies to the Foreign Ministers of the three Western Powers.Conclusions, It.was the general view of the Cabinet that the draft prepared by minute 3.) the Deputies in Paris was too legalistic in tone, and on that accountwas unlikely to produce the impact which the Cabinet wished to make on public opinion in this country. Ministers agreed that the effect which they were anxious to produce was more likely to be obtained by a reply on the lines of the draft embodied in Foreign office telegram No. 85 of 6th June.In discussion of this draft the following points were made:  (a) In the fifth paragraph of the draft reference was made to the underlying causes of the present state of international tension. Itwould be preferable that the reply should indicate more clearly whatthese were. It should be plainly stated that the present international difficulties were due to the unco-operative attitude of the SovietGovernment, which had prevented the United Nations from becomingan effective instrument for the preservation of world peaec. Thispoint might perhaps be made in the second paragraph of the draft,where it could be stated as the justification for the conclusion of theNorth Atlantic Treaty.(b) The second paragraph of the draft might also be strengthened by enlarging upon the purposes and objectives of the North atlantic treaty.(c) In the fourth paragraph of the draft it might be stated thatthe Soviet Government had at no time suggested that the measures
which they had promoted in Eastern Europe would be &quot; admissiblesubjects for the agenda&quot; of a meeting of the Council of foreign ministers. And, at the end of that paragraph, a sentence might beadded to the effect that, if the question of the North Atlantic Treatywere placed on the agenda, His Majesty&apos;s Government would alsowish to add to it the Soviet action and policies mentioned earlier inthe paragraph.(d) The Foreign Secretary said that, if the three Western powers could agree upon the substance of the reply to be returned to theSoviet note, it might be preferable that they should each sendsimultaneous, but not identical replies. This would leave each government free to frame the arguments in the manner most likelyto appeal to public opinion in their own country. The Cabinet were inclined to favour this course; and the Foreign Secretary said that hewould see whether it would be acceptable to the French and UnitedStates Governments.The Cabinet-Subject to further consideration of the amendments suggested in paragraphs (a) to (c) above, agreed that the reply to the Soviet note should follow the general lines ofthe draft embodied in Foreign Office telegram to ParisNo. 85 of 6th June; and invited the Foreign Secretary tomake further attempts to secure the agreement of the UnitedStates and French Governments to the despatch of a reply on those lines.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1th June, 1951.
