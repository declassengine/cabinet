Service Courts-Martial.(previous reference:CM. (50) 77thConclusions,Minute 6.)1. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofDefence (CP. (51) 21) on the questions of policy (other than thecreation of a Courts-Martial Appeal Court) arising out of the recom-mendations of the Lewis and Pilcher Committees on court-martialprocedure.The Minister of Defence said that, apart from the creation of aCourts-Martial Appeal Court, which was the subject of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Bill, there were three major issues arising out of the lewis and Pilcher reports. First, the Lewis Committee, but not thePilcher Committee, had recommended that, in serious cases, generaland district courts-martial should have a civilian president. TheDefence Ministers, with the agreement of the Lord Chancellor and theLaw Officers, advised against the acceptance of this recommendation.Secondly, the Lewis Committee and a minority of the Pilcher Com-mittee had recommended that a court-martial should be unanimous in its findings. This would be impracticable in war, and even in peacewould be difficult in overseas stations, and it was proposed to rejectthis recommendation. Thirdly, one member of the Lewis Committeehad proposed &quot; other rank &quot; representation on courts-martial, and theSecretary of State for Air favoured this proposal. The defence ministers as a whole were, however, doubtful whether this wouldprovide any real safeguard for an accused person and they recom-mended that the existing procedure should be maintained.When the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Bill came under discussion in Parliament, there would be pressure for an indication of the Gov-governments views on these issues and on a number of minor recom-mendations made by the two Committees. The Minister suggestedthat a White Paper should be prepared, but that its publication shouldbe postponed until after the Second Reading of the Bill, by which time the general trend of opinion in the House of Commons wouldhave become clear.The Cabinet agreed that it was undesirable to adopt the recom-mendation that a civilian lawyer should preside over courts-martial.In time of peace the number of general courts-martial was relatively small and they were concerned primarily with disciplinary issues.There was no serious criticism in the Services of the fact that membership of the court was drawn exclusively from the Services.The Cabinet also endorsed the proposal to reject the recom-mendation that the findings of courts-martial should be unanimous.To a considerable extent this proposal depended on the earlier sug-gestion that there should be a civilian president, and rejection of theone proposal involved the rejection of the other. The members of courts-martial should be regarded rather as magistrates in Petty orQuarter Sessions than as members of a jury: and, even if the analogy of a jury were applied, it should be borne in mind that majorityverdicts had always been accepted in Scotland. This and other pro-cedural questions might have to be examined afresh after the Courts-Martial Appeal Court had been operating for some time.Against the representation of non-commissioned ranks on courts-martial, it was pointed out that, apart from one member of the lewis committee, both the Lewis and Pilcher Committees had been infavour of a continuance of the present system. There was no indication of any general desire for a change of this kind amongnon-commissioned ranks; and, in practice, representatives of non-commissioned ranks might tend to be harsher in their judgments-thanofficers. If a court-martial gave an unpopular verdict, any repre-sentative of non-commissioned ranks might find himself in an embarrassing position, particularly on a small ship. As the juniormember of the court he would be expected to give his opinion first,and this would be a difficult position in which to place him.In favour of this recommendation, it was argued that in theUnited States Forces an accused person could ask for someone of hisown rank to be a member of the court, and it was understood that thissystem had worked smoothly and well.   Most of the administrative
tribunals set up by recent statutes in this country contained arepresentative of the branch of the profession to which any personbrought before them belonged, and this would be quoted against theGovernment if they refused &quot; other rank &quot; representation on courts-martial. Under a system of National Service, there was no reasonto believe that &quot; other ranks &quot; representatives would fail to make a useful contribution to the work of courts-martial.The general view of the Cabinet was that an arrangement bywhich an accused person would have an option to demand that some-one of his own rank should serve on the court-martial merited further examination in the light of such information as was available aboutUnited States practice.The view was expressed that, when the Cabinet had taken afinal decision on &quot; other rank &quot; representation, it might be desirablethat a White Paper, setting out the Governments decisions on thoseissues which were not dealt with in the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Bill,should be presented before the Second Reading of that Bill in theHouse of Commons.It was doubtful whether it would be practicable to pass a naval discipline Bill in the present Session, having regard to the other claims on Parliamentary time, but the preparation of the Bill should proceed.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that effect should not be given to the proposals thatcourts-martial should have civilian presidents and thatverdicts should be unanimous.- (2) Invited the Minister of Defence to submit, as a matterof urgency, a further memorandum on the question of&quot; other rank&quot; representation on courts-martial, givingsuch information as was available regarding the workingof the United States system.(3) Agreed that, subject to an early decision on &quot; other rank &quot;representation, the Minister of Defence should present a white Paper on the Governments decisions regardingcourt-martial procedure generally before the SecondReading of the Courts-Martial (Appeals) Bill in the Houseof Commons.(4) Agreed that the preparation of a Naval Discipline Bill should proceed, although it might not be practicable to pass theBill in the current Session.Fire services in War.(previous reference:CM. (46) 19thConclusions,Minute 3.)2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary and the Secretary of State for Scotland (CP. (51) 14) indi-cating the terms in which they proposed to inform the local authority associations that it would be necessary to nationalise the Fire service in time of war.The Home Secretary said that, in the light of experience after thelast war, it was desirable to make it clear that, while the present government contemplated that the Fire Services should revert to localauthority control after any future war, they could not pledge futureGovernments or Parliaments.In discussion it was explained that, by the reference in paragraph of CP. (51) 14 to the fact that powers to nationalise the Service inwar would be limited to what was required for war purposes or in preparation for a state of war, it was not intended to suggest thatparts of the Fire Service would in time of war remain under localcontrol. The statement was intended to distinguish between thepeace-time phase and the war-time phase and during the latter periodall the resources of the existing fire brigades would be required for national purposes.The Cabinet-Approved the proposals made by the Home Secretary andthe Secretary of State for Scotland in CP. (51), 14,
3. The Foreign Secretary said that it had not proved possible to restrain the United States Government from putting forward in thePolitical Committee of the United Nations a resolution condemningChinese aggression in Korea. After consulting the Prime Minister hehad instructed the United Kingdom representative at the united nations not to join in sponsoring such a resolution. On 20th january the United States Government had abandoned their attempts to persuade other countries to join them in proposing a condemnatoryresolution, and had tabled one on their own responsibility. This,after noting that the Chinese People&apos;s Governent were continuing their large-scale attacks in Korea and had rejected all proposals for a peaceful settlement, called upon the United Nations * (i) to conclude that the Peking Government were engaged inaggression, which should be ended by the withdrawal of chinese Communist forces;(ii) to affirm the determination of the United Nations to con-tinue its action in Korea against aggression;(iii) to invite all States to assist the United Nations in Korea andto refrain from assisting the aggressors;(iv) to invite the Collective Measures Committee to consider andreport to the General Assembly what additional action could be taken against this aggression; and(v) to invite the President of the Assembly to designate two persons with whom he would co-operate at any suitable opportunity in using their good offices to enable theUnited Nations to achieve its objectives in Korea by peaceful means.The United Kingdom Government had now to define their attitudetowards this resolution and to decide whether their representative atthe United Nations should be instructed to vote in favour of it.The Foreign Secretary invited the Cabinet, in considering this difficult situation, to keep three broad considerations in mind. First,what practical consequences would follow if China were formallybranded as an aggressor by the United Nations? There was no doubtthat China had in fact committed aggression in Korea; and the UnitedKingdom Government were committed to support United Nationsaction in resisting aggression in Korea. But much more than this might flow from a formal condemnation of China as an aggressor.The United States Government might prefer to withdraw their troops from Korea, and direct their attack upon the mainland of China.They might even wish to use Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s forces in hostilities onthe mainland, and to foment a new civil war in China in which theywould be supporting Chiang Kai-shek against the Communist forces.Commonwealth Governments would not wish to be drawn intosupport of such policies as these.Secondly, the Prime Minister of India had taken the view thatthe reply from the Peking Government did not amount to a finalrejection of the offer to seek a settlement through negotiation. Therewas in fact some ambiguity on at least one point in that reply. Whenthe Peking Government said that they could not accept a cease-firewithout preliminary negotiations, it was not clear whether they hadin mind negotiations about the details of the cease-fire or negotiationsabout the wider issues of Formosa and their admission to the united nations. If they referred to the latter questions there seemed to beno possibility of a compromise. But, if they meant only that theremust be some preliminary negotiations about a cease-fire before itcould be put into effect, this was a request which merited serious con-sideration. He had therefore instructed His Majesty&apos;s representative in Peking to seek clarification of this point; and the Cabinet might think it wise to defer taking a final decision until this was available.Thirdly, full account should be taken of the state of publicopinion in the United States cm this question. The fact was thatAmericans were exceedingly reluctant to admit the Chinese Com-
munists on equal terms to a conference on the outstanding issues inthe Far East. This was largely due to an emotional feeling thatChina was now showing nothing but ingratitude for all the generoushelp which the United States had extended to her over many years.This made it difficult for the United States Government to take a realistic view of the current situation. But some means should, ifpossible, be found of handling that situation without any open riftbetween the Commonwealth and the United States.Against this general background the Foreign Secretary invited the Cabinet to consider the message from His Majesty&apos;s ambassador in Washington (Washington telegram No. 205 of 20th January)regarding the proposals which the United States Government would put to the Collective Measures Committee if their resolution were passed. It was satisfactory that the Americans were not intending to ask that Committee to recommend military action against the mainland of China. On the other hand, the Committee would beasked to explore the feasibility of general economic sanctions, andthe Americans evidently hoped that there would be some selectiveembargo on key exports to China. This Committee would be in aposition of considerable influence, and it was unfortunate that itincluded a number of countries which would follow the United Stateslead. Although its findings would in form be only recommendations to Governments, it would in practice be difficult for member States to refrain from accepting recommendations carried by a two-thirds majority on that Committee.The Foreign Secretary, in conclusion, said that his advice to theCabinet was that they should defer a final decision until His Majesty&apos;representative in Peking had reported the results of the enquiries which he had been instructed to make of the Chinese People&apos;sGovernment.The Chief of the Air Staff, at the Prime Ministers request, madea report to the Cabinet on the impressions which he had formedduring his recent visit to Washington. On the military situation in korea American opinion fluctuated greatly. It was still the policyof the United States Government that the United Nations forces should maintain their resistance to aggression in Korea; but themilitary authorities with whom he had discussed the position while he was in Washington had left him with the impression that theywould be glad to see their forces withdrawn from Korea. This was partly because they believed that the Chinese could drive them out,if they set about the task in earnest; and partly because they were reluctant to accept a continuing military commitment in Korea.Since he left Washington, however, General MacArthur and someother senior American officers seemed to be taking a rather moreoptimistic view of the situation. The morale of the United states troops had certainly been stiffened by recent changes in command;and the effect of United Nations air attack would be more damagingnow that the Chinese lines of communication were longer.As regards the future, if the United Nations Assembly adopted the United States resolution, he did not believe the United StatesGovernment would be anxious to take precipitate action under it.They were at present subject to very strong political pressure, butthis might well diminish when the resolution had been passed.General Bradley had told him that no action under the resolutionwould be taken until the United Nations forces had been withdrawnfrom Korea; and he had said after a meeting of the National security council that, while the United States Government would have estab-lished their position, they would not take action without consultationwith the United Kingdom Government. Admiral Sherman had saidthat he was not in favour of attempting a naval blockade: he wasthinking rather in terms of a selective embargo on key exports to china, operated mainly through export licensing and a navicertsystem.
The Chief of the Air Staff said that he did not believe the UnitedStates Chiefs of Staff would advocate, nor the Administrationauthorise, air attack against the Chinese mainland, except in a critical situation in which United Nations troops in Korea were being exposed to heavy air attack by the enemy. He also thought it unlikely thatthe United States Chiefs of Staff would favour the use of chiang kai-shek -shek&apos;s troops on the mainland of China though General Bradleyhad asked how we would view a proposal to use these troops insupport of a stabilised line in Korea.In conclusion, the Chief of the Air Staff stressed the need for avoiding at this stage any action which might give the isolationistsin the United States an opportunity to jeopardise the all-important contribution  which  the  United  States  were  making   towards,strengthening the defence of Western Europe.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The Governments of Canada and India had also arranged forfurther enquiries to be made in Peking with a view to clearing up some of the ambiguities which they found in the reply from theChinese People&apos;s Government. There was reason to believe that theresults of those enquiries might be available by the following day.(b) There was general support for the view that it would be inexpedient at this stage to abandon all hope of securing, throughnegotiation, a peaceful settlement of outstanding issues in the Far East.From that point of view it was specially undesirable that the reply from the Peking Government should not at this stage be described asa final rejection of the proposal for a conference.(c) There was obvious danger in remitting to the CollectiveMeasures Committee the duty of recommending to member Govern-ments what further action might be taken against China. Common-wealth Governments would certainly wish to reserve to themselves fullliberty to determine how far they should go in applying any sanctions against China.(d) The United States Delegation to the United Nations had issued on the previous day a statement of United States policy towards China. In this it had been stated that the United Statescontinued to oppose the admission of the Chinese People&apos;s Govern-ment to the United Nations; and continued to reserve its right to make certain that the question of Formosa would be handled in a mannerconsistent with the interest and security of the United States. It had gone on to say that Chiang Kai-shek&apos;s Government should be repre-sented at any conference held to discuss these questions. The publica-tion of such a statement at the present time could not be regarded ashelpful.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said that theCabinet would not wish to take a final decision regarding their atti-tude towards the United States resolution until they knew the resultsof the enquiries which were now being made in Peking. The cabinet must, however, decide what line should be taken by the UnitedKingdom representative at the United Nations, Sir Gladwyn Jebb,in the debate on that resolution which was to be resumed later inthe day. He read to the Cabinet a draft of the instructions which theForeign Secretary was proposing to send to Sir Gladwyn Jebb.In discussion it was recognised that it would be difficult for sir Gladwyn Jebb to speak again on the resolution before he knewwhether or not he would be instructed to vote in support of it. Itwould be preferable that, if this were at all possible, he should defermaking his speech until the following day. If, however, he had to speak that day, he should avoid saying anything which might pre-judge the Cabinefs final decision. From that point of view, it wouldbe better that he should not express support for the paragraph of theUnited States resolution which condemned Chinese aggression in korea.  It was suggested that on this point he might confine himself
to saying that the Chinese had committed aggression in Korea, but,notwithstanding that, the United Nations had offered to seek a settle-ment by negotiation and it was a matter for regret that the PekingGovernment had not yet accepted that offer.The Cabinet (1) Endorsed the decision that the United Kingdom Governmentshould not join in sponsoring a resolution condemningChinese aggression in Korea.(2) Agreed to defer a final decision regarding their attitudetowards the United States resolution, pending the resultsof the enquiries which were now being made in Pekingwith a view to clarifying the meaning of the reply whichthe Chinese People&apos;s Government had returned to thelatest United Nations proposals.(3) Approved, subject to the points noted above, the instructionsto be sent to the United Kingdom representative at theUnited Nations regarding the line which he should take inthe debate in the Political Committee later that day.Cabinet Office, SWA,22nd January, 1951.
