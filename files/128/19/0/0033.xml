Korea. 2.   The Foreign Secretary said that on 1st May he had received(Previous        a personal message from the United States Secretary of State dealingReference:      with a number of points of policy relating to the situation in Korea.CM. (51) 27th   In this message Mr. Acheson had clarified his attitude towards theConclusions,    questions of economic sanctions against China, Chinese membershipMinute 1.)       of the United Nations, and the need for a further declaration of Alliedaims in Korea.   But the most urgent of the questions raised byMr. Acheson was that of retaliatory bombing if a major air attackon the United Nations forces in Korea was made from bases onChinese territory.  Mr. Acheson suggested that, if such an air attack was launched, the decision to strike back must be taken by the UnitedStates Government, representing the unified command of the united nations forces, since there would be no time for consultation with theother Governments concerned.The Foreign Secretary said that, if it was clearly established thata major air attack had been made on the United Nations forces from&apos; Chinese bases, we could not challenge the view that this must be answered by retaliatory bombing of those bases. We must, however,seek to secure agreement that we should be consulted before suchretaliatory action was authorised, and he proposed to take this line in his reply to Mr. Acheson. At the same time, we must be able to promise to give an immediate reply when we were consulted; andhe therefore suggested that the Cabinet should accept in principle the necessity of counter-attacking the Chinese bases if a substantialair attack was launched on the United Nations forces, and to delegate to the Prime Minister, in consultation with himself and the Ministerof Defence, the responsibility of deciding whether to agree to a UnitedStates proposal that such retaliatory action should be taken.It was the general view of the Cabinet that this necessity mustbe accepted in principle, but that it would not be desirable to leave it to the United States Government to decide when an occasionjustifying such retaliatory action had arisen. Since the dismissal of General MacArthur there was less danger of a precipitate decisionfounded on insufficient evidence; but, even so, the political conse-quences Were so grave that the decision should not be taken purelyon military considerations.In further discussion the following points were made:  (a) Although the United States Government had been pre-:  occupied for some time with the danger of air attacks on Korea from china, it was not clear that they had taken any steps to reducethe effect of such attacks, e.g., by the dispersal or protection of military targets or by the provision of more night-fighters.(b) An air attack from bases in Soviet territory would raiseseparate and very grave problems, and we should make it clear tothe United States Government that full consultation would be neces-sary before we could agree to retaliatory action against those bases.4066O-1 b 2Persia. 1.   The Prime Minister said that, in view of the rapidly changing(Previous situation in Persia, he had decided to appoint a small group ofReference: Ministers to watch the situation and to authorise action which couldCM.

The Cabinet Took note of the Prime Minister^ statement.
(c) We should seek to obtain from the United States Govern-ment elucidation of the military and political consequences whichthey expected to follow from an attack on Chinese bases and, inparticular, their estimate of the Soviet attitude to such an attack.The views of the Chiefs of Staff should also be obtained on themilitary aspect of these points.(d) Although we could not suggest that the Governments ofCanada, Australia and New Zealand should be consulted beforeretaliatory action was taken, the United States Government shouldbe asked to ensure that those Governments were as fully informed as ourselves of the views and intentions of the United StatesGovernment.(e) While it was necessary to take an immediate decision ofprinciple on the bombing of Chinese bases, there was no reason to yield precipitately to United States pressure on the other points,which should await further consideration by the Cabinet.(/) In order to limit the area of conflict, retaliatory action, if it became unavoidable, should be directed solely against the bases inChina from which an air attack had been launched.The Cabinet  .(1) Agreed in principle that, if a major air attack was launchedfrom bases in Chinese territory against the united nations forces in Korea, retaliatory action should betaken against those bases.,(2) Invited the Foreign Secretary to inform the United StatesGovernment that we should wish to be consulted before such retaliatory action was authorised, but that in this event our views would be communicated to them withthe minimum of delay.(3) Authorised the Prime Minister, in consultation with theForeign Secretary and the Minister of Defence, to dealon their behalf with any request from the United StatesGovernment for concurrence in a proposal to authoriseretaliatory bombing of Chinese air bases.socialised industries.parliamentary control.(previous reference:CM. (50) 65thConclusions,Minute 5.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (51) 121) regarding a request by the Opposition thata Select Committee should be set up to consider how the House ofCommons might be better informed of the conduct of nationalised industries and be enabled to exercise a more effective measure ofcontrol over them.The Home Secretary said that, if it were decided that this request should be conceded, the terms of reference of the Select Committeeshould be restricted to the adequacy of the present arrangements forinforming Parliament of the affairs of the socialised industries andshould not cover questions of Parliamentary control.In discussion there was general agreement that further experienceshould be gained before any general investigation was made into theorganisation of the socialised industries or their relations with ministers and with Parliament; and that, even when the time wasripe for such an investigation, it should not be made by a SelectCommittee. It was clear that in the present political circumstancesa Select Committee, drawn from both sides of the House, was not likely to make an objective examination of this question.The Cabinet-Invited the Home Secretary to reject the Opposition^request for a Select Committee to enquire into the relations of the socialised industries to Parliament.
Coal.economy measures,(previous reference:CM. (51) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)Divorce Laws. 5.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Lord(Previous        Chancellor (CP. (51) 119) seeking the guidance of his colleagues on reference:      the question whether the Royal Commission on Divorce shouldCM. (51) 19th  include Bishops or other representatives of the Churches.Conclusions, In the Cabinefs discussion it was argued, on the one hand, that minute 6.) a large body of public opinion would be reluctant to accept the findings of a Royal Commission on this subject which had not included some members who would be known to have approached the problem from the point of view of the Christian Churches.Although the point of view most freely expressed on this question was that which favoured easier divorce, it would be a mistake toinfer that this was a majority view: it was more likely to be theview of a vocal minority. It was not necessary, however, that thepoint of view of the Christian Churches should be represented on theCommission by clergy: indeed, it might be better that it should berepresented by laymen, and the Churches themselves might well preferthis. It might be expedient to take informal soundings on this point,either through the Archbishop of Canterbury, or through the Councilof Churches, or possibly through both.On the other side, it was argued that the Churches held pre-conceived views on the subject of divorce and that they should there-fore put their views in evidence to the Commission rather than berepresented on it. Moreover, different views were held by differentdenominations; and, if all shades of Christian opinion were to berepresented, the Commission might become unmanageably large. Thepoint was also made that the Royal Commission of 1912 had includedonly one representative of the Churches, that the influence of the churches in the national life had decreased substantially since then,and that it would be out of accord with contemporary opinion if the churches took a dominant part in the work of the Commission. the divorce Bill recently introduced by Mrs. Eirene White, M.P., hadcommanded a substantial measure of support in the House ofCommons.At the Prime Ministers request The Lord Chancellor informed the Cabinet of some of the people suggested to him as possible candi-dates for appointment to the Commission. These, in the main,represented various professions or interests which had special experience or points of view on the problems at issue. It was agreedthat, if this was to be the basis of selection, the Lord Chancellorslist would have to be supplemented by the addition of suitable repre-sentatives of working-class views and interests. But the question was raised whether it would not be preferable to constitute the Commis-sion rather as a jury of ordinary men and women with no specialisedor professional angle on the problem. If it could be constituted onthat basis, no question need arise of its including representativeseither of the Churches or of any other special interest.The Lord Chancellor suggested that, before deciding on whatbasis the Commission should be constituted, the Cabinet should consider its terms of reference. These must cover some of the legal and social aspects of the problem; and he was inclined to think that,because of the technical issues involved, it would be necessary thatthe Commission should at least include some legal experts.4. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the Ministerof Fuel and Power (CP. (51) 118) outlining the progress made in securing economy in the consumption of coal.-The Cabinet -Took note of the information contained in CP. (51) 118.
The Cabinet (1) Agreed to resume their discussion of the composition of theRoyal Commission on Divorce at a later meeting, at whichthey would also have before them the terms of referenceproposed for the Commission.(2) Invited the Lord Chancellor, in the meantime, to reconsider the composition of the Commission, in the light of the cabinet&apos;s discussion, and to consult some of his cabinet colleagues regarding the choice of individuals to serve on it.(3) Agreed that, pending further discussion by the Cabinet, itwould be inexpedient that even informal soundings shouldbe taken with a view to ascertaining whether the Churcheswould wish to be represented on the Commission.Cabinet Office, SWA,3rd May, 1951.
