(previous reference:CM. (51) 1stConclusions,Minute 1.)Kashmir.(previous reference:CM. (50) 13thConclusions,Minute 5.)2. The&quot; Prime Minister said that the Kashmir question had notbeen formally discussed by the Meeting of Commonwealth PrimeMinisters: it was not the custom at such Meetings to discuss issues arising between one Commonwealth country and another. Hehad, however, been able to arrange for the Prime Ministers ofCanada, Australia, New Zealand and Ceylon to join him and thePrime Ministers of India and Pakistan in informal talks on theKashmir question. He was sorry to have to report that theseinformal discussions had proved unfruitful. Although the points of difference had been narrowed, no settlement had been reached.Defence.(previous reference:CM. (50) 87thConclusions,Minute 1.)40027-33. The Prime Minister said that the Defence Committee andthe Cabinet would be considering, in the week beginning 22nd Jan-uary, proposals for accelerating our defence preparations whichhad been worked out in pursuance of the Cabinefs decision of18th December. The need for this acceleration, and its probableimpact upon the civil economy, would have to be carefully explained to the public; and it had been suggested that he should make a speech on this subject during the coming week-end. He himself would have preferred to wait until he could indicate the scale ofthe acceleration and the nature of its economic impact, but he wouldbe glad to hear the views of his colleagues.The Lord President said that he was concerned about the stateof public opinion in this country on two points. First, there was agood deal of apprehension, which was not confined to Labourcircles, lest another world war might be precipitated by the pursuit of provocative policies, particularly by the United States Government.The Public should be forced to face the facts of the situation; torecognise that the threat of war was real; and to understand thenature and extent of Russian activities in stirring up international difficulties. At the same time, it should be made clear that it wasthe policy of the United Kingdom Government to seek to preventwar, and that they would lose no opportunity of reaching a peaceful settlement of outstanding differences with the Soviet Union. but no Government could hope to negotiate successfully from a positionof weakness; and the process of increasing the defence preparednessof the western Powers was an essential element in the policy of preventing war. Secondly, the public had not yet realised that increased defence programmes would involve some retardation of social policies and of the improvement of economic conditions.They should be made to face the fact that this necessary increasein the defence preparedness of the western democracies must involvethe acceptance of some sacrifices by their peoples.The Lord President thought that this process of public education should begin before Parliament reassembled. It was unfortunate that the Prime Minister would not be able to indicate, before then,the scale of the increased defence programme or the nature of its economic impact; but, even so, he thought it would be valuableif a preliminary speech could be made on this subject during theb 2Meeting of 1.    The Prime Minister said that useful results had beenCommonwealth achieved by the Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers,Prime Ministers, which had held its final session on 12th January. The discussions had been conducted in a spirit of understanding and co-operation;and, at the end, agreement had been reached on a valuable declarationof Commonwealth purposes.The Cabinet congratulated the Prime Minister on the successof this Meeting. The declaration issued at the end of the meeting had been well received in the United Kingdom, and was likelyto have a healthy influence on public opinion abroad, both in theUnited States and elsewhere.
coming week-end. He was anxious that this speech should bemade outside Parliament, so that it could be reported by the Presswithout the Opposition comment which, if it were made in Parliament,would be published at the same time.In discussion the following arguments were used in supportof the suggestion that the Prime Minister should make a preliminaryspeech of this kind before Parliament reassembled and before theCabinet had decided what the scale of the increased defence programme should be: (a) The declaration of Commonwealth purposes, which hadbeen issued at the end of the recent Meeting of commonwealth prime Ministers, had reflected the fundamental objectives of theUnited Kingdom Government to seek to remove the causes ofwar by the peaceful settlement of outstanding differences, but tobe prepared to resist aggression, if need be, and to accept the sacrificeswhich this preparedness might entail. The Prime Minister mightwell take an early opportunity of enlarging upon these objectives,in his own words, from the United Kingdom point of view. a speech on those lines would have the effect of reinforcing theCommonwealth declaration. It would also give the Prime Ministeran opportunity to reassert the moral leadership of the UnitedKingdom Government.(b) There would also be some advantage in re-affirming theGovernments decision of 18th December to increase and acceleratetheir defence preparations still further. This decision, though ithad been announced at the Brussels meeting of the North atlantic council, had not received much publicity in this country.(c) There would be advantage in emphasising the readiness ofthe United Kingdom Government to join in any discussions which theSoviet Government or the Chinese Government were willing toenter with a sincere desire to reach a settlement of outstanding issues in Europe and in the Far East.(d) It would be useful if the Prime Minister could make plainthe reality of the Russian threat to world peace. He might with advantage make more widely known the information which theMinister of Defence had already given to Parliament about thestrength of the Russian forces now in being, the up-to-date weaponswith which they were equipped, and the extent to which the SovietGovernment had reorganised the industrial war potential of theirsatellites in Europe.(e) It would also be useful if something could be said to restrainpublic criticism of United States policies. While we should continueto do all we could to prevent the adoption of provocative policiesby the United States Government, it was important to avoid any public rift in Anglo-American solidarity at this time. western europe could not be successfully defended without american military strength.(/) There was some danger that the latest proposals for asettlement in Korea might have led the public to take an over-optimistic view of the world situation. An early speech by thePrime Minister could correct that tendency. The need for acceleratingour defence preparations arose, not from the situation in the FaiEast, but rather from the Russian threat to our more vital interest!,in Europe.(g) Something could usefully be said at this stage about the rawmaterials shortages and the machinery which was now to be set up,largely at the instance of the United Kingdom Government, to mitigate their effects. Public opinion was already concerned aboutrising prices and the threat of unemployment. An early statement by the Prime Minister might have a reassuring effect.The Minister of Health said that he was opposed to the suggestionthat the Prime Minister should make a speech on these lines beforethe Cabinet had seen detailed proposals for increasing the scale and pace of our defence preparations and had considered the
economic consequences of adopting those proposals. If no indication could be given of its scale, the proposed increase inour defence programmes might be assumed to be of the same order as that which the United States Government were now undertaking.Such an assumption would cause public alarm, and would stimulate the demand, already voiced by the Conservative Press, for aNational Government. Moreover, it would in his view be a mistake for the Prime Minister to talk in general terms about anincreased defence programme before he was in a position to indicatewhen the impact on the civil economy would begin to be felt and whatsacrifices the public might have to be asked to accept. In thisconnection he pointed out that the Cabinet had not yet acceptedthe view that -increased defence programmes would involve anycutting back of social policies already launched. So far, all that had been conceded on this point was that, by reason of increased expenditure on defence, the public might have to forego socialbenefits which might otherwise have accrued to them in the nextfew years. If proposals were made for putting back existing services, the Cabinet would doubtless have to consider them though he was not at present disposed to accept any reductionin the National Health Service. But he would strongly deprecateany public pronouncements at this stage which would create aclimate of public opinion which might pre-judge the decisions which the Cabinet had yet to take on this question.The Minister said that, for himself, he was sceptical of theappreciations submitted to the Government by their military advisers&apos; regarding the strength and equipment of the Russian forces.It was the habit of military advisers to exaggerate the strength of a potential enemy. Although the Soviet Government were doubtlessmore willing than the western democracies to allocate a largeproportion of their resources to military purposes, he did notbelieve that Russian&apos;s steel production was sufficient to enable her tomaintain and support military forces on the scale which was beingassumed by the intelligence experts. His information was that theSoviet bureaucracy had failed to organise Russia&apos;s industrialpotential. He did not believe that the Soviet Government wererelying on a military coup. If this was their policy, they wouldhave taken military action before now: he did not believe thatthey had been deterred from this merely by fear of atomic attack.In his view their main strategy was to force the western democraciesto rearm on a scale which would impair their economy and embittertheir peoples. He therefore thought it would be folly for the democracies to adopt vast defence programmes which would putsuch a strain on their economies, and impose such delays on theirattempts to promote economic development in the under-developedterritories, as to give the Soviet Government the opportunity whichthey sought. Russia had not sufficient economic strength to win along war against the democracies. It followed that the democraciesneed only rearm to the extent necessary to ensure that they couldnot be overrun in the first few months of a war.Rearmament should therefore be approached with restraint,not with enthusiasm. The declaration issued at the end of therecent Meeting of Commonwealth Prime Ministers had struck this note, and had given the Commonwealth the moral leadership of theworld. We should take full advantage of this opportunity to restrain the United States Government. They had never had our experience of maintaining an army in peace: hitherto they had armedonly for war, and had remained disarmed in peace. They mustlearn from us the importance, and the means, of directing their current rearmament towards the prevention of war.Other arguments advanced against the suggestion of an earlyspeech on this subject were as follows: (h) The need for increased defence preparedness had alreadybeen put to the public in general terms on more than one occasion.40027-3 &quot; b 3
If the Prime Minister were now to speak again on this subject, hewould be expected to give some broad indication of the scale ofthe increase and its economic consequences.(0 These consequences might well include some abandonmentor retardation of peace-time policies which were now being pursued by civil Departments. Individual Ministers could not reasonably beleft to explain these modifications without reference to defenceneeds; and it might be preferable that they should all be covered insome general statement of Government policy.(j) It was likely that before the coming week-end the People&apos;sGovernment of China would have disclosed their attitude towardsthe latest proposals for a settlement of the Korean question. this must influence the tone and content of the Prime Ministers speech;and it would be difficult for him to decide, before knowing whatthe Chinese reaction was, whether or not it would be wise for himto make a speech on the lines suggested during the coming week-end.(/c) One of the objects of such a speech would be to rally publicopinion in the countries of Western Europe. But in those countries there was at present a good deal of anxiety, particularly on thesubject of civil defence. The United States Government had justannounced a programme of expenditure of about  750 millions forthe construction of air-raid shelters in the United States. This,when it became more generally known, would invite the peoples of western Europe to draw most unfavourable comparisons with theirown unpreparedness. This perhaps pointed to the advantage of postponing any further statement until the scale and nature of ourincreased defence preparations had been determined.(/) A general speech on the lines suggested might be valuableif it could be followed within a few days by a more definite statement on the scale of the increased defence programme and its economic consequences. At present, however, there was no certainty thatthere might not be a delay of one or two weeks before those further details could be given.The Prime Minister, summing up the discussion, said thathe would take note of the views which his colleagues had expressed but, before finally deciding whether to make a speech on the lines suggested during the coming week-end, he would wish to know what attitude the Chinese People&apos;s government decided to adopt towards the latest proposals for a settlementof the Korean question. He would therefore postpone his decision for a day or two in the hope that meanwhile furtherinformation about the attitude of the Peking government might have become available.industrial disputes.Conditions ofEmploymentand NationalArbitrationOrder.(previous reference:CM. (50) 84thConclusions,Minute 1.)4. The Cabinet had before them memoranda by the Ministerof Labour (CP. (51) 8) and the Attorney-General (CP. (51) 9) onthe future of the Conditions of Employment and national arbitration Order.The Minister of Labour said that the administration of this order had run smoothly until recently, when a number of difficulties had been raised about its interpretation. First, it now appeared thatif the Minister, for good cause, postponed a reference to the national arbitration Tribunal beyond the twenty-one days prescribed in theOrder, the prohibition on a strike or lock-out lapsed; secondly,it was not clear whether it was mandatory on the Minister to refer to the Tribunal all cases in which there was a failure to reach asettlement by other means: and thirdly, if reference to the Tribunalwas mandatory, it was not clear whether the Minister must acteven where the workers who were parties to the dispute were an unofficial body acting against the wishes of their trade unionexecutive. He had arranged for a meeting of the Joint consultative committee of the National Joint Advisory Council to be held on24th January, with a view to placing before them the problems
Coal: economy measures.(previous reference:CM. (50) 86thConclusions,Minute 6.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (51) 7) making three proposalsfor alleviating the prospective shortage of coal, viz., an extensionof the period of summer time during 1951, a reduction in mid-weeksport, and a shortening of the hours of broadcasting. They also had before them a memorandum by the Home Secretary (CP. (50)309) on the [proposed extension of the period of summer time.which had arisen in the interpretation of the Order and ascertainingtheir views on the form which it should take in future. He feared that, unless agreement was reached between the two sides ofindustry on the form in which the Order should continue in force, a motion for its revocation might be carried at the next meeting of theTrades Union Congress.The Attorney-General said that he believed that as a long-termmeasure the Government should aim at permanent arbitrationmachinery with civil remedies for any contravention; but he didnot think that this was an opportune time for effecting such a majoralteration and he was disposed to conclude that, for the present,the Order should be continued in force more or less in its existing form.In further discussion the following points were made: (a) The dispute between Kemsley Newspapers and certainchapels of the National Union of Journalists (described in CP. (50)313) raised the question whether [the Minister of Labour was entitled to refuse to refer to the National Arbitration Tribunalgrievances of an indefinite character, which were being pressedagainst the advice of the National Executive Committee of theNational Union of Journalists. If the Minister of Labour was notprepared to argue, in the legal action now before the Courts, thatthe Order gave him a discretion whether or not to refer a dispute to the Tribunal, the only point at issue would be whether thedispute amounted to a trade dispute within the meaning of theOrder. If the case went against the Minister and the Order wasnot amended, the law might play into the hands of the Communistswho could foment unofficial disputes and demand that the minister should refer them to the Tribunal. If such a state of affairsdeveloped, the Trades Union Congress would almost certainlyask for the revocation of the Order; and it had been understood from the beginning that, if either side made such a demand, theOrder would not be continued in force. There would be difficultiesin amending the Order to provide that only disputes recognised by a trade union could be reported under it, but these difficulties wouldhave to be examined if the Kemsley case went against the Minister.(b) If the Order were to be amended by general agreement,it would be desirable to make it clear that the dispute between certain boroughs and their Town Clerks (described in CP. (50) 316)did not fall within its scope.(c) It would be undesirable to delete the provisions of the Orderrelating to the prohibition of strikes and lock-outs; but it mightbe useful to provide that breach of the Order should be punishableonly by a fine, and not by imprisonment, and to exclude from its scope disputes relating to recognition or non-unionism.The Cabinet-Authorised the Minister of Labour to hold a general discussion with the Joint Consultative Committee of theNational Joint Advisory Council about the difficultieswhich had arisen in the administration of the Conditionsof Employment and National Arbitration Order; and agreedthat, in the light of that discussion and of the decision in the Kemsley case, the Cabinet should consider at alater date whether, and if so in what respects, the Ordermight be amended.
Summer Time. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the progressivedeterioration in the coal position strengthened his case for a longer period of summer time in 1951. In 1950, summer time had beenin operation for three weeks longer than the statutory period of twenty-four weeks, and he recommended that in 1951 the period should be extended by a further five weeks to a total of thirty-two weeks. It was estimated that this further extension might saveabout 62,000 tons of coal.The Minister of Agriculture said that any further increase inthe period of summer time would be strongly opposed by the farmers, who regarded last year&apos;s period as already unjustifiablylong. The saving of coal would be relatively small, even if itreached the estimate given by the Minister of Fuel and Power,and it would not begin to take effect until the end of the currentwinter.It was the general view of the Cabinet that the balance ofadvantage lay against the extension of summer time by five weeks in 1951, in view of the relatively small saving of coal which was likely to be secured, the strong opposition of the farmers and thedifficulty of securing Parliamentary approval for such an extension.Parliament should, however, be asked to agree that the extra-statutory period of three weeks which had been adopted in 1950should be repeated in 1951, and that the shortage of fuel should beadduced as justification for this extension of the statutory period.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that in 1951 summer time should extend for the twenty-seven weeks from 15th April to 21st October.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that in order to reduceabsenteeism in the coalmines he recommended that the FootballAssociation should be asked to arrange that re-plays Of Cup Tiesshould take place on Saturdays instead of during the week, andthat, if the Football Association could not agree to this, arrangements should be made to reduce the number of re-plays. He was considering what could be done about mid-week horse-racing; but he did not ask for an immediate decision on this, since the only major race-meeting to be held in the middle of the week was the St. Leger,which would not take place until September.In discussion, it was argued that the reimposition of restrictionson mid-week sport would call public attention to the gravity of thesituation, and that in Scotland the miners were themselves anxious that restrictions should be imposed on mid-week football. Asregards racing, it might not be difficult to arrange that the St. Legershould be run on a Saturday; but, if this was desired, the approach to the Jockey Club should not be long delayed.It was the general view of the Cabinet that it would not bedesirable to reimpose restrictions on mid-week football, since theincrease in coal production which would result from it could not be precisely calculated and was likely to be very small. ministers were, however, prepared to agree that the Jockey Club should beasked to arrange for the St. Leger to be run on a Saturday in 1951.The Cabinet (2) Decided that no steps should be taken to reimpose restrictionson mid-week football matches.(3) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to consider whether he should not ask the Home Secretary to put to theJockey Club at an early date the request that  the st. Leger should be run on a Saturday in 1951.Broadcasting. The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the proposal thatthe B.B.C. should end broadcasting at 11.0 p.m., instead of midnight,was based primarily on psychological grounds, since the saving in mid-weekSport.
fuel would not be large. Such a measure would, however, bring home to the public the seriousness of the fuel situation.In discussion it was pointed out that, according to an estimatemade by the Post Office, the direct saving of coal by stopping broad-casting at 11.0 p.m. would be no more than 90 tons a day. Inaddition there might be indirect savings totalling perhaps 60 tons aday. It was clear, therefore, that the proposal could be supportedonly on the ground of its psychological effect on public opinion.Ministers were doubtful whether this effect Would be beneficial:the public might well feel that the restriction was being imposedwithout adequate justification.The Cabinet-(4) Agreed that the balance of advantage lay against the proposalto stqp broadcasting at 11.0 p.m.The Lord President drew attention to the fact that the public statement issued after the meetings between the National coal board and the National Union of Mineworkers on 10th and 11th Jan-uary had not made it clear that the supplementary pensions schemewhich was to be discussed would apply only to underground workersin the mining industry. The statement had merely said that theworkers who would benefit would not be known until the Boardand the Union had worked out details. In view of the Cabinet&apos;decision on this point (CM. (51) 2nd Conclusions) it was desirablethat, at the forthcoming Delegate Conference of the National Unionof Mineworkers, it should be clearly indicated that what the national coal Board were prepared to discuss was a scheme for underground workers.The Minister of Fuel and Power said that the National coal board had indicated to the Union that the scheme would apply only to underground workers, but there had been difficulties withthe General Secretary of the Union about the form of the public statement.The Cabinet (5) Invited the Minister of Fuel and Power to take steps toensure that it was made clear, at the forthcomingDelegate Conference of the National Union of Mine-workers, that the pensions scheme proposed by theNational Coal Board applied only to underground workers.6. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Fuel and Power (CP. (51) 11) recommending that theprogramme for opencast coalmining during the next five years should be increased, and that he should make an immediate announcement to that effect.The Cabinet agreed to defer consideration of this proposaluntil a later meeting. They asked that in the meantime the ministers concerned should discuss the proposal and endeavour to reach agreement.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of Town and Country planning to discuss with the Minister of Agriculture and theMinister of Fuel and Power the proposals in CP. (51) 11,in order, if possible, to reach an agreed view.(2) Agreed to defer consideration of CP. (51) 11 until a later meeting.

At the same time, it was desirable thatthe Trades Union Congress should collaborate with the Governmentin making the enquiry a success.
