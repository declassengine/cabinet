Divorce Laws. 1.   The Cabinet considered what attitude  the Government(Previous        should adopt towards the Matrimonial Causes Bill, a PrivateReference:      Member&apos;s Bill which was to be debated in the House of Commons on. (5.0) 11th   9th March.Conclusions,Minute 3.) The Cabinet first discussed whether the time had not come toappoint a Royal Commission on the law relating to divorce. Forsome time past the Government had declined to pursue specificsuggestions for modifying the divorce law on the ground that piece-meal amendments should not be made in advance of a compre-hensive review of the whole question. It was, however, becoming increasingly difficult to use this argument and at the same time to decline to appoint a Royal Commission to undertake such a compre-hensive review. The Lord Chancellor, in a recent debate in the Houseof Lords, had used the additional argument that, before setting upa Royal Commission, the Government should wait to see the effect ofthe new legal aid scheme on divorce litigation. There were, however,positive objections to the appointment of a Royal Commission onthis subject. The choice of members would be difficult and theCommission was unlikely to produce an agreed report. When it had completed its work, the Government of the day would probably be faced with some difficult decisions on matters which cut acrossParty lines. On the other hand, there were various general issues which merited the kind of investigation which a Royal commission could make; and, while the Commission was sitting and after itsreport had been received, public opinion might reach a clearer view on the steps to be taken in the matter on which there was at presentgreat diversity of view, coupled with general disquiet about variousfeatures of the existing law. The preponderant view in the cabinet was in favour of the appointment of a Royal Commission to under-take a comprehensive review of the law in England and Wales relatingto divorce and cognate subjects, such as the custody of childrenwhere marriages were dissolved.The Cabinet then discussed whether Ministers should be free to vote according to conscience if a division took place on the secondreading of the Matrimonial Causes Bill. On the one hand it waspointed out that, even if the Bill obtained a second reading, it was unlikely that time could be found for its further stages, and that the vote on second reading could therefore be regarded as no morethan an occasion for the expression of personal views on the limitedproblem, with which the Bill purported to deal. If it could be soregarded, Ministers might have the same freedom as other members to vote in accordance with their personal views. On the other hand it was argued that, if it was the Governmenfs view that there shouldbe no modification of the divorce law until a comprehensive reviewhad been undertaken by a Royal Commission, it followed that a minister might vote against the Bill or abstain from voting, but should not vote in favour of the Bill.The general conclusion reached was that, if a Royal commission was to be appointed, the best course would be to seek to avoid a division on the second reading of the Bill. The Cabinet thereforeagreed that the Lord President and other interested Ministers should inform the sponsors of the Bill, in confidence, of the government&apos;s intention to set up a Royal Commission, and that the Attornev-Generaland Chief Whip should similarly convey the same information to theMembers who had put down a reasoned amendment for the rejection of the Bill. The aim should be to secure that, after a full debate inwhich the issues involved would be canvassed, the amendment wouldnot be pressed and the Bill would be withdrawn. In the debate the attorney-General should announce the Governmenfs intention to setup a Royal Commission and indicate that the Government could holdout no hope of facilities for later stages of the Bill, if it should receive a second reading.
The Cabinet-(1) Agreed that a Royal Commission should be appointed to review the law relating to divorce in England and Wales,and invited the Prime Minister to take the necessary steps for the establishment of the Commission.(2) Authorised the Attorney-General to announce this decision in the course of the debate on the second reading of theMatrimonial Causes Bill.NorthAtlanticTreaty.command organisation-.(previous reference:CM. (51) 16thConclusions,Minute 2.)2. The Lord President said that, in the debate on the navy estimates in the House of Commons on 12th March, there would befurther discussion of the appointment of Admiral Fechteler as supreme Allied Commander, Altantic, under the North atlantic treaty Organisation. He asked whether it would then be possibleto give any indication of the other appointments to be made in theNorth Atlantic command organisation.The Minister of Defence informed the Cabinet of the progressso far made in informal discussion of these appointments. It wouldnot be possible to announce any further appointments by 12thMarch.After discussion it was agreed that the Opposition should beinformed that the Government would not be able to announce, before12th March, any further appointments in the North Atlantic command organisation. They therefore proposed that the debate on the navy estimates should be opened in the ordinary way by the parliamentary secretary, Admiralty. The appointment of Admiral Fechteler as supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic, could, however, be discussed later in the debate, on the Amendment to be moved by Mr. F. W.Mulley, M.P., and the Minister of Defence would speak in that partof the debate. It was further agreed that in his speech the Ministerof Defence should promise to present a White Paper on the north atlantic command organisation as a whole, as soon as the othercommand appointments had been settled.DurhamCountyCouncil.Conditions ofEmployment.(previous reference:CM. (50) 83rdConclusions,Minute 8.)3. On 13th March there was to be a debate in the House ofCommons on the action taken by the Durham County Council with aview to securing that all persons employed by them belonged to a trade union or a professional association.The Cabinet were informed that in making new appointments theDurham County Council had recently been asking applicants to statewhether they belonged to a trade union or a professional association.Many applicants had declined to answer this question ; but, for eachof the appointments recently made, one candidate had answered thisquestion in the affirmative and this candidate had been appointed. Aheadmaster thus appointed was due to take up his duties on 12thMarch ; and it was understood that, if he did so, the other teachers inthe school would decline to carry on their work.The Minister of Education said that, if this occurred, he would beable to raise the whole issue formally with the County Council on thebasis that they were not discharging their duties under the education act.The Cabinet-Took note of the position and invited the Minister of Educa-tion to speak on the Government^ behalf in the debate in theHouse of Commons on 13th March.
4. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.The Lord President said that, in his Statement on Business that day, he proposed to announce that Parliament would be adjourned forthe Easter Recess on 22nd March and would reassemble on 3rd April.The Chancellor of the Exchequer would open his Budget on 10th April.In discussion it was suggested that there might be some Parlia-mentary pressure for a longer period of recess at Easter. The cabinet recognised that Members of Parliament had been working under greatstrain and were in need of a longer respite. On the other hand, if parliament did not reassemble until 10th April, it was doubtfulwhether it would be able to get through the large volume of business which had to be transacted before the end of the current session. TheLord President said that, if the suggestion of a longer Easter Recesswere strongly pressed, he would promise to consider it.Korea. 5.   At their meeting on 5th March the Cabinet had agreed that(Previous        His Majesty&apos;s Ambassador in Washington should take further stepsReference:      to secure from the State Department a formal assurance that united cm. (51) 17th   Nations Forces in Korea would not advance beyond the 38th ParallelConclusions,     without a fresh political decision by the United Nations.Minute 2.) The Cabinet now had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 68) to which was annexed a copy of washington telegram No. 538 of 20th February. This made it clear that the assurance which had been given on this point by ah official of the state department on 16th February represented the formal views of theUnited States Government. It was also stated in the memorandum that a more detailed statement of United States views on this point wasto be communicated to the United Kingdom Government in the nearfuture.The Cabinet-Took note that, for the reasons given in CP. (51) 68, theForeign Secretary did not propose to instruct His Majesty&apos;ambassador in Washington to make any further representa-tions to the United States Government on this question atthe present time.Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.Cabinet Office, S.WA,Sth March, 1951.
