95CM. 45 (51)      219Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken inthe House of Commons in the following week.Bechuanaland 2. The Cabinet were informed that members of the ConservativeProtectorate. and Liberal Parties had now tabled a motion inviting the House of tshekedi Commons to deplore the decision to continue the banishment ofKhama. Tshekedi Khama from the Bamangwato territory without hearing or(Previous        enquiring into the grounds for such banishment, and calling uponReference:      the Government to rescind the order of banishment and to allowCM. (51) 27th  Tshekedi to dwell freely within the territory of his tribe. The motionConclusions,     would have the official support of both the Opposition Parties, and minute 4.)       it was likely that a number of Government supporters would be reluctant to vote against it.   The Government would therefore be confronted with a difficult Parliamentary situation when the motionwas debated.The Secretary of State for Commonwealth Relations said that,if Tshekedi were allowed to return to the Bamangwato Reserve, itwould be difficult to maintain the exclusion of Seretse. The Govern-ment would thus be forced into a complete reversal of the policywhich they had hitherto followed in this matter. This would seriouslyimpair their relations with the Union of South Africa, and would cause the Union Government to press their claim to assume responsi-bility for the High Commission territories. This last argument, thoughit could not be used publicly, might have some effect on those Gfovern-ment supporters who had been favourably impressed with Tshekedi&apos;sstatement of his case.The Cabinet agreed that special steps should be taken to explain to Government supporters the importance of ensuring the rejection of this motion. The order of business in the House of commons should be rearranged so as to enable a meeting of the parliamentary labour Party to be held before the motion was debated. The argu-ments in support of the Governmenfs policy should also be explainedprivately to some of the Government supporters who would be most reluctant to vote against the motion. Two Ministers should speak on behalf of the Government in the debate: either the Prime minister or the Secretary of State for the Colonies might join the Secretaryof State for Commonwealth Relations in putting the Governmenfscase before the House.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Home Secretary to arrange for a meeting of theParliamentary Labour Party to be held before this motionwas debated in the House of Commons.(2) Asked the Home Secretary, the Secretary of State for Com-commonwealth Relations and the Chief Whip to arrange thatthe arguments in favour of the Governmenfs policy were fully explained, before the debate, to those government supporters who would be most reluctant to vote againstthe motion.(3) Invited the Secretary of State for Commonwealth relations to consult the Prime Minister regarding the choice of thesecond Government spokesman in the debate.Festival of 3.   The Lord Privy Seal said that in the forthcoming debate onBritain. the Festival of Britain Bill he was likely to be asked whether it was(Previous intended that the Festival Gardens should continue in operation afterReference : the end of the Festival.  The Gardens had proved popular and wereCM. (51) 32nd now showing, an average profit of about  20;000 a week. If they were conclusions, to; continue in operation after the Festival ended in September, someMinute 3.) statement to that effect should be made before Parliament rose at theend of July.40835 B 2
The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that the London CountyCouncil would be willing to promote legislation enabling them to operate the Festival Gardens on a permanent basis. In.that eventsome arrangement should be made for the Treasury to recover thebalance of their original expenditure on the Gardens which had notbeen recouped before the Festival ended.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Lord Privy Seal to ascertain informally whetherthe London County Council were prepared to take overthe operation of the Festival Gardens after the end ofthe Festival, and whether the Battersea Borough council were agreeable that they should do so; and, if the twoCouncils were in favour of this course, authorised him tostate in the forthcoming debate in the House of commons that the Government viewed with sympathy the suggestionthat the Gardens should continue in operation after theend of the Festival.(2) Agreed that the Lord Privy Seal should move the SecondReading of the Festival of Britain Bill and, with the leave of the House, should also reply to the debate.4. The Foreign Secretary informed the Cabinet of the latest developments in the Persian situation. In view of the intransigentattitude of the Persian Government the negotiations between themand the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company had been broken off, and theCompany&apos;s delegation had been instructed to return to this country.The Company had been advised that for the present they should not take the initiative in stopping their operations in Persia; but, if no tankers left Abadan, the storage tanks on the island would becomefilled within about a fortnight and the Company&apos;s European staffcould then be withdrawn gradually from the oil-fields and concen-trated in Abadan. Further aircraft were now being made available,in order that the evacuation of the Company&apos;s employees fromAbadan might be carried out more quickly, if it became necessary.The Company had been instructed that they should make no payment to the Persian Government for oil delivered to their tankers attd thatthey should withdraw their tankers from Abandan as soon as it became clear that such a demand was to be made. All practicable steps would be taken to prevent the Company&apos;s customers from buyingoil from the Persian Government. The Treasury were taking stepsto-prevent the Persian Government from converting any of their sterling holdings into dollars. There had been a hostile demonstra-tion that morning at the Company&apos;s offices in Tehran; it was reported that crowds of Persians had broken into the offices, but thatno personal violence had been used against employees of theCompany.In discussion the following points were raised:  (a) The necessary military preparations had been made for theevacuation of British nationals from Abadan. This was a relatively small operation. A much larger operation would, however, berequired if the refinery at Abadan was to be held against activemilitary opposition by the Persians; and it would be some little time before the forces necessary for this larger operation could be assembled. Moreover, there would be serious political risks in authorising military intervention for the purpose of protecting british property in Persia. The United States Government had indicated thatthey would not be prepared to support such action, and it was unlikely to command general support among other Commonwealth Govern-ments. If we took this course and the Persian Government brought the situation before the Security Council, we should find it difficultto defend our action and were likely to have few supporters.Persia.(PreviousRefereace:CM. (51) 37thConclusions,Minute 3.)
Emergency Acts.(previous reference:CM. (50) 44thConclusions,Minute 3.)5. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the HomeSecretary (CP. (51) 170) reporting that a Divisional Court of theKing&apos;s Bench Division might decide in the following week that theNational Registration Act, 1939, was no longer in force, and drawing attention to the need which would then arise for retrospective legis-lation validating action taken under a number of emergency statutes.The Cabinet agreed that the necessary Bill should be preparedwithout delay, so that it would be available for immediate intro-duction if the decision of the Court were adverse.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (51) 170.subversive activities.(previous reference :CM. (50) 76thConclusions,Minute 7.)6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Attorney-General (CP. (51) 167) suggesting that, if he decided not to prosecuteMrs. Monica Felton for treason in connection with her visit to north korea, he should state, in reply to questions on the subject, thatthe Government were considering what changes should be made inthe law regarding various types of subversive activity.The Attorney-General said that there had been a series of incidents (of which Mrs. Felton&apos;s visit to North Korea was unlikely to be the last) in which British subjects had consorted with authoritiesagainst whom hostilities were being conducted in Korea. Publicindignation would grow if it were felt that no action was being takento check such conduct. He therefore wished to be authorised to saythat the Government were considering what changes should be madein the existing law. Consideration might be given to a provision which would make it an offence for a British subject to go to countries,(b) It was suggested that by a show of force we might avert theneed for positive military intervention. Would it not be wise to bring up some stronger naval forces into the neighbourhood of Abadan?(c) Was it not desirable that further steps should now be takento concentrate the European employees of the Company at Abadan?The Cabinet were informed that instructions had already been givenfor the evacuation of the families of these employees. The withdrawalof the employees themselves could not be further accelerated without serious risk of causing fires or explosions in the oil-fields; and thegroup of Ministers which had been keeping the situation under review on the Cabinefs behalf had not thought it expedient that this riskshould be taken at the present time.(d) Had not the time come to stop exports, e.g., of steel rails, to persia? The Cabinet were informed that this point had been underconsideration by the Ministers concerned. Such action was likelyto stiffen public opinion in Persia against any compromise on the oil question; and it seemed likely that it was the state of public opinionthat was now the main factor in preventing the Persian government from accepting any compromise. This action should, however, betaken as soon as it was clear that there was no longer any hope of -reaching a compromise on the main issue. Thus, the moment whenthe tankers h*d to be moved from Abadan would probably be an appropriate time at which to stop exports from this country to Persia.It was suggested that, in the meantime, shipment of these exportsmight be delayed; and The Chancellor of the Exchequer undertook to consider this suggestion.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s statement and of thepoints raised in the discussion.
)Raw Materials. 7. The Chancellor of the Exchequer said that he had circulated(Previous to the Economic Policy Committee a memorandum (E.P.C. (51) 61)Reference: on the measures necessary to deal with the high cost of raw materialsCM. (51) 14th imported into this country. It was, however, a matter of urgencyConclusions, that he should have authority to ask the United States GovernmentMinute 3.)       to enter into negotiations about the stabilisation of the prices of rawmaterials at levels which in the longer term would permit an equi-librium of supply and demand.The Cabinet-Agreed that the United States Government should be askedto enter into negotiations about the stabilisation of the pricesof raw materials.Germany. 8.   The Cabinet considered the text (reproduced in Paris telegramSoviet Proposal No. 166 of 20th Jmie) of the Soviet reply to the latest note from the for a Meeting three Western Powers. In this the Soviet Government insisted thatof Foreign there should be no meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers unlessMinisters. the North Atlantic Treaty and American military bases formed one(Previous of the items on the agenda; they offered to discuss at such a meetingReference: their Treaties of mutual assistance with China, their satellites in. (51) 44th Eastern Europe, France and the United Kingdom; and they urgedConclusions,1 that the Foreign Ministers&apos; Deputies should continue their discussionsMinute 4.)       in Paris with a view to reaching agreement on an agenda including(as a disagreed item) the North Atlantic Treaty and the american military bases.The Foreign Secretary said that it was proposed that the replyto this note should be made in an oral statement at a meeting of the deputies in Paris, in a form which had been agreed in advance betweenthe three Western Powers and was suitable for subsequent publication.He read to the Cabinet a draft of this proposed statement.such as North Korea, against which hostilities were being conducted by United Kingdom forces, and the clause against subversive publica-tions which had been drafted in connection with the OverseasOperations (Security of Forces) Bill should be examined again.In discussion it was suggested that there might be a good case for a statutory Power to question and detain suspected persons, onthe lines of the war-time Defence Regulation 18 D.There was general agreement that the question of strengthening the law to deal with subversive activities should be examined afresh,probably by a Cabinet Committee. If the Attorney-General promisedconsideration of the law on the subject, on the lines suggested inparagraph 6 of CP. (51) 167, the Government would be more or lesscommitted to introducing legislation, although experience suggestedthat the prospects of passing legislation of this kind depended verymuch on the temper of Parliamentary and public opinion at the time.It was therefore desirable that the point should be mentioned to thePrime Minister, so that he might either approve the proposed state-ment or arrange to have the matter discussed further by the Cabinet.-   The Cabinet Subject to the Prime Ministers agreement, approved theproposal in paragraph 6 of CP. (51) 167 that the Attorney-General should state, in answer to questions in the Houseof Commons, that the Government were considering whetherchanges should be made in the existing law regarding sub-versive activities.
99CM. 45 (54)       221In discussion of this draft the following points were made:  (a) It was important that a further attempt should be made tomake clear to the public the basis of the distinction which we were seeking to draw between discussing the North Atlantic Treaty at ameeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers and allowing it to appearas a separate item on the agenda for such a meeting. Essentially, ourposition was that this subject could be brought up for discussion, butnot for decision, by the Council of Foreign Ministers. It seemed desirable that, in replying to this latest Soviet note, we should makeit clear that we had always recognised that the North Atlantic Treatymight be discussed under the first item on the agenda, but that wewere not prepared to agree that the Treaty should be placed formallyon the agenda in a manner implying that it was a subject on whichthe Council of Foreign Ministers were competent to take decisions.(b) It was - significant that the Soviet Government had not suggested that their Treaties of mutual assistance should be placedon the agenda. They had stated merely that, if the other Powerswished to have these Treaties discussed, they would raise no objection.Yet they were still insisting that the North Atlantic Treaty should form a separate item on the agenda, and should not merely come upfor discussion at the meeting. Attention might perhaps be drawn tothis in our reply in support of the point noted in paragraph (a) above.(c) Some Ministers again emphasised the importance of ensuring that, if the project for a meeting of Foreign Ministers had to be abandoned, the responsibility for the breakdown should be clearlyseen to rest with the Soviet Government. From this point of view itwas arguable that the project should not be finally abandoned untilthe four Foreign Ministers had themselves tried to reach agreement on an agenda.The Foreign Secretary said that the last note from the western powers had made it sufficiently clear that the Foreign Ministers ofthe three Western Powers were sincerely anxious that a meeting ofthe Council of Foreign Ministers should be held. Moreover, it wasnot proposed that the Deputies&apos; discussions should be finally termination-nated, but only that they should be adjourned while a further attempt was made to secure agreement through diplomatic channels. If thediscussions in Paris were adjourned, he had it in mind that, subjectto the Prime Ministers concurrence, he should make a broadcaststatement, in which he would take the opportunity of making it plainwhere the responsibility for any breakdown would lie.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary to consider how the points noted in paragraphs (a) and (b) above could best be incor-porated in the reply which was to be returned to the Sovietnote embodied in Paris telegram No. 166 of 20th June.(2) Agreed that, subject to conclusion (1) above, the reply tothis Soviet note might follow the lines of the draft whichthe Foreign Secretary had read to the Cabinet, and took note that this reply would be made in an oral statement at a meeting of the Deputies in Paris.Japanese Peace 9. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the ForeignTreaty. . Secretary (CP. (51) 166) seeking approval for a revised draft of the(Previous        Japanese Peace Treaty.^Reference *CM (51)44th The Fbreign Secretary said that the revised draft gave effect to conclusions     tne decisions which the Cabinet had reached in recent discussionsMinute 5) &apos;     about the provisions of the Treaty.   He had discussed with theMinister of Transport the steps to be taken to prevent any revival of the unfair practices previously used by the Japanese against British. shipping. Talks were taking place in Tokyo on this issue, and it might
be necessary to insert a provision in the Treaty that the Japaneseshould not engage in discrimination in the carriage of their goodsby sea.The Cabinet Approved the revised draft of the Japanese Peace Treatyset out in Annex B to CP. (51) 166.Yugoslavia. 10.   The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theEconomic Foreign Secretary (CP. (51) 160) seeking approval for recommenda-Assistance. tions made by officials of the United Kingdom, United States and(Previous French Governments about economic relations with Yugoslavia, and reference: asking for authority to seek Parliamentary sanction for a united cm.
