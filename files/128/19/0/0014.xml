War Pensions. 1.   On 16th February the House of Commons was to discuss a(Previous private Member&apos;s motion inviting the Government to review the ratesReference: of war pensions in the light of the increased cost of living. the cm. (48) 65th Legislation Committee had agreed on 13th February that the Govern-Conclusions, ment spokesmen on this occasion, while dealing sympatheticallyMinute l.)       with the representations made in the debate, should be careful toavoid committing the Government to any increase in war pensions.They had invited the Minister of Pensions to discuss, with TreasuryMinisters and the Minister of National Insurance, the precise line which the Government spokesmen should take.The Minister of Pensions said that there were differences of viewamong the associations representing ex-Servicemen: some favoured an increase in the flat rate of war pensions, while others would preferincreases in the supplementary allowances. These differences were likely to be reflected in the debate, and this would make it easier for him to refrain from going beyond a fairly general assurance that the Government would consider sympathetically the points whichhad been raised. He indicated to the Cabinet the general lines onwhich he was proposing to speak. The terms of the motion itself were such that the Government could accept it.The Minister of National Insurance pointed out that any con-cession to war pensioners would have repercussions on the ratesof benefit under the industrial injuries scheme.The Chancellor of the Exchequer agreed that the motion couldbe accepted. It was, however, most important that the Governmentshould not be committed to any increase in war pensions, whichwould have very serious repercussions on other rates of benefit, andthat nothing should be said in the debate which would arouse falsehopes. He had not yet had an opportunity of considering in detail the statement which the Minister of Pensions was proposing to make.The Cabinet Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer to settle, in con-sultation with the Ministers of Pensions and national insurance, the detailed terms of the statement to be madeon the Governments behalf in reply to the debate on warpensions which was to take place in the House of commons on the following day.Parliament 2.   The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in business in      the House of Commons in the following week.the House of On 22nd February a prayer would be moved for the rejectionCommons. of the Order, under the Ministers of the Crown (Transfer of Functions)Act, redistributing the functions of the Minister of Health and theMinister of Local Government. It was understood that theOpposition would argue on this occasion that responsibility for thehousing programme should not rest with the Minister of LocalGovernment. The Cabinet agreed that the Lord President should reply to this debate on behalf of the Government.Business in The Lord Privy Seal said that in the House of Lords on the pre-the House of vious day a strong case had been made for an increase in the salariesLords. of county court fudges;  and he had felt obliged to accept a motioncalling upon the Government to give earnest consideration to thisquestion.On 13th February the House of Lords had carried the Transport(Amendment) Bill. This Bill, which had been introduced as a private member&apos;s Bill and passed against the advice of the Government,would prejudice the road-haulage activities of the British transport commission. The Cabinet agreed that the Bill should be blocked inthe House of Commons.
Sulphur. 3.   The President of the Board of Trade said that, in view of later(Previous telegrams from H.M. Ambassador in Washington, there now seemedReference: to be less urgent need for a high-level approach to the United StatesCM. (51) 12th Government on the supply of sulphur to the United Kingdom. ThereConclusions, appeared to be a rather better prospect of co-operation between the minute 6.) various agencies of the United States Government which were con-cerned with this problem.The Chancellor of the Exchequer suggested that, in the meantime,the United Kingdom. Departments concerned should examine thepoints which had been raised by the representative of the economic co-operation Mission in London in support of the suggestion that united Kingdom requirements for sulphur were excessive. These hadbeen reported in Washington telegram No. 463 of 13th February.The Cabinet took note of the position.Germany.soviet proposal fora Meeting ofthe Council of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 13thConclusions,Minute 3.)4. The Minister of State said that the United States Governmenthad now put forward a draft reply to the latest note from the SovietGovernment regarding their proposal for a meeting of the Council ofForeign Ministers. Tne text of this draft was set out in washington telegram No. 474 of 14th February, and some comments on it byH.M. Ambassador in Washington were given in his telegram No. 473of the same date.In discussion of these two telegrams the following points were raised:  (a) The United States draft was somewhat stiffer in tone than the reply which the Minister of State had proposed in paragraphs 8 and of CP. (51) 48. This general comment should be communicated with.M. Ambassador, for his guidance in the discussion of specificamendments.(b) The draft included the specific proposal that the ministerial meeting of the Four Powers should be held in Washington; and it was understood that this was proposed because the United States Secretaryof State was anxious that the meeting should be held in a place where he would have the full support of United States public opinion.The Cabinet felt doubtful about this proposal, and still moredoutful about the reasons underlying it. It was in their view un-desirable that Ministers attending the meeting should be subject to the pressures of United States public opinion. H.M. Ambassador in washington should therefore be instructed to press strongly that the reply to the Soviet note should include no reference to the venue ofthe Ministerial meeting. He should urge that this question should be reserved for discussion in the preliminary talks between the officials who were to draw up the agenda for the meeting.(c) Paragraph 2 of the draft reply, in referring to the members ofthe German Federal Government, said that their &quot; records of opposi-tion to the Nazi regime were well known to the Soviet Government.&quot;Was it true that all the members of that Government had this record?And, in any event, was it necessary to make this complimentary refer-ence to them? Was it not preferable that this phrase should be omitted?The Cabinet agreed that H.M. Ambassador should suggest the omission of this phrase, but need not press the suggestion too faragainst United States opposition.(d) In paragraph 3 of the draft it was stated that &quot; the german problem, including consideration of a German contribution to thedefence of Western Europe, is not the cause of the present tension inEurope.&quot;The Cabinet agreed that H.M. Ambassador should suggest thatthis sentence should be omitted. If he could not secure its omission,he should urge very strongly that it should be altered so as to statethat this was &quot; not the only cause &quot; of the present tension.
5. The Minister of Labour said that in the Defence debate inthe House of Commons that day the Government might be pressed to make some statement on the question whether Yugoslavia couldbe given some further assurance that she would receive military support if she became the victim of Soviet aggression. Could he beauthorised to make any statement on this point in replying to the debate?In discussion it was agreed&apos; that, if this point were pressed, theMinister of Labour might make a statement to the general effect that under the United Nations Charter Yugoslavia had the same protection against aggression as any other nation and that, if any furtherassurance was required, this would not be a matter which the UnitedKingdom Government could handle unilaterally but one which theywould need to discuss with their friends.The Cabinet-Invited the Minister of State to arrange for the ForeignOffice to provide the Minister of Labour with a form of words, on the general lines indicated in the cabinets discussion, which he could use if it became necessary for himto refer to Yugoslavia when speaking in the Defence debate in the House of Commons that evening.6. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLocal Government and the President of the Board of Trade (CP.(51) 37) setting out the proposals of the Committee on distribution and Marketing for dealing with resale price maintenance.The President of the Board of Trade said that the CabinetCommittee on Distribution and Marketing and his Department haddevoted a good deal of time to this complicated question. a departmental committee had reported in 1949 in favour of the pro-hibition of collective, as distinct from individual, resale price maintenance. This would have involved a rather elaborate machineryfor administrative supervision and the Cabinet Committee had reached the conclusion that resale price maintenance in all formsshould be prohibited. It would doubtless be argued that this wasaimed against branded goods, and it was therefore proposed to prohibit, in addition, the methods by which the practice was enforced.An out-right prohibition should be popular with consumers when theyunderstood its implications, and the co-operative societies would be strongly in favour of it. If the Cabinet gave general approval to theproposals in CP. (51) 37, the first step should be the preparation of a white Paper setting out the Governments proposals, and he had it inmind that this might be published before Easter.The Minister of Local Government said that the prohibition ofresale price maintenance would be in the public interest.   TheYugoslavia.(previous reference:CM. (50) 66thConclusions,Minute 2.)Resale price maintenance.(e) In paragraph 4 of the draft it was stated that the free nations of the world had been compelled &quot; for their own survival &quot; to increasethe strength of their armed forces. This statement was too extreme.H.M. Ambassador should press for the deletion of the words &quot; fortheir own survival &quot; or, failing that, for the substitution of some suchphrase as &quot; for their own security.&quot;The Cabinet (1) Invited the Minister of State to convey to H.M. ambassador in Washington the views expressed by the Cabinet on thepoints noted in paragraphs (a)-(e) above.(2) Agreed that, subject to amendment on these points, the draftset out in Washington telegram No. 474 of 14th Februarymight be adopted as a basis for the reply to the latest note from the Soviet Government.
Monopolies Commission were moving more slowly than had been hoped, but their report on dental goods had shown how vicious were some of the present practices relating to resale price maintenance,and their forthcoming report on builders&apos; castings would no doubtdisclose similar abuses in that industry. He hoped that the cabinet would decide that the projected legislation should include a provisiondeclaring discrimination unlawful and providing for civil remedies.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) A prohibition of resale price maintenance would secure agreater measure of competition in the distributive trades. The general effect should be to reduce prices and so to offset to some extent thepresent rise in the cost of living. It would help the self-service shops,established by the co-operative societies and others, by enabling themto sell branded and packaged goods at a lower price than the ordinaryretailer, which they could afford to do because of their lower running costs.(b) The prohibition of resale price maintenance would be strongly opposed by the associations of manufacturers and distributorswho operated collective resale price maintenance. It would be argued that the Government were discouraging branded goods, which werepopular with the public, but this argument could be rebutted byemphasising those aspects of the Governments proposals whichwere aimed against the undesirable practices by which fixed prices were maintained.(c) Although the legal position would have to be further ex-plored, there was a prima facie case for including in any legislationa provision declaring discrimination to be unlawful and providing for civil remedies. Statutory provisions directed against discriminationhad been common in railway legislation.(d) The question was raised whether the prohibition of fixed prices might not lead to higher prices being charged when supplies were scarce or in areas where the costs of distribution were high. Theinterests supporting resale price maintenance would make much ofthe argument that, under the present arrangements, branded goods were sold at the same price in a distant village store as in the townin which they were made. In reply, it was pointed out that corn-petition between retailers should operate to prevent higher pricesbeing charged than were justified by economic considerations, and thatmanufacturers might in some cases fix maximum prices in their own interests. In the last resort, price control might have to be invokedif conditions of scarcity were being exploited.(e) The direct and indirect effects which might flow from any statutory provisions, and the manner in which these provisions mightbe circumvented, would have to be carefully examined before any bill was introduced.(/) The Minister of Health in consultation with the Presidentof the Board of Trade, was preparing an Order under the monopolies and Restrictive Practices (Enquiry and Control) Act to give effectto recommendations made by the Monopolies Commission in theirreport on dental goods.The Cabinet (1) Approved in principle the proposals in CP. (51) 37 for pro-prohibiting collective measures to enforce resale price maintenance and the indication of resale prices by indi-vidual suppliers.(2) Agreed that the practicability of introducing a provision, ideclaring discrimination in the supply of goods to beunlawful and providing for civil remedies, should befurther explored.(3) Invited the President of the Board of Trade to submit to theCabinet at an early date the draft of a White Paper explain-ing the Governments policy in regard to resale price&apos; maintenance.
nationalisation of PublicWater Supplies.(previous reference:CM. (50) 52ndConclusions,Minute 6.)7. The Cabinet considered a memorandum by the Minister ofLocal Government (CP. (51) 50) proposing that he should indicate tothe associations of local authorities that the Government contem-plated dealing with the future organisation of water supplies along the lines outlined in CP. (5.1) 13 and that he should now invite theviews of the associations on these proposals.The Minister of Local Government said that he believed that theproposals which the Minister of Labour, when responsible for water supplies, had put forward in CP. (51) 13 would satisfy those who wished to see a national plan for water supplies and those who were concerned lest the local authorities should lose all their responsibilities -ties in this matter. He was strongly attracted by the substantial reduction in the cost of rural water supplies, at small additional costto urban supplies, which would be secured by this scheme. He didnot wish at this stage to be committed to all the details of the scheme,but he desired to put it in broad outline to the local authorities andto elicit their views .In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The Chancellor, of the Exchequer wished to be assured thatthe area authorities would be self-supporting, and that the scheme would not impose any new financial burden on the Exchequer. TheMinister of Labour said that, in the initial stages, the exchequer should be prepared to give grants which would meet, or at any ratelessen, the increased charges which the scheme would impose onconsumers in urban areas. Since the scheme was not to extend to scotland, it would be unreasonable that people living in Scottishtowns should receive their supplies at the present rates and that thecharges in rural areas in Scotland should be subsidised by theExchequer, while in England any additional cost of providing ruralsupplies would fall on the urban consumers. The Minister of LocalGovernment said that, while he recognised the difficulties involved,he appreciated that the Chancellor of the Exchequer would not inpresent circumstances wish to accept additional financial burdens.He was therefore prepared to give an assurance that the scheme would be operated in a way which did not involve any additional costto the Exchequer.(b) The present organisation of water supplies was failing toprovide adequate supplies at a reasonable cost in the rural areas.This Objective could not be achieved without the constitution of larger authorities including both urban and rural areas. So long as local authorities were given a larger share in administration thanthey had been given in respect of gas and electricity supplies,any claims which they could fairly put forward would be met.(c) The compensation arrangements in respect of local authority and private water undertakings would be along the same lines asthose devised when gas and electricity supplies were brought under national ownership.(d) Local authorities had become seriously disquieted about theloss of so many of their trading functions. The growing resistance to area transport schemes, under which local authorities would lose their transport undertakings, illustrated the stiffening of localauthority opposition to schemes of the kind envisaged in CP. (51) 13.Local authorities had been responsible for water supplies for avery long period, and 80 per cent, of the water supplies in thecountry were already under public control. Local authorities tookgreat pride in their water undertakings and might be expected tooffer strong resistance to a transfer of ownership to the Minister ofLocal Government. They had lost so many functions in recent yearsthat there was a serious risk that the quality of local administration would deteriorate because the duties left to them would not be suffiently important to attract the right type of people, either a selected representatives or as officers.
(e) Since the ownership of all the capital assets, including reser-* voirs, plant and mains, would be vested in the Minister, and sincethe Minister would be responsible for carrying out schemes for newsupplies, doubt was expressed whether the proposed area authorities would have a sufficient field of responsibility. Local authorities would not willingly nominate representatives to serve on bodies which did little more than determine the supplementary charges, above anynational minimum charge, to be levied in their area and collect water rates. There was need for a clearer and more detailed definition of the responsibilities which would fall on the Minister and those whichwould fall on an area authority. Persons living in rural areas might feel that a distant area authority would be less amenable to the irrepresentations than the rural district council serving their area.(/) If it were thought desirable to leave local authorities with agreater measure of responsibility than was contemplated in CP.(51) .13, progress might be made by bringing the private watercompanies under public ownership, by providing for larger water authorities (either by way of joint boards or by arrangements on thelines of those operated under the Fire Services Act, 1947) and by giving the Minister greater powers to enforce amalgamations of authorities in proper cases.(g) The Lord Advocate said that, as indicated when the cabinet had previously discussed the matter, the Secretary of State forScotland did not recommend that the scheme in CP. 51 (13) shouldbe applied to Scotland, where for all practical purposes water supplies were already wholly under public ownership.The Minister of Local Government said that, in the light ofthe Cabinefs discussion, he would propose to meet the associations of local authorities and to inform them that, in view of the defectsof the present organisation of public water supplies, he had been considering favourably a scheme on the lines outlined in CP. (5.1) 13.He would invite the associations to express their views on these pro-posals and, if they so desired, to put forward alternative suggestions.He would then bring the matter back to the Cabinet.The Cabinet-Agreed that the Minister of Local Government should approach the associations of local authorities about thefuture organisation of public water supplies in England andWales, on the lines indicated above.PermanentEconomicPowers.(previous reference:CM. (50) 70thConclusions,Minute 3.)8. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the lord president (CP. (51) 52) proposing that the Full Employment Billshould not be introduced in present circumstances.The Cabinet Agreed that in present circumstances it would not be appro-priate to proceed to the introduction of the Full Employ-ment Bill.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,15th February, 1951.
