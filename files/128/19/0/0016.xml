Parliament.Business inthe House ofCommons.North atlantic treaty.command organisation.1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.2. The Cabinet discussed the political difficulties which had arisen from the premature disclosure of the decision to appointAdmiral William M. Fechteler as Supreme Allied Commander,Atlantic, under the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation.The Cabinet were informed that throughout their planning of command organisation in a future war the Chiefs of Staff had alwaysfavoured the creation of a unified naval command for the Atlantic.They had also considered that it would be to our advantage if this postwere held by an American Admiral; for they thought that this would help to ensure that a sufficient proportion of American naval forces would be committed to the eastern half of the Atlantic. The views ofthe Chiefs of Staff on this point had been approved in principle by the then Minister of Defence as long ago as 1949. The proposals that a supreme Allied Commander, Atlantic Ocean, should be appointed andthat he should be an American Admiral had been approved by theNorth Atlantic Defence Committee at their meeting in washington in October, 1950 ; and at their meetings in Brussels in December, 1950,the North Atlantic Defence Committee and the North Atlantic council had approved a report which recommended the appointment of a supreme Commander, Atlantic, though without specifying that heshould be an American. The Foreign Secretary and The Minister ofDefence said that these proposals were contained in agreed reports which were adopted at the Washington and Brussels Meetings withoutdiscussion ; and that neither of them had at that stage given personalattention to these particular proposals or to their political implications.It was unfortunate that news of this appointment should havebeen disclosed prematurely, before the full picture of the command organisation under the North Atlantic Treaty could be announced.If it could have been seen in proper perspective, against the back-ground of the other appointments yet to be made, it might have beenpossible to demonstrate that the command organisation as a wholemaintained a reasonable balance between the twelve member Statesof the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. Moreover, if the newscould have been withheld until an official announcement was made,more effective use could have been made of the fact that in a futurewar 50 per cent, of the total naval strength in the Atlantic would beprovided by the United States, as compared with 40 per cent, by theUnited Kingdom and 10 per cent, by Canada. Some Ministersconsidered that, even so, it would have been difficult to satisfy publicopinion in this country that the Supreme naval command in the atlantic should be held by an American.In further discussion the point was made that the approval of theDefence Committee or the Cabinet should have been sought before any commitment was accepted which obliged the United KingdomGovernment to support this proposal. It was evident that greatercare was needed to ensure that North Atlantic Treaty business which involved political considerations was brought forward for collectivediscussion by Ministers. Possibly there was need for closer liaison between the military and political advisers of the Government in thesematters. Alternatively, there might be room for some additionalmachinery within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation to scrutinisemilitary proposals from the angle of the political and constitutional difficulties which they might involve for member Governments. Closerattention would also have to be given in future to the method of presenting such decisions to public opinion in this country.Meanwhile, this question was to be discussed in the foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords that afternoon. The First Lord of the
Admiralty should defend the appointment and invite the House to suspend judgment until they had been able to see the full picture ofthe command organisation to be established by the North atlantic treaty Powers. If he were pressed to present a White Paper defining the powers and duties of Admiral Fechteler, he could promise thatsuch a White Paper would be presented as soon as the terms of theAdmiraPs directive had been settled.The question was also likely to be raised in the House ofCommons in the debate on the Navy Estimates on 8th March. Itwould be preferable that this discussion should be postponed untilthe other appointments to be made in the North Atlantic Treatycommand organisation could be announced. It was agreed that theLord President should ascertain whether the Conservative opposition would be willing to agree to such a postponement: if necessary, theArmy Estimates might be discussed on 8th March instead of the navy estimates.The Cabinet (1) Invited the Foreign Secretary and the Minister of Defence to circulate to the Cabinet a report on the proceedings at the brussels meetings of the North Atlantic DefenceCommittee and the North Atlantic Council in December,1950, and on the command organisation to be established under the North Atlantic Treaty.(2) Invited the First Lord of the Admiralty to speak in the debate in the House of Lords that afternoon, on the lines indicatedin the Cabinefs dis -ussion.(3) Took note that the Lord President would discuss with theleaders of the Conservative Opposition the possibility of postponing discussion of this - question in the House ofCommons until it had been possible to announce theother appointments to be made in the North Atlanticcommand organisation.PacificDefence.Q?previous reference:CM. (51) 13thConclusions,Minute 2.)3. The Cabinet considered a note by the Prime Minister (CP.(51) 64) covering a memorandum on a draft tripartite treaty for mutual defence between the United States, Australia and New Zea-land, which had been prepared for consideration by the three Govern-ments during Mr. Dulles&apos; talks with Australian and New ZealandMinisters at Canberra on 15th-17th February.The Prime Minister said that the treaty now suggested was agreat improvement on the &quot; island chain &quot; proposal previously putforward by Mr. Dulles. It would meet the desire of Australia andNew Zealand for guarantees in the Pacific, and would be to our advantage as making them more willing to meet their commitments for the defence of the Middle East. The Prime Minister of Aus-tralia had explained the great importance which his government attached to the conclusion of such a treaty, and had invited the UnitedKingdom Government to help the Australian and New zealand governments to secure its completion. The United States Govern-ment were anxious that the Philippines should be included as anadditional party to the treaty, but they should be urged not to press for this extension, which would at once raise the question of extend-ing the treaty to other territories, including our own Colonial terri-tories, in South-East Asia. The exclusion of the United kingdom from the treaty would have political disadvantages, which were men-tioned in the paper ; but the counter-balancing advantages seemedgreater, and it was proposed that we should now inform the Govern-ments of Australia and New Zealand that a treaty On these lines would be acceptable to us, making it clear that we should much preferit to be confined to the three original signatories.
The Chief of the Imperial General Staff said that the Chiefs ofStaff supported the views which had been expressed by the PrimeMinister.Discussion showed that, opinion in the Cabinet was divided onthe expediency of acquiescing in the conclusion of a treaty on theselines, to which the United Kingdom Government would not be a party.   The following points were made in favour of the treaty :  (a) The Australian Government were pressing us strongly tosupport it. They had already misjudged our attitude to the &quot; islandchain &quot; proposal, and had assumed that we were opposed to anyattempt by them to obtain United States guarantees of their security in the Pacific. It was important that we should give no further oppor-tunity for misunderstanding of our attitude. The conclusion of sucha treaty would, be fully in accord with modern conceptions of thenature of the Commonwealth : Australia and New Zealand would beundertaking responsibilities for the protection of commonwealth interests in the Pacific, as the United Kingdom and Canada wereundertaking such responsibilities in the Atlantic area through their membership of the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation. In addition,this guarantee of United States assistance in the Far East would makeit easier for Australia and New Zealand to accept defence commit-ments in the Middle East.(b) A treaty on these lines would avoid the difficult problems raised by any proposal for joint participation by Australia and japan in arrangements for Pacific defence. The treaty, by safeguardingAustralia against Japanese aggression, would make the australian government more willing to accept some measure of japanese rearmament.(c) The treaty could not be enlarged to include the United King-dom without opening the way to the inclusion of other countries,including our Colonial territories, in the Far East and South-east asia. There was no likelihood that the United States Governmentwould be willing to assume any responsibility for the defence of thesecountries.(d) The United Kingdom Government ought not to enter into further commitments in the Far East without very carefully examiningtheir extent and implications. It seemed unlikely that we should beable to carry out obligations for the defence of the Pacific area of thenature envisaged in the treaty.The following arguments were advanced against the conclusionof a treaty on these lines from which the United Kingdom wasexcluded:  (e) There was a clear need for the conclusion of a comprehensivePacific pact similar to the North Atlantic Treaty; but it would be premature, and would obstruct the later conclusion of comprehensivearrangements for mutual defence in the Pacific, to agree now to alimited treaty which excluded not only the United Kingdom but many other countries vitally concerned with defence in the Far East.(/) Our exclusion from the treaty would be regarded at homeand abroad as evidence that we were abandoning our interests in theFar East, and would have a most adverse influence on our position in malaya and Hong Kong. It would also be regarded as a. furtherexample of undue dependence on the United States.(g) It should be possible to devise some means of associating theUnited Kingdom with the treaty without altering its purpose ordestroying its advantages. Rather than acquiesce in our exclusion, weshould explain to the Australian and New Zealand Governments thedifficulties which it would raise, and invite further consideration of theproblems involved. It should not be taken for granted that theassociation of the United Kingdom with the treaty must necessarily involved its extension to Malaya and Hong Kong.
The Cabinet-^Agreed&quot; to defer further consideration of their attitudetowards the proposed tripartite treaty between the government -ments of the United States, Australia and New Zealand.C.M.C51) 16th Meeting.    Item kisj closeduntil2002
T     82Germany.Soviet.Proposal fora Meeting ofthe Councilof foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 14thConclusions,Minute 4.)&apos;5. TheCabinet had before them a memorandum by, the Ministerof State (CP. (51) 60) outlining the instructions to be given to theUnited Kingdom representative at the preliminary conference whichwas to.discuss the agenda for the proposed Meeting of the Councilof Foreign Ministers.The Minister of State said that the Soviet reply to the latestnote from the three Western Powers was likely to be received duringthe course of the day; but he was asking the Cabinet to consider his memorandum before&apos; the receipt of that note since it was contem-plated that the preliminary conference would open in Paris on 5th March. In the Three-Power talks which had been held in washington in preparation for that conference, few concrete proposals had emerged for subjects to be included on the agenda: the americans had suggested that the Austrian Treaty should be placed high on theagenda, as a test of Russia&apos;s sincerity, and the French wished to addthe Peace Treaties with Russia&apos;s satellites in Eastern Europe. he himself thought it important that the first item on the agenda shouldbe so phrased that the Western Powers could embark at the outseton a general discussion of all those aspects of Soviet policy whichcontributed to the present state of international tension. It was also desirable that the agenda should be short and limited to a few broadquestions.The Foreign Secretary said that he hoped that some means mightbe found of calling into question at the Ministerial meeting the Soviettechnique of fomenting civil war as a means of securing their endswithout open aggression. If we could define in advance the circum-stances in which we should feel compelled to regard such action astantamount to open war, the Soviet Government might thereby be deterred from making further use of this method of extending their influence.In this connection reference was made to the statement on yugoslavia which had been made by the Minister of Labour in replying to the debate in the House of Commons on 15th February.In the foreign affairs debate in the House of Lords that afternoon theLord Chancellor was likely to be asked whether he could give anyfurther assurance on this point. It was suggested that he might make some reference to the possibility of a non-aggression pact includingYugoslavia; but, after discussion, it was agreed that it would be preferable to leave it to the Foreign Secretary to consider whether he should take some early opportunity to make a statement on that subject. In the debate that afternoon the Lord Chancellor couldrepeat the statement made by the Minister of Labour on15th February, but should not go substantially beyond it.The Cabinet agreed that Mr. Ernest Davies should represent theUnited Kingdom Government in the preliminary conference in Paris,if the Lord President was satisfied that his absence from the House ofCommons during this period would not give rise to Parliamentarydifficulties. It was known that Lord Henderson&apos;s special responsibilitywithin the Foreign Office was for Germany; and an announcement that Lord Henderson was to represent the United Kingdom at thispreliminary meeting might seem inconsistent with our declaredobjective of ensuring that the agenda for the Ministerial meeting wasnot confined to German problems. .
The Cabinet:  (1) Agreed that, subject to the Lord Presidents further considera-tion of the Parliamentary position, Mr. Ernest Daviesshould represent the United Kingdom Government at thepreliminary conference which was to be held in Paris inthe following week to discuss the agenda for the proposed meeting of the Council of Foreign Ministers.(2) Approved the memorandum by the Minister of State (CP.(51) 60) as a basis for the instructions by which Mr.Ernest Davies would be guided at this conference.(3) Invited the Foreign Secretary to advise the Lord Chancellorwhat he might say on the question of Yugoslavia in the debate in the House of Lords that afternoon.Defence. 6.   The Minister of Defence said that, during the second readingCall-up of debate on the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Training) Bill, thereReservists. had been criticism of the provisions of Clause 6, which penalised(Previous persons who incited reservists to disobedience. The Service MinistersReference: had since reviewed this clause and favoured an amendment restrictingCM. (51) 12th its operation to the incitement of reservists who had received call-upConclusions, notices. The clause in its present form was much wider and mightMinute 3.) penalise pacifist appeals addressed to any of the several million ClassZ reservists who had not received call-up notices.The Attorney-General said that the Bill had been drafted on thebasis that Class Z reservists, like other reservists, were still membersof the Armed Forces. This he believed to be the correct interpretation of the existing law. It followed that anyone who tried to seduce a&apos; Class Z reservist from his duty, whether or not he was being called up for training on this occasion, committed an offence against theIncitement to Disaffection Act, 1934. Clause 6 of the Bill did not substantially alter the existing law, but it had been inserted to makeit clear to persons who might not otherwise be aware of the position that the incitement of any reservist to disobey a call-up notice was an offence attracting severe penalties. If an amendment were tabledon the lines proposed by the Minister of Defence the legal position which would result was not free from difficulty, but he believed thatthe Act of 1934 would retain its full effect and that the new provision would be merely declaratory. The Government would therefore beproposing an amendment which appeared to placate the critics ofthe clause, but would not have that effect in law, and this would bebrought to light in the course of the proceedings in the House ofCommons or at any rate in the House of Lords. He thought that theonly courses which would be free from legal objection were to leavethe clause in its present form, subject to relatively minor amendmentsbringing it more ciosely into line with the wording of the Act of 1934;or to withdraw the clause altogether, on the ground that the Act of1934 covered the position and that further legal provision was notrequired.In discussion it was pointed out that, whatever the legal position might be, Class Z reservists were not generally regarded as membersof the Armed Forces and persons of Communist or pacifist opinionswho addressed appeals to them were not aware that they might becommitting an offence under the Act of 1934. There was, however,general agreement that it was not practicable in present circumstances to deal with this situation in the only manner which would be satis-factory from the legal point of view, namely a provision expresslyexcluding from the operation of the Act of 1934 all reservists who hadnot&apos;received a call-up notice. The Communist threat was muchgreater than when that Act was passed, and a relaxation of the existing law would be open to misinterpretation. The right course was, there-fore, to make such relatively minor amendments in Clause 6 of the Bill
as were required to bring it into line with section 1 of the Act of 1934.For this purpose the words &quot; maliciously and advisedly &quot; should beinserted in the clause, and the provision penalising incitement toreservists to perform their duties otherwise than to the best of their ability might be omitted.The Cabinet:  Agreed that the Government should table amendments to clause 6 of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Training)Bill, designed to bring it more closely into line with theprovisions of section 1 of the Incitement to Disaffection Act,1934.Cabinet Office, S.W. 1,1st March, 1951.
