1. The Cabinet were informed of the business to be taken in theHouse of Commons in the following week.They agreed that, in the debate on raw materials on 1st May, theGovernment spokesmen should be the President of the Board ofTrade and the Minister of Supply; and they invited the HomeSecretary to discuss with those Ministers which of the two should speak first.The Cabinet agreed that, during the debate on the Second reading of the Reserve and Auxiliary Forces (Protection of Civil Interests)Bill on 3rd May, a Law Officer should be in attendance, as legal points were likely to be raised.2. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by theMinister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scotland(CP. (51) 116), asking that special efforts should be made to securethat the National Health Service Bill would be passed into law beforethe Whitsun recess.The Minister of Health said that it had originally been con-templated that the charges for dentures and spectacles would become operative on 13th April, and it was on this basis that the revenue from the charges had been estimated at  12-5 millions in the first year. As soon as the Government had announced their intention toimpose the charges, people had hastened to order spectacles anddentures while they still remained free. In the last few days applica-tions for dentures had doubled and the demand for spectacles had risen by 25 per cent. The longer that the passage of the Bill was delayed the greater would be the loss of revenue. Those whocriticised the charges had claimed that the amount actually receivedwould not be sufficient to justify what they had regarded as a retro-grade step. It was, therefore, most important that the further stages of the Bill in the Commons should be expedited, and that the Houseof Lords should pass the Bill before Whitsun. In the Committee stage of the Bill in the House of Commons there would be some difficultyover two amendments which had been put down by back-benchmembers of the Opposition. One would transfer from the national assistance Board to the Health Service the responsibility for deciding whether a patient should be excused from paying a charge, and theother would make it impossible to increase without fresh legislation the charges specified in the Schedule to the Bill.The Cabinet agreed that in the circumstances described everyeffort must be made to pass the Bill into law before the whitsun recess.As regards the amendments the following points were made:  (a) There was no substance in the proposal that the health service, rather than the National Assistance Board, should handleclaims for exemption from these charges. The officers of the national assistance Board were accustomed to handling this type of claim, andhad been made responsible for similar work in the administration ofthe scheme for legal aid and advice. This amendment should be resisted. It might be useful if a Minister with knowledge of the work-ing of the National Assistance Board were to intervene in the debateat some stage to stress the suitability of the Board for this type ofwork.(b) More difficult issues were raised by the other amendment,which would enable charges to be reduced, but not increased, byOrder-in-Council. The intention had been that the patient should bear half of the cost of dentures or spectacles; and it ought to bepossible to vary the charge to the^ patient with variations in the costof the appliances. There was a sufficient Parliamentary safeguard inthe requirement that the provisions of any Order-in-Council shouldbe approved by affirmative resolution of both Houses. Nevertheless,-2     - B 2
there would undoubtedly be widespread sympathy among Govern-ment supporters for the view that charges should not be increasedwithout the authority of a further Act of Parliament. The Chancellorof the Exchequer should therefore consider, with the Health Ministers,Whether some concession could not be made on this point. It wouldbe undesirable to accept the amendment tabled by members of theOpposition; and, if a concession were to be made, some Governmentsupporter who had spoken in favour of the Bill should be given anopportunity to move an amendment in a form acceptable to theGovernment.The Cabinet (1) Agreed that every effort should be made to secure that theNational Health Service Bill was passed into law before the whitsun recess.(2) Agreed that the Government should resist amendments to theBill designed to remove cases of hardship from theprovince of the National Assistance Board, and thatGovernment supporters should be made aware of the argu-ments against these amendments.(3) Invited the Chancellor of the Exchequer, in consultation withthe Minister of Health and the Secretary of State for Scot-land, to consider whether the Bill could be so amended&apos;that the charges specified in the Schedule could not beincreased without fresh legislation; and agreed that, if theMinisters concerned found themselves unable to offer con-cessions on this point which were likely to satisfyGovernment supporters, the Cabinet should consider theposition again at their next meeting.Germany.Soviet Proposalfor a Meeting of foreign ministers.(previous reference:CM. (51) 29thConclusions,Minute 9.)3. The Cabinet had before them a memorandum by the foreign secretary (CP. (51) 115) on the preliminary discussions which werebeing held in Paris with a view to framing an agenda for a meetingof the Council of Foreign Ministers.The Foreign Secretary said that the representatives of the three western Powers had not yet agreed on the tactics which they should follow in order to bring the discussions to a head, as contemplated in paragraph 12 of CP. (51) 115. The United Kingdom representative had argued in favour of offering all the less important concessionstogether, so as to make it clear to world opinion that the only thingwhich prevented agreement was the Soviet insistence on so wordingthe armaments item of the agenda as to commit the Western Powersto revise their policy of strengthening their defences. Among the concessions thus envisaged would be the placing of German de militaires-tarisation as the first sub-item under Item 1 of the agenda; and theUnited States and French representatives had both shown a strongpreference for keeping this concession in reserve. The United states representative evidently feared that, if all these concessions were offered at once and the Soviet representative then pressed for some concession on the armaments question, the United Kingdom Govern-ment would urge that a further concession should be made on that point. In order to allay this anxiety, the United Kingdom repre-sentative had now made it clear to the United States representativethat he would continue to insist that in this item of the agenda the reference to the level of armaments must precede any reference tothe reduction of armaments, and that he would not press his Westerncolleagues to agree to any further change of wording to meet theSoviet view on this point. It was hoped that, as a result of this assurance, the United&quot; States and French representatives would nowbe more willing to make a further effort to secure an agreed agendaby means of the bargain outlined in paragraphs 10 and 11 of cp. (51) 115.   If this failed, we might still try to persuade the Soviet
representative to accept a written proviso (possibly in the finalcommunique) to the effect that the formulation of the agenda wouldnot commit any of the four Powers on the substance of the questions to be discussed. Another possibility was. that the Soviet representa-tive might be persuaded to accept our view that at the ministerial meeting the first item (on the causes of international tension) wouldbe taken as a whole.In discussion the following points were made:  (a) The fine points of distinction which were being made in the paris discussions were not fully appreciated by public opinion in thiscountry. As a result, there was a real risk that, if no agreement could be reached on an agenda, public opinion would believe the breakdown to be due merely to disagreement over forms of procedure.The Foreign Secretary undertook to consider what further steps couldbe taken to bring home to public opinion the true nature of the differences which had emerged in the discussion of an agenda. Inparticular, he would take special care to ensure that, if the discussionsbroke down, the failure would not appear to be due to any intransi-gence on the part of the United Kingdom Government.(b) It was suggested that there would be special difficulty inexplaining why we had thought it necessary to reject the Sovietformula about disarmament. The Foreign Secretary said that, in his view, it was reasonable to decline to enter into discussions on disarmament without regard to the existing level of armaments. Itmight well be that, in order to reach something like parity, therewould have to be a substantial reduction in the armaments of theSoviet Union and her satellites and an increase in the armaments ofthe Western democracies. That being so, it was surely unwise to offer to discuss this problem on a formula which wouid allow the SovietGovernment to put forward proposals for a percentage reduction allround, without reference to the relative strength of existingarmaments.Some Ministers felt that, even on the basis of the Soviet formula,it should be possible to discuss the existing level of armaments. Itwould be difficult to demonstrate, on the basis of the Soviet text alone,that the Russians were unwilling to discuss the relative strength ofexisting armaments.(c) Our own views should not be pressed to the point of riskingopen disagreement with the United States and French representatives.It would be disastrous if these discussions had the result of sowingdissension between the Western Powers without securing any better understanding with the Soviet Union. It was also to be borne inmind that, if differences arose between ourselves and the UnitedStates, the French were more likely to side with the United Statesthan with us; and we should be careful to avoid presenting themwith opportunities to do so.(d) Was it possible to judge whether the Soviet Governmentreally wished to reach some understanding at a Ministerial meeting?The Foreign Secretary said that, while at the outset of the discussionsthere was some reason to believe that they did, this now seemedrather less likely.(e) Public opinion would be seriously disturbed if these discussions broke down and all hope of a Ministerial meeting hadto be abandoned. It was suggested&quot; that, if there had to be a break with the Russians, it might be better that this should come after therehad been some discussion of the merits of the questions at issue, andnot at a meeting confined solely to questions of procedure. In the last resort, therefore, it would be preferable to face&quot; a Ministerial meetingon the basis of a split agenda rather than abandon at once all hopeof holding a Ministerial meeting.(/) The suggestion was also made that, if agreement could notbe reached in the present discussions, Ministers might themselvesattempt to secure agreement on an agenda.   The Foreign Secretary
said that he would be most reluctant to agree that the Council ofForeign Ministers should meet without having an agenda agreed inadvance.The Cabinet Took note of the Foreign Secretary&apos;s memorandum(CP. (51) 105) and of the points raised in the discussion.economic affairs.(previous reference:CM. (51) 15thConclusions,Minute 2.)Man-power.Production.Coal.Steel.Stocks.InternalFinance.4. The Cabinet had before them a note by the Chancellor of theExchequer (CP. (51) 113) covering a report on the developments inthe economic situation during the first two months of 1951.In a general discussion of the report the following points weremade:  The fall in unemployment had continued, and the figures forthe development areas, in particular, showed a considerable improve-ment. There was evidence already of some transfer, of labour fromdistribution and into the engineering and other defence industries.Although there had been some short-time working in the motor carindustry and some others, there was no reason to suppose that under-employment, as a consequence of raw material shortages, was wide-spread. It was suggested that the next report in this series should include a fuller study of the extent and distribution of under-employment.The rate of increase in production during the first two months ofthe year, compared with the corresponding period of last year, wasabout 5 per cent. The forecast given in the Economic Survey of a4 per cent, increase for the whole of 1951 might still be realised, butindustry would have to meet serious obstacles later in the year andthe 4 per cent, target set a difficult task for industry.There had been a striking improvement in the coal situation.The extent to which exports of coal could now be increased would need careful consideration. On the one hand, these exports were ofgreat value in securing imports of raw materials which were urgently needed: on the other hand, account must be taken of the recentsharp increase in domestic consumption (mainly for industry) and theneed to build up adequate stocks for next winter.The low stocks of steel-making materials were a grave threat to production and to the whole economy. The deficiency in iron-oreimports due to the recent shortage of shipping could not be entirelymade good during the year and there was little prospect of obtainingsufficient quantities of scrap. Some Ministers felt that the domesticdrive to obtain more scrap might be pursued more actively, and that further pressure might be applied to local authorities to co-operate inmaking disused tramway-tracks available for scrap. It was clearthat allocation of steel supplies to industry would be unavoidable, anda scheme was now being prepared for consideration by the production committee.The level of most of the important stocks had continued to decline. The critical position on sulphur would be eased by theallocation now approved by the ^United States Government(95,000 tons for the second quarter of the year), but supplies would still be far from adequate.There were some disquieting indications of an inflationarysituation, and it was clear that the measures announced in the Budgethad been fully justified. There had been an increase in March in theprices of our exports, and steps were being taken to encourage afurther increase, but import prices were rising more rapidly. Stocksheld by retailers were decreasing and, if this continued, a furthersource of inflationary pressure would develop.
Exports. Exports were not increasing as much as had been hoped, thoughshipping difficulties might to some extent have been responsible forthis. In order to maintain the desired equilibrium in our balance ofpayments, a renewed export drive was indispensable.Balance of The increase in our gold and dollar reserves was tapering off.Payments. We were likely to maintain a substantial surplus in trade with western europe and a deficit with the dollar area and the Commonwealth.The Cabinet Took note of CP. (51) 113 and of the points made in discussion.Cabinet Office, SWA,26th April, 1951.
